Rouge under the lights would it's changing helmet color which is awesome between Roche\nWe've got Washington state taken on the ... ... ... ... okay and the other rank ran for office ranked we've got baseball go with the baseball game and then we also\nWhich three do you think I should go with definitely\nUCF [laughter] what'd you knew this has got to have it ah okay I say on one screen definitely have UCF uh-huh or the other screen\nSo you don't need to do baseball right now you're not you're yeah you can pick baseball up in the fifth\nInning and be fine you'll be good writer you get three innings of you know solid baseball deciding factor game seven you'd be good so you don't want to miss out on on quick action with you know college football\nTo to watch a whole baseball game so ... which one of the devices over to a\nBaseball but that are LSU a Mississippi State game and then you might as well just throw a\nUniversity of South Florida and and and you kind of near to my world [laughter]\nSo yeah it's all about the American athletic how about that how about South Florida goodness they were favored by thirty four I think you're losing seven nothing out of the game did on guard at\nU. Conn is the corrupted you know and they are leading right now which is you know bounding one Alabama plays south east university\nTexas Tech a wing a mammoth a enlightenment college that at some point they may be a three or seven to nothing [laughter]\nAnd then and then you turn the game on in the fourth quarter and it's a hundred and nine\nTwo seven [laughter] but it is we're talking about six minutes to go in the second quarter you were almost we're nearing half time here in Yukon\nYukon is brutal man they have the worst defense by far all hell enjoyed world I think they've given up I think I saw the stat going into today they've given up a hundred and twelve\nThey've given up a hundred and twelve thousand yard [laughter] go far\nEnough in the it seems like that banned in South Florida rough flatten so far getting shot out by the huskies and they're at their home place it's at South Florida\nYeah to pick it up you know these are top elite schools get it done\nI'll tell you what man we don't want to do um I don't want to beat up on UCF again for a second straight week you know so I'm going to keep it at a minimum but I'll say this\nFrom UCF perspective you've got to have somebody from your conference do something to help boost up your credentials right yeah you need to have South Florida show up here to have the other ranked teams and your conference sharing with Matty what's lost today that's right uh so you need UCF\nTo hold up their end of the bargain for you guys can fight it out two undefeated teams and then you go from there you know what I mean\nMhm somebody yeah move\nYeah but you root for your opponent me as a Notre Dame fan he from I was rooting for Michigan today or were you\nAbsolutely clear that helps Notre Dame ... argument right their resume out so absolutely I was if it benefits Notre Dame ... root for Michigan even though I hate their guts you know [laughter] but if that's the way you got to be in college football and I'll tell you what\nIt's a big win for Michigan they go up there to East Lansing and they smack around Michigan State Michigan State so we're seeing this year there are times where they look horrible which they did today\nBut then last week they took down Penn State on the road so it's a weird team I don't want to blow it out of proportion but it's the first time since two thousand six Michigan beat a ranked team on the road so it was a long haul before they've beaten ranked team\nThat last one of your TV go to a Fox Sports ... details\nHe's the firm ... you're on Fox Sports radio were coming to you from the guy go studios [noise]\nYou know what I'm not going to fall for it you from\nI was just talking to poppa bear\nAnd he was like hey so why is the Notre Dame scared to play UCF you know [laughter]\nI'm like oh what a variety of you here almost ... almost ... almost got me you are there for a split second he was like what are they talking about [laughter] we'd play or do you want I didn't want to [laughter]\nI'm not falling for it I'm not I did a mile away you know I'm going to be stronger and\nLook at this or do a Ohio State\nThat's right man I'm people often yeah song for the outright upset tonight huh see it but I'll tell you what are you from Ohio State they're vulnerable they're not playing great defense there one dimensional Dwayne Haskins is phenomenal but that running game is not very good\nSo I'd be surprised if they lost I wouldn't be stunned but I don't think that they're going to go through the regular season without a loss I just don't see it from this team\nRight well we'll see\nHow about when a deliberately Christine and I went to the sea hawks game oh weeks ago uh yeah we were going to the Space Needle and it was going to take a couple of hours for us to get up there mhm and so we went to a restaurant across the street\nAnd it's just swimming with Ohio State fans I'm like what in the world and I looked over there is a flag that said Seattle buckeyes\n[laughter] usually the most random stuff is already do stuff like do you ever see that with\nBasketball baseball anything in this country\nNot as much as football like not as much we have a bar out here\nA jalapeno Pete's it's called I think\nOver to her and if you go by their own\nThe hang out I was like ruined ...\nThey'll have like Steeler bars in Chicago right he doesn't ... it it it really is\nBut that's fandom no right that's fanatics though there you know I have before\nThe season the proclamation of winning the national\nChampion I have the championship trophy and Notre Dame at Thirteen and old tattooed on my back\n[laughter] and we haven't even started the season yet [laughter] right like\nThat's what we're dealing with dinner that don't you\nOh I don't have a personal ... home run solo homerun who who is it ...\n... ... for ... which yell at each\nFormer a former Marlin going yard how about the\nMarlins just having a fire sale like this guy is good you want them [laughter] this is not the first time they've done that how big are you on the Dodgers D from you than\nI was a fan or are in the eighties I was around when a\n... a ... was on my own and they won the world series so but I've never been really a baseball guy my family my wife's family are angel fans\nLike we have the tattoo of the angels I'm like okay uh\nDo you guys know anyone who plays with the angels or there's some type of family connection and they're just like no we love the angels and then half of them love the angels the other half of the age so\nMy wife comes from a baseball family I'm just\nLike a I like I like\nThe world I mean I like the playoff games I'm really into the playoff games all about the world series for sure\nThe bears birthday for a second straight year\nI'm not going to fall furry little trapped there find on Iraq and fall for it [laughter] have you tried to trigger him up to adolescent boys going back and forth at each other both of you go to the brands of all the goals that he didn't leave rabbit\n... [laughter] oh Shaq Hennessy is\nI'm I'll tell you this though college football today from\nIt's not that I made this ... discovery today but I have known about Trevor Lawrence the Clemson quarterbacking\nBut you watch this guy play this dude has an absolute cannon for an arm and it's an accurate can and\nBecause this guy every time he throws the ball that ball is coming out just like a bullet and he is accurate the sideline throws you only see that in the NFL those deep out where you can throw it off the hash mark very ... to do\nMan he can do that with ease he has like canon over there for Clemson ... yes\nAnd I like to move you know I Love what\nBoth Nick Saban ... Sweeney of done\nI I look at Nick's saving that took some ... and the national championship game that they were playing ... with virtually no experience does far and we're going to throw in the national championship game at halftime see what happens\nBut you know that the credit to him it's all about knowing your personnel right yeah they were behind they knew they had the push to boil down to feel\nAnd they knew they had to make the choice they knew that this kid can throw them I see him every day in practice run in scouting running to all of that so they knew they had to get the ball down the field and they currently couldn't do it um\nAnd they made the switch yeah and that's how you become legend Bill Bill ...\nOr an image of we're going to win over I'll figure it out and you look up in the game's over\nYeah and I'll tell you you bring up village jak we make it look like well you have Tom Brady and do you realize\nMany other head coaches same scenario they never would have gotten the production out of Tom Brady that ballot check has because you trace it all the way back to his second season he goes in there for an injured drew Bledsoe Bledsoe it's healthy for the super bowl that season\nAnd ... now we're going with the second year guy who was our sixth round draft pick you realize how many had coaches wouldn't have made that move\nOh yeah there are tons I mean because you go\nWith what you know right you go with the veteran guy you go with the guy who just give a hundred million dollars by the way a and you know you as soon as he's hoping he's back in there he would just like you know the kid has something we're going to ride this all the way out and see where it takes is and it took drew Bledsoe getting traded\nYeah and also at the same thing with Diablo Sweeney\nYou look at Kelly Bryant he played pretty well\nPretty good quarterback for Clemson they were a playoff team last season and he said you know what I think we're better team with Trevor Lawrence and he made the move and Kelly Brian transferred and all that but dabbled Sweeney he said this is what I think is best for our football team\nAnd I love head coaches that will trust their gut trust what they see and in spite of knowing that they're going to get absolutely blasted publicly if this bold moves doesn't work out they still make that move I Love when coaches do stuff\nLike that if like the old John ruined thing right [laughter] but sometimes it doesn't quite work out [laughter] and we're going to get rid of the best player on the team and go [laughter] to shake things up here we're going to get rid of split on the team and we're going to ride this thing\nGood good pass rush [laughter] it's I I read a workout granted yeah it doesn't work out swimmingly every time but I Do love when those coaches know they're going to get criticized but still willingly sign up for it to do what they think is right\nYet at the end of the exciting because now you're not\nNow you're ... years these in the opportunity in in your winning right we saw you know a similar thing was I Believe a couple of years ago when um jak do real with the the head coach of the raiders\nAnd became the gate and made some\nGood to be called against the saints to win the game and not go right high and the ... the the moniker of the team that year and they're propelled them to a tremendous record a until\nBy car got hurt broke his leg right but\nHaving the type of coach that believes in you as a player\nAnd is willing to go for the fourth in short or go for two and not to tie those type of thing they resonate with players because players are always in the mindset let's go for the win mhm right players always want to go for the win\nNot the tie\nAnd when you have a coach that can line up with you with that and make these type of decisions and make these type of adjustments on the fly in and the heat of the moment guys respect that in college and in the pros\nHe cares about someone who put\n... can you say that statement I have read a lot of pressure diction I have a lot of respect for him as a player uh-huh put you just can't\nReally bad respect a fair play over way or the like the boys like that [laughter] yeah I think what he's saying is I Love him as a player I just hate the antics which makes sense teaches in say we'd like you don't\nWrite I I don't get it I'm Sorry um yeah it sounded like you're saying two completely different things that you say that\nIt's too much when you get to professional sports it's too much talent\nTo be dirty right like you don't need it mhm\nI mean you're already among excellence so any of the extra stuff but the Albert Haynes worth\nThe atomic ... all I mean it's not your bloody bike I oh man\nI Can't respect it\nBecause it's already hard enough to get to\nThat level and to maintain at that level and I have a guy who needs\nTo our has a desire to hurt injure or you know do something out of the realm of the actual\nSport it it is Bush league it is known yeah for it right and I think you're supposed to be passed that level once you get ... professional sports\nI think there's a difference between\nDoing something that's dirty that could cause injury\nAnd something that kind of Bush league you know I look at him like Saint Denis Rodman [laughter] he used to like grabbing opponents but and try to throw 'em off their game they're like that's not going to injure someone but if you do somebody that's not a dirt actually light among the game right like that 'cause I had my I think that Bush got older I get dirty yeah\nSo I'm okay with Bush league stuff but the dirty stuff that can injure people I'm with you I got no love for that\nYeah is just you know I I mean I don't I Can't respect me that falls right into the category of of\nPd use for me you know what I mean like if\nYou needed this to be this\nAnd what what's the point I mean what makes you different what makes you special and I think if you reach the level of a professional in any sport\nTo that rarified air\nAnd you did it by\nPerformance enhancing drugs or whatever that is I to me that I Can't respect it\nBecause of all the guys who work extremely hard to get there myself included without any of that\nMhm that's special to me now you may not be a hall of famer or all ... all war all but to be a professional athlete and have a successful career you get all the respect in the world for me because I Know how difficult that is especially when you do it the right way\nYeah man I hear ya I think that um\n[noise] maybe trash talking\nMore we could to music and make the point where we're quickly\nTrash talking I'm totally fine with that I don't think that's dirty [noise]\nYou know that's just trying to get inside someone's mind right as long as you are trying to get inside the mind of an opponent by doing something dirty then you're putting them in their eyes yeah you're right they put them in a position to be injured [noise]\nThem okay with that but we'll Machado did it could have led to an injury that is dirty\nThe Geico studios tennis [noise]\nFigured it out it's time for football to figure it out as well I'm Brian no easy from Salem

Do Justin Herbert\n... they started quarterback for Oregon and he is getting dominated right now Justin Herbert he is one first six for seven yards\nJust before half time he has done absolutely nothing meanwhile Gardner men Jew he's the quarterback at Washington state you see is that do completed thirty one of thirty six passage in one hassles football for two hundred and thirty one yard in three touchdowns he's\nOn his way you know you're not bad you look at the ... conference in ... you're going to they'll never have anybody in the playoffs because they're going to eat each other alive\nBecause this is what it is when you have you know think of all the teams all the rink teams in the ... and all the five in one form one team they're going to literally eat themselves mhm\nAlive and not have a representative and the college playoff\nBut that's not happening this year no you're right about that yeah yeah they're going to go out with your each year ...\nWe're not cannibalizing each other\nBut you're right that's what's happening in the pack twelve this year Washington high expectations couple of losses they're done Oregon even if they somehow found a way to come back and this ball game they're non conference schedule is just it's like UCF ask really is what it is you know [laughter]\nIn terms of a paper thin schedule it's horrible what Oregon is doing I don't see how they come back and win this game on the road anyway but even if they did then I got a legitimate candidate to be in the playoffs yeah packed twelve is out and they're not going to be there no yeah\nBut how about this Justin Herbert he could be the number one overall pick\nIn next year's NFL Draft that with them are saying yeah there are a lot of people very very high on him and as it stands right now three for eight for thirty two yards he had a wide open receiver earlier in the game just ran a goal route right down the sideline\nAnd he air mailed it out of bounds that's like do these are the throws you gotta make legitimate number one overall pick he's got the talent it just the execution had been there remember\nWhat I said about the motion of a young student athlete at any moment something could be going on and I'm not saying that's what ... is right but I'm also not saying that's what this is it\nYou know [laughter]\nSo you're saying the word I'm saying words saying

losing streak yeah they won like\nFifty one to fourteen or something crazy like that you can't be the team that won ends a losing streak and to get both raised in the process can happen you know\nNow that uh that does nothing for morale I can tell you about and we will do and I get your coach fight so yeah there\nIt might do that as well I'm Brian no easy from saloncom where ... live from the guy

lovely Christina Jew go yes we were there that's why we lost the bachelor and the air [laughter] that's a drawback 'cause we're here in Portland I'm a terrible and for the blazers of course you were\nThere was a positive vibe that oh the blame or whatever um\nPortland when I I had called playwright Baker barely went in Portland it's something about the north west Utah Portland that I [laughter] the Lakers just have fit\nGoing up there and women and men in Portland to come to LA and get beat by thirty you know just something about being up there you know I think they put something in the coffee that just got to look into that\nTo sixteen game losing streak yeah for the Lakers against the blazers which is just crazy because we know the Lakers and this isn't to put you in a foul mood the band I'm good I'm good we know the Lakers have been hot trash for the last five seasons garbage\nTerrible but just one off night now you know the blazers commit a bunch of turnovers they can't buy a basket someone from the Lakers ... goes off and has an amazing game nothing for the last sixteen games in raising\nWe didn't have anybody with that type of pedigree and as long as ...\n... [noise] I mean this kid is on I knew he had it his rookie year when the Lakers went up and play and carbon Kobe like maybe forty five forty eight point\nAnd he was right there with him I think yes thirty eight and that game and I was like who is this kid what what is going on oh he ... the business and on top of that\nI don't know if you're a rap fan have you heard Damon ... Rao he's good good good rice is probably where and when we come back from the break give us Damien ...\nThere was just a fact that we're white family or a unlike\nOn my God oh listen to you oh my God what you know I was I was I watched that game and I was pleased with what I saw out of the Lakers some things\nThree bar shooters [laughter] right right\nThey were old for their first fitting ... pointers\nJust because they're open doesn't mean you have the shooter but what they did do was a pound of them in the lane and I think that's where the discipline has to come in to where we're going to get the\nBest the rights shot instead of the wide open shot because the league has transformed into the if you open up the report online you have to shoot it right and I don't think that they need to fall into that category because they have a bunch of ball handlers who can get their own shots\nYeah and that's the thing man it's [laughter] I always say it in any sport but especially basketball and football\nYou got to have multiple ways to beat teams and you shouldn't show up like this is what we are and if it isn't working you just stick with it right if you look at the Lakers if you're old for Fifteen from three point range and you're having a lot of success in the paint\nYou ever want to understand the latest state or federal tax plan coming down from the government\nAttacks in the

tweets ... says Lakers will need about a month to gel as a unit opener in Portland was just the first step\nYeah they're going to need at least a month to gel I totally agree with that he from it's going to be a process with all those one year contracts brand new team but I don't think they're going to jail to the tune of doing anything really noteworthy this year\nWhat good into the playoffs for the Lakers in their current status noteworthy so let's not ... heap expectations on them but let's also not you know under fail the process\nWhen you be happy with as a Laker fan this year\nUm I Would love to see them play in the playoffs again I Know if they get to the playoffs then\nAnything can happen you know what I mean like so just been getting back to the play offs and being in a position to compete for a championship that's a that's a positive that's a win for them not making the playoffs doesn't do anything for me or any other Laker fan are them\nAs a franchise so you start in small you're like let's just get to the post season and I'm good there'd be a smile on your face\nYeah because they're now that's a ... like we were like we know you know regular free season as regular season there's postseason those three different seasons within one\nUm let's get to the third season and the housing shaver shape out see what changes they've made by the trade deadline that the the chemistry that they have as a team all of those things\nSure you know I'm I'm going to switch gears on you with week seven starting tomorrow while the bulk of week seven we already had the Thursday night game but there's no sense sense discussing that because the cardinals are high trash\n[laughter] they fired their offensive coordinator MIke McCoy but the bulk of week seven is tomorrow one of the more interesting games the patriots will turn things around in a big way\nThey're scoring just under forty points per game over the last three I've got a little three game winning streak four hundred and sixty two yards of total law fence each game in that span probably no Bronx tomorrow so on the road against the bears bears looking to rebound after getting disappointed\nI'm after being a disappointment against the dolphins who\nDo you see one in this game big men like the patriots here I Do a patriot\nThey may start slow and get warmed up but once things started going and peace and started to fall into place and guys start to learn their role than there very rarely you know retract\nThey just keep a thing moving and keep going and that's what made them so dominant the last Eighteen years\nYeah it is man and I want to see their off ants against that bears defense\nBecause ... ... what the ankle injury and we know how much he means that the fence\nAnd I would expect an angry bears defense after Brock Ozzie Wyler had the day it gets you last week come on man\nWhat is that right there would be such a bears performance right when you're ... hey it really would could really challenge for the oh they're losing against the ... and the dolphin never mind right yeah right yeah [laughter] goodness\nUp by the way the patriots this is an interesting that they have a twelve game winning streak against teams that have a better record than them [laughter]\nTied for a record that's pretty good winnings I retire mine that's drawn to quite strong that's impressive right [laughter]\nBy the way you from I've got a tweet here from Ryan Leaf I interviewed him the week and of course he went to Washington state and so I was asking him cause I interviewed drew Bledsoe

instance the from that was in a car accident in January a just a slightly broken stern them like heroin slightly just haven't been able to work out a time you know I'm not going to go to the beach\nHe'll mobile with the top one of the six point seven mobile apps visit top one of the six points dot com for details\n\n\n\n[noise]\n... well you know so we\nMe to talk for\nA ball boy ball for the call yeah all the action from college [laughter]\nIn reviewing your belt someday [laughter]\nHere's Arnie Spanier in Erin ... [noise]\nAll right everybody are serving as we're coming he'll live from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios did you guys do that Fifteen minutes good said you Fifteen Percent or more in car insurance [noise] what do you got to do with the guy could I come for free [noise] great quote ease Aaron ...\nAnd you're dying Aaron what a great night for sports talk radio is there enough going on right now or what yeah I got to say\nThis San jose state San Diego's a game is really it's\nGripping stuff right ... hers is first quarter six to nothing Spartans with delete\nUnbelievable night of course I Know you're watching that but I got my eyes on the Dodgers brewers right now Dodgers up five to one as they now go to the top of the night yes yep week\nWith the three runs slave and that was that the uh so far a little bit of the difference there was two one when he hit the three run Homer five one and that one and the big game going on right now Purdue thirty five Thirteen\nOver Ohio State still five minutes left I sent to the show sheet of what I wanted to talk about an hour ago and if you notice on your text it says Ohio State loses I told you an hour ago they were going to lose this\nTwo weeks ago or three weeks ago when they were at Penn State did not work out for you or Penn State's fans I think this time we're good\nAll right well of course we're good thirty five Thirteen ah Purdue is leading right now this game was actually seven in the three late in the first half went Ohio State was looked like they were going to go in for a touchdown they didn't get in\nBecause of the receiver dropped it on third in goal I Believe they wind up for a field goal they miss Purdue comes down gets delayed touchdown fourteen three it was all downhill after this this last may drop them quite a distance because\nThey're getting manhandled not that produces like all horrible team but there are five hundred team or this last may cost ... Ohio State of chance at that four team playoff\nYeah it's well it's certainly not good they are certainly going to fall as you said Ernie and now this is what's great about college football this time of year the playoff picture starting to take shape\nMichigan wins again which will get into but if Ohio State can't hold on it could make that Ohio State Michigan game basically a de facto playoff to get into the Big Ten championship and then potentially for a playoff\nBerth right first of all before we even go flying into it we want you to go ahead and give us a text\nOr tweet us excuse me early and often all through the show you could reach him Aaron underscore tour as I'm at stinking genius one we should\nGet them tonight like it's a slot machine like I'll give it away hundred dollar bills because so much going on but Ohio State how far do you think they're going to drop from this and do you think this loss is going to keep them from getting back up into the into the top for it I Know that's hard to tell them now but I I guess what I'm asking is how bad of a law says this\nWell it's bad but look there are a lot of one loss teams as we get closer and closer to the end of the regular season here I mean they are officially asked\nTeams the big twelve doesn't have any undefeated team so you'd think they'll fall into that group with Michigan with Georgia with Ohio or not Ohio State excuse me with Oklahoma\nThe schools punched up the great thing is we still have a lot of games to be played in the big twelve the west Virginians are going to play the Texas and Oklahoma as and as I just mentioned in the Big Ten that Ohio State Michigan game could be huge now Michigan has a by next week right but they play Penn State\nAnd if they get by Penn State it's hard to see any scenario where they don't enter that game with just one loss and we'll see what happens with Ohio State\nWhat went wrong in this Purdue game um look I Know Purdue had a a field day on the ground against them but also a passing they had over three hundred yards passing Haskins\nI I don't think the game plan was to throw the ball sixty two times which is what he's put up right now but uh mistakes have done the guys in at least what I've seen so far or this game of flipping around all the channels there\nWell I I think you and I were a little bit ahead of this because if you remember last week Ohio State they right yeah they beat Minnesota but it wasn't pretty they were kind of honestly dominated at the line of scrimmage by Minnesota and it was an ugly it was about fourteen point wind but it was it was I remember\nCorrectly it was a one point or he would just be a one possession game going into the fourth quarter if I remember correctly\nExactly and by the way we saw a Minnesota did today losing to Nebraska giving them their first law so it's not as though are giving them their first winning season so it's not as though Minnesota was this red hot team but you saw it and so to bring it back to weigh in asking I think this Ohio State problem stems from the fact that they can't run the ball\nFifty three yards on twenty two carries a Arnie your Arizona degree my you kind of agree I math was never my strong suit I don't\nOther than president result maybe el issue gets into that ... for the Georgia will be okay obviously Michigan with their victory Twenty one seven\nThey'll stay up or maybe move up the spot a I think Texas will stay you know what it's either going to be Texas or Ohio State I think Ohio State stays ahead of Texas I think that's fair\nYeah well what I think it's interesting too is if you start to look at Ohio state's resume it's not as impressive as it looked three four weeks ago you know we we spend a lot of time last couple of weeks talking about how that Michigan lost to Notre Dame actually looks better because of the way Notre Dame ... plan\nBut you look at Ohio State they beat a TCU team that's absolutely terrible you know they beat a Penn State team that last last week to Michigan State right so so Ohio State doesn't have a lot to cling onto right now now let's be honest they they run the table they win the Big Ten they're going to be in that that final four\nBut right now they got to get back on track because they don't look anything close to one of those top teams that can compete ah once they get to that that playoff\nWrites this final just in Washington state over Oregon thirty four twenty a lot of people were calling for this upset the cougars at home Oregon coming off and emotional when last week a good victory by the cougars and this one thirty four twenty ...\nWith Washington's when a sets up a good game at the end of the year for those two huh\nYeah in theory I mean I think I think it's just more bad news though in the bigger picture for your pack twelve Arnie because\nI mean we're down to now with Colorado losing today we're down to one team\nWith less than two losses and that Washington state right now and I don't think anybody thinks that Washington state is going to run the table considering that they still have Stafford on the schedule they still Washington schedule they still have your Arizona Wildcats Otto yeah ... don't forget that how 'bout that maybe the walk cats playing sports\nAnd tonight we got his heart of a view that I keep an eye on him flipping around the channels like crazy while we do this show now before we get into the Michigan Michigan State game so many different things to get into in this one or two before the game even started\nUm a shenanigans I guess is the word I'm looking for a before the game did you see the Michigan player or going out to midfield stopping on the logo or and then after the game\nUm coach ... just really going up the coach that Tony saying you know taking shots at him saying he was five yards away yesterday like stuff like that boy there's a lot of bad blood right there\nYeah so for people to see the video it's already in my line here I don't really remember ever seen that before is that um\nBasically the entire ah the entire Michigan State\nTeam held arms held hands and walked across the length of the field yeah while Michigan was warming up by the way it did you see the Michigan a recruiting director did you see what he said after the game on Twitter was a little\n\n\n\nGo mobile illiteracy elaborated I Wonder if it's going to have your own brain Taylor or\n[noise]\nYou know when you buy for college you're in a green\nCard Morse right\nThere on the job of gymnastics team what all day long\nStay at seven thirty five now [noise]\nHi this is so both my biggest scores in odds for three winters daily go to Vegas covers dot com that Vegas covers dot com [noise]\nHe's Aaron tourism already Spanier great Saturday Night Dodgers trying to finish this thing off five to one now as they go to the bottom of the night will keep you updated\nAs soon as that one becomes a final Purdue scores that God oh my goodness up forty nine twenty now a over Ohio State uh this is the difference between Ohio State staying in the tub seven or eight and the falling out of the top ten they're getting a feeding and this one Aaron\nYeah it's a it's a ... it's crazy because now the second straight year\nThat Ohio State has just gotten him ... on the road\nLast year it was at Iowa and frankly that was the last probably kept him out of college football playoff if you remember um it came down to Alabama the non SEC champ versus Ohio State and every one pointed to that one really really ugly loss\nAs to why they got left out and it looks like they are going to have another embarrassing loss see how it affects them going forward\nUm look I Know we're a college football show and of course we'll preview week seven of the NFL just a quick left turn because I'm trying to follow everything we're trying to see what's going on with the Lakers as I told your\n... uh uh LA debut a Dodgers up five to one over the brewers winter\nGoes to the world series it take on the Boston Red Sox reason I bring that up\nIs quite and curse shot in the game um are you getting too cute I I Know the Jetsons just pitch a you know\nThe game or what Dave Roberts I Swear man and I'm not like I'm not like a big you know bash the manager bash the coach guy right I Am so on board with you already ... ...\nWhat are you doing [laughter] I'm what I mean first of all if you really feel the need to bring including her show why don't you bring them in in the eighth to set up the closer to close the game\nOr I mean I Know this is crazy couple of things one let the closer pitch to innings he's done it before we saw it throughout the playoffs last year we've seen it at times in the playoffs this year or let him start the ninth and if it doesn't go well then you bring in ... they've Roberts man I Swear like like this guy\nI I just don't get what he's doing\nI I mean let me go to them because maybe we're missing something or ... well\nI I'm I'm In complete agreement with you guys when I saw that the score one to five to one I was like the mission for David Roberts should not be to bring Clinton ... in it because that was what 'cause let's not forget\nAnd I know this game is over but yeah for run lead with the way the brewers have been hitting the baseball the night they haven't scored a run since the first inning\nThere's no reason to bring him and you've got a game one in Boston on Tuesday night yeah well you gotta you gotta think about that like I Know you're trying to win a game but Alex would can't get you three out I I Know it's ... and include encouraged\nAre just workout Hastings Aguilar but yeah that's fine but you couldn't go with Jansen another you know you could've you could've easily gone two innings when it was ... days arrest and here's the other thing\nThough too is let's say God Forbid something happens including ... gets rocked now\nYou just use jantzen in aid you don't even have more valuable\nAnymore and it's like it's just you know what's going to work out for them obviously but I just well\nIt's going to work out well you don't want to solve the\nSo it's not going to pitch in game one or even game too I don't believe so uh I wouldn't ... to ... because that was in the way they set it up this time around he was what the uh third started was he not or no well he ... he was he was the wine and like he would have ... it was the one only because of the rotation beforehand right\nExactly but at the same time you you you gotta know scenarios and I know is presumptive to think hey they're going to when they're going to win this game but still you got to be taken to the next series like totally ... and being it being on Tuesday he would've been lined up to start that game now he's not maybe ... pages in a game\nYou know what's interesting maybe they've Roberts wanted to do it on purpose to take that decision out and say well not recant pitch\nGame one we're going to moving back a little bit to save everybody face I don't know so now ... game one is that my understanding I'm not I'm not positive Richard ritual pitch ... last night too\nSo I I I don't know who would line up\nI I don't know who would who would pitch game on for the ... one for the red Sox its critics sales for sale who look game five off because he had a belly ring and ... and ...\nAnd that was one of them and then we'll ever see the last week I had a lesser than there come on we all we've all had a belly ring or who and I still have one yeah I still have one do you still got their nose ring to\nYeah absolutely very good nothing wrong\nWith that I saw a couple of things while to get the Alabama well I looked they were winning at half time uh what was it a forty two fourteen and as Nick Saban is going to be a you know the locker room or some tendency fed those are I guess it's a couple of vice Adam\nI first of all did he think Tennessee was good to be where do you get half [laughter] that's my first question to court for the point is if I was tendency I'd be celebrating if I was a tendency fat because I didn't think they were going to be able to score that many\nIs escorted off the field by police yeah\nWhat are you doing yeah what do you\nKnow it was a it was a weird day and uh by the way it looks like the Dodgers have Dodgers women yeah they they have one they're going to the world series they have no pictures for game one so they are just going to um they might bring Fernando Valley way a lot of retirement here because Sandy Koufax is usually in the ...\nYeah I was gonna say Sandy Koufax a you know he's usually in these post game locker rooms he might have to throw a few in game one because uh\nBecause uh you know the or the day on average was up there Yeah David Roberts I I just I don't aren't to use the word cute and I don't mean to get off family here but\nI like what like why why I don't get it and as you said\nAren't like maybe they are doing it so they take it out of the decision of the pitch came number one I didn't think he was going to Penn State one anyway because\nUh they went with a Walker viewer to pitch the game one sixty three and then they went with somebody else to open up the serious so he was the third pitcher anyway for you so I was a third pitcher anyway down the line\nI guess I just think that you know and and by the way it's exactly what you just said is it's not game one sixty three it's not a the opening round this is the world series and you're going up against one of the best pitchers in baseball and Chris Sale I just I don't get it Arnie I really don't and even if you don't want him to start game one I mean it's it's one thing if it's if it's a\nFive to three game if it's seven six\nEurope right for and you have your closer in\nIf it was that close to the jets or whatever even come out of the game I think I Would just go with him into his arm fell off or until he got a little bit in trouble and that I was what happened by the way I just real quick back to college football David the tweets in Michigan State did nothing wrong or disrespectful horrible as the definition of classless why sore loser sore winner\nNever one says he displayed class\nSo it was it wasn't disrespectful to just while the other team is warming up to walk across the field arm in arm\nBut that was Michigan State that when I had that you know in her book rather disrespectful writer but Michigan but Michigan also was displaying a disrespect by stopping on the logo after the game that's completely disrespectful again an eye for an eye you push me around I got to push back me I was trying to warm up\nYeah um yeah Michigan State did they they obviously did something you know that that that's obviously wrong when you said they did nothing wrong you're\nYou're not looking at at at the right way real quick just getting back to Alabama I'm I'm not sure what that tendency fan wanted but it was all Alabama and this one I'm not sure why there's so much better I look at why they're better\nAll right a couple of the games come in with the forty one seven over NC State notice that were just ignoring quite em troubled Lawrence and not one twenty six I'm thirty nine over three hundred yards at a touchdown I'm Still not sure there was a third best team and now they're probably going to move up the number two unless somebody seems a jump up and I don't see that happening but\nI don't see them as the second best team in college football right now\nNo I mean this was their first went over ranked opponent all year now they did beat a ... or they did beat\nTexas a and M. who is now ranked but this is the first time they played a ranked team in one this season I mean look the schedule leaves a lot to be desired the fact remains and we talk about this every week already if they run the table they are going to be in the final four in the play off\nBut the competition just hasn't been there yet and so forgive me for not being all that excited this was the first ranked opponents they've played NC State by the way who they beat has not played any ranked opponents\nSo I just I Can't get too excited about clubs in right now if they if they run the table they go Thirteen and oh we'll have a different conversation but right now there's just there's there's reason to think of Notre Dame and some of these one last teams the Michigan's the Georgia's et cetera\nThan them because Ohio State gets upset because Michigan has a good victory over Michigan State nobody said about that was you who was a while after what happened last week there overlooking Mississippi State um they grind it out Mississippi State gets a field goal nothing after that uh\nIt was a typical LSU big three Nineteen three a job or oh nothing\nThat's going to move them up a notch you get them into that top for probably\nWell maybe except your boy Tom Ridge well tours already had them in the top four last yes you did I did I said look and it it comes back to what we were just saying that Clinton I said I Know unless you as a loss but if you look at what they've done it is more impressive total body work with ... than a than cleansing\nReal quick on LSU though yeah I actually give them a lot of credit on the Internet how you feel but they they're coming up this huge emotional when they got to buy they got bam of the whole road ahead of him I thought that it might be a little bit closer that they might be looking ahead credit to them for taking care of business against Mississippi State\nHe's Aaron underscore tourism

take on the Boston Red Sox ratings through the roof I imagined on this one unbelievable\nHow excited are you you are in the belly of the beast in Boston you're from LA the Dodgers you claim or your team when they're good [laughter] how do you feel about this one\nI'm going to be a great match up I I really believe that the Dodgers are in better shape starting pitching wise um maybe even bullpen wise um as for the lineup though\nGosh the way the red Sox what a hundred and eight games I Know a lot of became against Baltimore but there are wind up as hit and great at the bottom of the light of especially Jackie probably junior who won the MVP I don't know if the Dodgers what was going to hit as well as the red Sox lineup\nYeah the Dodgers were really weird because they were struggling so much they get that extra innings win and then they they they hit pretty well on the back end of the series it was funny because they have that that great late night when I think it was whatever Thirteen innings\nAnd the next day is a day games they don't take batting practice and that's when the bats came alive for him so I obviously not the depth of the line up that that the er the red Sox have but when you look at guys like Machado bleak cetera\nI mean they could put up put up around I I'm really curious to Ernie is just the experience of being there last year there were so close I Know it's a different team it gets a different opponent but you got to think they got a little some extra just\nThat I think I see that the red Sox the early favorites according to the super book um Red Sox for the series minus one thirty five Dodgers plus one Fifteen coming out about Fifteen minutes ago so a as expected\nOr the red Sox the early favorites in in that one and I like I said Chris cell will be the opening games are we the opening starter on Tuesday a because he didn't have to pitch game five\nTo go out and go that far so Red Sox will be the more rested team has no doubt about that era\nYeah and there are at home to to start series so Dodgers got to fly across country whatever every baseball guys are used to it at this point but I I still I Know they won I still don't like the way David Roberts juggle that bullpen tonight and not to get super nerdy bullpen guy but like\nI just don't like a lot of decisions that he's made over the course of the series we'll see if ... if it ever comes back to bite him it did last year late in that World Series against the Astros I'd be curious to see if it has an effect this year ...\nAll right we've got a lot of college football to get through by the way I'm before we started the show today I was thinking not a lot of great matchups I thought it was a horrible weekend in college football yes Ohio State gets upset um we have the Michigan when\nBut not a lot of sexy matchups that a lot of you know a final ... meters or ... um last second wins or anything like that I I was not impressed with this weekend's a games\nTotally agree with you and it was funny too because the one game and I think everybody was looking forward to in that early window Michigan Michigan State yeah\nWhether to lay and we're stuck with a lot of all Bernal missed and uh Arkansas Tulsa and I can't even remember who else was playing at that time slot but\nOklahoma TCU I Believe too yeah and that one like we said earlier kind of got a little bit out of control their early I'm with you but uh you know like luckily as it always does with college football the end of the day\nA proved to be worth it with this Ohio State game but yeah a little bit of a slow start today for sure\nOf course the big story Purdue wins it over Ohio State forty nine twenty yes you heard me right forty nine pretty puts up twenty eight points in the fourth quarter a this was a seven three gain weight in the first half\nOhio State driving they drop the third doubt touchdown pass in the end zone obviously a go for the fuel go on for that is miss and produce gets delayed touched out fourteen three and Ohio\nJust scratching your head about this Ohio State defense um we questioned them against Minnesota's you're brought up earlier\nBut Haskins forty nine Seventy three for Seventy two touchdowns not the game plan to fill the ball Seventy three times Ohio State school to drop how far I Would say about number suffered a number eight puppies they added Texas if a if you're asking me yeah\nI think the good thing is that we've learned through the years is that as long as Ohio State takes care of business from here on out there going to be just fine um that that would obviously include beating Michigan which is looking a like a very good team and would be a very good\nWhen that Penn State when is going to hold up they still have to play by the way Michigan State who has given them trouble historically\nBut if Iowa State wins there'll be wins out there'll be fine I think it's hard to look at that team what we saw tonight and say they will win out problems on defense problems in the running game this is a ... a team with holes even though that Jersey says Ohio State they got issues\nLet's get to Michigan Michigan State or before we get to the gate we mentioned this earlier to start the game off Michigan State walking arm in arm I guess when a little bit too far caused a ruckus shenanigans\nOr you know get into a little bit of a altercation I guess is the word I'm looking for oh with the Michigan players one Michigan player had the ear buds ripped out of his ear I guess the Michigan State or dead Tony ... is a according to Harbaugh was five yards away from the smiling enjoying the ... going on\nUm look it was a big thing is this just part of the whole Michigan Michigan State mystique rivalry that it goes as far or these coaches taking it too far\nLet me flip it on ... because I I look I thought the Michigan State thing was a little disrespectful it's one thing if you have a pre game routine tradition whatever but why what's the other team takes to feel for warm us I mean you have to respect the competition\nOf the guy getting his ear buds ripped off or anything like that so I've I've got to take first you know reports on that a chef swimming that's true right\nYeah no and I look all of this all that makes sense is like ... there was nothing malicious nobody got hurt like all that stuff but I just think it's one thing look you want to be a competitor you want to\nBully the opponent you want to show how tough you are in your own or feel now bowled ball and this and that I also just feel like there's common etiquette common decorum and you did mention earlier in the show Arnie is that after the game so Michigan players were stomping\nOn oh no no no not saw the whole team well good for them when the ... I maybe I didn't say it right it was the whole team I'm ... whatever you take traveling with your fifty sixty\nWhatever it is Seventy right there in the middle jumping up and down on top of sporty um and and you know obviously trying to take a dig at it\nYeah but the thing is again and and I hate to be like a little kid here who started it but I mean you know\nAs you started yeah like I mean at a certain point if a team disrespect you like that I don't know do you disagree I feel like you have the right to kind of hey we just kicked your but it's it was Twenty one seven the game was a lot more one sided in the final score it indicate\nI feel like good from Michigan they charge you know I I\nYou know you can do that when you're playing at home but the fact that you're on the road you got the victory\nJust pack up get the hell out of there and and move on I Know what your rivals at Michigan State but come on now you know just you know it's hostile you know you're going to cause a problem if you're at home and you want to play up to the home crowd and\nGo into the stands or you know do the Notre Dame singing afterwards knock yourself out but you're on the road let's get dressed and get the heck out of your you know I disagree stay and more what standard\nThat's overall one hundred and Seventy dollar value is called mounting a lot of glass today\nDidn't come by three six by nine seven two mountain ... cash back\n\n\n\n\n\nNo I\nHaven't dot com\n[noise] ... end up as well as well [noise]\nMid America about groundbreaking usa [noise]\nAll of your goals are rapidly right here\n[noise] horse racing but I\nCertainly don't want a horse for a long while you're on the other one of my family so\n... as you say\nThe seven thirty Easter non law in our case they\n\nGet rewarded with that shot from progressive it's simple sluggish snapshot and dry and burned discounts forces driving for progressive\nYou're right here on Fox Sports radio guys was go right up to the guy go Fox Sports celebrity ... joining us now you could think about it the big moves dot com that's the big moves dot com or you could read them in Greek underscore gambler that's we go to the score gambler Vegas runner how you do in Vegas runner\nNever better on e thanks for having me thanks for having me uh once again on the show Aaron and a busy day of course new college football and more importantly with the baseball game seven tonight a Dodgers coming through with that was a big win for the books\nUh they were getting pounded with one sided public money on Milwaukee a wise guys were on the Dodgers no surprise they had the Dodgers for the series and they didn't come back the hedge that that um they let it ride\nAs the Dodgers were the hot side for the sharks the night a lot more than enough public money on Milwaukee to uh make it a good result for the books and more importantly Dodgers boss thing you can't really get a better World Series\nA four book makers and four major league baseball so a lot got done today and tomorrow we got weeks seven event F. L.\nWell let's start with baseball or what's going to be you have any early wise I think that the red Sox are a slight favorite and this was when he was coming on something like this\nMinus one twenty five Boston ah you know being home that they'll they'll be probably around one twenty five one thirty what was the number that was slated if it was going to be this ... you know with Boston getting home field\nUh so I I think they're going to get good to a action Arnie believe it or not um I don't think they're going to get one sided action and you you didn't see anything immediately column in a one that line why knob so it's going to be interesting between now in game one on Tuesday to see if any of the best\nTeam but I don't know I I could see Dodgers money coming in specially out here on the west coast\nHow much action does the world series or an individual game or whatever get I mean we know football skiing in this country but but how how does baseball compare relative to other sports\n... it's not going to get that the the volume that football does no not no other sport does um\nBut with that said uh baseball in October is when it gets the most by a betting action the first month people are excited with the start of baseball on April but nothing like when October rolls around\nAnd when you get into the world series more times than not it's going to depend on the match up um you know our day Marquis teams uh with big fan bases or the small market teams and this year we got a\nTeams with huge huge fan bases major cities I saw I think this one's going to do extremely well again not your your football type numbers but it'll surpass your prime time NFL games I Would put it up there with the NFL playoff game\nUm as far as World Series game by game ... does\nNot look at the college football my goodness give me a little money ... they how did the books do on that one and I'm sure when he was paid quite hence the million this where\nYeah you know the winds guys were all Purdue that line dropped down to his lowest twelve but the public obviously was on Ohio State we thought we were going to get Ohio State Michigan at the end of the season\nI Am with they're still going to play but I Will see how that game shapes up now oh house there was a minus five hundred favorites a while in office about minus four fifty a plus three fifty on Purdue so you've got three and a half to one on their money on that home dog if you put it on the money line if you're better off our state\nYou're late five to win one and not a good result it all the game did end up going over\nThe sharp send the public were betting that game over\nOne thing already and I were arguing about a little bit a minute ago so central Florida look [laughter]\nI'm just saying we know they're not famine Notre Dame whatever but at a certain point you win so many games in a row\nI just think we should at least keep them in the conversation if they let me go bam because there's so much better than everybody else if they were on a neutral field against the Michigan Notre Dame ones in one of those one of those teams at the top that using them what kind of points been are we looking at\nOK you see ads on a on a neutral field against Michigan would be about I'd say easily not\nTo touch down favorite while around ... eleven twelve points at the least\nGay because against Alabama they'd be three touchdown favorites easily probably\nA little higher than that but the books were bringing out lower obviously because they're in the business of managing risk it they're going between what they're going to point out as as a true line compared to a fair line a fair lines meant the split the bending action and put them with limited risk limited liability\nOr if they you know put a real or true number out there that that's meant the split the result long term teammate supposed to cover fifty percent of the time at this point spread team be supposed to cover fifty percent of the time\nAt this point spread since they get eleven attend long term if they can do that they're going to turn a profit so they probably wouldn't put Alabama's at three touchdown favorite or Michigan as a two touchdowns favor because the public would come in one sided only UCF thinking they're better than that number reflects\nBut I'm telling you what what happened is the public would be on your ...\nAnd the winds guys would be stepping over each other to get to the window to on the load on the favorite\nKnowing this line eight nine out because believe it or not um you know teams like Clemson Georgia Michigan\nWhat the odds makers we'll numbers look like\nAll right let's get to the NFL let's do with the New England patriots in Chicago taking the bears no patriots had a lot of time to prepare for the kids a city games\nThey're like ten days you're not getting that the advantage and this one Chicago who ... who ... was about um what are the less practices but then again ... didn't make the trip wind open up a two and a half the patriots were favored that one now down to maybe even want to know what's going on your biggest runner\nWise guys love Chicago Arnie that's one that every every group that I provide betting it accounts for that bed NFL and wind long term doing well have Chicago plus three in their pocket already well they really like Chicago in this match up and and I agree I mean most our ratings\nAt least from the winning guys ... favorite in this game\nUm most believe the wrong team is favored I mean listen this line reflects that in in New England knowing would be around six six and a half point favorite\nAgain she can't go and I mean they were six and a half at home against Miami um there were six and a half against Houston and Chicago is a much better team\nI think than that uh so I think I this is more reflection of the the wives guys taking advantage of the the books having to put a a higher number than they shut up but the public's going to come into New England being able to get New England that pretty much a pick 'em\nYou know a ... ah you're going to get one sided public money on New England so the books are going to be open to wise guys got it right what Chicago that's for sure\nBecause a way of Stevenson was taken down by the neck ooh ah and ah there was no tough all the players that kind of gather around I'm shocked\nI'm I'm absolutely shocked\nThat it didn't get into a something a little bit more physical I I don't know if you guys have the game on was that way and Steven said look like yeah yeah No Child maybe it was a little bit not as much as I made a good take up around the neck though\nIt was Josh heart but land Stevenson jumped right in and was not having it All right so there you go on\nWay is that you should write a story on who has the best contracts obviously ... beneath his name keeps coming up I remember the old time people like are needy already the ... uh was getting paid I might be getting paid what some of these crazy contracts that are out there and\nI'll give you one how about you your boy Kevin someone\nBecause and I'll tell you why if I'm not mistaken\nAll these other guys that had all these massive buyouts\nThey had a stipulation where if they accepted a new deal obviously they're ... right I Believe Kevin someone was paid his entire buyout within like a month of losing his job why now is at Arizona making money new check\nKnew everything got all of those double paychecks yes like you when you were in that arby's commercial\nThat [laughter] I'd\nA couple of things before we get ready for the sake your next segment I just wanted to wrap it up put a bowl on this one I'm Nick Saban getting ice thrown at him obviously you know that would have been the biggest story\nOf the show today if we didn't have so much else going on I'm a I didn't hear the post game conference by coach saving but uh the police did go into the stands remove the tendency fan for a nap or nothing crazy bumped supply something like this hasn't happened more often Aaron\nYeah well I mean we saw it last week in New England with Terry kill right and uh it's just you know listen I I think that it's one thing if you want to yell it's one thing if you want to scream I never have a problem if a fan like yell stupid stuff when you start throwing stuff\nThat's ... that's what I think it crosses the line or by the way we're not going to our top for or we're not doing that this week top five ... I'm like a kind of forgot you want to squeeze it in right here real quick well I'll just tell me real quick I was just thinking about it I completely forgot myself so\nIf you want with it yeah I mean I'll I'll give it to you real quick right now if I'm going to go ahead and do it and that's obviously\nIt's still going to go out and be Alabama there's not going to be a change or obviously number two is good to be clumps and\nThough I really hate to put them there I'm going to put Notre Dame and number three at LSU\nAt number four I Know you don't like when I Do my top five um but it's not even five I may jump Michigan over Georgia so I've Michigan in Georgia and I'm probably going to drop Ohio State or to number seven just to add to Texas and central Florida in Oklahoma\nO. so Oklahoma's behind all those teams interesting yeah what do you think you got your top four what yeah I got to have four ... number one ... number two now uh there's so much better than it was\nFamily one Notre Dame to I still think ooh this I think the second best team in the country I really do I mean they play great defense and they got the book\nUh three I Will go LSU because I think their resume is more impressive\nPoor I Will go Clemens and and then right on the outside I'm with you I think Michigan is that one last team that that right now they certainly have the best loss of any one of the real contenders\nOr so ago Michigan at five Georgia's six although Oklahoma looked really get to that if there were there one that they're kind of everyone just forgot about him it wouldn't surprise me if if if that last Sunday there that team that gets that one of those spots\nAll right how are the Lakers doing will tell you when we get back to say your will have the answer are you are

Rondo Lance Steven singer avail muggy\nI mean they did nothing wrong with Chris Paul look I don't know what ... is thinking\nYou're don't push I don't know why he pushed hard into the back for no reason whatsoever the phone with them there was not any controversy will call here about if it wasn't his benefit but they didn't give a continuation of what the hell was Chris Paul thinking you're up by one and you just got that\nThat's what I'm saying yeah so yeah you're you're a veteran player you've been in this week for what Thirteen Years yeah and you're in a one point game in the fourth quarter yeah national TV against the Lakers the bronze first game this is a national TV game and you're getting yourself ejected when your\nWell no ... lives on it was a whole hand you ponder right in the face by the way I was being scored it out I don't like that little Braun went ahead\nAnd um yeah that console lack of better term they're I'm broke up and carry Chris Paul away put his hand around them and said come up breaking up\nNo no you're a Laker yup you're back away that's the enemy over there you don't break them up and put your hand the wrong Chris Paul and and say come on come on you go to your teammates you know what I mean there and\nI I agree with you on that I mean I'm I'm Still trying to wrap my head around everything that happened is we watch all these replays again this game I'm a hundred percent with you on the I mean look I you know we know a little Braun increased poll have a a friendship that dates back a long time\nBut I don't care I I agree with\nThat of course both on your team you're competing with it for a championship I mean in theory right the worst economic but like the that's the competition I don't care I don't care who you're friends with once you step outside the court but on the court I mean that guy just got into it with your teammate and I'll tell you this Arnie\nI Know LeBron's the man I Know he is by far the best player on that roster if I was younger I Know when I see that I come back to the locker room he did that guy just put his finger on my face in my ...\nYou cannot put your hands on somebody you may wag your finger you may pointed the guy but Chris Paul put his finger his I didn't see the palm of his head but the finger on his face on his cheek on his nose and then started pushing his head back with it that's it well that's it we're we're we're getting it out now if you do something like\nIn all seriousness I mean if you're rushing around and you see little Braun I understand the Bronx just trying to cool the situation but I mean that to just shoved his finger on my face and I took a swing and um and you got your arm around them I don't know exactly I I think that's a week sauce man that's what the kids say we saw\nI mean I agree yeah I agree I'm just saying\nI I look yeah I I get that look brownish hey Floyd Mayweather sitting courtside okay\nHow come it is are are now makes sense or how can they afford tickets I don't know yet ... well it did you see by the way he bought two thousand dollars worth of Powerball tickets last night I always 'cause he died Monday I was dying when I saw that I was like oh\nWell I mean imagine Floyd Mayweather won the billion dollar Powerball or whatever [noise] sick to my stomach [laughter] but so anyways I'm just saying\nI understand the ... to defuse the situation I don't like the idea of putting your arm around the other teams player after he just started this ... I don't like it at all\nNo not at all or if you want to go out and give your comments Aaron on this score tour as at stinking genius one\nUh right now used to lead to what eleven one oh wait rockets shooting one more foul shot they made to\nOr from the technical or excuse me not from the technical from the silent Ingram um so it was one of Lebanon one wait Arden with one more uh so it's one twelve went away three forty one left in this one salt\nWake us up to come from behind a if they want to go and get the victory right the week seven though of the NFL my goodness man\nSome monster matchups first of all any games as we're looking that stick out like must win games\nOr with their teams back against the wall that if they don't when\nYou could pretty much right or off their playoff hopes I think one of the Detroit Lions they go to Miami there are two and three\nOr wouldn't get some back the five hundred they're back in the thick of things dolphins are foreign to they got a big victory last weekend and now they get ... for another game I think this is intriguing match up here but gee uh between Detroit and Miami\nYeah it's really funny or the the lions does anyone have a weird or resume than the lions yeah there are two and three ... patriots\nThere's a big one for them and and I'm really intrigued also by the dolphins I'll give you another one in AFC East versus NFC North battle how 'bout Minnesota at the jet yeah I mean I listen all admitted\nI may have been wrong on Sam Donald Arnie I haven't been wrong on something since the mid nineties and in a while [laughter] but I mean they've won two in a row the jets they beat the Broncos they beat the colds and I\nI think this is no great shakes they're sort of like like they'd be world leaders you know I Know I totally agree especially the Broncos they they were coming across country or on a short weeks so\nBut I'm saying is the the the jets when this game they're right back in the thick of things and oh by the way the the Vikings who we left for dead after that um after that that that Iran's game they were one two and one they've ripped off to in a row as well so it's funny that we both kinda picked\n\n\n\nGo ... we'll see I don't see eye to eye to eye for detail [noise]\nAnd the other lane college sports ball\nGoes down in New York and talking about before [noise] so we're the ones that you have to\n[noise] stay swat Lawrence radio\nI got a six point seven mobile labs that is it I thought it was a column for the tail\n[noise]\n\nHi good evening everyone ... and you're you're on Fox Sports radio by the way this they've been brought to you by the governor Carter we treat you like you treat you check out discover card [noise] gosh one interesting fact is only one because it's a game like Arizona UCLA\nArizona just took the lead twenty seven twenty four ... not playing this game ... Rodrigues Rhett Rodriguez got the start Eric correct me if I'm wrong isn't that a coach Rodriguez's son who was fired and replaced by Kevin someone or what\nI Believe it was I Believe it or not you know Rick new ... son stuck around UCLA after he left I thought that was weird too but I mean I guess you know whatever it is what it is but still yeah that's a little weird yeah Kevin someone relying on the coach's son\nGet back to the NFL and by the way if you have any more comments you want to reach us on Twitter a Aaron underscore tours at stinking genius one because a lot of people are again making comments about what happened with the Lakers situation\nLike the ... mall or once again LeBron James is the only athlete in history of pro sports to get criticized for doing the right thing and making the right play amazing abroad should've left his wife for Brazilian swimsuit model to get respect ... again\nI don't think people are quite understanding what we're saying here it's one thing to break up the fight it's another thing to put your hands\nAround your buddy Chris Paul and you know walk away with him instead of being on the side of your team and I bring up a point um and maybe that's not the same on the same scale we all criticized ... earlier this year when he was playing or um might've been last year actually\nI didn't do anything it was my teammates that did something and we ripped him like crazy you're supposed to back your teammates does that with a bronze doing here\nOh yeah no absolutely and and he had to be clear so for people to see it there was a big\nRole in the ... a a skirmish a scuffle will say you know hunch is worth throwing punches were thrown and low Braun to his credit\nWe have to speak slow slow for some listeners top polled Chris Paul away and kind of broke it up but then the camera shows kind of LeBron almost like I don't know like a big brother like yeah\nGetting his his his little brother to school or something like that it's a word yeah yeah and he's he's walking Chris Paul back to his badge and it's I certainly will be\nPut your hands around Ingram who's getting thrown as you'll be put your hands um around some of your other teammates or like run though that's also going to get in trouble for the punches about\nThat I totally agree Arnie I totally agree come to the defense of your teammates do what you gotta do to make sure that everybody or that situation gets cleared up and I don't know what's going to happen as far as suspensions finds whatever but you got to worry about your guys and and if you want to get Chris part of the mainly that's fine\nBut then it wasn't ... get suspended because they always say if you throw a punch that does anything about putting a finger or putting your hand in somebody's face in touching them though\nI don't know it's going to be really interesting I mean you know it would be really interesting to me I look the guys that through punches are going to get suspended\nIt's been so long since we've actually seen actual fish thrown yeah\nIn an NBA game that I don't know what they're going to do I'm just really interested to see I'm really curious to see because it has just been a really long time since we've seen something quite like this\nMore thing does anybody know why Ingram got all upset to begin with and push hard and in the back after they were discussing whether it should have been continuation or not that's\nYeah I was gonna say that's the one tough thing about in a situation like this that and by the way we we have we we get all the good fights during our our window [laughter] crazy we had to be McGregor could be versus the crowd last uh two weeks ago\nAnd then we get a Lakers rockets so I was like sweet cocky going into the crowd or what yeah well hockey at least we expected maybe we'll get like a good uh I don't know WMBA brawl or ah MLS or something like that but um you know but when I was going to say was that's the only thing that's tough is that\nWhen we're on in this window obviously we have the TV's turn now because we're trying to figure it all out\nAnd uh you know we're trying to do a show but then to see stuff happen live we don't always have the full details so we're kind of collecting them in real time like everybody else\nPatriots going down the road that take out in Chicago I brought this up earlier patriots had about ten days to get ready for the Kansas City chiefs\nIn which they beat them a forty three forty pages of finally found a running game in sodium show who by the time he retires will go out as the best running back in the history of the patriots wow they really are back into our history Jane I'm like I said [laughter] Chicago Bears coming of age draining laws to the dolphins\nWere the dolphins well actually the bears that that gave one\nNot because of dolphins ... the one yard line because the bears that a eight point lead and it just scored a touchdown but it was ruled no good because of a penalty and the next play dolphins picked it up so tough loss for the bears a patriots don't have the ten days to get ready for this one\n... Mac held out of practice I Believe on Thursday or friday rock not making the trip for the patriots monster game for the bears I Believe in uh the patriots look they want to keep track with the dolphins I don't think the patriots witnessed what I liked the bears an escape\nWell we've seen two different patriots teams away from Fox borough and ... and I think that's going to be\nTrying to figure things out uh but now it's the middle of October ... towards the the the time of the year when the game's really means something\nThey've been at home for three straight weeks they now have for the next five on the road so for me like it's hard for me to definitively say oh the patriots are back or they're not back like I Need to see what they do away from Fox borough it's going to be cold it's going to be nasty there in Chicago curious to see how they respond usually played on weekends\nNo ... well ... the games start too early over here so no I don't sleep late and we can well you\nYou would get up about nine o'clock or something like that to go and watch the ten o'clock games what are you to do tomorrow when the titans play the chargers interests because that's good to be starting pre game what about or I actually the game will kick off six thirty\nOn the west coast you of interest you're going to get up and watch that or maybe kind of sleep a little bit late maybe watch after half time or something\nSo I'm going to sleep till a normal time and why is that even sleeping late I mean what time does the game started or six thirty your time six thirty out in the morning you know I Know I'm where I'm where I uh I Will not be a waking up for a you know teen Crumpet or for for first kick here\nIf it was a better game would you were you just have no interest in you know because look at how many times do we play in London it seems like every other week were playing in London or so\nI mean they've been up to like four or five six games the last couple of years is\nA last week the the raiders in sea hawks but they kicked off at one Easter and I don't even really know if we played that game I don't even know if it wasn't really fly well it was like one of those you know how like red zone that cuts all the games you get to the red zone it's like well ... yeah well I never got to the red zone so they didn't they didn't come to that one so\nNo I mean look I I I if it was look if it was chiefs patriots and that just happened to be in London and yet I of course I Would get up\nBut the chargers look I think they're they're really good I just\nCan't go to under five hundred charges still want to win that division I know we're only six games in but still kind of a big game for both teams out there though\nIt is a big game but if you're asking me am I going to get up early just for it than a no\nProbably I like it because I got nine thirty on the east coast now so I'll do the nine thirty to one o'clock in the four o'clock in the four thirty whatever you want to call it um but do six thirty on what time is it in Hawaii that is going to be a star wars of army\nFor thirty is your wife doesn't get mad at you for like fourteen straight hours a day on Saturday and Sunday just watching football\nAnd I just think the Dodgers had that experience from last year I mean they were one game away from winning the world series last year I just think being there it means something I mean obviously I Know some of the red Sox have have been a plate at this level and you know back in twenty Thirteen\nBut I just think the Dodgers having just been there having been that close I Know it's like a corny sports cliche oh\nThey were they were one step away their their back it's like I think that really does matter in this case I'm Wondering you know I said the cold weather um\nLook the red Sox have had a good home run power during the course of the year but obviously solve the Dodgers so I'm Wondering who's going to be at the disadvantage um as for you know the red Sox being used to the cold weather\nUm you know summertime it it does warm up around here I don't know if you know that guy the\nThe northeast does it get warm in the summer time but the one thing you've got to be worried about the red Sox is the bottom of the ... come alive I mentioned Jackie probably junior was the MVP this is the guy that was about to get up to ten or ... actually left it to ten for most of the year but I think finished with a a two ten to twenty batting average\nUm the really coming alive at the bottom of the order divers\nWith a big home run a and of course when you have to keep pets and JD Martinez and those guys obviously\nYou're going to be real dangerous or one through nine so Red Sox certainly not the Dodgers don't do that is why I think it's going to be a great match a plus the ratings through the roof fair and absolutely through the roof yeah it was amazing\nI think he said the uh the red Sox game six or whatever it was ended up getting\nSix million viewers and basically the NBA has struggled early on because so many people were watching baseball I have to imagine not only historic organizations but big markets but also look I think that Dodgers thing if they were so close last year people want to see if they can get over the hump\nThe red Sox obviously with what they've done over the last decade and a half since they won that first world series and all four\nI think you mentioned earlier but outside of the Yankees Dodgers I Can't imagine a much more appealing World Series for ah for major league baseball and\nHow about we with the three run Homer that was awesome to see I'm considering where I thought maybe I should add that home run ball in the first inning yeah if you want to jump to a little bit but he was on the run so he really didn't time anything otherwise I think he could have gotten up all the you know it would have gotten out of that any without any runs\nAbsolutely and you know I don't know I just think that that when you look at this Dodgers team and I just think I just think that that we would that that I don't know I just I I think there's something about the Dodgers this year and I know that the the line of business deep I Know that maybe the starting pitching isn't as deep I just think there's something about um this year\nOh it's deep it's deep enough to beat the red Sox that's for sure I've seen just about every Red Sox game this year\nBecause I'm Out here in the northeast and we carry them will come back our picks for everything for the Sunday games plus I'll tell

book you could buy the way we've got to kick off at about seven hours here\nYou got to love it so let's talk World Series a little bit yes first off it's the series\nThat baseball once I ultimately the interest level and the teams is a driver TV ratings wise coverage wise Red Sox Dodgers made it harder to do better than that red socks with ...\nIn baseball that war is about thirty five cents so that means that say their war no home field and they were even money well the home team would be minus one thirty five and a series and oh by the way the series price Boston Red Sox home team minus one thirty five\nSo if you want to buy the Dodgers you get like plus one Fifteen back or so so pretty much if you want to bat Red Sox but a little bit more to win a hundred and if you want the Dodgers a hundred wins you a little bit more than a hundred\nBut it's really align with home field which means the betting market at least initially thinks this is a eat these are even team that's exciting\nOpens Tuesday night in Boston Boston His name Chris ... started the Dodgers have yet to name a starter so I haven't seen a game press for Tuesday night\nYeah and and what you'd expect is based upon the starters or if one thirty five is going to be the starting point based on home\nLet's just say Red Sox have a slightly better starter maybe one fifty and if somehow the Dodgers have a slightly better start maybe one twenty so you get that range home field plus or minus based on the starting pitcher\nMoving along to college football and other headlines tonight that one can't ignore a game played in West Lafayette, Indiana no don't adjust your sets the Ohio State buckeyes mentally last they last by for touchdowns RJ as a double digit favorite\nI didn't see that are you sure\nI'm not sure I'd have to readjust my set\nI mean you know listen do we know the following that if you can ignore reality sometimes you just can race at times it's like well reality will catch up to you maybe not always but as in a high stakes grad I've got to try to deny it a little bit there felt lights\nSaying we saw that law that we expected based upon\nThe coach urban Meyer being suspended what I thought was okay August you're relaxing you're getting ready for the season instead there's all this drama right now you know you got a Michigan State game the Michigan game coming up\nAnd just felt like you know of almost a fourteen point favorite on the road\nI really blame the urban Meyer situation not saying who was right or wrong and that\nBut to me the stress that distraction around that made being flat\nAt this point of the season a lot more likely than if it didn't happen so a obviously a horrible loss obviously it brings up an interesting point though Bernie and let me ask you\nIf Ohio State wins out do they make the playoffs\nI Believe they do and I do believe they'll beat Michigan let's keep in mind last year the buckeyes winning became Nick stadium in Iowa and got spanked still beat the over into a few weeks later two years ago coughed up a double digit lead as a double digit favorite at Penn State still beat Michigan I still think the buckeyes get it done to regroup\nOkay I I'm not saying buckeyes aren't still the favorite to win the Big Ten\nTitle I mean I don't I haven't seen the updated odds but the line in the Michigan Ohio State game mhm last week before the today ... was Ohio stay\nAt home favorite by six and a half mhm let's just get crazy and say to point downgrade for our state to point out great for Michigan I don't believe Michigan deserves that but let's just say to four point adjustment but I still favorite\nRight so buckeyes are going to be favorite against Michigan unless something very surprised ... absolutely agree but here's\nSame and let's say they squeak by over Michigan and lifting Notre Dame has won last at some point they lose the game they're not supposed to look who gets in Notre Dame with one last or Ohio State with ...\nWell ... I Believe Ohio State we keep in mind RJ they'll still have to run the gauntlet and when the big could championship understood too but it gets to Wisconsin or Iowa will see okay is that I mean hey any game we saw today right but most likely that's not a problem right\nAnd you don't see and what ends up happening is this\nAnd this is a good example of what happens in the NFL playoffs Indiana fell playoffs when there's a double\nDigit favored which is rare one teams just so much better\nThey know against the spread last day for the favor now it's like wait are usa double digit dogs are good yeah because one of the reasons\nDouble digit dogs are good is the favor often times is distracted is not focused on the game in the playoffs their focus same thing if Indiana played Ohio State somehow in the Big Ten championship\nThe chance to them upsetting them is so much less than it was today ... because there's the ebbs and flows of a natural season in a playoff in the NFL in a championship game and college you're not going to see a lack of focus but I listen here last thing I'll say about the chance of the bad guys as they do went out\nI think I think the two narratives oh my God here's another Florida Ohio State team just got crushed against Clemson now two years ago a it's almost like who wants to watch that game Notre Dame comes in with one last\nYou know having beat Michigan and I that wins looking\nBetter and better now you say okay\nI mean this is going to be exciting they're ... they're both going to be double digit dogs again\nIs\n[noise] second straight up if you are ... I'm Bernie ... live from Fox Sports radio Geico studios and by the way our Jay [noise] I understand there was a big game and the blues tonight Washington state came up big oh well yeah I mean\nThey covered the spread it was one of those wait a minute to favor the ranked team isn't favored and it was kind of public versus pros but on friday straight out of Vegas we had a new\nExpert I I'll say expert in quotes he has his own theme song\n[noise]\nIt paid staff hang\nAnd he thought wait a minute Oregon [noise] they're that they're\nHow could they be getting points but Brad power said no no no we're going with Washington state so nice winter there but it's fun to have haystack come in and just give that perspective [laughter]\nOther than that we had to hear you got it if you just gotta here\nI have to make make a point or let's move back to the NFL [laughter]\nHe's like I didn't want to do that but see I I'm I'm a team player [laughter]\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals beat this game was flexed to tomorrow night bill visit Kansas City is six point dogs and I thought our jihad kind of an interesting play on words with respect to the Bengals and their game Sunday night let's take a listen\nBank was team has a history in prime time\nOf not playing well we are not touch we talk about if we ... we the bangles I'm from southern Ohio so I Would never associate with that [laughter] go ahead well your or Pittsburgh fan so Marvin Lewis nine thirty one straight up in primetime games\nAndy ... let's see what I'm thinking about this forty games they've won ...\nGood and the red rifle Andy Dalton is six and Nineteen again below twenty five percent okay\nNow positive for Kansas City college since he's overrated positive for Kansas City but since the historically under performs same coach means we can go back in history and assume it's still a play a couple last one that is also pro Kansas City they lost last week but we upgraded him\nYeah they lost by three points homes was a little nervous to start the game against New England by the time the game ended I was thinking if this goes another quarter Kansas city's gonna beat New England I upgraded Kansas City there now my number two team in the NFL I head of New England\nJust slightly traffic is spot on about the plight of\nThe Bengals games of this nature and oh by the way the flip side the chiefs there are a Lebanon one against the spread of the favorite in ... and by the way Thirteen and six straight up and it gets his brother last Nineteen Sunday night games RJ\nHold our second Bernie alliance fan can't possibly judge any team we do our best [laughter] I did that for ten years and are you yes I'm what I'm saying is is a Steelers fan I can look down upon the bangles you just got to you just got to be quiet about looking down on franchise\nBut in this particular spot RJ again what Steve physics said take note because the bad news for the Bengals but it's bad is there are three and Thirteen straight up and three twelve and won against the spread on Sunday nights\nThat's not good and I do think that the fact that it's the same coach matters sure because with trends you've always got a way you want bigger numbers\nMeaning of three and one trend doesn't mean very much right you want to hear Thirteen and seven but on the other hand it's got to still be applicable meaning if you change the quarterback if you change the coach now how\nWith that consistent coach some of these longer term trends Marvin Louis are especially applicable\n[noise] good point RJ by the way what does it mean when Geico says just Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more in car insurance that means you're probably should have gone to a guy go dot com Fifteen minutes ago by the way though\nDoes that mean that both RJ and physic are automatically fly around the chiefs tomorrow RJ had some additional commentary about this game a ... out of sorts I Try to listen\nEveryone is thinking okay we got like enough to bat coming up on case they hold the phone one thing is holding me back I went into the database\nAnd I found teams that were five into and last game six how did they playing games seven my rationale coming in was they'd be disappointed\nWhen you get that momentum you'll lose your thinking who cares so much about the next game not that extreme but just a little ad that\nWas twenty seven times last Thirty years five no team last game six what do they do in game seven ten and Seventeen against the spread to me that number is not big enough to say I'm sure it's a problem but boy when I looked into that because I thought it might be a problem\nThat reinforces are we sure I Know it's Sunday Night Football or we sure they're playing a fever pitch right now after that last I'm not so I'm just going to lean Kansas City minus six\nOr ... you brought up a good point a minute ago let's not bury it you created the chief after a loss\nAnd I want to ask you this question or the ... maybe even better than they thought they were and I are then they thought than we thought they were and I'll tell you why look at their schedule after chargers at Pittsburgh at Denver at new Williams versus the Jay Z\nPlus thirtieth differential oh yeah oh by the way they beat San Francisco thirty eight to twenty seven as well with Jimmy gee so if you look at that schedule for the cheese up to this point the easiest game\nWas Monday Night when I was the easiest I mean coming into the game was on Monday Night at Denver at altitude that's not an easy game for anybody so chiefs and it's not even close have had a tough a schedule in the NFL and right now\nAnd I do Boston radio once a week every Friday and they're obviously big patriots fans I asked them\nWho would you want and I'm going to ask you burn 'cause maybe we can do a little bad press or green button I'm all in one on that but that's a hands off of Chris ... it could just be a bad luck right so you've got to see you got you gotta until you lose a dime I don't think\nI Would worry about it and then at that point you might start wonder I live in St one hundred dollar bets well no it doesn't have to be ten straight just assume you know listen he wants out [noise]\nI mean it it it's something that you don't know until you try but [laughter] but um yeah let me ask you this if you could have Kansas City\nTo make the super bowl or New England to make the super bowl and if neither do it's no bad mhm\nWhich I Would you want I Would take new women because right now or a J they've got\nHome field advantage [noise] okay we may not be able to collect on this\nToo I mean I'm I'm planning on staying around burning\nGod willing and [laughter] right [laughter] uh yeah you're ... we're going to get to that later in the show and we talk about the the path bears game but yes I Would take New England well you just did take Durango I did take one hundred five hundred but even money hundred bucks you want to do that the noise the I don't know about that and for the new listeners this is ...\nWhy don't we let Jonas off John this is the voice of the fans he can have is opinions not back and with cash that's fine that's what typical talk radio does if you're a wise if you're around this table Bernie in Vegas your opinions you've got to back them with cash you just\nDid and graduate graduate as you do quite loans venture I Believe there was a picture on Twitter awhile back you had a nice little small fortune there you know it's been a good run but I think I've just been lucky so we'll revisit this in late January\nI say yes I Will take the patch over the chiefs you get to the super bowl if neither one makes it than a there is no bet\nYeah yeah so that that's a good one and here's my rationale okay I'm In Kansas City is the clear favorite to have home field\nRight if you look at their schedule from here it's relatively oh yeah I I agree with that and if if it and if that's the case\nThat the best unless there's injuries you never know with injuries but right now five projected what would the line be conference championship Kansas City hosting New England it'd be Casey minus three mhm so to me that I'm effectively betting\nThe home team that's favored by three at even money that's a good\nBet what you should have not lost on me when the chiefs chill twenty forty nine came back and almost one and you are created them I understand why\nThis is straight out of Vegas it's brought to you by discover become a new card number and discover card will match all the cash back you've

thanks so much the Iowa sand for getting our sounded a wink and a nod to Mike Myers back in the Los Angeles studios during all the dial keeping us glued together RJ\nWe talked about the parents are minute ago the other side of the coin the Philadelphia Eagles the visit Carolina's a five point favorite now Carson\nWhen I had a terrific rookie season and had a bad injury he's back this year but she made an interesting observation about him is he reserves that's the department of redundancy department in a few games back whichever listen\nI think this is all about Carson went being different quarterback today than it was three or four weeks ago he came back a little early and how does that affect things [noise]\nHe didn't run the ball as much they didn't call was a plays as aggressively and I think the guy's a watch the tape tell me that the need look better and better each week and I think that him getting close if not a hundred percent is the difference maker for the eagles\nFirst two games for once ... yards per pass attempt last two game seven and a half yards per ... interestingly enough I Do think fairly got their work cut out for him tomorrow Cam Newton Nineteen made against the spread of the dog in games coming off a loss including a Lebanon to against us\nLiking the eagles initially was about ...\nTraining up words the general health of the eagles improving a lot of players that aren't necessarily big names improving and the Panthers struggling on the road defensively especially they are the Carolina given up seven more points per game on the road twenty seven versus twenty\nBut if you look at the yards per play defensively yielded they're better on the road and I tend to trust the PR place that it's more in the point stats we know one pot return one ... pass for touched on can change a stat drastically on a per play basis\nNo lucky play really affects things all that much so in our super contest entry by the way the gold it was five thousand to get in our podcast me ...\n... who's a former book maker entered the five thousand or two games out of the first place two games out of first by the way first place when's almost seven hundred thousand I won't be here that Saturday Bernie if I when we just did it just ... why I\nWill get to that later speaking of on the road both the titans and chargers had across the pond by the way different scoring at home and I hope you are the favorite in this NFL international series it's been going on a while now\nWell the favorites are fourteen and six against the spread now is this just London or account in Mexico city just just limited okay maggots and you're just London and interestingly enough the chargers standing in a particular venue perhaps it was an old march\nTo our GI Bill word of the chargers stay before hitting the woman is take a listen\nOne to me is driven by the chargers staying in Ohio\nSame that many camp can bring a team together [noise] I don't really like this chargers coach so I don't know what to think of this many camp but I think the answer to that question gives you who you gotta like in his London game I don't have the answer but knowing the right question is important to\nThis game which she kicks off in just about six hours in twelve minutes you have thoughts\nAnd I don't and and I'll make it quick I I think the it's the same question is this a folk his team focused favor with the chargers because remember the charges of lost two games mhm one to Kansas City mhm one to the rams\nSome would say the two best teams in the NFL\nSo I was down on the chargers entering the year but boy if you look at rivers summer sang at this advanced age he's having his best season ever I'm passing the London games\n[noise] this is a straight out of Vegas

what are you talking about what is this your first day on the job Sears shielded not\nGet enough playing grandma to Frank okay may run in a row\n[noise]\n\nSo as it turns out [noise] apparently the memory spans of players in a certain\nSports league for a lot longer than we think and they're not as passive aggressive as we think we'll get to that coming up here momentarily I'm Jonas knocks this is Fox Sports radio\nYou can check out the show on me I heart radio lab you can find us on Syria sex them\nChannel eighty three and on all of our Fox Sports radio affiliates wherever you are taking part in the program we always appreciate a few minutes of your time\nAs we can be alive here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios were Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance visit guy go dot com for a free rate\nFor this to finally occur if you are just tuning in the Lakers and the Houston Rockets\nWere playing in LeBron James is debut at staples center\nWhere it was a who's who of ah a raise your hand if you're a blowhard you're sitting courtside at staples center for law bronze debut the tickets were overpriced the bud lights or Ninety five dollars and everybody was there on hand to watch LeBron's debut with the story\nEnded up being a fight and an actual fight in an NBA game which we don't really get a whole lot of\nSo late and the game James Harden\nGoes to the basket does his flailing James Harden move that he usually does a gets fouled Brandon Ingram for some reason decides to push James Harden\nAh they separate everybody ... nobody knows why Brandon increments pissed\nThen all of a sudden you see Chris Paul and rage on Rondo talking and getting face to face you see Chris Paul put his finger Enron does face and then Rondo pops in ... with this clean of a less jab as you'll see anywhere outside a boxing ring or a UFC octagon\nIt was beautiful technique perfect technique on a job and they start throwing blows and Chris Paul strong blows and then Brandon Ingram comes over the top and pops Chris Paul vi while the fights going on I mean we're talking an actual fighting and NBA game\nA lot of times there's just some John back and forth and maybe they'll go forehead forehead you don't actually see punches thrown let alone punches thrown and landed cleanly like you saw on Saturday Night\nSo Paul Peirce a long time teammate of regime Enron do\nRobert Criss wherever\nLiving out those are second year\nThe things that this is their first actually because\nAcross fought never got along\nSaw earlier when I saw a guy walking off a lot of heated exchange between those two images from there but I Am not surprised when\nYeah I'm not surprised at all either it's why it led to stop saying or something that started in two thousand nine it's been nine years in the making I'm not surprised by that there was an incident that took place in Rwanda was a member of the Boston Celtics and one of the stories that came out of that game was the trash\nTalk was so bad between Rondo and Chris\nPaul Chris Paul followed Rondo into the tunnel\nAnd was screaming I'm going to make him respect to me I'm going to make him respect me because rage on Rondo\nKept talking about how Chris Paul didn't have any rings so these guys have not like each other for a long time and to Paul Peirce his point yeah I'm surprised didn't happen sooner I I Can't believe it took this long for it to go down now there are some conflicting reports out there Chris Paul was alleging that raised on Rondo spit in his face\nI don't think anybody is found actual evidence of rage on Rondo spinning in his face I don't think that's been found anywhere but Chris pulse teammate and a good friend of his Carmelo Anthony decided he would give his opinion after the game\nWas played some form of ... [noise]\nThe sort of sitting in today\nSo so\nI mean you don't even see it on the street for\nYeah you're right you don't see that in the streets because in the streets people usually pull out a tire iron possibly a hand gun or a forty hour and ... and wrap it around someone school okay so let's let's let's not be over dramatic here we have no proof that he actually spin on him until there's video\nEvidence that comes out in the Lakers are backing raised on raw do let's not get over dramatic here let's not turn this into can be Connor to okay where are you guys are all playing the violin because it had a bad stayed on the sports stop\nRight it's a fight two guys who don't like each other it's a fight it happen national TV and it was great television here's the guy who's getting slammed\nBrandon Ingram\nHe's getting crushed and he's going to see a significant suspension from the NBA and that could come down in the matter of hours because I Believe Houston plays a game coming up on Sunday\nSo Brandon increments getting crushed and I got to be honest with you in a weird way I think Brandon Ingram just change his reputation\nAnd I don't think it's a bad thing\nI don't think it's a bad thing and all the knock on brand in increments always been well he's a raw talent needs to bulk up a little bit you know maybe there's not enough dog in him like I've seen a some people throw out the idea that yeah the difference between brand in increments so and so is that guy's got that dog in him that alpha dog mentality Brandon Ingram doesn't have\nThat in him I think that changed on Saturday Night now\nDon't condone guys going over the top and a brawl and popping a a another man in the face when he's engaged in an altercation with somebody else it's not condoning that\nAnd brings guys together I don't know why but when guys get in trouble in groups you kind of build up this weird camaraderie it's strange my area member like you and your buddy would get in trouble in school\nTell me detention wasn't the most fun you had the entire year\nI can remember getting into trouble with a buddy of mine\nIn high school and we had a in in a house suspension they called it where you had to you were suspended but you've stayed on campus and you picked up trash and all that might have been the most fun at at the entire year because it's sort of built up this camaraderie\nOkay you know you and I kinda you know couple rebellious hero a couple of rebels going at it going to school like it kind of built up a little bit of chemistry but also here's the other thing\nIn a legal were so few guys actually throw hands\nLet alone land Brandon Ingram just did so players around the league are going to know that moving forward that he's capable of that you may not like the optics of it or you may not like the fact that he went over the top and he popped Chris Paul in the face\nSports cars and all that explains you up to date twenty four hours a day seven days a week\nI saw one else sick so\n\n\n\n\nGo mobile on the on the same in my lab visit I saw one of the twin seven dot com for\nThe last thing for me [noise]\nI'm Eric is right in the past ...

Thursday at seven thirty Easter non blah now [noise]\n[noise] oh\nMy God [noise] odd the onus Fox Sports radio [noise] so what do you live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios is might may our executive producers\nFinal show um if if you have anything you would like to say to my marriage just uh you go to Twitter and do that and uh make it as offensive as possible that's always a good way to send people off here or on EPA's aren't weekend overnight you do it to me every single week and I'm not going anywhere so\nAh you could probably share with my mayor ... are still coming up here and just a moment I'm going to talk about a\n... team in in the football world got some is feeling really good about themselves well I'll tell you why maybe they shouldn't be feel and all that hot that'll be coming up here momentarily\nAlso in\nOn live to London and we're bringing London live to you here on Fox Sports radio we've got somebody on we've got to feed on the ground in London as we have a London game coming up in the NFL so stick around for that if you want to go international\nOr we will have that for you less than ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio thank God route for ovens not here for a Hawaii degenerate gambler update because they're getting murdered right now oh homily disintegrated by Nevada so um [noise] the lease or bolo civil but they have not looked good in recent weeks\nI'm All right so if you're a Michigan fans Saturday was sweet right you felt really good about Saturday I mean you were fired up about Saturday I I mean Michigan goes to Michigan State and they win\nAnd not only they when there's an altercation pre game and then they tear up the Turpin midfield and and it it is chaos and there's weather delays in Michigan when\nThe game it's a Saturday was sweet\nBeating your in state rival like that a team of your old one to a team of still thinks they're better than you because of that flew ... that went uh Ryan that crazy ending to that game a couple of years ago so that was a big time when from Michigan and then also\nIf you're a Michigan fan Saturday was sweet because then later on Ohio State put up a stink or against Purdue so Ohio State has lost\nSo they're going to be out of the top five Michigan to replace them\nI mean help even Penn State struggled against Indiana Penn State didn't look all that hot so Saturday was sweet for Michigan fans I mean Michigan fans are riding high after what went down on Saturday and then if you're a gym Harbaugh defender or your family like I Am Saturday was enjoyable men Jim are bought haters\nCouldn't even beat Notre Dame I mean they weren't chirping\nAnd then they just continue to win and they often continue to get better and the defense continue to dominate and here they are all these weeks later\nAnd Michigan looks like the best team in the Big Ten and they look like they're going to make a top five of parents when the new rankings come out\nThey've got a legitimate opportunity to go to the college football playoff so for Jim ... defenders Saturday was a great time to I even saw some emphasis on up us our crime on Twitter I saw Doug godly Fox Sports radio host trolling clay Travis\nWho just clay Travis has been hard on Jim ... of the past couple of years hammered and talked about over eighty was\nAnd So Doug ... leave just just a it's called out quite Travis on Twitter like look this is if you're a gym or about defender Saturday was a great day but like anything if something is really good for somebody chances are it may not have been all that good for somebody else\nSo Saturday was good for Michigan fans and if Saturday was good for Jim ... defenders\nWho is it maybe not so good for\n[noise] um how about Michigan themselves\nSee because now Michigan's got a target on their back\nIt's one thing happened that target on your back after you win a national title because you kind of have this thought of well yeah I mean even if we don't play well this year we get knocked off by a couple of rivals you know we still have that to hang our heads on we still have that one that we can you know go to bed at night and think well you know at least we got this\n... at least we want our national title\nThe problem is now Michigan's got the target on their back and they've never won anything teams are going to use this is their ... title game this is going to be the biggest game going\nAt all Penn State cares about is two weeks from now\nYou'll get to the ball game when you get to the ball game that's fine whatever you'll deal with that then and James Franklin wants to finish out strong so he can look good for recruits and looked like he hasn't lost control of the program\nBut for Penn State two weeks from now is the game for them that's the one they've got circled on their calendar that's the game they want to go out and they want to prove\nThat they still have a voice in the Big Ten Ohio State seasons in jeopardy Ohio State may have lost it all on Saturday after Purdue blow 'em out\nBut all Ohio state's going to be focused on is the season finale at the shoe when they get in Michigan and their Michigan a team potentially fighting for college football playoff berth\nMichigan's path just got that much more difficult\nI get to that much more difficult for Michigan right is it looked like he got easier severe Michigan fan you're looking around and go man what a great day Saturday was\nAnd now you realize yeah we still got Penn State we still got Ohio State and um you know there are seasons are probably over and they'd love nothing more than to make sure that ours is probably over two so they're going to give us their best shot\nAnd I think as difficult as those two games are against Penn State and Ohio State they just got that much more difficult because Michigan one in Michigan did it the way that they did it and they went into an arch rivals stadium and they walked all over the turf and then they talk trash afterwards calling Michigan State their little brother\nEats the weird thing that's happened in Michigan 'cause normally you get a target on your back after you win something the Houston Astros\nHad a target on their back after they won something the Chicago Cubs at a target on their back after they won something the warriors about a target\nAnd then the next month and a half they've got the biggest target on their back in college football and it's because of one thing Jim Harbaugh\nJonah stocks Fox Sports radio eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox the phone number you can also get me on

a a congratulations the LA Dodgers are back in the world series but you've got to give them credit um there's a lot of fan boys out there that that uh that root for the Dodgers their members of the media and they're basically pom pom waving ball washing fan boys\nOr who root for the Dodgers but you've got to give them credit because you get your heart ripped out in a game seven like that and then you figure out a way to overcome all of the reminders and the mocking and the memories of that and then you get back to the world series\nThat's that's that's something\nMandy Atlanta Falcons did it a year ago or they nearly did it a year ago and I thought it was really really impressive the falcons could eat\nRipped out having a Super Bowl in the bag\nUp by twenty five points\nAnd losing like that to then come back the next season just stare a Super Bowl hangover in the eyes to go to the play offs to win a road game against the rams to start and then they go to Philadelphia in a game you probably should have won if Julio Jones comes down with a football\nCommunications [noise]\nGo mobile it's the talk one oh six point seven mobile apps visit I taught one of those six point seven dot

Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance visit guy go dot com\nFor a free rate quote so uh we do something on the show called Knox locks [noise] um yeah it's more of a play on the last name than really anything else but I just I you know what I'm going to take like four or five games in the NFL every single week and I'm going to make a prediction\nSometimes I'll bet on a spread a point spread sometimes I'll bet on a point in total over under sometimes it's not even a bet I'm just going to tell you what's going to happen in the game in incident\nA quarterback getting benched or a backup player seeing playing time I'm like it could be a just a myriad of things uh throughout the course of a Sunday and the NFL and I usually pick about five of these every single week\nOr last week\nAfter going five in the previous week I went for\nAnd won I told you\nThe falcons would cover their three point spread against the Tampa Bay buccaneers\nCheck that's when I told you the\nLA stop hubs super chargers we're going to go to Cleveland and they were going to beat the browns and the chargers we're getting a point\nAnd a half check that was a when I told you\nThat the Washington Redskins would bounce\nBeat the Carolina Panthers and they were getting a point and a half check and I told you even though I think they're not very good that the Denver Broncos getting a touchdown at home against the LA Rams was a great baggage\nCheck\nThe only one I missed last weekend was the game in London where I thought Martian Lynch would be out for revenge and I bet the over a sixty one and a half rushing yards from our Sean Lynch and not only did I not when that bat\nHe may be out for the year or so if you're going to lose a just lose it all is the point in the moral behind that story but nonetheless a foreign one week which puts me at twelve and three on the season find me somebody hotter\nAnywhere on sports radio find me somebody hotter than that anywhere on sports radio especially in weekend overnight\nAnd the best part is by the time you realize what I just ask you um you'll you'll pass out because you're hammered right now so without without being said it is time for the week seven edition of this [laughter]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nSo the New England patriots are two and a half points favored over the Chicago Bears this is a one pm eastern time kickoff [noise]\nI'm going to be honest with you I don't feel good about this\nI really do I do not have a good feeling about this at all um but I'm going to take the bears getting the points at home [noise]\nWeek was a bizarre game for the bears they go to Miami they play the dolphins [noise] the old ... which are rue by the Miami Dolphins is a shortly before kickoff rock ...\nAnd the ... start to dominate the game they start to hit some big plays they start to pull away late but [noise]\nNext thing you know the dolphins [noise]\nThe catch up plays by wide receivers Albert Wilson was on fire\nOr then there was a to fumble is that the goal line I went into overtime the bears missed a fifty ... like there was just all sorts of craziness all sorts of craziness going on in that football game but the story with this one is the underrated home field advantage that belongs to the Miami Dolphins\nDoug Gottlieb was at that game for Fox Sports radio\nAnd he was actually doing the sideline reporting for Fox I talked to this week and he said it was hot as hell [noise]\nIn the shade was on the dolphins majority of the time the bears were having to make makeshift shade\nAnd canopies on their side lines because the players were exhausted\nThe humidity everything that goes along with it rex Ryan even commented said it's one of the top home field advantage in ... and played\nThere are a lot as a coach of the jets and a coach of the bills and that doesn't get talked about a lot to the bears defense was gassed down the stretch and they still probably should have won that game if not for conservative play calling and miss field goal in overtime book picking against the patriots is like going to that one dive bar in town every time you walk in you just think\nLike why why did we come here [noise]\nThat's what it's like picking gets New England patriots but I'm doing it anyways I'm going to go with the bears getting two and a half next [noise]\nCharger [noise]\nThis is a London game we just talked to any Garcia Fox Sports radio who is in London aides are going to be at the game coming up later on but this is a nine thirty am eastern time ...\nCan't imagine waking up at three thirty to watch a game so get your fantasy line upset but\nThere is a a I I guess you would call it a profit in this game that I found that I don't understand [noise]\nDid anybody happened to see the titans game last week if you didn't I don't blame you it was terrible\nAh the Tennessee Titans are off [noise]\nThey haven't scored a touchdown and a quarter so now they travel to London to play a team that has won three in a row in the LA Chargers the knock on the chargers is they lose to the good teams and they only beat the bad ones and it's\nTrue [noise] they've got lost his to the chiefs in Iran\nAnd then they've got winds over the bills forty niners raiders and brown so yes\nThey lose the all the good teams and they beat all the bad teams guess what tendencies bad\nSo the chargers are going to win this game but I'm not betting on the point spread\nWhich is sitting at six and a half\nYou see because the Tennessee Titans gave up a eleven attacks last week to the Baltimore Ravens eleven sacks\nTo the Baltimore Ravens the over under and I found this profit for ... for this for the LA Chargers in this game is two and a half\nHow is that possible they just gave up a weapon a week ago this seems fishy which usually means I'm going to lose but I'm going with the chargers over two and a half Saxon London [noise]\nJust the jaguars\nWhy this is day one pm eastern time kick off the Jacksonville Jaguars or a four point favorite over the Houston Texans book Jacksonville lost two in a row or they've been hammered in both games by a combined scores Seventy to Twenty one Blake portals has been played portal [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the I Know it's going to leave it on one of them would combine all golf so\nSeriously when no regrets\nFor stars do say I know like so\nShe said well maybe you\nWere doing it all for you it sounds to me to me when you\nSee that on the\nLine or do you\nLike to hear\nThat last one on your television showed a Fox Sports ... detail why\nWhy don't\nA man knocks Fox Sports radio\nShow where do you live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios asks standing\nThat wasn't a now ... that whole season now that's that's a tribute to Perdue who beat Ohio State on Saturday Night and that was DJ knocks from last year's Foster Farms vote against Arizona on a little a little fake kneel down ran for the thirty five yards I thought I'd throw that out there and look I'm\nTelling you and and I know that maybe people look at it like it's being a hot take but the worst thing that happened in Michigan on Saturday was Ohio State lose and I know it seems like a great idea I Know it seems a great Michigan looks like they're going to take over the Big Ten but Sam what don't you think of Ohio State\nYou being the Big Ten football expert don't you think Ohio State is going to be even more ready to play that game and the finale\nAnd outlay last well they were under in contention 'til you even make the play off with to blow out last last year this year they still I don't know how you can let them in though when when they lose by twenty nine ply\nActually when you actually look at how this breaks down if Michigan loses it like if if Michigan were to lose and then say the winner of that game say the winter of ... lost in the Big Ten title game a big big tends not getting the team in the cultural\nEnough no ... so it's going to be Ohio State Michigan will probably be you know for the east and then you got to watch the Big Ten title game but I assume that the east champion is going to win the Big Ten and you probably think that if they both have one last that champion is going to get into\nThe more this breaks down to more it's looking like ... there's there's a real possibility the big tends not going to get a team in the college football playoff which then it turns into Alabama Notre Dame Clemson and you're waiting for the I mean not LSU and I don't think it would be LSU\nZealous you plays Alabama yeah next week it's and they won today so they only have one last but they have a great resume\nJust that garbage that they've been trying to spew out the national champions guy could it be\nTexas all my Texas fans are going to be insufferable\nWell [noise] I don't know if ... defense could hold up in the playoff maybe ... maybe it's Oklahoma yeah their defense isn't great either that I Know man\nIt you know it's it's really flawed I'm outside of a you know three fourteen but you're going to get powerhouses in in the college football playoff which is a good thing for ah for the sport alright I'm Jonah stocks here on fs are it is Mike mayors a final show here on Fox Sports radio he is leaving us\nHe is going to another opportunity um good pray and we're still for Mike mayor\nUm we brought in sugar free treats here at Fox Sports radio nightmares they diabetic\nSo much so um that if you ah tossed to Mike mayor an arm and joy he'd lose half a limb\nOr he is a it is it is not not a good idea I Would share my ACL yeah ... that would that would be just a just a bad look I'm Mike stepped on an ... one time and had to have his foot amputated and it's terrible it was a terrible\nTerrible thing that happened and wrote a book that is where this is a this is actually Mike mayor a stepping on a sugar cube and the kitchen two years ago\n'cause\nI'm All

Sports radio just that you're watching the college football games on Saturday\nAnd you're seeing a couple of weather games you see in the snow on the ground you're seeing\nFootball's starting to change a little bit you know now it's now it's no longer a constant heat constant humidity I mean it's hot as balls\nOut here in Southern California for whatever reason I was walking around and got a sunburn on Saturday makes no sense in the world but we're embarking on that time of year where things really get fun\nYou know the weather starts to change a little bit and you're going to see that starting to take place around the NFL and so there's a couple of really good games coming up I'm In the NFL we've also got a London game so we're looking at a little over four hours\nUntil the titans and the chargers play at ... stadium Eddie Garcia our Fox Sports radio anchor a friend a joined us from London in our one he says the buzz in London\nThe hype around the chargers and the Tennessee Titans um yeah there is none a there is none whatsoever so um if\nI were looking forward to playing in front of an actual stadium and not a soccer field um they will ah they will see that uh they are celebrating Halloween early at ... stadium and it's a bunch of people going dressed as empty seats are apparently according daddy Garcia but\nUm if that turns out to not be the case you can blame Eddie and you could find him on Twitter to do that but uh the big game coming up a one pm eastern time kickoff in Chicago\nIs the patriots and the bears and the report is Rob Gronkowski is not traveled with a New England patriots um\nHis back flared up at practice and so ... did not make the trip with the New England patriots so the feeling is he's not going to play but it's New England so who the hell knows\nI mean honestly who the hell knows what's going to happen uh I'm waiting for a one time when the patriots\nA scratch Rob Gronkowski right\nThat to happen but uh the New England patriots were in Chicago to take on the Chicago Bears and Bill Belichick actually you heard a side of him that you did not expect to hear when the subject\nOf ... by the way is also dealing with a little bit of a an injury he's questionable dealing with an ankle injury he suffered last week in whatever the hell that was a in Miami you if you want to call it a football game I called the weirdest thing I'd ever seen and sat through for three and a half hours a Bill Belichick was asked about\n... Mac and comparing him to the great Lawrence Taylor\nAnd bell a check is very fond of Lawrence Taylor he coached them for a long long time in New York as a member of the giants coaching staff and he holds Lawrence Taylor to a level that nobody is ever going to get to this was ballot jak earlier this week\nIt was a lot of fast careers or was this sort of right up there that are\nFar too though [noise]\nOf 'em up when I was so close so\nWhatever it out a little bit of a\nLot of respect a lot of employers now that we're about law so\nI've always felt that bill ... got a lot of people fooled\nI think Nick Saban does the same exact thing they give you this side of them when they talk to the media and then there's moments where they'll slip and you see oh so they actually do have a personality\nOr they actually do care to a certain extent for certain things because if they\nDidn't and they were this robot constantly twenty four hours a day that everybody got agitated with because it was like walking in and and working at a factory because it was a common clock in get out work hard the same boring monotonous routine every single week if that were the case people want\nAnd that he's just a a bad guy and he's angry and a media members are scared of them if that's the case how does he continue to walk into living rooms and kitchens all over the country and get kids to want to come play for him when there's no guarantee they're ever going to get on the field\nIf he was that bad how's he doing that it's\nLike the J Cutler philosophy I have if Jay color was that bad how did he end up with Kristin capillary how does that happen I guess he was so bad how did he stick around the NFL for\nSo long you know like we just all assumed because they give us a certain side of them that that's who they are but you saw little glimmer of that when bell a check and the subject of Lawrence Taylor was brought up because he holds Lawrence Taylor to a level and the standard that nobody else can match\nOr they just had a football life documentary done on Lawrence Taylor what a monster I remember him a little bit as a kid growing up I remember watching him and remember thinking that man this is a really dominant football player he was unbelievable\nAnd the fact that Bill Belichick Mr rigid Mr know days off Mr you've got to do it by the book the fact that ... that Lawrence Taylor\nWas the guy that bell a check and Bill Parcells who also is another rigid\nIn your face get your job done if not you're out of here or no excuses type head coach the fact that Lawrence Taylor can walk into a meeting and fall asleep in a meeting and they wouldn't say a damn thing ... tells you about how much they respect Lawrence Taylor\nAnd bell a check in the football life documentary even talked about how Lawrence Taylor fell asleep in a meeting Bela checkup pissed called them out and Lawrence Taylor walked up to the white board\nBrilliant\nSo when you see ... get a little uh worked up where he shows a little side a personality like that's just that just as an example of a guy who we have always misread we've always gotten it wrong with that check we always have\nThere was a moment last week were Bella check went over remember him and Tom Brady didn't couldn't stand each other him and Tom Brady weren't getting along they were fed up with each other\nThere was a moment last week in the game rebel check walked over and he was talking to Tom Brady and Josh Daniels and I'm going back and forth friendly conversation about what they're going to do on a fence and what the plan is moving forward did you see Bella check\nHugging Rob Gronkowski after the game was over last Sunday night\nAnd that those two didn't like each other you see ballot checking Rob Gronkowski at a horse race\nOr chopping it up and and cracking a few jokes and we get a lot of this stuff wrong when it comes to build a check you don't we don't get wrong the patriots just figure\nSchool sports and the heart of the action hero you up to date twenty four hours a day seven days a week\nI saw one of those things are gonna\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDressing up like Lady Gaga problem we like\nBe a male playoffs are on gene but only one to call themselves [noise]\nWorld [noise]\nSeason MLD coverages right here on Fox Sports radio\nBelieves he can ...

I'm ... something that Kyrie Irving is doing in interviews and I think I Know why\nWill do things the wrong way as opposed to doing the right way I've always been like that um the greatest lessons I've ever had in life are seeing somebody screw up and going yeah I don't want to ever do that again I don't I Want to make sure I don't do that myself\nAnd so you sort of learn how to treat people or be around people based on people that you work with and it's like anything like any anything in in work anything in in whatever you you you treat the people the way that you were treated or the way that you were impacted by how somebody treated you growing up\nAnd so I'm always very cognizant of that and I'm always on the lookout if somebody makes a mistake I Want to use it as as a learning lesson a Conor McGregor as coach\nUm [noise] uh Kavanaugh and I forget his first name driving it's John cabin uh he had a great term after they lost to Nate Diaz first Sunday last\nHe said are you either win or you learn\nIt there is no losing you either win or you learn and it's true and I think that Kyrie Irving has learned something so after the Celtics\nBeat the Knicks on Saturday Night\nKyrie Irving was talking and answering questions as honestly as you'll hear an athlete talk about\nThe potential of going somewhere else we hear a lot of these rumors and reports about players going here or player signing with this team or what's going on after the season is over or they're going to get together or or Kevin Durant interested in the nicks are all this stuff\nAnd Kyrie Irving is the first guy I can remember\nWho's addressing it with the media and so they were asking about the appeal of going to New York and whether or not it was a real thing and he said look yeah it was absolutely everybody was under consideration of the Knicks were\nChristopher ... yeah definitely that was you know that was in consideration and that's really what I was thinking about but ultimately I just decided to Boston was the best spot for me here was Kyrie Irving afterwards\nI mean you know I I think if you are officer so I think it would be the decision\nYou know thinking about who we have in the future and what were set up for [noise] for me it was a [noise] you know where I Am an age is how I visit my career going\nOut of the lineage of ... for me in the Boston Celtics says some that I wanted to be a part of so I'm obviously my dad and my mom and buses so I had a lot of history there as well obviously they're they're from Jersey because there's history there but buses and stuff like\nI didn't Kyrie Irving watched LeBron James and how LeBron James handled his future and I think he said\nI'm not doing that that's not how I'm doing it\nReportedly part of the reason that he wanted out of Cleveland is because\nHe wasn't sure what the bronze plan was moving forward and I think he was bothered by that that it was always some mystery or had to be some grand announcement or had to be a decision or had to be something like that and so Kyrie Irving\nHow not to do it by watching LeBron James so here we are a couple of games end of the season and he's already come out and said I'm not going anywhere\nThis is where I'm going to be he announced it to the season ticket holders after he'd already told us teammates all these reports all these rumors and he's been in contact with the Celtics ownership group and he's been in contact with Celtics management and Brad Stevens for months letting them know yeah I'm not going anywhere\nNo I mean I'm definitely and it's been so transparent that it's almost weird\nMake a big deal of it you\nKnow if you go somewhere don't tell anybody until the last minute I get to this big God\nGrand entrance and this big grand announcement and Kyrie Irving I think looked at that and was so annoyed with it when he played with him and he said I'm not\nDoing it like that F. that I'm not doing it\nI'm going to be honest about it I'm gonna let you know exactly what I think\nThere is not going to be any hidden messages there's not going to be any passive aggressive tweets or Instagram posed\nThis is what it is this is what my plan is I'm\nGoing to learn from how he did it the wrong way and that's where I'm going to attack this off season\nAnd that's where I'm going to attack being a free agent and I actually think it's kind of a a refreshing\nWith all the drama and all the blow Harding\nIs in the NBA I think it's refreshing that he is taking this approach a Jonah stocks here Fox Sports radio ah well let's you know we are brought to buy discover card become a new card number and discover card will match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more I discovered dot com slash match limitations apply\nA I was thinking about this as we get back into the NFL I promise that'll that'll probably never happen again that we actually touch on a little bit of MBA and the NFL our I just thought it was interesting so ah ... it's not upset you\nI'm not apologizing but ah the Vikings and the jets it is they won eastern time kick off on Fox this game 'cause I'm going to pose a question to you\nIf you remember in the offseason the jets offered Kirk Cousins more guaranteed money than the Vikings did\nKurt cousins took the offer from the Vikings because he felt like they were a better football team and there was a better opportunity to win and he's probably right definitely a better football team definitely a better roster he passed up more guaranteed money and he decided I'm innocent\nThe jets were forced to figure out the quarterback spot and so what ended up happening it was a trickle down effect the jets moved up to number three in the draft\nAnd it was some help from the browns who took Baker Mayfield and some help from the giants who took say Guam Barkley\nThe jets ended up getting their top guy at number three which they had no idea what's going to be available to them at the time so they ended up with same Donald\nAnd regardless of what you want to say about Sam Donald or how much you want to hype Baker Mayfield and I'm a big Baker Mayfield fan either in Cleveland did the right thing in that spot if those guys if that brain trust their decided to Baker Mayfield was the best guy for the job they've got a great track record than\nYou go up top ... this is a game where he gets a little more activity down field ... Kamara banged up\nUh you you got some other issues and that is especially no clue Mac for a hundred percent or at least that's what we're told yeah again you can't do I got to think that guy's going to watch in that tape their pride got hurt a little bit so they rally in front of the home crowd a but otherwise we're going to go into\nA a little deeper on the the tight end position you know an in joke you against Tampa Bay they're given about twelve point to a game to opposing titans opportunity there\nYou go a little bit deeper you got CJ Zuma for Cincinnati going up against Kansas City because people were diving to the wire as usual Rob Gronkowski we have the red tag here's one where it's it's a red alert or that he probably doesn't go\nAll right so my comment on Fox Sports radio fantasy football inside her final one from you and this is where we get our ninja pick of the week and under the radar pick from my Carmen somebody who may be available in some of your leagues\nGive us a quarterback right or there's a lot of there's some by weeks that are starting to pile up for teams and oh Pittsburgh's on a by if you're out there and you're desperate and you need a quarterback who's a play that you kind of like in this spot\nThis week doubled down with Mitch ... look at you you wanna you wanna get a little bit ah getting a little bit loose like I've got to make a decision between him and Drew Brees I don't know that I Want your breeze against\nThe Baltimore Ravens on the road and I I'm I'm I\nAgree a hundred percent or ... uh with New England come into town you certainly got an opportunity there\nIf you lie Manning's ever going to put up a fantasy day it's today against Atlanta the Monday Night football yeah my ... if you're ever going to have an opportunity

I don't care\nCollege pro semi pro women's football you can't win when you throw the ball Seventy three times you have to have some sort of an odd sense of balance and\nThey couldn't get it they couldn't get it passed the red zone they couldn't get into the hands of they were like allergic to the end zone all field goals or whatever it may be they couldn't score and they gave up five hundred and thirty nine yards\nWell and that's the thing is they're not trailing by for touchdowns the entire game you know I get that at the end you got an air it out and you're trailing by a lot of points but that wasn't the storyline the whole game\nAnd when you're down even Twenty one to six if you ever running game that would help balance out your bad defense is keep your bad defense off the field you know\nSo they're not able to run the ball effectively and that hurts them it hurt him big time last night and it could hurt him going forward and you also have to throw out there\nThe loss of Nick both the because that hurts the defense big time as well as he leaves and he's getting ready for the NFL but you know what you can't pin this on him leaving because he wouldn't have been healthy enough to play in the game anyway ...\nAnd I can't imagine that it's just the morale was\nSo we've asked you as a crutch that really is and by the way I have no problem whatsoever with with those is doing\nYou know because every college coach is out for himself they using people they chew 'em up and ship them out so look you know what good for him he's hurt he could come back maybe later in the end maybe possibly get heard again so stay on the sideline get the big bucks in the NFL and you'll probably be in the first five picks of the draft\nIn April so good well I have no problem I've heard people say that he's a he's a he hurt his team is not a team made is I ... hey come and look at the coaches look good coaches do well\nI get it but I see it slightly differently where why don't you go back\nWhy don't you get healthy why don't you train while at Ohio State going to be doing all of those things on your own time now so you could still do it at Ohio State and if Ohio State is out of contention for the college football playoff which they very well may be at the end of the season\nThen you say hey I'm getting ready for the NFL\nBut why not at least give yourself a chance to come back\nIf you're in the college football playoff and before he left we didn't know that they wouldn't be there right so in my line changes right now why would you pull the plug early on and say I am out of here no question that I Would have at least stay there\nAnd trained and gotten healthy and done all the things you've got to do outside of Ohio State\nI Would have just done 'em at Ohio State and if he wanted to go back and play in a couple of ball games\nOkay great I realize it's a risk\nBut we can't blow the risk out of proportion where if you get on the football field what you're doomed well there's a lot of examples miles Garrett was the first overall pick and he went and played in his bowl game\nSo I don't think we can blow out of proportion just how great or how likely a bigtime injury is going to be that's all I'm saying\nYeah and let me put the brakes on that but just a second I mean you make a great point that it can stay at Ohio State and train but I think if he did that he'd have to go to class and a lot of these guys just don't want to\nWhere you can enjoy the huge calling me the gangs up the address back bays with why farm\nHuge while I'm getting a lot of ... is a

com forward slash match limitations apply okay Mr know let's get into it right now I got to ask you this how bad are the one in six hours on a car those Thursday and all that got drilled how many people watched that entire game on Fox I don't think many forty five to ten by the Denver Broncos\nWas ugly man it really is and look it's way way way too early to write off completed Jesus that's right Josh Rosen as a bust\nTheir offensive line is so bad Andy he played badly against the Broncos I'm not going to say it was all the offensive line fault but he's at work\nAnd you got to give him some help you got to give him some protection [laughter] in front of a like a ... it's just a bad situation right now MIke McCoy was fired as the offensive coordinator in steps in Byron left which\nUnless they fixed that often to blind and unless they block a little bit better let me ask you this do you think David Johnson forgot how to rent run the football\nUse in order to all of that is it all the ... the office of light and\nJosh Rogers in love with a total injury because of that he has three I N T tool for ... and the first court he was shot four times I feel bad for the guy really I mean it's the only guy like opt out like that to the wolves I mean it it could do some damage to his psyche it really can I mean I just don't\nI Know how tough these guys are they come across the top but believe me in their chest they're saying or do I have to do this again and I have to get it right but you Jack McCoy oh I I was just going to say real\nQuick Andy is you can start to develop bad habits where instead of keeping your eyes down field as the quarterback you start to look at big men who might be in your face and are about ... you and put you on your back you know so it's like look at Eli Manning right now it Manning's a two time Super Bowl champion\nAnd he's got bad habits of looking at the rush because no one likes getting hit hard by an individual that's much bigger than them you know so that's like a two time Super Bowl champion who is showing bad habits if you're a rookie good luck one that often the blind starts to get better\nGetting rid of those bad habits where you're just looking at the oncoming rush not an easy thing to do\nYou're right and you mentioned my record the authors of coordinator the once off as a quite a former of the Arizona Cardinals he's been fired from three different organizations now this is what caused those head coach Steve we'll have to say about his decision which he made on McCoy on friday take a listen\nI informed them my McCord this morning that I Would be going in a different direction I Want to thank my for everything that he's done\nTo help this organization and his team are trying to move forward seven weeks into the season based on what we were from a standpoint our production office decided a ball I felt the need to make a change and that's what I did and Byron left which will take over the uh play calling a loan officer started a ball\nLook I I could I understand it that someone's going to be the scapegoat why can't the head coach Steve will say we're not getting it done with him he's gone on getting a replacement this different direction garbage I hear that in every walk of life can they stop what they're different\nThe right forward back ... what kind of a statement is that we're going in a different direction I Would have all the time I\nYou're you're changing jobs you know you're you're going in the direction of Byron left which is not going to crush them on the way out they're not going to be like let me tell you what\nIn the history of our fence of coordinators MIke McCoy is on the short list of the all time does I mean let's be ... do you think that Steve will it's going to say that no it's going to say these things that we're just going to go to go in a different direction you know what that means they're switching to Byron left which done that's where they're going\nTo be done on gun oh you ... you don't like that I think it's weak just said look he didn't get the job done we got to move on that's all we got an art we used to live in a different\nDirection with our producer for this this shift\nNo he isn't that we're not going to different already left us we're going to get a different direction\nYeah exactly right I think there are actually going right now is off to London about nine thirty eastern time and again if I'm a season ticket holder of an NFL team\nAnd my team takes that one game to London I'm kind of ... I really am I Want to see ... home games I really do I that's what I paid for and I don't want to have to have one game off the ... going to London england but that's just the way it is the titans of playing the charge is not a bad game today\nAnd believe it or not I have the lines I got the line so they go ... okay everybody charges LA charges given up what mine is six and a half\n... of course it's right look how I Want to their\nHuh yeah I was in line at the what the updated lines they love you and then once you've already like reading the newspaper and going by Tuesday whatever the line was that day I don't know how long we've been doing this show two years right now you're getting ... yeah it's updated yeah what are you got it said that would always\nAlthough I'm not a big wager okay I got to believe there are people out there that listen to us not only for the entertainment value on the information value but for the way during his if for no yeah I I give it out and you tell them if you sent me right\nAll right that's right ... well hey man Andy sometimes sometimes we got to be shamed into doing the right things in life you know your exhibit happens early your parents are like what are you doing come on get it together\nIf that's what I was doing with you for a little bit it was ... ... yeah well yeah but yeah how about this game Andy where you look at Tennessee they allow ... eleven attacks last week to the Baltimore Ravens\nIn a game eleven debt is unheard of you look at the titans they'd do play soft event they give up only Seventeen point eight points per game so can they slow down Philip Rivers and company yeah the question is\nCan they keep up scoring wise\nDepending on how much they slow them down because even if they hit their average against the chargers do you feel comfortable\nThat the titans can scored ... points today [laughter] here's your bottom line about that\nNo here's the bottom line about about the titans what is wrong and walkers Mario to\nI mean he was like everybody is like you know flavor of the month when it came into the league and he's done I mean he's he's he's exploded imploded it's finished I mean really and I don't think that tendency can stop the running game of Melvin Gordon and full of rivers is really having one heck of a season though it's far\nYeah Mario to he's just not very good can you imagine like wheat so people are very critical of jak Prescott\nSo I had to build up the how the very day yeah yeah I don't see how the bears against the dolphins look that decrepit\nAnd then come back to Chicago they're playing the patriots at home and all of a sudden their lights out I think that they still struggle if the dolphins get the better of the bears to the tune that they did last week to that degree I just don't see how the patriots are completely struggling all day today I don't see it\nThe funny thing is they started this\nThe defense really I mean talk about your business and what he's done but the ... where they got those three once in a row and the the violence was way out of kilter last week for whatever the reason I mean if I was shocked I Am and I don't think that's going to happen again today\nWhere's the impressive win for the bears the season\nThey beat the the hawks okay and not have right Arabs Addison hard nosed they won sixteen fourteen they struggle duo win against the cardinals and then they blew the doors off of Tampa Bay\n... a good theme of the of course not you know so I don't see and it's not to say the bears are incapable of beating a good team they just haven't to this point they haven't been impressive where you're like hey man this is the team you got to look out for if you've got ... Mac\nAnd you're going up against the bill bill a check coach team led by Tom Brady is not an easy task today I see the patriots man I don't have a problem laying the small\nYou know I I don't love the small road favorites 'cause oftentimes those are the soccer but I don't see it as being a soccer but today with the patriots\nYeah before we roll on tests more impressed with the bears opening day last a Green Bay by a point than any other wins to be honest with you well well yeah when he was only for the last\nThat way and against Tampa your leg hey bears huh yeah and after ... after the by

lake show last night\nJust all of a sudden fight night broke out\nOver there at staples between the Lakers in the rocket you see that with Ron do and he and Chris Paul base he falls right that's right [laughter] face yeah you know that I can say ... ... face to face I could see a guy's\nAn elbow shoving maybe even ... reading the guy a basketball but to me when you spit and the guys on the street on a gay during the game but on a subway or whatever it may be that is the lowest form\nThey tried to punch them back it was yeah I I couldn't believe it or being in your face you go someone spits\nIn your face [noise] it's a it's an invitation to catch hands like that's the way it is and also when Chris Paul when you put a finger your face ... that's when you get blessed with the hands as well so I can understand why\nBall players were ticked off the one thing I don't understand is why Brandon Ingram pushed James Harden and the first place I don't understand that was a complete overreaction\nBut yeah you can be frustrated but you don't go like shoving people and get tossed in the process so it was just melt down by Brandon Ingram\nWell the good news is I mean if people are LeBron haters out there and there are plenty of those uh this takes away from the old one to record the Lakers have at this point in time because they're talking about the fight and the occasion rather than the fact that the Lakers are all went to right the right as it goes so lucky for LeBron in a sense\nWell a little bit yeah but uh it it's going to take them a little while to jail and Andy trust me I don't want to do a whole thing on the Amy Schumer deal and the ... stuff and all that but I just wanted to say this 'cause Sammy K brought this up in Bronx talk\nI all I Want to say is this when she's basically saying white players need Neal or they're complicit and blah blah blah it's like dude I we relieve this stupid\nBecause your point is until you Neil you're not supporting the goal right now are you just ... right now like to think about that and the like how many black players in the NFL\nHave not taken an e does that mean that they're against being treated better in this country of\nWhy does not want to Ask Amy Schumer that question Samy you know if they're not nearly does that mean they're not supportive I may ask some\nQuestion instead of the gods ... questions asked that question and see what she has\nTo say and you don't want to feel that it's like I could care less yeah ... it's such\nAn idiotic take Claritin like unless you Neal you are not supporting the end of racial injustice really right I don't see the logic in that maybe that completely wrong maybe that's what it is\nWell I'll tell you I Am supporting my guy Jim Harbach I liked him how he got a lot of heat and all of a sudden he needed when yesterday\nAgainst Michigan stay here to the game yesterday against Michigan State\nOr the record have one in five that guy's MSU and Ohio State now all the little rings have to do is be Penn State and two weeks\nAnd then November twenty fourth play Ohio State so you know what this opening day last Notre Dame looks better every single week there's no today was undefeated and Jim Hall ball right now laid it on Michigan State yesterday twenty want this seven I'm happy to hear by the way\nIt wasn't a game with a lot of points but it felt like Michigan was in control most of the way this is what it sounded like well Michigan jumped ahead in the third quarter to take a listen\nPatterson football factory pro growth throwing be found the right\nSide\nHave you on that stepping in one will hit a hard time saying Michigan\nWith a touchdown man who it sounded like [laughter]\nI'm by the way though Andy how about this in terms of total yard itch Michigan gave up Ninety four yards to Michigan State Ninety four yards that is great the fence and Michigan state's off since you gain Ninety four yards you could literally gain that\nMichigan State team I Know and they're held to Ninety four years but also in Michigan State\nDid not have a convert any of the twelve third downs they had all day yesterday this is not a good Michigan State team and I I tell you what I'm losing any sleep over it because I think what happened last year with what happened with those players that amazes me that marked Antonio is still there as coach\nDidn't they get rid of the president the president's gone the athletic director is gone but he remains that to me is amazing but that's a story for another day\nYeah yeah it is I just want to hear that final call again Andy from and listen to me again with the wind\n[laughter]\nIt doesn't sound as bad when you isolated it's just when you hear the whole call but I'll say this Andy I don't want to overreact to the other way when it comes to a gym Harbaugh\nAnd what I mean by that is sometimes our opinions are more of a reaction than an opinion\nBecause Jim ... has been getting crushed for losing too many games based on what his contract what he earns all of these things he just hasn't had the success there at at Michigan he hasn't fared well against Ohio State we know that he's had a couple of big losses against Michigan State yadda yadda\nSo I don't want to then all of a sudden with Jim Harbaugh rattling off seven straight wins and writing the ship I don't want to make it sound like\nLikud Jim harbor this is what Jim Harbaugh was paid to do he's supposed to take down teams like Michigan State so I don't think that we should go above and beyond that just because some of the critics have gone above and beyond\nNailing him when they have in fair to well you know what I'm saying\nSaid something very interesting because I pick up on every word you say because it's worth listening to that's why God gave me two years and one mouth because I listen you said that he's getting a lot of heat yes he is because of the money he's been paid in the contract he has I agreed to\nMaking less money will not get that heat I disagree I think Michigan has that history of football and they're supposed to be Michigan State which is an arch rival of theirs so it doesn't make a difference how much money he's making maybe even more money well if you make a lot more money look look at they we talk about that with the group situation ... absolutely right I mean\nBut he's not getting the heat that harp on his getting because he hasn't been there's oh I I don't ...\nAnd you think that Steve Wilkes with the Arizona Cardinals is getting the same amount of heat is John Bruton\nKnowing that it was such a bad team without going in there will be a bad team\nTo Arizona has a worst record already there one in six words fell ... okay how about the forty niners Kyle Shanahan getting a ton of heat right now I Know that Jimmy ... down over the past yeah it is because they get a vast you know as well as I Do\nThe main reason that John Bruton is getting as much heat

[laughter]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nJust about a minute this is Sunday\nAnd in Fifteen minutes you could say fifty percent of moral courage Joe's Big idea like that were roller right now Panthers eagles today or any of those playoff found perhaps oil relay are we're going to last living in Memphis\nTennessee last of the Redskins twenty three Seventy the eagles beat the giants beat him up badly thirty four team at both these teams beat the giants and I got the line for you right now are you ready\nCarolina Philadelphia Philadelphia given up five minus five yeah\nAnd you know what's funny is everybody freaked out about it and the eagles team the defending\nSuper Bowl champs collaborating the terrible giants who cares that's what they're supposed to do like we were just talking about ...\nNot throwing rose petals at his feet for beating Michigan State which is what he's supposed to do why would we throw rose petals at the feet of Carson went Doug Peterson and company but the eagles shellacking that terrible giants last week why\nBecause then you add to that went Andy that's what fans do in Philadelphia that's the way I look if you get a a fan in Philadelphia after winning the super bowl to eat a horse manure they'll do anything and I saw that on TV right\nThey were going crazy after the super bowl so that's what fans do and that's a lot of sports great in a sense in a sense it does\nThey smack around the Panthers today which I don't think they smack 'em around maybe they win this game but if they were to win by three touchdowns that's something you point to and say hey\nAll of a sudden Philly they look like they've rated the ship that would make more sense to me than what they did last week against the giants team come I Know it's uh divisional opponent I get all of that but to beat up the giants and to get the better of their offensive line\nCompletely that the eagles have figured it out because they smacked around the giant last week if they do it today that's going to make a big difference\nI tell you when I couldn't agree more because everybody's beating up on the giants was not a big accomplishment but at least they won and that's a step in the right direction for the eagles but last week Cam Newton was I guess you could say he's someone on fire was twenty seven forty two hundred and Seventy five yards two touchdowns he rushed to forty three yards\nBut here's the the funny thing if you look past the initial stats of twenty seventh of forty two Seventy five he only had six point eight yards per pass attempt so basically what they do how do they get back to the playoffs I mean the eagles I don't know but as far as the Panthers a concern as McCaffrey and that's their office right now\nAnd they run the ball maybe about fifty fifty percent of the time they gotta stop McCaffrey the eagles do and Newton maybe Newton's legs and ... can the eagles do that I think they can at home I really do\nWell I mean look I think it's a little bit more than just that because you get ... back he's a good tied in so he's going to get a handful of targets today\nAnd ... I mean I'm not going to say he's an upper echelon wide receiver but he is at least capable right he's a police can make some noise on any given Sunday so I think it's more than just Cam Newton and Christian McCaffrey granted those guys are the bulk of the ... I don't think it's the entire often\nBut you go against the number two rushing defense in football that's what's Philly has they give up about eighty yards per game\nSo if they're able to slow down a Carolina off ants that average is five yards per Kerry and put it all in the hands of Cam Newton that's going to be tough if you make any off one dimensional with Phillies pass rush\nAnd that theme is throwing the ball and that's the only way they can gain yards man that's a tough tough team to beat in the eagles have one third in the past Fifteen at home as well you know and\nThere should be a low scoring game for some reason maybe I just with the defense on the on the rushing side of the ball with Philadelphia and maybe weather conditions which I don't know right now but I Know on the east coast is kinda damp\nAnd it could be wet so I I think they're not going to pass the ball as much as they would so I don't think that over on the line I think it's going to be white on to that I really do I think it'd be a low scoring game\nYou might be right might be it's tricky when you get forty five\nYou start thinking about it it's a twenty four Twenty one ball game you know right that's not high scoring so in today's NFL if you're trying to get under forty five you don't have to have a team scored like thirty eight points to have a chance\nForty five is relatively right in the middle in terms of an NFL total so we'll see that Philly off then they looked a lot better last week against the giants and again\nIt was the giants so I Want to see what they do against the Carolina Panthers today because that Carolina Panthers defense they can make you one dimensional as well when they slow down you're running game\nSo we'll see if Carson when who seems to be regaining his his foreign from last year if he keeps going in that direction that's not an easy often to slow down either even though it's musical running backs at this point\nGoing to quote the great Brian no because I remember a lot of the things you say most of the things they do say this is a tremendous gain more so for the eagles and the Panthers should they lose today\nThey didn't do what you will always tell me a lot of teams do they get real tight yeah real type because there'll be three and four and then they'll be looking like they have to when they have to win and and an end to the press will be on ... the pressure that they receive from the media will be unbelievable that\nThat you'll be right that they may not be headed back to the playoffs as a Super Bowl returning team that you know they'll just be out of it now next week they've got a London of all places by jak civil dental by and then it ...\nReally is more so than Carolina they lose today they may have to pack it in I hate to say that and you'll be right they lose today I think it's over well\nYou're right it's a big time game because that's a tough schedule then that was one of the main reasons where I said I don't see them being a playoff team because they're the team everybody's gunning for as the defending champ\nAnd when you're playing that type of schedule that it's not easy to even be a playoff team that's what that's what makes the playoffs the the patriots streak so amazing really is to be on top for as long as they have when everybody in the AFC is gunning for them I mean\nSo I I agree with you\nI think that the lions probably come in after a by I think they probably get a road when I I don't love it I Love the over more than anything more than picking the game I think there's going to be a lot of points scored today I Would take the over forty six and a half I Love taking the over\nIn these games in the heat Andy because you just need the fences we'll look at the bears when they're trying to tackle our Wilson last week\nSo amazing and you saw the Kenyans Reich fumble at the goal line that the bears recovered a keen hit on the sideline big defensive lineman he was doubled over he's just like\nLike stuck into when man it is a way to slow\nDown and [laughter]\nThat was the ... on the sideline it's hard to play a good defense in heat like that so I Would say the over in this one more\nAnyone he mentioned that because we first start\nDiscussing this game you talked about maybe Detroit going from a dome it to the elements of people assume elements his reign when snow or whatever it may be heat but remember also and I got to believe that\nPlayers of players and like Miami has to handle those elements to even though they are the home team they have to play in the heat I mean ... there's going to easier for them because they're they're\nThey're the offensive linemen after playing that as well so we'll see if they will\nSo even if you're used to it it's it's not a walk in the park so yeah that Detroit off an especially think about this past rushing\nIf it passed heavy and you're having great success and you're able to keep Matthew Stafford clean and it's tough to to not we'll if you're constantly trying to rush the pastor or play pass the fence what have you ... it's just really tough to play good defense in the heat\nBrian no Andy for our movie coolest Fox

hello day our three\nThrough it financially from a good to be with you here man as it is every single Sunday\nI got a central question for you but I'm a civil to that's good you're right in terms of the teams you root for what they see off most because let me give you a little back story why I'm asking you this shooting at the minute or so ago was talking with my guy I was Sam\nWho is given a shout out to his Iowa hawk guys you know yes they pitched to shut out yesterday zero points given up and he's happy about it and so I started thinking you know what\nI was Sam is in his early mood when it's hot guys lose which is the way it should be I wrote him mad when Notre Dame loses and I got to thinking what's the one team above all others where you start like kicking objects if they don't win a game or something goes\nWrong you know what I'm kind of beyond that because I'm a bone marrow new ... not to tell you why because I'm from Brooklyn New York and I grew up loving the New York\nKnicks and there was a time when they lose and they they lose constantly so you just your foot orange from kicking and that's the problem now the Yankees lieutenant red socks that\nPissed me off pretty good All right I I don't I don't feel object to the television set any longer but you know it bothers me but I wear it wears off for a while but the funny thing is funny you mentioned that because the other night I'm watching Jimmy Kimmel I Love Jimmy Kimmel he's from Brooklyn born and bred there and he did a show this past week from Brooklyn\nAnd they went out in the street and they spoke to people on the street and what they thought of the red socks beating the Yankees to the world series oh my goodness\nThe F bombs that were out and I thought that I thought like young girls you know maybe in age girls young women professional women the language I mean the day\nThat's a New Yorker that's a sports fan that's loyalty to its best\nPassionate over there and prayed yes it's a good mixture of passion and crazy yeah but you get that I was just curious I didn't know if it was like the red managerial search I didn't know that was\nShot down a cheap shot below my belt that's just shot because I treated that early on today and I tell you why tweeted the reds announced about three or four hours ago that Jim rhythm is out of the running for manager I mean as\nI said it's a story it just came out about three or four hours ago they just announced that Jim rhythm his name has been gone he's finished he's not going to be considered manager for the reds next year and right now that the head I guess the front runner\nIs David Bell so I put that on Twitter stocks jumped all over me you initially before us and now you're taking a shot I Know I Know it's football season and\nI live in that area that's it's big news in Cincinnati you know outside of a twelve mile radius no one cares I get it I Do\nYet you'll still talk about it because you can't help yourself you know hair you care to a fault\nI Do care I'd I'd do kid let let me tell you that bothers me the month of October\nThe month of October if you're a sports fan you gotta\nHated it's hey why because I Love sports but I also believe that sports should have their own lane you got October well everything's ... got an NFL you got to NBA you've gotta NHL you got the world series you got to the college football you got everything here and there must have October\nLast night I really would have loved to lay back\nAnd watch the Dodgers play in that game seven against Milwaukee I had a foot back\nFrom the Kentucky football game that it's banned the bill to Ohio State football game when they got clobbered by Purdue I Can't I Can't deal with it I Can't live like that I think each sport you stay in their own lane\nNo way and the other day ... one of the best times of the year all what's going on\nOr a that's a no that was enough to to keep tabs of everything\nWhile I watch that movie on HBO with uh the plane the plane\nThat was really wanted to do that [laughter] yeah fantasy island\nThat's all I Know my mom used to always\nSay that the layout of laying it a documentary of Hervey the tattoo man Hervey right they did a documentary on him and HBO last night so I was watching that a little bit ... all the TVs are on where\nEverything was on last everybody's rock and roll and plus NBA get his state's really too much for sports and I understand why they operate as a major sports you don't have a problem because there's too much competition within their own field under their own umbrella of sports and I'd go one step further that's why people are more concerned with the actions of the players\nYou know rather than the game itself that Michigan Michigan State game it was all about the incidents during the game but oh they'll bet them that turns people off with the yelling and screaming ... that's the ... right now it's not that game any more\nNo Andy ... people are not turning the game off because of the antics if anything people started watching that Michigan Michigan State game just to see if there is going to be any bad blood bad blood cell we love battle it\nDoes sell but you know what I think it does take away from the game and it just took over a certain percentage of people not\nThe way I like it outside Andy straight from the get off my lawn playbook chapter one is complain about too much good stuff to watch at one time on that thing you know went problem to have\nYou know what the I Love sports and um and it's not a complaint this like it's hard to it's like multitasking in the world is sports it's hard to choose in my heart of hearts what I Want to watch I like Kentucky Vanderbilt and Schnell hit us scored a touchdown to Kentucky to fourteen seven once I watched that on the SEC now we're going to take\nYou know the city ... how we celebrate takes us ...\nDifficult to watch one event in the month of October because there's too many events going on that's all I'm saying\nWell I sports bar it you know I that's how I get down for the early games on Sunday the lovely Christine and I will go to a sports bar and we'll watch the early games and then we'll go back and we'll hang out instead of you know I don't want her to grow roots in the sports bar so\nI've got the Sunday ticket so I'll go back and I'll have all the games on for the afternoon game so I see everything same concept when it comes to like last night\nWe were in here I was doing the show with the firm salaam and all those games were going on I was doing the show while all those games are going on\nYou know it's a great problem to have that all that stuff and I would go flip back and forth between the baseball and the Oregon game I was watching mostly the Oregon game and was checking in on baseball right yes it's no big deal at\nThe same thing with chicken you know I just I I like to watch a game I like to say this is the gambling or what but you can't do it in October there's too many things going on but I I Am a you catch the big\nStuff though in print Taylor what a catch\n... love the catch robbing Christian yell edge which would have been ... probably a double maybe a triple depending on where the ball ended up there\nBut that was a huge catch and then ... Yelp week three run Homer because when you talk about a guy who called the shot and said that they were going to go to the world series and when the world series and then he comes up with the biggest hit of the theories in the NFC and to take the Dodgers to the world series\nAnd the Fox suits they were doing Tiger Woods fifth bombs when LA beat Milwaukee you get the ... the red Sox major market it's a beautiful set up man described\nIt certainly is I'll tell you one game I'm going to watch so today's Vikings to the jets Vikings three two one judge three three jets right now plus three and a half plus three and a half of that jet game today and both teams or on a two game winning streak ...\n\n\n\n\nSri goal mobile we'll see I saw one of those things for you but at the bottom\nLine for

back you've or a dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more discover dot com forward slash\nEastern there she will tell you everything you want to know about the NFL the right now the cowboys at Redskins cowboys three and two of them got onto how about the cowboys right now and Dallas right now is ah I get well Washington is modest one\nWashington's modest one I'm surprised I thought I knew then that I Would yeah surprised where are you a little bit surprised that line\nWell it's changed a lot man because well actually the the Redskins or one point underdogs at this point so the money is really really shifted where the the Redskins were initially favored by two points and all of a sudden they're a one point underdog so lodge the cowboy money\nAnd look we know it's America's Team they're incredibly popular and they just boat race Jacksonville forty seven last week but didn't run a different team on the road they're still looking for their first road when\nAnd I don't know if they're going to get it on the road against the Washington Redskins both teams have been Jekyll and Hyde you don't know which team is going to show up because the good Redskins have been pretty good last week you can down the Carolina Panthers smacking around the Packers but then they've lost at home to the cold so it's hard to figure them out\nAnd the cowboys sometimes they'll look like they did last week sometimes their defense looks fantastic and then other times they're often says so in that but they're just not good enough to score the other team\nWell the Redskins at a pretty good defense I think the key to the risk is right now Ken Adrian Peterson they're running back could eat find some holes in that ... that's the key and I'm surprised agents averaging almost what for forty F you ought to carry which you know at his age with what he's been through a I'm impressed I'm impressed that he's still play it to be honest with rarely\nYeah not bad he's been pretty good up and down this this year and due to some injuries but you think about that cowboys off ants man they're averaging just twelve point three points on the road this season and gaining under three hundred\nYou got to see which team shows up but I'll tell you this Andy the Washington Redskins under J group and they have not handled success very well because over the last three years they are nine in sixteen after winning a ball game how decrepit that record that's this week I had to really do that that\nThat that sense on the road for Dallas I mean it's almost inexcusable when you've got another ... who was second in the league and Russian with five hundred years just yards he has three one hundred yard games himself\nAveraging more than five to carry and\nWhat Dallas needs to do what they should do and they did it after the first couple of games stick the ball in his belly ... running out from the battlefield for catch I mean give him the football because he's ... he is to that team is what Christian McCaffrey is to Carolina given the ball\nYeah and I would also say the same thing about that Prescott because he's lethal running the football and he does a great job of not taking a ton of punishment\nBecause he'll run it and then he'll also slide there's a lot like Russell Wilson he's more like Russell Wilson and let like Cam Newton because Cam Newton is likely going to try to trucking free safety you know what I mean we're jak Prescott he'll get what he can and then he gets out of harm's way so he's not taking a ton of punishment\nSo when he's able to mix the run with the past I think that's when he truly becomes dangerous and that's what you can do man you don't have to be this\nStay in the pocket only stay there and do nothing else type quarterback play to your strength in one of his strengths is running the football and that's when he becomes really really tough to defend his when he crank the running game up\nI mentioned coming into this show me that this was once a great rivalry I'm Talking about the rams and the forty niners ... believe it or not they meet today again the rams or a perfect six to know the forty niners are decrepit one in five\nLook what do you have on that yeah I got it at nine right now but again half point depending on where you look so good but yeah you think about the forty niners it's it's all about pick your poison what do you try to slow down you know\nYou try to slow down Todd girlie make Jared ... you can know Cooper cup today that helps a little bit but\nHe got a lot of weapons over there with the rams and you've got to take some on the way that's the the tough part is look at what the patriots did last week against the chiefs if you hone in on one player or one aspect that they often they have so many weapons over there in case the\nIt's hard to just slow that often down let alone right opposite forget about stopping it slowing it down what do you do against the rams if you're if you're not defensive coordinator you try to slow down side girlie take your chances with Jared guy\nWith you right there try to slow down ... I Will tell you so for us right now in my heart of hearts I think early is going to be the MVP of the league and the fact that the voting today but you look what happened last week the ranch struggled at Denver they went by three twenty three twenty\nAnd the forty niners you know I thought that gave us to be a lopsided game that they lost thirty three thirty a Green Bay and they gave Green Bay everything they want that but you look at the quarterback situation and now they have an excuse because corrupt blows out in San Francisco but CJ best or he's got seven turnovers in his first three starts you can't win football games like that\nThe key is turnovers keep the ball\nHalf possession of the football when you have the football you have an opportunity to score may not be a touchdown but once you get that I read your own area maybe you've got a field goal if you turned up all over your finished you just can't get it done and you're right too many weapons on LA LA is going to go step in and out today but if you look what happened last week\nYou know the forty niners in Green Bay I mean\nSomething's going on in Green Bay and I'm telling you Aaron Rodgers is not a hundred percent he can't be with that team struggling losing an alliance and struggling against the forty niners\nClearly isn't a hundred percent he's still limping around pretty good out there but he's still playing crate foot ball he really is it's not like Aaron Rodgers is throwing two three picks a week and you're like wow this guy's clearly not himself\nHe's not healthy yet he's still basically close to them self in terms of production and it's amazing what he's been doing but they don't have a great defense over there I Wonder if this game lends itself to an overreaction based on last week you know what I mean Andy where\nYou look at the ramp like you said they didn't play one of those vintage rams games on often they granted it out Todd girlie was amazing with over two hundred yards rushing\nBut the the bronco scored late and got the backdoor covers so it looks like it was a close game than it actually was and the forty niners frankly surprised us keeping the game as close as they did against the Packers and having a chance to win it so I think maybe you're thinking of week six heading into weeks seven\nWhere styles make fights and I don't know how the forty niners defense it's going to slow down the rams off and they're going to have to have a lot of flu key weird stuff turned over city for the niners to keep this one close I Believe\n... with your idea and I think it could be a very high scoring game in the sense that they're asked to put up a lot of points when I say high scoring I think the I could really wrong I made that they are under I got us fifty two\nRight and that's the thing Andy is if you're the defensive coordinator if you're weighed Philips game planning for the forty niners what do you do you slow down Matt Brita you make CJ ... beat

Baltimore Ravens in ...\n... and having to go to Kansas City the way they are you know the NFL schedule makers doing or the bangles no favors because that place is going to be rocking and rolling it's going to be all chiefs fans going against them the question is is can they make some hay against what is and I'm not joking when I say the Sandy the worst past defense through six games since\nNineteen forty no team has given up more passing yards two thousand plus than the Kansas City chiefs ... so\nYeah AJ green Tyler boy those guys I mean they could have a field day working to get some we could get some high scoring points but I just in Kansas City\nRight now with the way Patrick homes is playing unless the Bengals defensive line can truly effective if you know Atkins Carlos don't want those guys can have a big game if they don't look for them look for the chiefs to do even more than what the Steelers they're taking advantage of that single secondary\nI Know you're all

just the idea you're getting to see Brady one more time it was one of the bears deepest just before ...

usually means ah the guy gets\nWhat in the box and has never seen again so we'll see how that flows by Gabriel and Michel ... another hot play addition you've got to get an opportunity against the defense that has seven sacks all year long New England not getting pressured you'll have some opportunity during college still flying out of the backfield ... and Alan Robinson quietly\nPutting up a solid Jesus for them as well with Trey Burton he got options you got opportunity you got an over ... as long as the wind is don't take things down on the other side of that\nMatch up you've got Edelman where the bears have struggled against slot receivers but looking\nJosh Gordon as well to try to take the cover ... which are an ankle injury\nYes there were some shady ah dealings in terms of injury report yeah opponent with ... while there last week said it at the time as that game started to unfold and certainly the bears are looking to find a little bit of pride but\nThey still don't have enough to really take ... down so high but opportunities down the field next job he gets an opportunity to be a number one\nCame in and he did a midnight studying like we were back from college

I'm either\nFox all fantasy is to get by discover card we treat you like you\nI'm not sure if you know this but a new Twitter handle was developed has nothing to do with me\nTwitter handle was was started right now ten followers hey so\nHey long road begins with that first everybody dialing up die dial into Twitter account\nAt all it all started because of last week when we should have just got to follow us on Twitter and we will end up answering your fantasy question and what do you know this ended up being born but that Twitter handle\nHas a question PBR flexed he why Hilton or a healthy Mohammed ... knew who will play for the falcons tomorrow against the giants\nUh ... you like the Monday Night matchup you always liked to have some stake in that game maybe have a stake while you're watching the game that I don't I don't ever get it's not a bad move right I'm going to take a while even though I'm Down on\nThe team altogether I'm a little afraid of what we've got in terms of their overall production\nReports out of practice this week he's moving well and want to get him integrated with the new he's your fourth or fifth option\nRight even with devoted frame and now out you've got to have in common you got Ito Smith\nYou got nuclear jokes to look into that illusion first touchdown Ridley Hooper all the way down she knew how many targets you again if Hilton yeah they're they're finally clearing Hilton that would indicate to me they want to give them a full load which means he's coming back and he's going to see eight to ten to ... targets at a minimum\nAnd by the way the giants are into defensively to cover the falcons first for options just so you know that's not going to have their you know [laughter]\nSo it's probably best to go with the way home today against the bills and what I think is an intriguing match up even though it's bills colds and we'll dive into that and it's like well let's get the titans chargers did it start sure no Melvin Gordon for LA today going to sit out because of a hamstring injury obviously with the body and we ate\nIt allows the votes to give him a little bit more time to rest you mentioned Austin Ecuador Justin Jackson Jackson a possible daily fantasy\nKeenan Allen who's still having a difficult time finding the end zone how does that Gordon injury effect the boats today against the\nTitle I think you'll go to the shore passing him so ... as a PBR option I think that's where his true value is going to be obviously you can't replace\nThe production of Melvin Gordon one to one but it just started to put it split down maybe you see a couple of more targets ranch audio gates or virtual green maybe the tight end gets involved a little bit more and I I Would think\nYou'd see them take a couple of more shots down field early so maybe Williams is is where you might be looking at\nTo get yourself a little bit of run a turnaround Williams that is Mike Williams are also in the mix as a number four but\nYou're you're trying to see exactly how to how to push but ... defense has been up to the task and that and that's the hard thing is that something always gives in these London games something strange a little little often and Gordon's injury certainly opens the door for that\nYeah it does throw in a different factor because you never know how to travel is you don't know about field conditions is just it's it's much more different than just a Homer road game if you will and the titans over the last couple of weeks have been bad at both home and on the road considering their last of the bills\nGranted they were Nick Williams touchdown catch away from winning that game but still you only see only score what twelve points in that game then you end up going home and getting blamed by the Baltimore Ravens like Baltimore's a good team I'm not sure if they're a great team but defensively\nThe titans aren't doing anything and Mike this is the titans team that many of us still remember from a playoff win against the chief last year and then going to New England for the divisional playoff game\nBut as you mentioned Mike rebels there and Mike malarkey and and his staff are gone so now you've got a new office to feel there's no exotic smash mouth anymore Derek Henry and beyond Louis are\nOne of the better off its winds and the national football league they haven't been getting it done and the internal markets Mario is going to finish the game the way he's been thing up\nBy you look at ten sat or eleven ... yeah it it was a veritable turnstile and Baltimore as I thought before the season they they could be good\nTo great still not sure whether the rat on that\nPart of our time continuum but you've got it off and that's explosive won't get into to Flaco and all those guys are a bit but with Marquez Mario to\nThis week because it's the spotlight game in London finally getting I think the the criticism that deserve from the river regression obviously you have injury issues that kind of mixed in with the office of line as you said it's been terrible the running back position is isn't an absolute travesty get Derrick Henry's\nA shell of his yeah herself and that's not the off and said why that's he's been poor or in terms of hitting holes and getting any kind of traction Lewis hasn't really even been a factor in the passing game like you would have ... to ... David the big break out in one big game\nThat got everybody excited and I think the early returns from Tennessee there were playing good defense is the first couple of weeks come up with a couple of big stops and and you start getting a little momentum and especially with huge didn't struggling as they were\nThat or they may they might have a lot of words was there might be good enough to slug it out juror factor and then you wait by week we're watching them\nAnd and I don't I don't think there's any part of that team that you pull aside and say I like this the numbers may say certain things but in in terms of what do I want from this man and losing Delaney Walker before the season let's not let's make no mistake about that your number one time yeah yeah I mean you lost your number one before you even got started\nThe the the fact is is that they've had the ... the crazy season because it was that seven hour game against the dolphin yeah it was delayed and in in walkers services injure there then you end up in in the ...\nEagles have now gotten on the right track you expected maybe some some growing pains when Carson once returned and I think you got that you don't know how great that when was against the eagles or maybe it was more about the eagles and about the titans but the titans to me or just the team that I just can't trust and\nThat goes back to Mario to\nOnly because of his plate but just because of the the health situation it's it's my biggest question that you've got what the titans and bolts were about to to kick off Mike Williams by the way of the chargers\nOne of those big things in terms of the development in a year to you wouldn't expect that so fast most guys are still talking the ball and taken off after that first or second read\nThe patriots and bears will play in Chicago might told us that to get into the game you may have to spend almost four hundred dollars a ticket yeah money to see this week seven showdown but if you pay that much you're not going to see Rob Gronkowski\nPatriots ruled out one of the first time ever that I've heard\nPlayer didn't make trip not yet ruled out about what that that was the situation with the ... like he's going to find his own way to Chicago you just take a bus take the grey hound ah maybe catch connector planes trains and automobiles the rule you know certainly I'm sure there's tons of direct flights between Logan at O'Hare that you could hit but Rodriguez's figure it out\nFor being the patriots aren't going to have Rob Gronkowski today against the bears we saw the patriots come away with that when a Sunday night but they'll face a little bit more of a resistance if you will who will Mac expected to play despite that ankle injury\nWill not have Ninety degree temperatures are to where you're wilting and the second half\nA Mac gonna play in some capacity would expect the better pass rush year we know the New England often said wind has its issues I mean Tom Brady getting the ball fast more Edelman more James White out of the backfield Sony Michel still on a back in number one looking in that tend to twelve range\nI got injured either on the injury list every week or as well but it's been fantastic for them so you're you're looking at getting all your options in and Josh quarterback and number two are high and number three depending on how you want to look at it\nAs you go a little bit deeper or for the bears\nIt's looking at ... go and becoming a much bigger player for them and I think we'll see more of that this week against the patriots that that they have much of a pass rush but again trying to get that speed element going and trying to get that pacing\nA battle of the best in Baltimore how about those bees for you seem to ravens going to go at it will break down that match up as often in defense go at dead two of the top and the national football league plush will also check in with this showdown in the bay\nTampa Bay so more be used for the

good one between the browns and buccaneers in Tampa\nSmacks of one that should open up quite a bit we're looking at it over under of about fifty three as we said here early on a Sunday Morning and and watching the hey do as I say not as I Do because you have to hit a bit sometimes Dan in your life when you're talking about fantasy a lot of\nUh Cleveland Jarvis Landry is a top ten play\nOr you're going up against that bad Tampa Bay secondary we look at in joke in one of the guys we outlined in the hot plays\nA earlier in the show that you definitely want to take a look at as you roll through a Callaway is more IDF ask play if you're going to go deep\nBaker may feeling good valuation there as well\nUh but for Tampa you've got your options on the other side of Cleveland for all the early accolades the numbers have a balanced out and you've seen some words a and that defense some place that can be made down field so looking for Winston looking for a little bit of Godwin who's been a touchdown machine for them and us far\nUh and my Gavin makes sure he gets his where you have trouble is trying to figure out whether you could pick a running back whether painting barber Ronald Jones\nFlex worthy for barber but not much more than that\nThe trade of Carlos tried to Jacksonville earlier this week it does open the door for Nick Chubb as you said the job was another one of your hot place for this week\nHe complained a couple of weeks ago it seems like maybe the bronze we'll get him the ball a little bit more but maybe out of necessity as you said with with really Jarvis Landry Antonio Calloway being the really only healthy guys that you could\nI guess he got what do you wish for early in the seat and uh before they made some boos there was talk of him switching fulltime wide receiver Nick Chubb I mean he jak has been telling us he's going to get us more next job and and do Johnson in for a while so I don't know how long these ... potential trade of Carlos Hyde and been in the work and maybe he was letting the get out of the bag\nBefore it actually came to fruition because I had imagined a guy of Carl is that even though he's only averaging three point four yards for Kerry and that's one of the things kind of take\nFrom this as you get excited about Nick shoves opportunity because you've seen a couple of big hits\nHe's only touch the ball three or fewer times yeah game so you know you got some outlier being runs that are out there\nBut enough to where you know he'll become the guy but given the proficiency of opposing running back to the passing game against Tampa Bay do Johnson cannot be an underrated and all he he's a guy that I think if you're going into the daily league or as the valuation on him was remarkably low this week\nThis is hard knocks bowl the match up between the two most recently appeared on hard knocks and when you watched hard knocks this year with the Cleveland Browns yeah there was a lot of ... Taylor while he was benched a there was a judge Gordon storyline ...\nUh he's now in New England or Carlos Hyde park and\nThere's this Brown's ... let's get the veterans in the same few Jackson's job\nThat planning went out the window and see who won the game with Baker may feel hey let's get the young guys going and that's where Cleveland is is they faced the buccaneers today who by the way I think Mike gyms Winston didn't show any rushed granted it was against the falcons defense last week and he didn't get a little looking at blow out a ... at the hands of the bears a couple of weeks ago\nBut his fantasy potential ... eyes it's it's through the roof with the questions that they have it the ... the running back position and with the weapons that they have in the receiving corps I like James Winston today\nPaul but ... again you're looking at tight end options you might be able to find great on the waiver wire depending on how deep purely is so maybe you take a look see there are but remember ... last year\nHad seven games of at least two hundred and Ninety nine yards passing now again going going back to the Philip Rivers a commentary earlier about how many times the rate it inside the top ten despite the guardian ...\nThat we it's a pinball machine leave right now you know even a good day as much as we can endorse somebody may rank them fifteenth\nRight two fifty into scores is nothing and they are with\nThe the kind of numbers that we're seeing on having game by game bases\nHis bodyguard but I'm Dan ... Fox football fantasy somebody alive for the guy go Fox Sports radio studios you always listen to the show on the radio I been serious ex um channel eighty three and you can find this on Twitter just like jeep and John has done\nHe started to follow wash and so his fantasy question will be answered I'm at the end by or on Fox Mike they can get us by mail read swollen do he's got a Robert words Julian Edelman Jarvis Landry or\nWas John McCoy at flecks in a ... so you've got\nThree receivers or the bills running back for a flex play today\nOh he's dangerous to start thinking about bill's I'm running back even though ... shady McCoy finally had himself a little bit of a game I'm going to look at\nA first of woods is going to be your number one Landry number two at all and number three 'cause I think Tom radio distribute and feed more miles but uh that's the way I Would rank those three but I shady McCoy based on touch is going up against Indianapolis I'm intrigued\nBut he's not he's not setting the needle and and setting the bar terribly high\nEnough I favor your tweet by the way that means we've answered it on the earth you know the answer just go to I didn't subscribe to Fox Sports radio weekends download the show is\nEspecially when it comes to fantasy no ... no raiders today so you may be looking to build some gaps my comments here to give you the answer but the guy that you got to get into your wind up in week seven\nLA wow there is a big voice uh what do you live and and going against Atlanta last ditch effort to get him into a line up twenty five point five fantasy points allowed per game\nFive is Atlanta past defense sixteen touched out six picks ... only got you multi touch down games in six this year he's only ... but he has gone over five to Fifteen by trade so they're at least winging it out a little bit opportunity year sterling shepherd\nYou look at the Atlanta defense giving up a hundred and ten yards the game ... opportunity there for a little deeper way for a bigger may feel we've just talked about it I just want to hunt you in the mouth was one more stat\nPlugs give it up twenty eight when for famous you went to a game to opposing quarterbacks\nThey've allowed sixteen touchdowns with one interception hand picked out turning them over and they don't go to Vegas Kansas City which means we get a little more of Tyler Boyd five multi touch the game for ... and his six\nBut as far the season CJ ... one of your opportunities here as you're trying to replace Rob Gronkowski this morning I took a look they're Michel ... going up against New England they've only got seven ... a year I think Bill Belichick was maybe too much uh you know the upper\nComplements here and that's just central I like it that he's got a been abused with his praise and what they're doing\nDid you see the Kansas City often shown some similarities or maybe they were able to type things up over the week so I'm a little afraid would bills to too much about it the law but still you got to take your opportunities for table Gabriel another guy that you want to get in your back to back a hundred yards games second most targets on the team and big\nWhite threat if the judge said that touchdown route\nGold\nWho are you and what are you doing these numbers twenty four seven three sixty five\nWere that trusted voice it makes you smarter feels like college or if you've ever met when you're wrong so tell your friends\nYou know why don't we listen to the right here in Fox Sports radio this\nFox Sports radio [noise] something about that sports

comment I'm damn by our weather is not going to play a factor anywhere in the national football league today except maybe in Philadelphia could be a little soggy\nThere was rain earlier today breezy Tamms maybe I'm a high forties Panthers an eagles playing today and Mike this is the game that I was pointing to now the eagles\nMaybe the best team in the end of the east and the Panthers challenging for the NFC shelf match you up but in a game where could have playoff in that could have playoff implications in the playoff picture I'm not seeing\nTons of fantasy love\nFrom this game this by the marquee matchup that it is\nWe're going to take McCaffrey will take him as a high end number two Cam Newton back a number one not looking for a monster a performance is really good teams are pretty similar in terms of what they do middle of the pack\nAgainst opposing quarterbacks for fantasy purposes so we'll we'll put Carson went in that same vein starting to pick things up and obviously the report without a Jeffrey ... hertz\nAnd number two what you're you're not going in that with you on a confidence by uh this one could be sitting at about a forty five over under a I think I'm gonna take the ... just the God of why having watched these teams each week\nI expect Philadelphia to try to get that running game going by the way last year when they play Christian McCaffrey has kept in check on the ground was it was in the workforce back that he was this year had just ate yards rushing last year but was receiving threatening Ted and catches in their match up for fifty six yards and the score\nAt least up to to watch today where I just don't think you're going to get a lot by the way the titans didn't get a lot they got a field goal against the chargers it's ten six LA over Tennessee nine fifty one to go into halftime\nChargers where at midfield but now Tennessee has forced upon will keep you up to date\nOn that match our point Dan yeah how 'bout that shock and awe in sunshine in London wow yeah just well it's the sunshiny or any Garcia bringing [laughter] are you hearing in the positivity there are a team made here at Fox Sports radio last guy was odd\nDevon punches and he in a gray goals and we'll get old send it back in number one again tight end position is just such a muddled mess this year a but Olson with another week of practitioners don't we get

com\nLet's check in on one of the greatest albums there is\nMy comment graders kids from we just in the national football league [noise]\nWe got my own son knew going up against the Tampa Bay buccaneers everybody plays everybody wins a lot of scoring to be done\nStays enhance the cycle by ah here's a play face right going to slip it across the county fair\nTo the field in a full time basis camera in great I like my chances\nWriter looks up your\nFavorite bar signed last fall\nA bucket ... Dr\nAndrew Luck against the jet back to back top five ban is the opportunities for him put for gesture Rogers he's on the board or you as a back and number two wide receiver\nBreathe receivers go left brand new walk out of the gun is going to feel\nThat you have to ride the\nPile on is the end yes touchdown touchdown Chester Rogers Seventeen yard strike from Andrew Luck\nThere was so much information great information that was given an weeks six you could have been I doubled this from my Carmen ... greatest hits album there is a hidden bonus try like here it is look for David more of the ... to make a late today against the raiders there's a ...\nFine man song\nLook at me going out on a limb telling you to play a guy who had two touchdowns the week before but that's what I did Hey David more getting through with the score last\nWeek But Dan here's the thing that anybody know who David\nMoore was that even with this huge ... that is true that he had three ... thirty eight yards with through scores that's enough to put 'em on my watch list sure most people\nAnd it's like oh who's this guy but given the Seahawks than where they'd been ... doing there I mean we're taxi back and forth right Dennis you you and I a writer or executive producer and kind of going back like hey that was just going there was a guy we met you and then more scores like there is a we got her ... or done there was a game of him\nLittle ... left a much to be desired in that one that was a tough week for ah for some of us in picking games but fantasy was we were picking the right players\nJoined us on Twitter I'm at the end by or on Fox Mike is at swollen dome Chris dealt sweets us and follows us and says he needs to start to running back to the PBR league Nick Chubb do Johnson met Brita Kenyan Drake or to wreak Cohen who do you like out of those do in a PBR league\nI got all the guys that you have to love a little bit but this week shoving and Johnson kind of equal one back ah when it comes down to three Cohen's got to be in your lawn and just based on his workload\nThe touches a and targets that ISI in Jordan our a bystander much at the time even though you had a couple of big runs down in in one possession then they got conservative Dan a weight I'm not going to remove that [laughter] uh [laughter] I got to get Kenya Drake and so we're going to rank these guys uh it was job you're Johnson who is the third one\nIt was job Duke uh Matt Brita\nMemory yes that's right I abbreviated it and then couldn't remember when I started I'm losing my mind a over weeks six\nOr so Greta still banged up always banged up I'm like you got CJ bath or certainly working things in the that all fence not much expected in in this game over all from the the forty niners they're going to get boat race but that means opportunity do you want to get to catch a couple of flares out of the backfield\nAnd protests have turned up field or so let's let's rank them let's go chop one going to read it three then we'll get down to a ... of the Drake drinking heavily jump\nBrita uh and then ... fifth PBR league certainly as some respect but the split workload you start to see how that plays\nThe lions go up against Kenya and drink and the dolphins today one o'clock eastern time starting ...\nThe bears had opportunities to close things out last week or they didn't than the dolphins ended up getting a victory and it was a great win for us while our question is can you do it two weeks in a row against the lion seem that does have some firepower out often so you may have to put up points again lions dolphins today in South Florida\nHe had you know it doesn't happen again and again and get some success from drink on the ground you can take a shot down the ... seat garish light so will push him to the side he's no better than a fourth option Albert Wilson last week's hero six foot one fifty five\nDifficult to see that repeating Detroit overall at secondaries been fantastic against outside receivers and coming out of the by others know rope a dope this week as do starting they practice for broadcast while I went back and pulled all the tape and\nShowed all the bad tendencies no matter how much you may love Adam gays you can't take all those things away\nUm but for the Detroit side of things all three of those wide receivers number choose as always a as we go through um Margaret Jones would be the third of them golladay leads the way\nTape for your PBR is is your best option and then carry on Johnson's the guy we like a math you Stafford sitting around between eight and ten on most ranking board that sounds about right some opportunities down field certainly to be had\nThe lions the road team through point favorites in this game against the dolphins Miami by the way remember that Kenyan drink at the fumble at the goal line that could have sealed the victory for Miami a little bit earlier\nSan Francisco forty niners on the short week coming off of the valley of effort against the Green Bay Packers now they get the fish Jared golf in the LA Rams who will be without Cooper cup today short wait for the non us but at least they're home against their division rival\nYeah and again last one\nSomebody else started calling players did they have like a contest winner [laughter] ... hour drive yeah ball\nHits maybe six they ah somebody had won a contest\nLike guy winning on his you know Madden game and you get to call the plays\nFor the rest of the fourth quarter because totally different game that then they called and and played effectively the entire way about third mid number two for me to the scramble ability there are some big place to be at 'cause that's also face it if this is if this script goes to four minutes of fifty two and a half\nOver under rams are scored a bunch points which means that they're putting the ball up suffer daily leagues I'll take him I'll take good when I'll take a stab their um Brita mid number two or as we talked about kid all\nBecomes easy just by the tight end position or even banged up and always has the red questionable tag is always going to be a top five top seven ... for you or for the rams get 'em on get them all over again I'm In no Cooper cup but everybody else lays everybody else gets into your line of\nThe titans and chargers playing in London right now Tennessee dominating in time of possession\nHaving the ball over Eighteen minutes to just eat the chargers now driving in LA territory but it's the chargers up tend to six about two and a half minutes to go until half time in London Marcus Mario to eleven and fourteen so far for a hundred and thirty four yards\nOperational efficiency damned but not being able to finish now we're watching them march up and down the field and then get cute and get it and I don't know maybe a puck Hering in the red zone and it's a Ryan suck up on a day\nTo feel goes the charges got their touched down in the long touchdown pass from Philip Rivers the ... Williams on their first play from scrimmage of this game but again chargers up on the titans ten six about two and a half to go into halftime this is Fox football fantasy he's my comment I'm Dan ... if you want to reach us\nThat have asked for fantasy advice and I can see that they don't follow us so we have an answer their question yeah simple as simple as that I Know it's it's it's it may seem like a lot to ask I just don't think that it is well given the answer just follow us get might get swollen dome I'm at the empire on Fox\nWe also have some random people jumping into the match mentioned declaring themselves experts in January of the world\nDon't listen to them just listen to them because if you want to listen to them you might as well to make your own decisions he's my comment I'm Dan ...

makes pleased with his legs he has to get Carrie he's only got one game over two hundred and fifty yards this year\nWhich is the benchmark for me in this league right now you got to be able to go through an agreement here do any better run the football once that I Would tell you guys about he's five and oh in games where he has at least seven carries they Jason Garrett needs to

I'll tell you who decades the guy who's going to lose to Washington today [laughter] Washington is the best\nSeemingly nobody talks about first of all their next eleven opponents none of them currently have a winning record okay last year they beat the rams in LA and the sea hawks in Seattle\nThen they were decimated with injuries I've never seen an offensive line decimated at thirty six different options of line combinations this year they've already beaten camera and Aaron Rodgers this is a real team was smart veteran quarterback who doesn't make mistakes they've got a nice schedule and I think Washington in Philadelphia\nBy Thanksgiving and beyond are battling neck and neck for the NFC Champion outside and play well and there are there are only the rail this year\nWe are allowed to pass in game and had been in office is in in the past the numbers of beginning with a going up each and every week\nBut whether it's running back ... by committee off is one running back I think the running game as this continues to be relevant relevant these days you can't lose sight of the running backs a segment instance ... Gurley are being the Denver Broncos\n... and then you got James wind a Sony Michel in New England\nWhen they're done with the ... how important he has a quarter back saying you throw the ball for points and then run up to win games or what you're saying when we come a long way to running\nBack position is still relevant in this game and I think we lose sight of that but these guys should get paid the money that they should get back to control the\nClock okay you know I'm looking at a quarterback of a player that I think is the most exciting player to day in the national football like Patrick more homes Kansas City I mean think about what he did last week we know what he's done all season they didn't win the game but he goes into England Tom Brady playing prime time TV again\nThrows for for touchdowns puts up forty points\nThe the big question I have is is there you know they're the facts right now is ready to thirty ... than in a lake\nCan you have a a great player like this and explosive office and down the road to your deepest it good enough to ... to get you in the super bowl\nSparing very does come back and have matches up on ... so that that's a huge edge they gotta go great component I don't know if that'll that'll move and the twenty to thirty is maybe not a recipe for success trust me I speak from experience\nThat nothing coach said\nNo I agree with you ... if they better be able to start because once you get to the playoffs guess what that's where you got to get out of Kansas and where the kids but yeah I\nLook at our early match you up to paint project by State Farm in ...

I really marvel at all the things that he had I Wish I had some of those things and and today when he plays against a team like Baltimore\nThere'll be measuring stick for him I'm sure but he's still say themself we win this game this is the one that will give us the super\nBowl he's got a couple of notes he can pass today five hundred touchdown pass and also the ravens the only team and he's never beaten if he beat them he will be over thirty two teams are matching farm and manning he's actually open for against the ravens the same record that the Redskins against that Prescott they will try to exercise that theme into that and\nThat speaks to Baltimore is what when you think Baltimore anything defense and all he knew some hall of fame tighten wrapping up his final years of GM with ravens how good is he drafted on ... the ... been outstanding for years and this year is no exception particularly in the league where we talked about last week how difficult it is\nBetween Baltimore blitz is more than anyone league and Drew Brees today pre snap is is a big match up\nTo watch how are you know what kinds of match up with Dallas in Washington I think Dallas found out that they're not going to win games without pure dropped back\nPocket passer ... Prescott rush for eighty two yards yeah and you add that to what LA it's gonna rush for they found now the easy passes you know and so in Prescott runs a foot ball against Washington that law open up that passing game like\n... and they're going to need to do that but what ... Prescott do it now it's difficult for the Redskins can record has had trouble\nRush into passer when you have that run path option that's another thing you have to worry about as he get Eli another thing to worry about but Washington defense has not necessarily been up to par to handle the cowboys office\nAnd then on the other side of the ball with Alex Smith he's kind of debt Prescott in a way ... accent is his best friend they need a big play out of Adrian Peterson big game at Adrian Peterson today to give Alex Smith that I've often said he likes to run\nOr going to bring in Jay Z before we do that's a fantastic ... really where I wanted to weigh in with the boys on is is that that was a really good together Glazer who's good with everybody we put him with right now he's was all about trying to tell us who was in and out friday by Geico\nAgree about Tony great piece to show once and for all that short people are just better people\nThank you Tony from the get\nGo into the Chicago

visiting show a soldier field in Chicago Carolina in Philadelphia will get together\nAnd Drew Brees will march on Baltimore Minnesota at the jets all a bit about to start but rich we have to start at the game that already took place\nIn London at first I Need to do a salute myself for setting an alarm at five thirty this morning so I could find out of Melvin Gordon was active or not and then it rolled back over and try to go back to sleep didn't work so it went ahead and go to work out in before the game today they're watching the game super intriguing\nSeconds to go to tie the game but instead of tying the gaming ops to go for two which is kind of something that I feel like a team does late in the season when they're five and nine not when you're tied for first place what did you think\nYou know I'm kind of with you on this one you like I\nI Love the idea to play to win I really do I love that he did it as an office of Lyman when you have faith in your off in the way it appears ... does that makes you feel great about yourself but two consecutive pass please obviously the whole\nBy Hayward and then the uh the the ... to tailor on on the tip by safety uh Anthony Philips but you know these these things happen or you you you make\nThe judgment calls especially as a new coach remember he's a rookie at the head coaching position and so the same way maybe a lake game interception is thrown by a rookie quarterback because he's anxious to get the ball out of his hand to be the the guy who who who brings victory home\nI think ... got caught up in the moment and probably on that long plane ride home back oh\nHe's got to be thinking about that different different ways you know a few different ways you can uh plays you can call and the decision to potentially kick the PAT instead of going for two\nChargers win the game twenty the Nineteen and escape for their even longer plane trip home more on that and just a second Baker Mayfield already on the field for the browns\nTaking on Tampa Bay today we'll see Kurt cousins in the Vikings first\nIn New York against the jets also the patriots aren't going to have the ball first in Chicago in a game that is tremendously compelling\nI cannot wait to watch this one the defense of the bears led by mark against Tom Brady and the patriots and Brady without one of his top wedding uh weapons in Rob Gronkowski today who didn't even make the trip\nKnock on the defensive line he's been struggling with an ankle and it was questionable they said it would play but he might be on a pitch count yeah and they said that he's day to day so I I I Do believe that he's going to be limited and the patriots are orchestrating right now I get out the fences defense look very different against Miami was led by ...\nBears a bears team that led Twenty one ten at one point let it slip all the way away or to overtime victory for Miami and they gave them some chances that taking that came back no doubt and Miami was able to beat him in Miami so ... undefeated at home but we'll see what the bears have for the patriots patriots hopping rolling right now\nToo big place for Sony Michel right out of the gate and they're already into bears territory at the forty four where the first in town and I will say this just in general about defense in the NFL even when you've got a really good one\nOr like the Chicago Bears I feel like there's a cap on that like that's today's NFL you can still be a really good defense and it doesn't mean you're going to hold the patriots under twenty five points are that that's just I don't know how possible that it is anymore\nWell right I mean a lot of teams are averaging ... north of twenty or you know the best teams are averaging close to forty points per game so this is a different looking league these days than other and I'll tell you very intelligent patriots running screens\nThey're trying to neutralize the past rushed they knew that this home environment or ... would bring the defense out and if if you get to Tom Brady or the patriots have a long day ahead of them so they're\nThey're doing the right thing by slowing down this defense making them second guess the blitz or the heavy rush or by running these screens\nI'm Carson once also on the field for the eagles and one of the first place of the game for him he drops the ball and the eagles are looking at third and very long do we already have an atom stealing\nIt is just flat out dominating the NFL right now he is out of one hundred yard gaming every game so far this year and he's on his way earlier where the thirty three yard touchdown pass from Kurt cousins right over the top boom right in the lap touchdowns the when you call them this week possibly the best receiver in the game I think\nHe is look out I'm feeling his ball skills are incredible he has enough speed to make you pay\nAnd that's exactly what they did here that's a one word route it's called go and that's exactly what he did he strike down the far and wide line of her cousins through a perfectly police ball in the end zone feeling had already stacked his corner\nAnd comes down with the first score on the board against the jets they read six nothing right now P. A. T. can make it a seven point despair\nAnd I'm Glad that you said could write remember the days when we were like hey I have enough in here and as I can\nAnymore I bet this extra point is up and good although he just not getting it right there are seven nothing for the Vikings the patriots at first and goal nice cats they're from a Julian Edelman sets it up as a actually they're going to market just shy of the first marker so second down in one\nBut the patriots are inside the tent yard line what do you look for here I Can't tell if that's Michele are white and it's in their brain is going to throw the ball\nOut to be in complete that one broke down because of past protection and that is James White and it's in there now third and one coming up for the\nYeah they went completely on the on this play and the bears they only rushed for it looked like they were setting up another screen here\nUh the the linebacker who had white played them close and man and so Brady had nowhere to go with this ball but yeah red zone screens tough to get off because there's so little space to defend for the defense\nAnd so interesting call there but the second one I I don't think uh I I don't think I hate it I\nThat's at him and he is at the end zone whoever it is\nYeah yeah Julian Edelman and you know now these are the screens that you're running the red zone these are these are the those double wide receiver screens he through to the bunch side Edelman kind of just curling underneath to blockers in front of them and as you can see he had to fight through tackle or is on his way to tell you out here\nAnd he is he's got that great motor after after contact he never stops driving his legs and that's exactly what it took to get into the end zone that was a hard fought five yards for the score\nDoubt so it's an eight yard score but he got hit at the five yard line and then just work this way and meantime there's an injured patriot on the play and not as Chris Hogan\nObviously one of the other receivers for the patriots he's still down there looking at his right leg but the patriots do out of six nothing lean or we're out of the gate underway touchdowns for the parents and for the Vikings I Want to get back to the chargers the chargers zero down\nWhen you live what do you need a pond yes we are getting millions of downloads you see his face\nIs right here with us this is a place you want to work and some will tell you some will protect you well than male or might not tell you everything is All right\nWe're Fox Sports radio\nAds and one\n\nTo find out fast one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com or details caps fan while\n[laughter]\n... three winters we go to Vegas ... biggest covers dot com mark ... joined burger red zone radio here we go\nI'm Sean McCoy\nThat's really an acre injury they're looking at him the building coal store less midway through the first this is Derek Anderson Wang that's right the quarterback position for the males and\nI don't know what else needs to happen with Nathan determine before the\nBut then being when his obvious chance to start because you've got no other options comes up\nYou go find another option off the street and start immediately to avoid mutiny in your own locker room it's like I I I'm not I don't want the guy did not get a paycheck ... y y or Z still on the team if you're not even like your own team won't allow you to play him well why is he there\nYou're making a poor assumption that outside of a trade you're going to be able to find a better quarterback on the street which is it's a difficult thing to go out and find a guy ready to play a media we\nBut Derek ... longtime veteran longtime backup last saw a last scene in the NFL in January of twenty sixteen or so\nWe've got the cabinet and bench gay or where they are like him your city out one theory that season and I I don't because he had a post season\nPlay or to or you know so look here's the deal with Eric Anderson um he actually himself said look this isn't it a great situation we're going to do the best we can\nAnd the faith in Peter minutes Wayne because for obvious reasons that goes on the field he throws more picks been touched down\nAnd it's a problem but I practice apparently he really impresses these options of coaches who has worked with him but when the lights go on something really fates repeat them and so I don't think he's long for this week I think we'll see him in the alliance of American football soon\nAnd you know that's going to be an opportunity for him to battle back in time I don't really want to marry\nYou see the take six last week it was it was the highlight so horrible ... one thing that throw picks sex\nIt's another thing to throw pick six in a tie game with a couple of minutes ago yeah it's a third thing to do that when the guy you're attempting to throw it too was never opened\nThe whole time I was just one of the worst place you'll ever see it as a truly\nTruly looked to me like a panicked\nHarried throw that he had no business making and again that's the difference between a quarterback can Aaron Rodgers or a Tom Brady who when it all matters when its fourth quarter\nThere's twenty seconds left on the clock it says if it's play one from scrimmage at the beginning of the day it doesn't matter to them they got ice water running through their events this is the reason why someplace stickers can do it in some can't reason why you have closures come into the game a and we've got the world series coming here pretty soon\nI mean these guys need to be different\nAnd beat him in just doesn't have that gene it appeared\nThat does not All right someone who does is Carson winds and an interesting third and five coming up to the eagles right now they are in Carolina territory this was a scoreless game\nI'm at right now when she was a little bank that was questionable this week with a back issue he's in there it's a thirty five at the Panthers thirty nine yard line out of a shotgun ... will throw deep down the right sideline looking for Aguilar editors incomplete out of its reach\nOut or is that Jeffrey now that ... I'm All right so onward their goal and I you know I'm looking at this eagles often this year it's interesting they have classes there moments once it's been fine\nAh they're good they're in first place I I Know it's not as dynamic as last year\nBut I Do wonder you know what's our assessment of how this all fence looks\nCarson once posed injury Superbowl last year or like do they look the same there's some there's not a lot missing but there is something that's just not there that was last year\nYou're the patriots you get everybody's best shot every year because you're a Super Bowl contender every year when you beat the patriots in the super bowl you can guarantee every team getting ready to face the eagles go\nOkay they're going to get our best\nThis year there the hunted and I think they're reacting poorly in some of these situations because they don't have that same attitude this team looks like it lacks a little confidence being the favorites in a lot of these games early in the season\nEagles went ahead and did Doug Peterson stuff which is let's just go forward on foreign down and they may allow son Jeffrey with a beautiful do tap\nFor again of about Thirteen yards first down to the twenty five yard line so now the eagles and here goes curriculum at straight up the metal that will be first and goal just inside\nThe ten yard lines actually checked out that's one of those small one so I'll check that there was a flag down but anyway the point being eagles uh have moved into a into scoring territory and along the lines of what we saw from ... in London about one certainly more gutsy than this one\nBut it's the first quarter and here's Doug Peterson going forward on fourth down\nI Wonder if Doug and you could run that off of the jak Del Rio tree from a few years ago\nI feel like gutsy and this is on the rise in the NFL\nWell lack of faith in the kicking game ... young now you're you're on the Carolina Panthers side of the field so you have an opportunity here if you do hand the ball over for them to face a longer field but you're still out by the thirty between the thirty in the forties so\nIt's not that long of a field yeah it's faith in our fence it's maybe lack of the faith in the kicking game\nAnd I'll tell you Doug Peterson a for what this team may lacking confidence they make up for and scheme I think they do some wonderful things offensively that sub run the gated from a penalty by a block or upfront but very much like an anti read or a matinee gee now with the bears\nThey're very dynamic offensively and you see that getting back to the initial line of scrimmage and more on a play where where they needed to\nScreen it was not urge that was the second tight end and that'll get an inside the twenty it was first in ...\nAmong the buccaneers now trailing two to nothing um I haven't got the ball in the browns territorial brown score to ... I mean every way every way like this is such a battle of styles every buccaneers game everybody get thirty bucks get thirty in the other team probably gets forty\nEvery Brown's game is like a throwback like we're going over time and the score is going to be twelve twelve yeah last quarter and so far it's only the first quarter but it has a kind of a browns look to it so far\nThat they liked the mark it up and defensively their fears an offensive leave their low scoring because they still haven't found their identity yet a rookie quarterback\nWho's struggling as teams are getting used to scheming for him and a run game they're leaning on albeit willing enough to trade Carlos Hyde\nAnd give this started responsibility to do Johnson junior now are there have been changes made on the op and so it it it'd be interesting to see how this fence reacts to that so far that we buy too but it's only because ... was able to down Jamieson it or excuse me the running back in his own end zone\nNext job as well who I think is going to get a lot of Ron and has looked good in a limited duty so far this year the this kind of paves the way for him and Carlos Hyde by the way if you're just joining us id activated today for the jaguars so it is still going to be at least for one more week\nThe TJ yelled in show and it's interesting I Am scratching my head a little bit about four net because if he is truly supposed to be\nBack after the by weak and hide was not going to be active today that means they got high for one game\nI mean the jak you're going to London next week the plane the eagles and hide will be active and then they have a by and then for that was going to be back unless something's going on with the ladder for now than we do know about\nYou know there were questions about his health coming out al is huge ships\nHow did it had great health in the NFL yet he hasn't had that that all we're moments so\nMaybe there is something more significant going on with for net or maybe there's something more significant going on off the field that the Jacksonville Jaguars don't want to come public with yet and they're just kicking the tires on hide who we know is very competent both in the run game and the passing game something you absolutely need to be if you're running back in the NFL these days\nAll right uh an even more ... than before as the bucks at a field goal now three to two to three to ... to ... lead the browns or hundreds of added another field goal they now lead in Jacksonville\n... going to go into the end zone is there are there any flags on that because I feel like that play took about Fifteen seconds and a no flags on the field drew Pinsky went all the way right everything was blocked out turn he went about twenty yards backward turned around all the way the other end of the field and walked in the end\nZone so raw be interested in this jets Vikings game gets uh the jets all the way down into the red zone and then Darnell just throws an absolute strike too as tight and again facing man coverage just a great routes throw it over the head of a of an under a linebacker playing close a line of scrimmage\nAnd jets all of a sudden I'll tell you the the quarterback situation in New York if you had to tell me Ryan outlets pauses season and say who would you take manning a two time super\nBowl winning quarterback or Donald Hall thinking Donald know every single day of the week\nNo question at all it's Herndon who gets the touchdown pass Darnell ... I I think of the Fort rookies has been the quickest study and right now I mean there's a lot that goes into that surrounding cast whatnot but this is not a guy that is dealing with any perfect wonderful weapons with the jets or anything like that\nAnd I and there are viable in the scoring points and he looks to the best of the Fort rookies so far All right uh the bears are leading the patriots the lions have just\nAlong with Chris Myers who checks in before the saints ravens game that's coming up on red already I have no knowledge of anything\nTo have some of the [noise]\nThe fleas that makes you rise out of your chair\n[noise]\nThis is why you know what we are in\nFox Sports radio\nOn this episode of the world shorter sitcom by Cassie\nI say it's inside accounts like what's inside my no\n... and you can raise a chicken too large mashed potatoes and or biscuit for and again I\nOr a hundred and twenty dollars that's what really matters is pretty incredible what chicken can teach you about life in any way they rarely\nAt discover we believe anniversary should be a time of celebration not obligation\nThat's why we think annual fees are ridiculous and now just for giving us a try we're going to get new card members a one year anniversary gift they'll never forget at the end of your first year will match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar\nNo caps and they'll catch is because we know if you try us you'll like us and that's worth every penny try it and believe it at discovered dot com slash match cash back match offer only for a new car members limitations apply\nIt in right now and he taught her ... teaches celebrating its ... anniversary of the show it's appreciation they will offer savings like never before has any brand new twenty Eighteen he saw the way forward Lincoln Dodger Chrysler tar this week and getting tires for life is right treated to a brand new carpet reads this week uh never buy a set of tires again don't forget teaches the only ... offers you a three\nDay money back guarantee swing by today or visit them at ... dot com tires for certain conditions why does it tires but I took office before\nYeah you're insured when did you recall you you get a delicious and the white males and donors are wonderful just a white male to all of them are so long that smog you'll also get a dollar or whatever else\nYou get in July first back bays with wind farm\nIn the wrong laser that\nYou're getting at least you which begins a law\nThat was over a hundred dollar value ... miles a day\nBy day five nights a loan or last I guess\nNeed hats\nJackets every other way your logo voided products from little blue versus the company that does the bats jobs green T shirts or the older you know\nThere's a local you know what he was ill designers here about ... companies and the Bloomberg studios today Ninety three by one Seventy nine forty years on line a little liberty odd little bluebird look either\n\n\n\n\nHe didn't gentlemen [noise] basically I mean\nAnd I think it's always difficult to judge rookie quarterback performance but I didn't get near swatting the guy that I think you can make a strong argument for Baker may feel that the best I think you can make a strong argument or Sam ... quarterback so far\nI think they are clearly that's too bad on the world where he quarterback that are flying and starting in the NFL right now Josh Alan\nOn the bills fan not very so and I'm also not sold right now on what I mean from Joshua Rosen does it mean that those guys are going to be bad remember Jared golf was not very good his first year either\nJust that if you're breaking the quarterbacks right now the rookie quarterback Baker Raphael ... haven't been on a different level compared to Joshua Rosen Josh\nAllergies our coverage with ... you want to talk about a way to start your Horning say yeah I mean there are three am but their bags on Fox Sports radio\n... will the iconic blue seven mobile labs lately I was just going to have a house or in your city is the world's GM\nThe [noise] who are like the\nBoston Red Sox for the Los Angeles [noise]\nOut of batteries five\nWorld's theories that coverage is a writer [noise]\nThese Fox Sports radio\n...

belt with how passing players can be defended how quarterbacks can be hit so unless you are they still had a quarterback you are not going to amount\nTo very much in this league because this is now a line of scrimmage game as it always has been you need to have good offensive in defense of lines but it is a passing we all the way and Blake portals just doesn't have enough firepower to play with a lot of these quarterbacks that they're facing\nTo the patriots bears game you are just referencing so now the bears up by ... and the day could not be going worse for the patriots because certainly Michele has been\nTheir child pro football doc on Twitter is a wonderful follow during the games because he's really good at taking video evidence and telling you immediately what likely happened how long it's going to be how serious it as well he said\nI've got video of the ankle and that looks okay he goes what I Can't see from the angles I've got right now is the knee\nAnd the pages just announced it as a knee injury and it's the left knee which is the need that Michele has been dealing with since before the draft even happen\nYeah you know when I talk to people about injuries and ligaments ... there there is this thought process that they work like muscles and there are there there are similarities they're structurally but it's more like think of think of the ligament like a rope\nAnd if a rope spin damaged out all uh and you have that fraying that occurs you know one of those braided ropes\nWell what happens if you put that under tension and then you tweak it at all that ropes more capable breaking them one that hasn't had any prior injury and so a ligament that has been scarred over and heal itself or even surgically repaired\nIs more at risk than that rope oral argument that hasn't so yeah well you can see what happened in the pile up like I said it looked like his lower body was pretty stable wrapping his upper body was being twisted away from his lower body and that can cause a lot of strain on those ligaments and with one with all that scar tissue\nA you know you you hope for the best but you you you consider the worst in those situations\nDoubt about it and it did not look good and he's on a car and all that stuff even after the initial sideline diagnosis sell the patriots are in for a fight and you have to wonder I think I think you're sort of kidding with what you just wrote on Twitter was telling him to show off like\nSomewhere maybe I'll balance taxis agent and I'm thinking okay by the way the patriots Cordell Patterson is going to return the ensuing kick off for a touchdown\nOh that's exactly what the doctor ordered there but\nUm there's no way in hell the Steelers would take a call from the patriots right well I I think if you look at tap\nRoom around the league there's only so many teams who could afford lay beyond bell but if ... willing to play on a one year flier\nAh well I mean for the remainder of this Taylor standing there why would the Steelers patriot yeah ... there's no way there if I may be down taxi my agent but I if I might help yeah hey hey hey the guy in Tampa looks like crap how about the I mean I wouldn't be saying anything but\nThere is no way to see it as you get a call for value uphill climb\nOr do they have the cap space to sign I'm probably not another ... to climate is an ... team or a C team both a leading their divisions or or or have potential lead their divisions Baltimore obviously doing great job in the north right now but yeah you you know you couldn't see that really happening by the way Cornell Paris and\nHe fumbled the kickoff return to give them the bears one of their in suing a scoring drives just moments ago on the last time he touched the ball and so he just had a huge makeup playing this game\nBringing it within three points where is it was starting to stretch out here and look pretty bleak for the patriots losing two of their off into a plane makers in Hogan and Michelle Patterson nice acquisition by the patriots they're using them well\nWell I'll tell you what I Would do if I'm the patriots because you're not get laid the bell but I'm certainly going to watch the situation in Jacksonville we just talked about it earlier if letter for and it gets healthy but just acquired Carlos Hyde he yelled and is there all of a sudden you've got too many running backs a hat and because\nUh the patriots have already lost Burke had a they've already lost Jeremy Hill if they've lost Sony Michel James White is fantastic but that's not in every down\nIf if Michele is out and that's what they are and and maybe misses sometime but either way if he's out for a short time or a long time depending on his knee injury as it's being reported by the patriots currently\nUh yeah you have to make a move to bring in somebody whether that means signing somebody off your practice squad who you trust we don't know what the depth of the roster looks like because we haven't seen some of these players that that they they're stashing on practice squad but then aside from that\nOr sometimes you can work or trade where you get a guy who's a stopgap player or he can come in and do some things where it is not completely uncommon for a guy like Carlos Hyde\nTo get bounced around to a couple of teams rice she another trait of hide when for neck gets healthy that would be ridiculous\nDoes happen that would be amazing if the jags got him there and they're just like you know what\nI Am just kidding nevermind let's move on I mean we'll see we'll see long feel going try in the Philadelphia game and that is no good for on the field though that came from the panther is no good there's a lot of wind going on in Philadelphia today we're watching feel go kicks we saw Jake Eliot already missed one\nThe ball was flying from one poll to the other right once they put it in the air so today's the day where you see any mistakes from Google or Eliot I'm going to give them a path because there was a lot going on in the air right there in that\nGame yeah and that was a forty nine yard at ten so that was a hope and a prayer shot anywhere\nBut in a narrative mean got to the goalpost and like I mean that's how hard the windows ... if\nYou're facing a headwind and you're going from that distance or if the winds swirling in it just happens to kick up in your face when you're about to kick it there's nothing you can do no kicker can can face those conditions and convert but still that gives the eagles an opportunity to take over and they're pretty decent field position\nOr or or no they'll punt\nActually yeah sort of penalty was all on a Carolina John Carolina or a well no if the ...\nRight now what you're insured windshield replacement you get fifty dollars cash doesn't delicious donuts of White Mountain donor two wonderful launches that White Mountain\nWhere you can enjoy the game is um the first back bays with wind farm\nOn all day we read for a dog that we understand your in your pocket or at least as long ago I was in love with ... is\nThat overall one hundred dollar value mountain glasses day\nGo by the stakes madman says is now the last ...\n[noise]\nThe sun's diamond backs and cardinals here I jog when I was six point seven [laughter]\n\n\nGreat great where the money you know like I cannot comedy I mean there are some that are more and more on the car is All right All right they raised it to happen in the early ... gossiping egos over the ... in Miami I wouldn't want\nTo touch down as the destroyed again I mean it's been over the dog and a half in Jacksonville the jags though I'm not a score points\nOut there for is used in and I'm working at that okay you just gave up a Dr Carlos Hyde for and that is you're not performing like your thought it was ... a former like you thought\nYou explain\nCandidate for a bunch of moves because if they really want to go for it it's clear that they need to make some\nAlso like moves tend to happen in bunches like you notice when a general managers given the okay whether it be from a up top words or just just you know decides to start switching things up they trade for hide\nMaybe they see if they can work something out um but yeah is it going to be you lie in a in a ... of course you know form this season that would be ridiculous ... been out of it actually after they uh they gave ... contract they extended them\nOr you know there was faith in in what\nThey saw member though it was a deal they can get out of after one year job it's a deal that they can get out of after one year or so if they feel like they're going to do that next year anyway might be ready to move on I mean I had this conversation with Bucky Brooks yesterday about the raiders\nPeople think oh gosh you know they're they're stuck there are car um you know big extension and he's like they actually\nCan get out of that deal with minimal damage by cutting him in the off season\nAnd if they come to the decision that they're going to do that then why wouldn't you\nCall around ... right now and and you know back to the point is it going to be the giants maybe not because who's behind them they got that kid law lead a a I couldn't even tell you any other quarterbacks in the room so you look at it it would take oh willing seller you have to find any willing to part with a commodity\nDerek car to the giants have many vitamins jak [laughter] AJ Medicare and gets the job in Oakland why why did they somebody knew something right it they trade for ...\nThis was the weirdest deal and it went under the radar because you remember it was the same day as the march ... Brian story Mm it was the same day\nAnd it was right in the midst of all the Cleveland back stuff too and the raiders trade ...\nAnd I'm thinking bills why did you do that or I mean we don't even know what Josh Allen's do and yet we've seen Nathan feed 'em and a little bit we don't like it right why did you get rid of aging McCarron and boy wouldn't they loved to have him right now\nYou know it's bizarre about that too is McCarron apparently al played everybody throughout the pre season and so I yeah I'm I'm confused by the bills in general right now ... sermon is going to be allowed a certain amount of rope here\nAnd ah the Carolina Panthers old GM is up there now I'm forgetting his name but they're they're gonna they're gonna have some some time to work through some things but not much I mean if this gets off the rails as bad as it\nForecasting to be this season or ... you know now bringing a quarterback in off the street and putting them in and starting him in a week and a half the time I it could it could get really ugly for the bills and it wouldn't be shocked completely if all of a sudden more changes are made at the top of this organization\nOkay did not take long for the patriots to get back in front this time Tom Brady to James White touchdown patriots Twenty one they're Seventeen just under four minutes to go until halftime show plenty of time for more fireworks where we're thinking this one would be a good game it is\nYeah no the browns or excuse me the bears a talented team great at home too and I was so far this season\nPatriots have struggled on the road they lost the Jacksonville and they lost another game on the road their own two on the seas and looking for their first away victory here and so the fact that they had the lead going in at half time potentially although they're kicking away to the bears are up at very high powered off and\nUh that would be a huge boon for them yeah this game as an under delivered at all what we have seen though is more attrition to this Patriots' offense will just added Julian Edelman book wrong then ensued up he has a back injury he stayed home and Fox bureau and Chris Hogan is down and all of a study of ...\nWhat is this team look like on the other side of that big thirty\nAre trying to get more Sony Michel information um I can pass along this remember I referenced pro football doc earlier saying the ankle is fine it's the me\nUm he has just read it I cannot make a clear conclusion on limited video but this is not an ACL\nAlone nodded ACL not expecting a season ending injury I Do worry for ... tear on an already degenerative left knee\nYeah yeah again I Would say this is good do yeah yeah I mean if it's not he said the ankles\nClearing is not an ACL so yeah you know it doesn't mean you're not looking at a multi week injury but uh you might not be and uh and it sounds like the patriots at least based on this might have some Sony Michel still have this year\nWho and speaking of injuries we have a a Tampa Bay buccaneers player who's down on the field a member of their defense\nOr ... and it was one of those deals where everybody looked like was taking a knee and prayer as a as the training staff was tending to him I we don't have a number on this yet but that looked like a scary deal the whole game stop\nYeah yeah he's up and walk into a yeah hold on here right\nIn the share and this was number fifty eight or hit right in the shin and it's still limping a little bit but now during this Alexander and he's doing it on on his own power or this one this way and that kind of had a little shade of Jerry Maguire in it were like ... down on the ground for about twenty minutes and then all of a sudden\nThey got up and it's like no I've got I've got just walked off the field actually when when that happens\nIt's like a head injury that bringing out the back right word but yeah you popped on his feet and he walked off the field so that's good news but yeah I I not great news for New England\nPro football dark or David Chow we trust this guy because we've got all this Twitter feed we have them on the show bunch and he seems to be accurate most of the time again limited video\nPoor angles to make a fool determination but if he says that this doesn't look like a season ender I'll take that as a as a voter support that that ... shall return to action at some point\nWell you've had let's pass along he's not just a a dock on Twitter this is the former team doctor ... of the than I should still be a San Diego chargers and this is a guy who's got a pedigree he's been on the sidelines he's done this you understand what's going on\nAnd so ah so at least in a moment and then the vacuum there is a wee bit of good news or potential light at the end of the tunnel\nFor Sony Michel so I won't drop him yet\nOn your on the line from my parents in the world was wondering whether or not Willard remaking well I'm Glad I I mean\nLook this is what this is all about I was actually going to ask you when you stop to talk about that buccaneer injury I'm like well that's a defensive player that doesn't that doesn't resonate with everybody\nNobody nobody seems to be there anymore if had defender goes down they're like Oh thank you so down these I'm ready to say oh it's the feds okay never mind value and you know what my friends who will stick to start about

Taylor went down like rounds against energized which yeah energy switch it's a it's a different game plan for each quarterback and every quarter back in approach dial up and leave springs a little bit of a different dynamic in certain places or rule\nOn there in Jacksonville lions extend their lead on the dolphins twenty six to fourteen as Matt Stafford for the second time today\nHits little used tight and Michael Roberts has got to touch down catches on the day just three cats just for the day or two of them going for touchdowns and alliance laid the dolphins twenty six fourteen Kenyan dre went along fifty four yard touchdown run for the dolphins\nIn that game to try to keep it close and now ... while on company have the ball again\nFor the dolphins also the Vikings right now in the red zone second intent from the eleven yard line and there goes your guile uh TVS Murray right up the got into the end zone touchdown Vikings and this is going to be now a to score a lead for Minnesota\nYeah leukemias Murray again underrated back he uh he was out of Oakland on that year that they had a ton of success behind a pro bowl offensive line in the Vikings have a pretty good our fence of line here\nIn Minnesota as well this is just a weak side run and the Vikings are friends of mine did all the work he wasn't touched until they reached the defensive secondaries so from about Fifteen yards out\nNot as easy as it gets for a running back to navigate it inside zone run and so yeah well I'm a fan of twenty five I give all the credit to the big ugly up front against gangrene [laughter]\nExtra points for the Vikings is good Seventeen to seven they lead at New York eight Fifteen to go in the third quarter a big catch for Chris Hogan who is back in the game\nFlag down though so we'll check that but for the moment takes just a just across the fifty into bears territory\nA while the patriots are now some are trailing again in this game twenty four and a Twenty one of the games have been back and forth\nDuring this game the spotlight it a couple of the time how cold we'll Mac is operating against is Patriot's occupants of one he has in fact it as much as they normally does\nFifteen yards at the end of this play as the taco was made yeah\nCall that is a good call got the side of Hogan space about the left side of his helmet twisted them down to the ground luckily he seems to be all good there but yeah that's going to bring the ball down a close up he'll go range already for knowing\nIt's amazing how much coal we'll Mac being traded to the bears defense already means that his team they looked like a completely different defense without him healthy\nWell they're also facing Tom Brady\nShow last week against the dolphins jerked as soon as she was it on the field that you could you could tell the difference\nThere is no threat of that advanced passed rush I feel similarly about the chargers losing Joey boats or early in the year they've been able to supplant some of the pressure by getting more exotic with their blitz packaging and I think that's what the bears need to turn to because Mac doesn't look right today against\nThe pat while watch out for those charges by the way if you were sleeping especially those have you on the west coast the chargers pull out at one point when in London early this morning\nOver the titans twenty to Nineteen they've got to buy we coming up and it has been announced the joy both will return when the chargers come back so the version that you saw the chargers today which was a little wild way even though they got to win or the next time we see them in theory Joey both ... and Melvin Gordon a will be re entered into the mix\nBribe Melvin Gordon have the hand me both at the foot from earlier this season keep an eye on that the defense event and playing across from Melvin in Rome on that defense with the chargers bookend pass rush years had a lot of success last year\nBut with a foot injury announces a bone bruised taking this along to get healthy from that I suspect there's more going on there and he hasn't been fragile but he's dealt with some injuries I'm curious how we look so now there is not\nThe entire most of the family just has like injuries yeah don't really know what's going on with all the things I haven't seen any\nThe patriots they're going to convert that one went to James White and so they will move the stakes and keep on going as they move into scoring territory the Panthers or threatening here but how the third and fourth coming up and trailing by Seventeen in Philadelphia against the eagles and\nWhat's not right off the browns yet we've got a little bit of a delay in this game as their ah their tending I think are they tending to Baker may feel a little bit he was sacked on the most recent play\nUh but now he's he's in there and ready to go on and right now they're facing a third and long from their own twenty seven thirty sixteen you know for all over the middle of the juice Landry and only gain about five\nBut I say let's not write them off early on that game how to look of oh this is not going to go well it's going to get out of hand it was sixteen to too but you mentioned he hits and joke for the touchdown their defense has started to slow Tampa down a little bit and here we are mid third quarter there just down by seven points\nOr you

hundred and forty eight yards and four touchdown ripe for two of them go to the White House\nMost likely it's the the field position right you know when you're special teams in defense or doing a great job for you and giving you a favorable view a field position that's complimentary football as long as you're converting those into scores instead of field goals you're doing the right thing offensively doesn't matter what the stats say\nTouchdowns are the most important thing in this game and so for all for ten yards as long as you're going that many touchdowns doesn't matter and so Andrew Luck orchestrating with is a favorite target back he was held and had a great quote this week leading up to this game\nAre they asked him if he was a hundred percent he said no he goes but me something less than a hundred percent is better than most guys will go so we're going to be our eyes and sure enough they are All right\nThey are and he got two touchdowns receivers are not shy usually a let's go back to Chicago\nAnd so third and ten coming up for ... the Panthers hold the eagles and get the ball back however it's going to be deep in their own territory just six forty six and counting to go in this game and the parents are are Panthers trailing by eleven\nYeah the Panthers out a lot of ground to make up and and this is not the place they want to be ever in a ballgame again Kim new ... he has some greatness as an athlete at the quarterback position but when you can score\nAnd keep scoring against them and have them playing catch up this is in a situation where Aaron Rodgers is coming in and scorn you Twenty one points on the other side of halftime or Tom Brady operating down twenty seven three in the super bowl a Kim Newton\nDoesn't have that dynamic to his game and do we have an interception ... we might the patriots sure thing that they do but we're gonna have to take a look at this one trip is\nKey roles out to the ride and it looks like he's going to try to run it and then right before he gets a lot of scrimmage he tries to Janet in there to Alan Robinson and\nThe ball ... both of them are going to the ground I mean at full speed it looks like an interception they get up and running back a little bit Jackson does he might have been down by contact so I don't know if he caught it and if he did I don't know if he's down right where he caught it which is my guest\nOr but this is a this is a heck of a guy as two players pretty much that an equal share of that ball and and he just worked a little harder for it\nThey call that an interception on the field I think that plays stands because I don't see evidence of the ball really being grounded I agree and so I I think that'll stand and there'll be patriots ball when this game comes back to the action here's the funny thing\n... through a great ball I mean I was the only place Robin sent out a plan on it that the corner didn't and it bounced off of his hands as he was diving forward to get to it and so first\nCam Newton hits right down the field big opening and suddenly\nThey're threatening to make this a game because they were deep in their own territory unable to get in and going off instantly they just scored a touchdown a few minutes ago and now they're firing down the field in the scoring position again time is of the essence only five minutes actually a little less than that now to go in the game\nBut the Panthers are already now inside the money they'll have a second in three at about the Eighteen year old line is Devon functions gets a ... a first down cats there are the Panthers even if they walk out of here with a quick field goal they've got to time out the two two minute warning still ahead there are still in this football\nYeah Noone during a nice job operating the two minute drill here he just hit\nThe crossing pattern there ah Philadelphia playing a little conservative here they were replaying coverage zone coverage behind that\nOoh boy oh boy whom wide open was\nFun just in the end zone there touchdown or they'll go for two and see if all of the sudden they can turn this into a three point game with for a way to go\nYeah look you know this isn't this isn't what we're used to seeing out a new and being able to operate this well in a situation like this but\nThey ran some good routes against bad coverage choices and that was a tremendous job by punches setting up the slant and then running the seven route to the corner of the end zone that was an easy pitching catch can actually under through it's like we had to turn around and make the adjustment\nFrom his own thirty one fourth in ten steps up in the pocket hit his he throws bud completes for first down and now more down the right side line and in the eagles territory to the thirty for your line is Torrey Smith\nAnd the Carolina Panthers or in business clocks stop one fifty to to go\nWell they got lucky there because can Newton was about to get absolutely wall up in the pocket because he was looking at extend played there the pass rush finally hit home\nSo broken play but jam and Smith fixed it for the first down when they needed it the most\nAll right so we've got a big Dr coming up in Philadelphia Detroit trying to hold off Miami and the bears with the ball down by seven to start the fourth quarter ... more as we continue coming up next on red zone radio Fox

[laughter] Baker main field just ran out of all over the place and at the very end of the play try to go into a slide he didn't get hit he was certainly in the slide yet but he kinda got up and did that I just play the flag in Ohio State sort of a thing and he got in somebody's face\nFlags are flying all over the place\nIf throwing the ball in the direction of the defendant didn't hit him which is bad for a quarter but I'm sure I ever to hit your target but it's one he was eight minutes to go the browns get a big play in a flag which I have a feeling is going to go against Tampa for hitting Baker Mayfield\nHowever I only offsetting it would be offsetting if he threw it they get flak for throwing it back\nAh we don't have the sound on any of these TV is the rap is doing a whole lot of talking also led to value a walk yeah he's sort of go on helmet to helmet okay that that's definitely a flag Baker may feel was not fully in a slide yet but the defender went helmet to helmet\nAs a blind person you have to be aware of you know legion tell you why don't you can you really have to try\nMy folks got me a little ... radio in Nineteen forty and\nThat was the best Christmas present\nWas eleven years old when I started to play music yeah and then the accordion and then the show\nMy wife who's also blind was a good cook when she died that's when I started meals on wheels\nLet's do lunch\nOne in fixing your spaces between um hunger and millions more isolation drop off a hot and hearing and allow volunteer for meals on wheels donating your lunch break at America likes to launch dot org this message brought to you by meals on wheels America and the ad council\nOr you should try and figure out from all the wonderful volunteer groups where your time would be most valuable how about a few hours a month to help a child that will last for\nTheir lifetime and you are the costs to live on that ... year like going out to expose the author of Arizona dot org ... at five to four\nFour one three five for Navajo county\nWhere Rick that two four or five well one one eight for Apache County [noise]\n\nWas colder weather approaching it won't be long and fill that small cracking your windshield grows into a major I saw and more importantly a major safety issue so stop putting it often called black diamond auto glass you already know they're the absolute best in what they do\nBut did you also know that with your insured windshield replacement you get a fifty dollar Walmart gift card at two windows for free called five three seven\nOh five hundred to set up your appointment today\nWill\nSmoking isn't easy but it's easier with\nThe first week kicks off on October first from four to five thirty PM at the summit cardiopulmonary sleep lab and shallow and also available on video at the Hebrew snowflake Taylor and eager offices get the support and tools you need to quit smoking and stay smoke free free registration is required called five three seven six\nThree zero three that's five three seven six three zero three\nDid you know that according to Nielsen the people who do TV ratings Ninety three percent of all adults listen to radio each and every week that's right more people listen to radio that are reached by TV Google Facebook Pandora satellite radio or any other medium for that matter\nSo how do you get all those people listening to radio to use your services or buy your product\nWell that's the real question isn't it we have the answer we can show you how we can walk you step by step through a process that has been effective in doubling tripling and even in some cases quadrupling our clients business want us to do that for your business\nCall I talk one oh six seven and nine to eight five three two ten ten that's five three two\nTen ten five three two ten ten\nFunny I don't want to explain that in weather patterns\nPlenty of time he signed building on in foreign today also a rogue a shower or stormy pop out here or there increasing south land and our high warnings here that the Levis blow in cancer showers lingering can identify ready made forwarding\nAnd widely scattered showers on Monday more clouds in place and highlighted nicotine shot a shower and Monday Night entertainment\nAnd eating here I was just ... ... what a six point seven [noise]\nThese eagles I just didn't trust the the confidence in this team you have ...\nShe was the NFL or I should say the super bowl MVP last time we saw him and you have a team that\nOver the off season there was a lot of this talk like hey we ... we can't ride the coattails of our championship we need to get into the mode where were earning things because in the pre season there are problems it was a parent\nI remember that game against the browns you saw them play a lot harder and a lot better against the eagles then you would have ever suspected and so this all this goes all the way back to the ... I just don't see the same belief in themselves now there's sort of out of the eagles the season or go\nMinnesota Vikings leave by ten but somehow so a lot of time left to go in that game seven forty and counting and right now they will be facing a third down trying to hold the jets they try to move that clock\nSo the bears have gone right down the field after that turnover first intent at the patriots sixteen yard line you're busy will throw all over the metal\nInside the ten to the nine however a flag is down or that is his second tight and that makes the cat's not Trey Burton said the nine year old line but a flag is down we will check the flag so those are the three games that were watching right now the rest is gone final\nDetroit wins in Miami Today thirty two Twenty one of the Cold War never threatened they beat the bills thirty seven to five\nAnd even though ... Kessler came in and got a touchdown pass there was no more but the Jacksonville Jaguars Houston wins in Jacksonville with these today twenty to seven and Jacksonville it's kind of panic time there\nAnd here's the thing that's happening in New York that is is quite apparent to me because I I thought that this match up would look a bit more even you know what's happening is Sam Donaldson and I'll play by her cousins he's got two interceptions Kirk cousin\nHas not thrown a pick yet and so this drive right now we're cousins now has a great hook up on a on a Fifteen yard out on the sideline to feeling who's just been playing amazing this\nOut and that cat sends them all\nYou know I mean well earned because he is all the talent he needed a a real gunslinger\nOur quarter back and they gave him guaranteed money to do just encourage cousins I've been delivering a underwhelming season so far for them in the record books that tie hurts them there are three to one so far looking to improve to four wins after this visit to New York and it looks like they will\nOr indeed they well that was a third down conversion the cats that feeling that you mentioned so they're up by ten and now clock ticking below six minutes which basically hits Trey Burton for a touchdown and so we got to keep our eyes on Mount one patriots thirty eight bears thirty one as the extra point is good\nFor Thirteen to go in the game and the bears down by seven have all their time outs\nAnd and one of the things that you got to point out when you're thinking about the bears is they've been more efficient on third down in the past or only seven Fifteen so that that comes in critical timing you need to actually be able to do that so the lesson the fifty percent ... percent threshold that you want\nAnd special schemes mishaps have hurt them they had the block punt\n... way scoops in scores off the Dante high tower block or obviously Paterson takes it all the way on a kick return otherwise this game is being led by the bears deep in the fourth quarter where's the patriots have the upper hand\nCousins over the middle to feeling again who takes all hard hit\nTakes are hard hit over the metal flag is down ah he ah seems to sort of be indicating the teammates that he might be OK had some decent body language there but he's not up yet\nUm that was a big hit over the middle from Adams who is a fantastic safety now feeling does hop up and jog off of the field or the that's the kind of play oh\nMy gosh that way and that you know that was one\nThe impact bang\nIt still below the helmet but that's the kind of thing that usually gets called I don't know if that's one of the flag originated on the play would you call that a helmet to helmet I wouldn't actually in order to shoulder absolutely\nNot and if they do call this on Adams that's unfortunate because it's a sign of the time we'll see what this call is\nNo I think they're picking up the flood forced out\nIt should be you know call because you know you interview that\nHe put his shoulder and stealing chess and yeah it hurts but so does football is the guy I work and when the guys making progress away feeling was who's going to fulfill for the first don't you have to absolutely stop that if you had the opportunity to and that's what Adams did well struck play him square in the numbers I think he's completely\nHealthy but he's just like got the window knocked out oh that hurt yeah oh not heard just everybody's jak can win them over on the sideline they're like hey did I hear some water that I like that really sucks [laughter] yeah and I and I think he did but it brings up for us down and and maybe strangely the Vikings are going for it\nFor an eight at the jet thirty four or five twenty two to go\nCousins overall for the end zone and it is\nA touchdown [laughter]\nNow that I\nThink that was like ... well and why on earth did they go for it I don't really know check that no I think that was all ... Robinson who made the cats are but then again I guess where where are you are on the field why not a little too close to ... you don't want to try field goal they just suck it up to the end zone and the Vikings are probably just what the game away\nI agree with ya and and now I'm I'm no longer second guessing for down opportunities because you're seeing a lot of these convert and the other thing is you're seeing a lot of kicker is really flounder in situations where you can add a score late\nTo to create further separation so why not if you're going to give your defense ... yards to defend say or or or Ninety\nMy name is Tom Jordan and my name is Cindy [noise] we've been married thirty eight years we're retired and this is how we live in Idaho\nIdeas and nursing at the clinic\nI work the front office checking in patients greeting them making them feel comfortable\nUnited ways how we contribute because we now our time and money are going to the right places to places that need it most and implemented math\nJudging by the tank used we get a clinic I'd say we're doing the right thing with our retirement to\nWe even get a blast is\nWere common Cindy Thornton\nWe volunteer at our community free health clinic so we don't just wearing the shirt we live a\nLiving on its good living on a ... by United Way an ad council\nLegendary NFL player and coach Mike ... said before you can when you have to believe you are worthy consistent effort pointed in the right direction increases our belief at ourselves and each other and with greater faith comes greater success\nJoshua it'd be alert and below orthodontics would like to encourage our White Mountain teams to be worthy of each other's trust and the confidence of your family or community bealer orthodontics lived to smile love your smart\nDo you ever want to understand the latest state or federal tax plan coming down from the government\nAt heritage attacks and accounting we continually scour articles read legislation and attend classes to try to make sense of what the government is thinking a tax law then we posted information on our Web sites news age in plain English the more you understand the tax law the more we can help you save money check out our Web site for current news tax rates in so much more heritage attacks in the county\nLet us be your tax professional three three three five Ninety or look us up on the Web at ... dot business\nOr you should try and figure out from all the wonderful volunteer groups with your time would be most valuable how about a few hours a month to help a child that will last for their lifetime ... be cautious and the ... or ...\nTo ... for for one street sign for Napa County were reacting to four or five lung on a check you out of\nMountain mobile bottle glass is away or\nWriting yeah when you're insured when did you replace you about your cat\nA delicious known as the White Mountain donuts are wonderful lunches White Mountain you can say to automate dinners that Los ...

end zone in the\nPages defender seven back and the patriots win thirty eight thirty one and what was a an absolutely entertaining game\nYeah that was that was really really fun really good ah two teams that are now struggling defensively Chicago was rolling we can we'll Mac when he was healthy but he's been injured passed two games so it's not as great\nProlific are fences though and it was trading fire all game long I mean I was as good as the last week game a patriots against the chiefs it's a very similar a fenced in so they had a look\nAt what they were going to see in Chicago but that is a gutsy team Chicago the bears\nTo me can hang with anybody in this week and that's even with their best horse on the shelf defensively\nI Would say that the bears are are not who we thought they were this year and that's why they're not bad\nI'm also we've got no not this year they're actually really good so I have a swing state with a first down throw that could have been a lot more All right but a nice open field tackle and the boxer still in their own territory but her first down now and the next court wins the game the browns have already out the ball and overtime\nAnd did not move it on their first set or if you are just joining us yes the browns are in overtime again for the fifth time in seven weeks it's twenty three all seven and a half to go boxes I'm a first down on their own thirty three yard line here is Winston to Sean Jackson for a lab and yards\nMove the change again so box missed an extra point earlier missed a field goal at the end of regulation so keep that in mind as they potentially moved down the field yes the feel go into the game\nI mean not across the if you can trust kicker is like I said they are they now going to like strike or something did something happen or they unite buying it right it it's it's uh it's pretty ridiculous but the bucks did a good job getting off their own goal line there and two consecutive plays they're out by midfield here\nSaints opening Dr Breen throws for the end zone incomplete on first intend or just shy of the ten yard line\nAll right now this opening tried for the saints has taken almost eight minutes off the clock and feature to fourth down conversions already and a fake part Sean Payton is coming out like this is the super bowl again and he's got some tricks up as late as\nWell I I think he's considering this a as one of those games where you're only going to win if you get a little gimmicky\nAnd yeah Drew Brees as one of the class it on a fella quarterbacking you need to have a great one time great success in this league but that's a great defense and so he's not taking it for granted and they brought in taste inhale mail they do this and the red zone a couple of times down this game and it's affected because I think as a change up pitch\nAs a secondary punch or a counter punch so to speak to some of the options they run he's dynamic as an athlete he just got them some yard is down there and the red zone I'll tell\nYou what the OJ miss Winston just got intercepted inside buccaneer territory in overtime so here comes Baker Mayfield out on the field and the browns only need about ten Fifteen yards throw these attempt a field goal doesn't mean it's going to go in all here starting to for the saints\nMark Ingram up the middle probably only get to the yard or you're going to go for on fourth out again I mean you've been going for a fourth one the whole way here might as well do it again right\nI mean I I guess I Would if you're a conversion rate is as good as a as good as it's been on this Dr already ah let's see how you got painting holding his card and he's calling something in so Drew Brees is going to take the field for for the\nUsed to have some help and here he comes here comes he'll onto the field now this is Brett stays all no so this is hill and breeze a and there's a breeze that is set up out to all the right as a wide receiver hill gets it sauces to come are are fun bowls\nBy the ravens the saints getting out of it\nYeah I didn't like this play call so what they did is they ran a double option hill has opportunity after receiving the shock on snap to run it himself\nBlanking him out of the backfield was Kamara as the pitch man and when he tried to execute that pitch Kamara mishandled it honestly bad pitch and it is going the other way from Baltimore this is what you sacrifice when you do go for it on fourth one so instead of getting the three points and you're kicking off\nIt's now Bolton Baltimore's ball after I'd won the play Dr open the game saying holy Mac\nUnbelievable to show for it not fit All right ah except for a whole lot of time off the clock Baker Mayfield hits David in jokes do they are getting very close to a field goal range in this game between ... ad Cleveland that was a seven yards gained right there\nKeep an eye and the overtime clock as well which is approaching five minutes that darn over time clock I cannot hate anything more than the NFL right now but we have it at least for this year\nThird in three for the browns from the thirty seven yard line may feel that the shot gun is going to take us

... lived for myself it was all the way to reach out to us right now we're just talking about a moment ago but now we're joined by march where you're talking about those lines victory down in Miami against the golf as if they were thirty two and a Twenty one and they are you\nI'm doing good how are you guys are really good that we have a we have\nThe full disclosure I are in alliance for as a whole life and I may or may not have to announce them\nAre living in LA or or you know they have only denounced them however I have on the Jersey today I think I'm back on that I I still have Iran's hat on an alliance Jersey I'm going through some things right out of state but when I see them run the ball like this in April you love scouts will have you ever run a ... thirty five a chance for two hundred and forty a yard\nI mean that is a recipe for success especially for a team like the line\nHe missed him make four guys missing the fact that he took off for eighty you know it was like hey we're going to dictate the run again to anybody that was never there style but I'm I'm with you a hundred percent I mean I I look at what they did and this was part\nOf this was part of what they try to do what they tried to accomplish with Matt Patricia they certainly wanted to be able to run the football takes the pressure off of Matthew staffer I'll be a little bit more balanced view a little bit more power team and I'm In and they certainly accomplish that today and it's been interesting\nTalking to map Patricia and talk to them as just you know all types of players like staff or some of the guys that I talked to prepping for this game about how they're still trying to figure out what they are what they're good at it and that's part of the process of being a new coach\nAnd with limited amount of time you have to you know practice and all that stuff so that by we came with a great time for them and you saw them do a couple of things that they just haven't shown all season long I'm from uh skiing standpoint so really good stuff by Detroit today\nDo you think this is who we are going to try and be moving forward Matthew Stafford who's been there prolific passers and he's been in the league only twenty two ah attempts is is the ... the recipe for Detroit moving forward to be a contender\nI think I think it's part of the recipe I think when you look at\nWhere a map Patricia comes from in New England they're going to do whatever they have to do that gives them the best chance to win you know it's always that make you play left handed look at your weaknesses and try to exploit those weaknesses so that's always been kind of the philosophy the philosophical approach\nYou have to have smaller players in people that understand you know what you're trying to accomplish but that was a big you know that was a big talking point with math Patricia is we're still in this process but we would love to take some pressure off of bath you step but we'd love to be more balanced would love to be able to win\nA couple of things come to mind first is what Matt Patricia what's what's the thing that you would say now here we are what seven games in several weeks in that you would say I see the difference or he's doing well or he may be putting his name on this team\n[noise] yeah I think I just think from my standpoint it was always kind of okay you know to just say hey we'll just leave it to our quarter back and we're just not you know we don't run the ball really well so we'll just\nWe'll just candidate you know we're not going to stay committed to it and I think the big thing for me watching this team is there like here well established this what we're gonna stylish\nAnd we're not going to give up like we're going to keep walking and really interesting you know just talking to about\nThe process of of understanding kind of what we are and putting guys in positions to win and that was a big that was a big talking point is there still guys at work trying to figure out there still some guys at practice really well but just don't show up as well on game day\nThere's some guys that don't practice as well but do\nYou know show up on game day so we're still trying to process of trying to figure that out and he was like you just don't have the time to work on everything in today's game\nSo you know the big thing was establishing putting everything in early in the O T H making sure they they have all those things down and now we're working on technique week to week technique of trying to become a better football team so\nUm I think they're going to be a SMART Team I think they're going to be a multiple team is really what they want to establish it that's kind of the philosophical approach to cheat or what New England has been able to do over the years\nAnd let's go over to the other side of the ball and Miami Dolphins are ... filling in for ... hill and he's not playing bad\nRight he's not blame Betty was parked in the offing for them more moving forward what are we going to see something between tannahill and in ... in in terms of a controversy\nUm and you know I mean the shoulder is legit he's got an entry it can't throw right now but there doesn't seem to be a lot of stress I Will say this for all kids you know ... always been a guy that throws a little bit three quarter arm it you know drops down it's just six seven at it throws it it's like five eleven\nBut just watching him on film delivered the football has been better now this year it in this game and in the last game that I've ever seen it and I followed him because he's a you know he's been a Denver bronco um and he's really gotten back to work you know mechanics really got back\nTo it not over striding and I'm In is doing much better job of staying on top of the football and drive into football I'm not getting his hand underneath the football which tends to make it sale or not\nOver striding which again link fences arm action and and and creates inaccurate throws in ... so I thought he drove the ball well today I thought he played really well I'm was protected great\nAnd uh you know didn't have a great running game behind him so um you know all those things to consider I think he's playing really Well Adam gays tells me he knows he offers better than anybody else on the football team 'cause he was in it and twenty Thirteen and twenty fourteen so you know ... ... has done a good job for them\nWell we have mark we appreciate it safe travels and uh the lions welcome Seattle into Detroit next week that as their next morning thank you mark sounds good to getting right\nA real quick uh there was a touchdown Lamar Jackson scores of running touchdown for about three hours out for the ravens so it is now ten seven uh with ravens in the ... Jackson over the the saints\nLamar Jackson's kind of interesting the way that they're using him and then\nIf you're you tell me when you were playing quarterback if you're a Flaco do you not mind that you anytime you kind of get the red zone maybe Fifteen yard the closer that the Marge actually comes into Haiti and that's what I thought as a starting quarterback starting anything the last thing you\nYou're driving a team or you have things everybody's on the same page everybody's working together this long drive and then you get down to the five six yard line they say hey\nAre you going to play a receiver and we're going to bring the other quarter back in to it it just throws off the chemistry and and I I made this point earlier in the year they could be in the middle of a drive and they'll introduced this Lamar Jackson baggage and\nHe may lose yards on first down so now you have to come back in at twelve and a I mean at a at a second and twelve or Thirteen\nYou do for a bunch of yards but he had those to intercept has put his team in terrible position\nAnd they've been trying to work on this with this has been the the the point of emphasis for all of the coaches that he's had what can they possibly do to make these young men make better decisions with the foot [laughter]\nI Wish it were that easy but\nBut basically you got to keep telling the guy if you look at some place not there you got to get rid of it you know just a throw it away or check it down and you got to have that checked down and and ... the shore the short short pass or did hold on the ball long\nTime late or late in the game for cars shack which was a bad one because\nHe's got to make better decisions you know he wants to make a play these young guys\nGuys like him the guys that are coming into the league Sam Donald Josh Rosen a judge Alan you're you're looking at these young quarterbacks Baker may feel they believe in themselves so strongly they believe that can make the play\nJay misses the same way but he's got to get over that and realize hey if that play is not there get rid of it and we're right there will make the next play but it came down to what you said it comes down to the decision making and you got to be smart with a football because when you turn it over you're putting your team in real bad position\nDefinitely don't want to do that hey we appreciate it Sam thank you and safe travels thank you Sam\nThanks guys thanks for having me on of\nCourse Rosen there on the call again books get the victory twice\nStill doing it at this point in your career in the league and everyone always says this is his fourth season and everybody's like hey kid has town and he's got\nTalent is only going to get you so far if you can like having those to turn over than the red zone last year I mean last week and like things like that those add up and he's still not making better decisions like Sam said taking that back\nRight taking those that it it it it at that spot on the field at that time looking as they got it but\nBut he's not a rookie writes played a bunch of football and you gotta know better the great quarterbacks don't do that Tom Brady won't do that Aaron Rodgers won't do any of the elite court even if they're good quarterbacks wouldn't do it and I don't know what they have to do to get\nHim to switch his mind over to being more\nAlex Smith with the ball and you know what I mean\nI I Will say before a break I think it's part of it is\nThe talent yeah and we see that all the time with some quarterbacks for a while for the entire duration of their career when I have\nThe talent or the opposite Jay color for example I can make that pass I can get that there I can be laid on the past I don't have to be a I can be on my back foot and do that and it hurts you in a guy that gets away with it a lot\nAnd he's out of buddies that a lot of success Cam Newton I saw today throughout all of the pads on his back foot you know but but it gets there and he's able to have success but\nIt is playing with fire hey I'm by of course we're coming to you lie for the guy go Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more car insurance with

a strong argument for saying I'm darn all that the best quarterback so far I think they are clearly the two best of the former quarterback that are playing and starting in the NFL right now I'm Josh Alan\nOn the bill fan not marry so and I'm also not sold right now on what I have seen from Joshua Rosen doesn't mean that those guys are going to be bad remember Jared golf was not very good his

wanted to so bad but Steve Martin and I were talking yesterday and he was like man we're going to have a LA Boston everything you can have the rams patriots\nThat's not far fetched rice my for my argue that the two best teams because they beat the cheeks not farfetched and you could have potentially Lakers Celtics that so far this of the team that is I've already the warriors would be like a a hello\nBut the Celtics represent the east isn't far fetched they've been the number one see the last couple of seasons of yeah more than that for her dad's ... likely yet ... might have a lot to say with that he's\nHe's got that raptors team looking good just to see the difference between him and the Rosen right there um\nBut at the ... for some reason a Kevin Durant injury or Steph ankles go out like they used to [laughter] you must around and get to the Lakers and the Celtics and the uh the the patriots and the rats are crazy would that be\nThat would be um one for the ages that across all

fetched that is I Would imagine it may not\nWell you're making a clean sweep across all force that will be that will be wild\nSo which team what sport I guess sport would be the least happy you know we always want the bigger teams that what you want someone other than the rams and the patriots\nNo I I don't have either yeah I thought it was ready to get anything better right I mean ... rams in Kansas City yeah or I was going to say if you keep our patriotism that will be exciting now will be excited for sure um maybe the\nJust for a namesake the hackers patriots whipped cream you know

going right\nYou see your teammates pulling you and their guys off for the ... and trying to keep them away from the other team or the I saw was\nThe end of ... or the LeBron James\nSpending more time consoling and trying to calm down Chris Paul\nThen his own teammates now I don't know now for me it looked weird and I'm not on the team right can I can I can I wait a minute okay go ahead for me it looked weird and I'm not on the team so I could just imagine\nWhat those young guys in the locker room are I think the land Stevenson right the the uh jobs that are the odds are to be all around ... Rondo all of these guys are like\nYo what about us I Know that show boy but your boy just much me and I and you gonna run to his defense\nRight in the Bronx and say well I was you know trying to get what you focus on your ...\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n... Sunday salons Kelvin Washington with you and a lot to get into we are joined as we are every week that is with Alex Marvin serious acts MFL radio Alex ... on Twitter ... ... what is going on rather how are you\nBy mail colonialism today so not only in my learning my football on what's going on with week seven but also a little bit of history as well\nI just I mean I'm I'm a you know I already think your robot I mean how can I Want to consume so much information is ridiculous or there's a lot to get into I Want to start here\nLet's break down some people are calling it ammonia gay I'm going to college gate as it smell like so uh I saw it sweet here you reach we did something from a Chris Nowinski a doctor saying about the uh jak Prescott earlier in this game\nHe gets the Redskins he was he looked like saying what the protocol went out of the ... comes back out and plays but there's a great video from CBS covering the game where he hits the smelling saw a couple of times\nAnd then you have a the injury going on eight I'm Adam gays and devout they Parker and the dolphins way to get to that afterwards but what's going on with this concussion for the call and our guys are still getting out there and maybe just saying I'm OK put me back out their coach\nYou know the the smell like salt thing has been an interesting one maybe from could talk a little bit about this you know and Mike framing or who's now with bleach report he wrote about this a long time ago and guys that were getting hopped up on this stuff you know on the sidelines apparently it is legal\nCertain was is now I I I Do on a couch this by saying that\nThere have been a couple of cowboys media people who you know reporters who were pointed out that\nThat crust got does do smelling salts or you know the ammonia capsules um if I'm On a regular thing for him but for a player who potentially as foggy I you know who may you know may have some costs of symptoms to try to get used backup potentially by taking an ammonia capsule and breaking it open and smelling it that that's not good\nFor anybody not a good look for the league of course you know the other thing was what was in the medical tent or was that more matter of looking at his hand which appear to be the injury or is that actually going through the concussion protocol testing so the NFL investigate they they are not afraid to find teams I Would imagine at some point there will be a statement whether the cowboys were cleared of this or not\n[noise] um yeah the smell and saw a a issue has been\nAround we used to do it we still a crack a bunch of uh a bunch of them and put them in the empty water bottle yank it up a little bit just to get you guys did that before the games even started this was a thing to do to to just ... get you in the in the mindset of\nOf of getting ready to go compete though I mean I don't want to have a problem with it I don't know what the lasting effects of it they are just like they used to give us are still give us toward our shot\nNo one knows what the land rights uh affects of toured or shots are either\nOr any of the ... of the other opioid they give us for pain or\nOr ah or the anti inflammatory so I put the money so in the realm of all of that if you're going to give out a cornerstone ... by the truckload then all of a sudden the food and Drug Administration are poor ... and all\nOf shows because people have been dying and then right so they all of this fit into the category of\nYou know seeing that professional athletes partake in they may or may not be good for them and until something or study\nIs the worst thing right and I mean ... you don't need another generation of guys that are dealing with opioid issues and you know pain management and things like that because you know youth is wasted on the young I mean you think you're gonna live forever you think that things that you do in your twenties all I'm Superman especially great athletes right and you know no I can overcome this is part of what makes\nAthletes so great it's also the abuse of the sort of stuff is what led to the FDA actually running an investigation of NFL teams a few years ago to find out okay who's prescribing what you know where things at right now in the medicine cabinet so to speak right and you know how do we account for these things in fact\nIf you're a player and you need to get a pain numbing drug right down your row team the home team has to go get it for you I don't know if you're aware of that\nYou know they have to yeah they have to send someone out I'm not joking like someone with a script with a police escort to a nearby pharmacy to go get it because they do not keep it on on the stadium cites anymore it's one of the things that he had it stemmed from this but\nYou know again it it's something that look I I Hope that people keep the NFL in check because if it weren't for the media banging the drum about the concussion\nProtocol through the years as we look back and colt McCoy remember he was playing for the browns on Thursday Night Football everybody in the world knew that he was can cost except for the people on the field right in the guy was allowed to continue playing right if you don't point these things out as reporters\nThen you're not going to get them investigated you're not going to have these things happen and that's bad for the players long term because again we don't want another generation of guys that are having issues that could be prevented\nI agree with that one hundred percent speaking of injuries or what is going on down in Miami were adamant in saying that divide the parkers Napoli healthy and then he's going out through his agent and saying that he is and this is poor management and the costs and the team you know chances to win what the heck is going on Alex please I was breaking down\nOkay so let's understand that anything that happened before two thousand and sixteen involving Adam gays in the Miami Dolphins he doesn't feel responsible for K. he didn't select the voluntary Parker and the dolphins have been frustrated through the years because ...\nBig Buddy Guy incredible speed but he's never out there right and now we're getting to a point about whether he's in the weather is truly injured or not the dolphins are saying he's not a hundred percent to volunteer Parker's age and the saying he is what I just wonder is does this come to a head\nYou know starting before the trade deadline October thirtieth can the Miami Dolphins move him their teams that are in the wide receiver market because a team believed Yvonne tape Parker is worth trading for\nAt what point the dolphins by the way who continue to cut ties with people\nThat run afoul of Adam gays I mean how many guys have they cut that have gone on to play elsewhere we saw Jordan Philips earlier this year and I was with buffalo as a defensive lineman recharge a a job he get traded we saw Jarvis Landry get traded none of these were Adams guys well at some point it stops being the players fault it starts being the coaches fault\nWhile you're not winning and that was a pretty darn bad effort today against the Detroit Lions that you know look I Know the dolphins are injured and they lost Albert Wilson has been their best often supplier all that being said though I mean this Miami Dolphins team\nTo lose the way they did today to Detroit you can't trust them and you know I'm not saying that they can't stick around five hundred type team as a year goes on but\nAt the end of the season I think the dolphins after three years in Adam gays have to ask themselves are we truly headed in the right direction and by the way how do we solve the quarterback issue because we saw ... while a return to earth today ... Tobar gets rocked today it it's hard rock stadium\n[laughter] well ah through my experience in in in things that I've seen in my career\nTeams have a way of devaluing you when they want to move on from you they will just certain things they do to reduce your value so they can move away from you without regulation or or without records\nAnd uh making a player inactive and using a injuries you know he's already injury prone\nWould just have to move on from ... that's a tactic that I Know for a fact that they they use\nI think the guy is very good or you just don't you don't like the way he practices whatever you know that's one thing they're blaming it on an injury why our team's going to see through this is talk on tape Parker movable I mean the reports are today that the dolphins are listening to calls for about people asking for a trade but so if you're saying device on tape Parker's entered argue trading for damaged goods\nCould pass a physical for your team I mean the dolphin to muddy the water on this as well but I even talking about this but again it's a team that can't get out of its own way I mean really that that's what the dolphins are I mean another team to create their own distractions although unlike the Pittsburgh Steelers they're usually not able to overcome\nA one more for me ... or ... radio outsmart as on Twitter\nI Want to go to Eric ... who has some very very strong words for Malcolm Jenkins a during the coin toss but even more so afterwards when he spoke with reporters\nI don't know if you saw but he basically yeah yeah you saw great so for those who didn't he basically said that he called Malcolm Jenkins a coward and he said he was a sellout so uh just what are your thoughts on how that all transpired in in in what came out of that\nThink the nastiest thing he said was calling him\nA neo columnist right and Neal colonialism by the way according to what ... is the practice of using capitalism globalization and cultural imperialism to influence a developing country in lieu of direct military control or indirect political control\nNow this had to do with the ... I'm African countries\nUndergoing the colonization in the Nineteen sixties it's what he what this is the deal with Eric read and Malcolm Jenkins K. to behind the scenes is that they all met up in New York last October\nNext week\nThey can't go back to ...\nThey can because they're paying them so they can go back they could come out and say look Blake was you know he he just wasn't himself or he was himself and we need them to be someone else was backing because they don't have a suitable backup they don't have a guy\nStarter as a backup they have ... Kessler\nYou know and and so they can go back to Blake borders and try to design a better game plan for them and and they help in some aspects\nUh them not having a limit for Annette there's definitely a putting a lot of put more pressure on him\nBut they did trade for Carlos Hyde so obviously they you know something is is is going on a little deeper with a with a friend that hamstring then we know so when they get Carlos Hyde back they'll ... I mean when they get him already in up to speed to play that will relieve some of that pressure like you I mean\nAfter twelve with him they were like okay that's good home [laughter] come on over here we had enough twelve attempts to phone bills you know it it they just you know\nThey couldn't do it anymore and I said it did it last year this is the same guy who rush for more yards at a playoff when then he passed for you can't sustain that\nYou cannot you specially where you're not a run it's not as Michael Vick kid I with possible like that is not a recipe for a dominant team and yet at defense is there but if you can't put points on the board than defensively doesn't matter how good your cat ah speaking the defense of\nGray stopping a red zone by the cowboys and only allowing the Redskins and get a feel go to make it Thirteen and seven because Adrian Peterson was running all over it I mean it got down to us about the Seventy yard line and they weren't able to score and had to go kick a field goal so great stop there\nBy the cowboys I uh I I Know you wouldn't complaining one album more from Albert ... so that means we'll get your fantasy ticker update as well fantasy ticker afternoon edition next Fox Sports radio\nThat twenty eight teams World Series is\nNow changing my chain has lost in rent from the fan out just\n\nNo worse for\nMy first thing I can answer the question again\nThe barrage of wordplay was among them or something where those commercial I don't want this new insurance through progressive is anything but this is a commercial for the call today insurance for about ... draconian measures [noise]\nOr last batteries are proven tough to perform right temperatures have a heart forty degrees and forty below zero because when you started extreme conditions you can start everyday conditions like running late for work\n\nCrazy for Iraq\nProven tough on only a dollar or so is there any of our fifty five hundred locations nationwide and let us do more for you\n[noise] I talk\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly thirty six million dollars and hotel back is on track to make thirty eight and a half a million dollars a year after that he is on track to make Nineteen point two five million dollars so they've got him locked in in three years\nOr twenty million dollars a year each of those three years\nAnd guys if I were running the giants right now if I was there a new head coach or if I were a part of the management team I Would say oh delve back in junior let's see if we can put him on that trait block and get done with it\nTo get the rest of what cleats rabbits that time cash my searching out there and it's always you can hear I'll get the coverage with clay Travis weekdays it they say I mean there are three am Pacific right here on Fox Sports radio\nGolf [noise] ...\n[noise] I don't want to do battles for the media but you know I heard somebody today on TV you know last time I'm going to war between the mostly as in\nDavid ... has been much maligned ridicule I've been\nOne of the leaders in the clubhouse and David prices really professional baseball player in the major leagues since twenty or you know he has been\nIn playoff series with Tampa Bay and also the Detroit Tigers to Toronto blue jays in the Boston Red Sox\nHe has now one one game as a starting pitcher in twelve playoffs and so I don't know who the bows or was it the M.

[noise] I had one of six point seven [noise]\nI'm Still at a time out as well or not yeah they do have one time out left so they have plenty of time to get this thing done at least tied the game as a complete a nice passed now they're on the other side of the field about the state's forty two yard line with admitted twenty five lead plenty of time come on just need\nI Will just ride this thing out for a moment here and I'll get to the NBA suspensions is just a moment\n\n\nFor a house to root out the thirty two yard line of the saints on the other side of this day we have a get a twenty to ten Redskins a lead in the cowboys trying to do something off with a specially that blood from Prescott so\nWe'll see what Joe flack was able to do here of course a I have a feeling that they get close enough we'll see all the ... and this is what I mean by close enough as they are on the fifteenth aren't\nNow they can't put a minute I'll put the ball in his hand at this point in the game they been doing it every other than an hour you can't do that this one this one was important if you don't want to miss hand or ...\nAnd he's like oh wait what do I do in the red zone again where nobody wants to answer those questions so why don't you take Joe Flaco out in a year that you're bringing Lamar jak semi finals\nYou don't want those no you don't want it\nAll right I'm going to casually start rolling these out and if there's a score or anything that happens big in the game will give you of course an update so this is from New York this is from Kiki a bad way and who is executive vice president uh basketball operations\nAs Adrian ... earlier and or Alex Rodriguez was we were talking about with him or was it I like I Can't remember it was ... it was Alex okay that's what the ah four games for brand name room\nAnd the down the ravens fish down raven okay ravens we got action they Drew Brees you can bring every record but you're not being ... that's the way I got out on it at\nA twenty three twenty four PIN dean the extra point ... showing we I Know that means we know that means so Joe Flaco drives in the down the field\nGets them in position to tie the game he's done his party\nHas on his part test on John Brown you've done is part and I don't see I just\nI you know what I almost don't want to make it just so I can hear you talk about pickers nah I don't want to do that man I I Want them to be able to do the job I Want everybody to be able to do their job to the best of their ability\nYou know the ravens are the AFC version of the Panthers oh that makes sense if you love their explosive nothing gray hairs look up if I give you the St Charles why we should have this game in the back\nOh let's say they missed it you've got even mentioned the extra point with twenty four seconds left and that was just an Tucker\nTell their enemy calling him and the other word of ... the saints are up twenty four to twenty three I told you only need for it\nTo ride back home with us\nToday when a field goal was almost guaranteed was automatic ... like all of that and you went into the kitchen and got to ... and came back to the point was good and the three pointers good no matter where they kicked it from above what we talked into languages seven member you all do you feel you know up to seven\nYou would say I haven't seen it wasn't it was seven it was like wow I have a field goal because they're always making it now so much best\nThing the best rule the NFL has ever change your light of it that ... you know what that's the best way you want and excitement\nShould hear you guys should we just where I feel about it\nAnd you're like there you go your way where should happen right this is ridiculous Justin Tucker you've been lead to long\nNow you go try to keep going on so I can watch them get on ... just to make this even more oh he's not going to get on a kid not after having that sit on his jokes like that not after having ... so the there there are holes in your body\nHow do you think how you think he says the field right now it's a real ... how do you think ...\n... just in terms of the great teammates Flaco driving a team down great drive get a touchdown\nWe did our job you do\nIt ... it was a bad kid to like eat me he makes it border line Izzy dyslexic in that he thought there was another up right on the other side\nI missed by a lot of it almost missed the rice thought oh well our left there right side of the net goodness gracious man I went home with a souvenir look at him looking eyes wide how'd that happen\nWhy and what happened to your ... okay when they were then waged to going back to the what is the Fifteen now\nWhen they did that I don't remember this many miss kicks that year like what is happening the kicker this\nGet anything for that I doubt it I Wish does that count as the cat out of the Alvin\nKamara the St ah recovers the on site kicked twenty three seconds left in the game ravens have one time out doesn't matter\nGame blouses man on the other screen that Prescott is on the ... over to thirty left in the game a down into the red zone a Washington on the boat well not quite on the red zone Twenty one yard line move going in\nAnd they have three time outs to and obviously if they were to score here they have the uh the two point it would only a three point game right now so you you unless you were talking about is over and I was saying there's a chance\nThat's on the move again another first down a rush to minute warning to minute warning but the fact of the matter is he just gave them seven points to me that he\nClock are you allowed to just forfeit I'd just running clock are you allowed to join yeah just like Romeo already like they should be in agreement with the coach of on both sides agree we agreed to a running clock just run the clock 'cause at\nThree twenty four left but the rams are thirty nine and ten on the forty niners and the rams had the ball so it's just it's just getting brutal\nI mean they need to just yeah like intentionally walking batters just hey we're gonna we're not gonna waste these four pitchers will just put 'em on first base All right we'll keep you updated on this Redskin as a game as again the cowboys are looking to a comeback\nGreat tackled their Alex Smith tries to run for the first down almost got the first I'm about to hear our short but the bad part is he goes out of bounds yeah\nIt saves the cowboys from having to use their last time out Sean ... hawk them down which is why one of the ... line why he wanted a better ... line backers and the games running fast man that tackle still recommend it took a little odd Alex Smith\nWe do have accident that game a which will be good that we have another game that is going down to the wire want to give you some granted increments suspended for games and the good thing about this or that kind of explain why I got to get to the Arab side\n... suspended for aggressively returning to an escalating the application throwing a punch in the direction of Paul confronting a game of fish in the hospital he tried to check the rough if you recall right it was a bit much and I get an overall incident by shoving rockets James Harden so that was strange ... if if if you saw it\nHe pushes James Harden aback because it's hard to talk on the wrestling and would actually be in one I have not even thinking about bringing them in so bad that anger over this got heat it out of the blue and decided to try to take it to the streets Rondo has been suspended for instigating a physical altercation with a and spinning and throw it out so they did say spinning\nAnd throwing multiple punches so it's for three games were Rondo\nAnd then to for Chris Paul who's been a he's serving his suspension tonight when the rockets play the clippers and he'll have to miss another game as well so there you have it um those are the suspensions for those NBA players in last night's Laker rocket a brawl you call those suspense is more\nThan I Am I Am a I think Brandon should have got the the biggest suspension because he came back into the male am swinging to people from behind and I'm a that's just you know\nHuge square up and you going back and forth and all that tensions are high but when you come into the ... you come back into the may lay like that and you throw a punch as someone who can't see you ... we can't do that\nEspecially when I still get while you were in in the first place you know you're mad because James Harden guy in the fall and they lay up and you thought it shouldn't have been an era when it was pretty strange yeah I'm okay with to be honest with you I applaud the NBA for not getting carried away\nBecause the NBA I used to get carried away with gene gay yeah they've I mean one game than you know five million\nTo the off year we were talking about it they just do about thirty are passed a call ... ... you know it didn't work out so certain ... for the cowboys again we'll let you know what happens on display but I I thought I applaud the NBA for not overreacting [noise] yeah I Want to have for Chris Ball pushing the figure in the guys I don't want a couple of hundred lines I mean\nIt it it was heated uh you got to point guards who you know have spicy demeanor is to say the least uh and so I just think you know both guys have had problems with their own team made to like you know so you know they're not going to like each other\nThat's a great boy a big big big big play that Prescott Kobe's they pick up about twenty twenty five yard pass it looked like a Kobe doesn't look up right there\nYeah he did he wound up on that up and got it uh they're currently\nUh what about the ... I say the forty five yard line yeah probably about ... I Would say ten to Fifteen Years away from Togo range but who knows what that is these days that's [laughter] for it or have you thought about it we we we've just witnessed an extra point being missed\nYou know who's by one but then earlier in the earlier game we see a fifty nine yard field goal checked\nTo win in over a hundred or so I don't know what's the range is in that same kicker for the browns are for the buccaneers Mr early yet so\nI I don't know is I think three extra points I don't know what I don't have to do it we don't know and the brown just sitting there saying there's no way no way that he may there's other feel goes we had a chance to win and he had the nerve to make this it's been actually will be a a ridiculous\nI don't know what's going on we got to figure it out we have to see what's going to happen um I don't know if you know twenty yard field goal or sixty or if it well they're both don't seem to be the same thing\nA great point why one of the places I like earlier in the ... the last week I Believe it was when air\nJust all the time I was at the red scare was it the risky can't remember but the Packers he came back and he kept\nGoing those amazing passes and you're like okay they're going to kick it feel go here and he did one time he looked at the sideline\nAnd he threw it for one nice pass again that Prescott they pick up about a Fifteen yard every couple of hours away from what is quote unquote I'm giving you air quotes field goal range scored a touchdown ... air Rogers kept going and ... he looked at a sideline he thought the ones that I'm going for one more remember that yup\nYup go for the points that plays San Francisco last year\nOr ... whatever it is a great yeah he came back and everybody's are cool they got enough yard you know and remember at eight seconds left and about the twelve you are like he still try to go for a touchdown\nThey're going to review this play oh there was a another twelve yard pick up for the cowboys but uh they're going to review it because the\nRedskin players are saying was incomplete of course ... cowboy players are saying it was caught but why they're reviewing this that was my point air Roger said I'm not putting it in the hands of this kicker Crosby who miss what four or five years or feel goes a week prior yup\nHe came back and here to be a a game wonder though that was a\nBook that I Love the air I just said I'm going to get you absolutely as close as possible ... no just aren't Cool War and the thirty that should be a good no no no no man on the wall him all the way down to about the twelve yard either here you go\nAnd got a final final say has taken off the rams game rams or Los Angeles ramps thirty nine San Francisco forty niners ten that is ah what Rand or seven so when ...\nUh the only undefeated team in the national football league and have a\nFirmer dressed in strong hole on the NFC\nThere's not a team better alternative layer defensively a than the rams and the credit to them because I spoke about it this off season they didn't rest on their laurels they had a good and a great season last year about a guy stepped up we we got to meet them the truth Jared\nGolf or a curly\nGirly got back to his his his ways that we saw two years prior right and they said hey we have to get better and they went out and got key pieces and free agency or\nA brand and cooks that's a big guy dominance too they went out and got Peters a keep to leave all of these pieces because they didn't want to be in a situation where other teams around them got better they want it to get better and it's it's it's showing it improve a dividend right now\nAll laying there speaking of all land the cowboys are all in good position to have a chance to try this game that was reviewed and said it was a cat so now they're at about ... thirty one yard line of the Redskins they're close enough to kick him you know they're not but I think they're going to Aaron Rodgers is\nWhere they hand out to see if he picks up maybe an extra two yards or so give or take there you go lay you got two yards and I help you out there that puts you over double digits or that counted as one time out three seconds left I'll take what I can\nGet I guess it is I had a vigorous issue like that if I'm going to I Want to pick up more yard that's not what I just wanted to get into the middle I Know what I'm just saying what we've been talking about I Want to pick up a friendship but you don't want to ...\nThis this what are your predictions here\nThe cowboys is that he's dead smack in the middle east or smack in the mid ... thirty twenty nine yard line\nSo it'll be rough for what is that the thirty twenty nine\nOlds about what it as a already ... thirty nine your field or thirty nine dollars more than that forty six forty six year if it will go what are we got he's missing anybody ... what are you got it\nThat that they didn't go oh wait hold on we might have enough\nSo I mean I have an all or either an outsider or all start ... I Would definitely saying he's missing\nThis is a big call\nOh fall start you've got to be a false start I'm stick now fifty eight to lead to yours what do you guys ... you still going over time\nAnd he went out there and said let's go when is he a big for all his they're scared money don't make no money right and I feel like the cowboys were playing scared\nTo do this level I didn't even get in the middle road that was horrified [laughter] okay I had to laugh and steal twelve seconds on a client and you just saw it I hate to keep bringing this up but you saw a guy who was beaten you before you saw\nA guy who's been held as maybe the greatest quarterback of all time last week Aaron Rodgers go down the field and say no boy that I don't know soon again this that no it do it again but it was in the wake of they're trying to get a test them and you I watch them like that oh freaking winter that's what it was a no no no no no no no no we're winning his\nGame even on top of that there were still there were still the the fact that\n... was catching a ball like right magical like it very cold they caught a three amazing catch ... catches right there and then you don't trust him enough to try to do it again just get like killed [noise]\nI'm not even saying though for the touch I mean I guess if you want your great but at least pick up Fifteen more yards on an out that you say are exactly ... this is all you need now we're down at the twenty Eighteen yard line cars that run gave him what an additional like five or six you are oh no no no it was a two year it was still on that is that it was like a yard\nThat they weren't doing it to gain the hard way we're doing it or put to position the ball in the middle of the field yeah I didn't like that now here's why I'm OK when you asked about earlier the titans going for it I liked that they said we were down in his game ... on the road with stream we're on the plane was not even on the road\nAnd mark is Mario that he should be able to at least make a pass without their run it in the end zone and I don't mind I think my favorite realize he's probably got a little leeway with the team I think there's probably some conversation with a GMO hey your guy let's just keep getting better and let's keep building you don't do that if you have if you don't have job security\nSo I think he knows they trust me they believe in me let's go for the W\nBut I'm just I'm just upset with the guy with a frustrating envy piece next and I'm sure Jason ... is not one of them Fox Sports radio [noise]\nIs Fox Sports radio that\nAnd
