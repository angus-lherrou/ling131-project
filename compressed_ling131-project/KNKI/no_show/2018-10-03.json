spare please get Canada done we can't do this without Canada where's Canada will candidates here are you satisfied with what we know so far us them be a good even if you\nEvening to and I am satisfied I'm actually cheered by what they accomplished and the reason it wasn't getting done is\nPartly political and partly because there were certain issues and in particular dairy terrorists\nOr that Canada was really unwilling to budge on the political reality is uh Justin Trudeau didn't want to seem like a weakling in ... you know facing off against Donald Trump if you remember back at the G seven meetings or they had a bit of a contract tall and\nA true does polling went through the roof for the first time in months because it was considered that he had sort of face down Donald Trump\nWell he didn't want to sort of renege on that but at the same time his liberal party was getting killed in one election after another and not doing well and here's the thing Canada is a very

was a matter of time but I also thought it was incredibly important to have a when if you want to look at it that way and I do\nBefore the midterm elections because let's face it Donald Trump has gone

fourth quarter there's a lot of consumption going on in the United states I have not heard anything about is slowing momentum if anything I've seen house prices maintain their heights\nMaybe there's a shortage in supply at the starting and have you heard any interruption in the shopping or in the consumer confidence list\nI I think you're looking at a spending being very strong in the third quarter and what everything I raised suggests it's going to be very strong as well in the fourth quarter we're talking about growth three and a half percent kind of territory a look when you have the federal\nReserve chair Jeremy pal talking about the U.S economy being almost too good to be true and talking about how there's not going to be any recession until twenty twenty\nIt uh except that is what he sees a and that's in spite of\nThe fact that the fed is going to be a increasing interest rates pretty steadily throughout the next year so right now um I don't see in the\nMarketplace any excesses that are particularly worrisome there is a lot of dead around but gosh guess white folks when you have one percent interest rates forever\nPeople borrow instead of issuing equity or whatever uh\nAnd that has had some impact probably on stock prices but and it also has meant that interest uh that the debt levels have gone up but it's not at all that kind of situation we had in two thousand seven two thousand eight when we all knew something was profoundly wrong there is no sense of that today whatsoever\nAnd the market is high and Main street is being a strong dollar so we're looking at a good Christmas season I've not seen a negative report on that in fact what I have seen is shortage of workers to stuff up the retail\nWell that's right in fact all the retail uh companies are out there raising at Amazon today announced that they were going to be going wrong Fifteen dollars an hour for all their employees others have raised wages to make sure that they have enough seasonal workers and the numbers that the increase year over year\nTarget I think was twenty percent they're not alone in that that that suggests that they're looking at incredibly good indicators are for the cause of upcoming holiday season and don't forget for many companies that's like two thirds of the year so it's hugely important I think we're going to have a gang busters fourth quarter\nAnd you know the question is then does all of that translate right well for the Republicans in the mid term elections it's hard to imagine that it won't it's hard to imagine that Americans are going to be I'm

Fifteen dead in Syria Steven the initial reaction in the Kremlin was\nExtremely belligerent and there were moments that there were it was looking as if the de confliction between Israel and Russia had failed\nThere was eventual your phone call between the president and the prime minister however my concern here is how the war party deals with this memory of the deaths of their comrades\nSo let's get the context I have argued and I don't think you disagree that for several years the new Cold War has developed\nAt least three bronze where Cold War could become hot war one is obviously you're in Ukraine everybody understands that there's a proxy work on the other is in the Baltic rage on the\nPoland when NATO is undergoing a very large growling and permanent military buildup on Russia's borders and burned in Syria\nWhich I think we all understood but the lack of clarity of the danger there because you have\nSo many powers fighting in Syria but in particular with Russia and the United States Russia legally isn't sure the United states is jury illegally but with Iran and Israel\nAnd turkey involve the the multiple opportunities for something to go wrong and things have gone wrong before so they set up as you said the United states and Russia did this so called confliction\nWhich means something like jeez let's try to avoid an accident and not shoot each other down and there'd been close calls but this confliction mechanism\nHas worked but I've always said you know today it works tomorrow it doesn't work\nIn war zones so much remind are are are folks lifting what happened on September Seventeen Israel attacked Iranian forces it's sad and\nEnded up with the Syrians shooting down a Russian reconnaissance plane it wasn't a comment that flight it was a reconnaissance plane and off Fifteen Russians aboard the plane died [noise] uh\nThe charge was and Israel really didn't deny this they maneuvered\nIn a way to put the Syrian planes chasing the rushing out to the Israeli planes\nThe Syrian shot down the Russian plane so as you say this is where people who study Russia's reactions\nDo more than just read the New York times you go to the source you look at what the Russians pay per se or television or radio and what happened here is very interesting and it confirms a thesis that I've stated on your broadcast for years\nBut people have criticized that in the context of a Russian policy lead ... as a moderate\nHe's moderate\nTheir hawks\nAnd the people more ... the ... and so the first reaction\nI guess is fascinating John was for ... to say it had been a terrible accident\nIn the fog of war\nSo keen exonerated Israel\nThe reaction from Clinton's own ministry of defense was very angry they rejected publicly some of its votes spokesman on radio or TV or the newspapers this explanation and they said Israel did it intentionally\nRight they said the Israeli shot the aircraft down that was not a fact but that was the argument the angry statements in the first hours yes\nThat they just kept saying Israel I yes Israel is responsible and that couldn't didn't want to do that why not first of all a it he had developed very very good relations with Israel\nRussia improvement that would make Yahoo and [noise] so what happened is that is neat and wants to fly to Moscow\nAnd basically either explained a potent are begging forgiveness and ... says no you can't come\nJust a moment ... will continue I'm speaking with professor Stephen F Cohen we're reviewing the new Cold War and the alarming\n\nThe sun's Diamondbacks and cardinals play here I

entered Syria three just about exactly three years ago September two thousand this thing and everybody in the west that it would be a disaster and the Russians couldn't do anything\nWith from that moment\nIt was Russia that destroy the Islamic state knock the United states in Syria\nToo now becoming and remember Mrs Clinton had argued during the two thousand sixteen presidential election that she was crushed\nAnd Russia have come on the world stage by this this fact I mean I don't want to say it in a primitive way because of world politics is not a game but Russia's back in the biggest imaginable way it's a very great world power no matter its problems at home and to the extent\nThat the United states now acknowledges that it will have to acknowledge that it needs Russia's permission to operate in Syria and show does Israel that has a lot of political implications particularly with an American president\nWho can't have a phone call or two and without being called a traitor in this country so we got that's why the Russia gate complicates everything\nLet me just say one other thing and I'll get off of this\nI Want to move to Ukraine to go\nAhead I ... I haven't been amazed you know I have not been amazed because demographically with all the Russians there I saw decades ago coming but how warm and close Israeli in Russian relations have to come over the years not just on a strategic level not just between ... Yahoo but Israel\nThe minister of defense labor minister Russian speaker a large parts of the electorate in Israel are ... not all of them are Jews they're Russians\nSome of them went to school together yeah\nOfficials in the Israeli government and Russian emigrated they went to school together and they were in the young communist league together this is a bond that doesn't exist in the United states uh I think that what we're seeing here is in Israel slowly becoming as close to Russia\nAs it's been to the United states over the years but in more human almost biological historical family ways and therefore they were the close relationship between two Nikki ... over the last two three years\nReflected this now it's been disrupted maybe\nNow we've got you know Fifteen dead\nTo the political relationship but this is a this is I wouldn't say it's a turning point but it's certainly a new situation\nAnd um it would be great more than great as Trump which I I Would like to cooperate I Would like ... as a peace process underway the United states refused to join the best thing Trump can do right now you can join that peace process process in Syria\nSteve more than a year ago two years ago when Russia got involved in theory you said this would happen you you can't you can't see the future you haven't got a crystal ball but you said when you put militaries up against each other in a small space there will be accidents this is an accident\nAnd in the first twenty four hours it was a dangerous accident [noise] it might be defining now but there's no guarantee that it's not going to happen again so I mentioned that professor that when we talk about the escalation cycle it's inevitable we're not making it up it's happened before yes and\nThe the post script or that or or teasing without I agree with you what you just said is there are people there are people in all countries in this case to who say it wasn't an accident\nBecause it was such a profound accident that is Fifteen Russians died that people see Mao us not acts and they say and the other country there are people plan this even if it isn't truth shot\nIt comfortably and this as a new warfare dimension and that's just one of the three Cold War frogs\nAll right we're going to go to another one next we're going to you ... a professor Stephen F Cohen New York university Princeton

G. do all the investigation on it tell us what happened here because the hygiene is going to have ...\nCommittees and really the White House the White House has been calling you know the echoing ah the the the ... and and the death of a new noses of the world\nIn calling for the release of those documents by the FBI well guess what the I. G. doesn't have to call for that yeah gee has access to it directly yep\nSo the I. G. takes this and the president because of the president comes out and says hey we we recognize abuse here we see this based on this ah under adopted material now from the Justice Department\nWill that instantly becomes political especially with this president while the president has that authority to come out and announced that clearly and has the authority to declassify that that's not the issue\nYou take the politics part of it away and you also expedite the process of not just looking at these documents but the I. G. had access to everything in the department of justice\nAnd any kind of trail on devices and everything else that the president would ... ... ... it would it would take a million years for the president called for that and for that to to be handed over\nAnd you take away from Adam Schiff the accusation that you're selectively yet just declassified part of it right because when you give it to the inspector general he's going to cover that part of it okay what are the context of everything that you have released let's expand the investigation and all of a sudden everybody went quiet and the interesting thing is we talked about\nUh uh that you know Deborah Nunez initially was asked what's going on here I mean they they could have done this thing um why give it to the inspector general and then he's gone quiet and everybody has gone quiet on this you hear nothing\nRight\nThe media is not covering it really the mainstream media I haven't seen one story in the mainstream media\nHe only looks at corruption\nRight that's what he's ... he's looking for corruption in the department of justice they redacted this and all of a sudden they don't release it and it goes to the inspector general well did they find out that it's that the the redacted part is things that the inspector general is actually been looking at right now right\nAnd so it goes to it goes to either help is just in the investigation or the fact is he's got all this material that has looked at it already\nAnd it's part of the when you talk about Russia probe Trump didn't say what Russia probe right which one which one\nBecause I read it and said oh Russian pro which Russia probe we initially thought\nYou know could because I I'm On the one time they said well mothers and but\nThe the limit for Mueller's investigation right but on the tweets that Russian probe right and I went oh that must have been Mueller investigation that [laughter] right might not be not there may not be the investigation that they're talking about you did what any mother he said Russia probe I'm like whoa now look at the pattern of behavior\nThe in the entire history of this this whole thing starting in the beginning of twenty Seventeen right yeah what was that pattern of behavior leaked to the media how many of those leagues favored Trump or almost or maybe exactly zero zero\nSo you have this situation\nThere are people on Capitol Hill and in the Justice Department that are not obviously not Trump on Trump's side if if they're under redacted classified material had\nDamaging information about Trump wouldn't we at least start hearing those types of rumors the sources\nHe also turned it over to the inspector general if it were because it wouldn't serve him\nPolitically I don't know it's not required to turn it over to the ... right but I don't think this I don't think any of this has any information that Trump was involved in this was all the up yeah in the department of just I Know but what I'm saying is it would be damaging to Trump that they were finding\nSomething on him all older okay okay there's about ... was actually I wanted to show was legit right that is going to go OK okay right that it is that the whole thing was legitimate right and it was based on something real\nWe haven't heard that and if that were the case when the president habits what he turned it over to the G ... he isn't required to do that eight six six Ninety right out [noise]\n[noise] he ... he wrote a bone regarded radio [noise]\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday morning at one am central it's the freight minor runs smart our on red eye radio tuned in to help you run more efficiently brought you by freight line or trucks\nAttention for national drivers now with all the one from T.

... ah so\nI ... the FBI report could be released a at excuse me the ... that would be correct I keep we keep saying the FBI investigation everybody's doing it the FBI background check but the by the FBI report on\nEarly as today sources are telling a variety of different media out there this morning so we will see whether that happens or not or if that happens or there could be a vote as early as as friday\nRight or the Senate majority leader a talking to the press yesterday they [laughter] the failed dot com said that the GOP was being coy about when they would vote when he wasn't being coy majority leader made it clear look you all know how this works\n... culture has to be filed and you can't have a vote until forty eight hours after cloture\nAnd then you move on to the vote you know two days later so it's not like you can uh you have culture and then all of a sudden you can instantly do a vote doesn't work that way\nSo essentially telling the media that you know you'll you'll know it's gonna be two days out at least two days out\nYou know from the point of culture on so\nThat puts it at least right now that puts it\nAh as early as\nFriday if it were to happen today or as many have already said over uh the last few days\nThat they could see a vote on the Senate floor you know Saturday or even Sunday which would still give time\nAh to the president if if he is confirmed Kavanaugh's confirmed to ah ah to have him sworn in and and then stated on the bench on Monday having only missed the first week of activity there you go to\nIs actually an important to have a ... a development here will tell you what bunch market says but a reading here from National Review Chuck Grassley has sent a letter to Dr Ford's lawyer requesting more information specifically Grassley wants the therapists\nAre ... are the therapist notes all audio or video recordings produced\nThe audio visual or any other documentation of talking to any other reporter or anyone else at any media organization\nOr are they believe that some material has been passed to a nationally circulated newspaper but not provided to the Senate or he suggests this was a lack of candor\nAdjacent to these requests is a paragraph that reads from Grassley the full details of Dr ports polygraph are particularly important\nBecause the Senate Judiciary committee has received a sworn statement from a long time boyfriend of Dr Ford stating\nThat he personally witness Dr Ford coaching a friend on a polygraph examination when asked under oath in the hearing whether she'd ever given any tips for advice to someone who was planning on taking a polygraph Dr Ford replied never\nBecause at first rationally asked it before she testified but is there just to the Senate had the power to subpoena\nThose those are\nThose documents that information I mean is it binding legally I guess my question now that she's testified because that's where the official claim is made in regards to the Senate committee in consideration for Brett Kavanaugh\nAs Supreme Court justice so would that not be part of the legal process\nAre her lawyers legally bound to turn that over I don't know I I didn't see anybody right it that way I'm just asking a question but I Would think because it's part of the process and they presented the results as part of the evidence\nThan they would be compelled to turn that information over\nSo I don't know at an interesting point I don't know I ... yeah I don't know that either I don't do it though because it's different before\nVideo any any audio or video related to it um because as as they as she officially basically and then under oath she testified in and use that as part of the evidence he still requesting it and hasn't gotten and hasn't gotten it I Wonder if they're just delaying\nOr you know if they believe that they lay long enough that the vote will get through this whole thing goes away I don't know that they're legally compelled to or not I'm not sure I'm just asking the question eight six six Ninety road I\nDare he was the high profile I guess you connected to U.S Mexican and Canadian negotiations that led to what is being called the U.

her which means they're accusing view of sexual assault on an allegation alone that's a personal attack on you as an individual but still that's all they have boiled but it was a professional that cause you're running\nOut of any type of argument\nTo defend the person that you were hoping\nCould ensure that cabin on number serves on the Supreme Court of the United states we know what it's about we know what is what it's always been about I just wonder what happens if you get to the point where are\nWe know I mean after the ... and I don't know is the FBI 'cause we we asked you know where's the FBI going with this background check are they going to talk to forge old boyfriend and for Jordan old boyfriend identified\nA a four and a girl friend identified her by name a ... as saying she told this woman I'll help\nThat woman\nAnd I said earlier she's alive the reason I said that as she can only be a witness if he's alive but if she's alive and they find her and she's willing to testify and she says yeah I mean under oath yet she\nHelped me do it you've got a perjury charge everything falls apart it's already all of these cases are falling ... every day another layer is being peeled from these allegations against Kavanaugh [noise] I I think\nRight now and again you know I don't know the answer the question I asked earlier about her lawyers being compelled to ah to forward that information and materials that\nAre Chuck Grassley a called for but assume that's not the case and they're not legally compelled to do so even still they would resist doing it uh I think they're going to resist whether they are legally compelled compelled or not\nBut the they're likely doing that why well because if if she's telling the truth during the lie detector test which\nThey say I mean that's the whole point of all I did check their test is that you passed it\nExcept there were different questions\nIf they asked a different question and she answered that question truthfully she would pass a\n\nVideo and audio the methodology of that test is important\n\nAnd so if you use that as part of the proof to cooperate that it did happen now that you were telling other people because it doesn't cooperate the crime no it just it it just and we can't even get to the point\nOf her the ... the the what she says his cooperation that she had been talking about this but she won't even let that evidence to be seen\nTalking about it like you said you said certain things but you have been released\nEverything that the therapist has sorry when you make the accusation and you say this is what backs up not the crime because you have nothing to cooperate the crime so you're you came in with your lawyers as the secondary\nA point you were going to make well maybe you know where that hoping that the witness was my cooperate you and they didn't\nSo your second point was but I've been talking about it for years and that should give me credibility and you won't release that evidence to the people who are the judges in this case mhm well then you lose even more credibility and that's why when they say she's credible\nWhen the members of the Democrats' Senate station Judiciary Committee say she's credible well you can't make that case because on every single instance when you want to get to the credibility by getting more evidence that she actually has\nHer lawyers refused to hand it over\nBecause if she is telling the truth and has been all along why would he refused to hand it over in fact why would you not voluntarily handed over without being asked\nBecause here is the proof here's everything you need to know here are my notes are here the therapists notes here are here is the audio\nAnd or video\nFrom the lie detector test you would be out to prove that this happened isn't she out to prove it happened\nYeah well you you're going to hand over everything voluntarily why would her lawyers not encourage her to do that listen Dr Ford this is going to vindicate you this is going to show why would you not be doing that\nAt least it sets a at least it sets the pat\nWhat's the evidence that it's it's the most evidence that you had that you even been talking about it yes and you decide\nYour case but it doesn't work that way right you are in which case to begin with that would give you a little path to go down and you're saying no sorry you can't have that I mean you would have you\nWould want to provide everything that was within your control to provide what the other people say in terms of people corroborating her story or or or or not that's on them you can't can you can't compel them to a testify or you can't compel them\nA Dr Ford can't her lawyers can't compel them to talk to the FBI or any of that\nBut what they can do what is in within their control is\nTurning over every piece of evidence that you have in your control and why would you not do that that helps to build your case you write Gary doesn't prove anything\nBut if your doctor forced position you're looking to be vindicated didn't show that this happened because you're being criticized and your credibility has been criticized\nAll along the way you have not proven

I've been watching this up for a long time I've ever seen anything like going on with respect to judge Kavanaugh Thursday high quality person is a number one that's often select he's he's ever gone through anything like this I think he did very well\nI think he's a great job he's known as the gray\nOne disappointment I don't think you people suffered and that's very important\nOne is over the last Thirty years\nYou're going back to ice or you're going back to college\nHas he done over the last Thirty years\nHe has in fact you know he's been a tremendous tremendous except\nThere's only one problem with that and that is Americans and I'll tell you what I say that we our society that has a very very short attention span we are a society that has a very short memory so if you're going to rely on\nBrett Kavanaugh being confirmed by his body of work I'm over the last Thirty years\nI got to tell you the truth I don't think Americans are real familiar with well let's say they are let's just for the sake of argument say they are okay I Will say to you\nThat most people would say if I said that was personally was the greatest singer guitar player of all time most people would say oh

even could tell you who won the Superbowl last year our attention span is so short\nThat to say and I agree\nI think Brett Kavanaugh is a very very good\nJustice I think he is a very good judge I think he would be great on the Supreme Court I think the fact that we have run them through the coals like this is terrible because he has been guilty until proven innocent and I don't like that\nThat is an American but on the other side of the fence\nI can see because I'm not a part is and like all the other people were talking about I can see why\nPeople would not vote for him because of those issues of his teenage in college years I can understand that and I think it's fair to get to the bottom of it and as a matter of fact\nThe swing vote in this whole thing ended up being Jeff Flake okay Jeff Flake says\nThat if in fact the latest stories that came out yesterday the letter that justice Kavanaugh wrote by hand\nAnd talked about himself being of ... and a noxious drunk\nHe made it out like that alone his own admission of that was enough for him to vote against the confirmation\nAnd at that point is over he said at once again I'm no fan of Jeff Flake in any way shape or form okay

are senators that they should\nDown on the Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd complete investigation I think it was important I'm very concerned about uh\nYou know the testimony of a woman or do they need to be listening to it was without any question about it and I thought it made sense to slow down and it turned out that's where the Senate went when they were in that in that hearing\nWhen I look at things now as to what you believe or what I Believe or with somebody else out here believes we're not getting very far on this and I don't know what's gonna happen when the FBI comes in but here's my observation and the lessons we're learning\nChris we're in a zero sum game it's like the flip a coin\nI flip the coin heads I win tails you lose or you flip the coin and it's you know you got heads you win and I lose you can't run politics you can't run life then as a zero game environment\nAnd so it's like when you were in that environment all the tactics are permitted you can say anything about anybody you can 'cause it's all about me winning you losing\nWe can't live our lives that way and then we get to our tongues you know our tongues which one person wrote to make it was even in scripture that the tongue is more powerful than the rubber on the ship and we use this tongue as a weapon and we use social media now as a weapon almost a virtual tons\nTo say things that we ended up turning around and we apologize to our spouses we apologize to our friends we apologize to her business partners and guess what sometimes we can heal it and we got to all wake up that I don't have to

dad not one million as you can imagine the White House is fighting back\nUh we'll give you that retort\nNumber two they read the Democrat to faith better than five weeks all of them are in states where the polling shows that Republicans strongly support the president they strongly support that cap it off and one of the number one reason they went to vote and twenty six tame by the Supreme

rat and we're talking all this stuff Nineteen eighty Josh homes is with us now former chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell president founding partner of calvary yellow sea Josh you know Mitch McConnell well do you he says we're going to have a vote this week do you believe that he will\nYeah I Do I Do Brian I'm you know they work through this process which has just been absolutely horrible and I think we should probably spend a minute talking about a regrettable it is how we got here in the first place but uh you know McConnell's been working when you have fifty one member yeah fifty\nOne different personalities people just um react to different things and\nYou know last week we got to the point where three Republican senators expressing reservations about moving forward without a another FBI investigation that the seven now that Kavanaugh will have undergone\nA and so that's happening and I I I think if you listen to McConnell he expects that that'll come back\nToday or tomorrow and apple time for senators to review it and cast a vote on friday\nNow a one on one you know the it's the same a cast of moderate Republicans usually or people anti Trump hers they'd give Mitch McConnell of a hard time can you tell me how he's going to go about dealing with Collins Murkowski and flake\nListens to them right I mean is it like I said it's a different stimulus for each senator and there are a large number of vast majority of Republican senators at this\nYeah and and I mean I I agree with that but but I think you've got senators Collins Murkowski in like\nA colon since done an amazing amount of due diligence on a cabin all met with them for over an hour of viewed every one of his uh uh decisions as a judge and has gone through everything and she wants to be absolutely sure that she's got a handle on everything\nThere now Murkowski in particular wanted this FBI investigation and so now that she's got that\nI suggest it you know she she made it very clear in meetings after Senator Flake brokered is quote unquote deal that um these are the parameters\nThat she would be comfortable with and she would move forward once the FBI or investigation came back and assuming it didn't reveal anything we didn't already know now I assume that she is she's also going to be\nComfortable with the end of the day when we also\nHave ... ... it's not just the three Republican you've got senators like Joe Manchin of West Virginia whose indicated that he's open for business and you got senator Heidi Heitkamp who has an announce one way or another I doubt very highly that she would vote for any Republican Supreme Court nominee at this stage but but\nBut perhaps in the least they haven't ruled it out as every other Democrat Senator has\nRight a good couple of things you know when we're healthcare went down I Know he was disappointed but this is personal for him what does the Supreme Court mean to him\nJohn means a lot it means a lot you know going back very early stages in his career he had a heavy focused on the judiciary and then of course his career before he became majority leader was defined by\nA judicial flight that ultimately went to the Supreme Court and McConnell the SEC where he sued the federal government over the McCain Feingold\nCampaign finance laws um and lost five four\nAnd you know if ever you want to have a a sense for how important are the Supreme Court is you'd lose five four at the Supreme Court and so you know he's dedicated the last Fifteen\nTaking us through Merrick Garland and everything else to where we are today\nI Want you here with the president said that I don't think it's helpful to Mitch McConnell but you might know different cut to\nThirty six years ago this happened\nI had one right I Want to be\nWell do you think it was I was wondering\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't know\nSo and so it was really the first time he's been remarkably disciplined over the last two weeks but not last night doesn't matter\nIf it's not my favorite stuff for sure but but I also understand his frustration you know you look at a New York times every day and got a new report we know that Brett Kavanaugh throws ice we know that he writes letters student's roommates caught on the ... of noxious drunks we've tried to assassinate his\nCharacter and every English in every paper and English speaking language and yet nobody is not as simple property check on\nOn Dr Ford or any of the people who have come forward and\nAccused Brett Kavanaugh of everything from from gang rape to being at\nA tawdry parties so I understand that frustration and I think highlighting some of those inconsistencies as inevitable it's also part of the reasons why this process should never gotten here in the first place you the kind of allegations\nThat you would have gay behind closed doors and the Judiciary Committee often does to make sure that you protect noxious the accused but the accuser\nHey you know and you know what I'm Wondering Josh or the one thing about Democrats in less who was the same boat for example you don't didn't fight for the Senate deal did the Iranian deal because it was a bad deal but the president said you don't have to worry about it I'm going to implement it anyway I mean President Obama but for the most part the Democrat stuck together\nAnd I wouldn't say they just no matter if they're a moderate liberals are most are on the left they'll stick together Republicans never have that\nMitch McConnell's always doing was Murkowski encounter major issues there's always a\nSenator Lugar sometimes and others who would take on President Bush and other things why is it hard for the Republicans tonight\n[noise] well Democrats don't have moderate you know it's kind of like a\nFun little retrospect to hearken back to the days of of\nPresident Kennedy and others who had you know more of a moderate ideology but now you look at the Democratic party and Elizabeth Warren find yourself in the mainstream you know this is this is a party that derives its energy from\nAbolish ice in a peach President Trump and some of the most radical ideas that you can come up with and in American government and so you know what the Republican Party I Love if everybody agreed on everything absolutely but I'm also Greg glad that they got big enough tent where we can appeal\nTo the whole faith based on where they live you know these people can be won over that's where it used to be a Leslie Josh of the United states might have done one of the most significant things they got just bury decide really the president's fault\nAnd that is redoing NAFTA us MCA whatever it's called a ... but it's done and I just had I talked to a dairy farmer on television and hour ago or ... praise\nThis deal this is unbelievable this is a worker former delivery is if the president promised and delivered\nTotally incredible and it's the first time any president and even try right I mean we've heard\nFrom the Democratic party and particularly the last Thirty years every campaign cycle is about how bad NAFTA is an hour shipping jobs overseas and tell President Trump braces that agenda and that every Democrat talks about how great NAFTA is\nAnd and the bottom line is the first president is actually a rolled up his sleeves and went to work at trying to make a make it better for American workers across the country right like he set includes farmers that quiz manufacturing includes\nAll the the the tenets of the American economy that have been really neglected for a whole lot of years\nGood good fighting back against the taxes they think are just Republicans can't it hasn't been affected in a packaging the success save at well let's see if that changes I Know you help get Mitch McConnell reelected in twenty fourteen and he wants to hold on to the Senate and his power Josh Holmes thanks so much\nThank you so much appreciate abroad go get them a one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine I'm going to talk to you in just a moment you're on your on the

Nick\nNo I'm Talking about the ex boyfriend of Mrs for he said I watched her administer polygraph test she perjury herself\nShe yeah you're right she did she did to help a friend because she's a she's a therapist a psychologist who's ... she did help a friend a coach your friend through a polygraph test and she answers and no I've never done that she did\nAnd you know she knows how to pass one obviously and that was would uh I guess the prosecuting attorney maybe new that ahead of time I'm not sure but I'm sure they did ask the question so here's the president didn't go after sweat next attorney he obviously does not like ... and I don't blame him I don't either country\nWe I don't know the woman reporter\nOr no I mean\nTurned out [noise]\nEven NBC who was as bad as again [noise]\nEven NBC couldn't shelter where that is if you did you\nTeenage Brett Kavanaugh a standby punch bowl and then you found out later that these punch bowls were spike so\nDidn't see him spike the punch bowl with quite lose or any type of liquor but he was standing by their he didn't do anything in terms of solving or that he knows of\nBut he was in a group he wasn't in a line for groups actually was in a group well huddled around a room that had group sex in it she sadly is assaulted if it was indeed true but people around her including a parents don't really believe it\nNow on the earlier topic on the polygraph\nFormer FBI assistant director for intelligence Kevin ... talked to Shannon last night about these claims of Ford training of friends for the polygraph test got twenty three\nIs standard in a polygraph to have one or two operative questions that are asked um so but\nIf somebody wants to look at the recordings that want to see how the question was framed they want to hear what the actual answers were [noise] um but I Will say my experience and I've dealt with political first both from the FBI and those who are hired privately a\nWhen you hire a Pulitzer for you get what you pay for that's been my experience is as simple as that uh nobody should be surprised that an outcome of a polygraph ah from somebody that you hire largely comports with the outcome you're looking for\nThey know what to ask the questions and she knows how to ask questions now we know she was helping a friend passed one\nSo do you see the problem ... if she sexual assault is terrible but if she was Koester phobic that's not true it doesn't seem that you couldn't ... she lived in a five hundred foot square apartment five hundred feet with one entrance that according to a boyfriend of six years\nShe's not afraid to fly she lied about that not afraid to fly lately yeah and we don't do it shows no words you can't really left out so there's a huge problem with the story you know how I Know Michelle they're now looking at bread cop and all this\nSo I thought I Can't and he lied under oath and she died\nAll right thanks Michele Richard in Montreal Richard you disagree with me you think it was a good move for the president to start ripping her last night on stage in Mississippi\nYes I thought it was an excellent idea he pointed out all her life these aren't inconsistencies these aren't bling lies and all these journalists who continue to say how credible she is and they're not even on the other networks are not even reporting about her ex boyfriends letter and as Chris Wallace going to report that on Fox from\nThe south 'cause he likes to cover up everything to now he doesn't like to cover up falling covers up plenty of things I I I don't think he's covered up I really don't\nOh he did he did a report that the [noise] anyway it covers he's not going to report this he covers everything up the attacks Trump day and night and I'm tired of it that's why he's always up with ... Smith the ship Smith hates President Trump how come I never see Chris Wallace on Sean Hannity's show\nWell um he doesn't do the nighttime shows he does Tucker and he does shot and um he tries to stay off the opinion shows he does because he does not want to be listed as a Republican or Democrat host it doesn't do any good\nAre these people who could Chuck Todd and they go he's left you know they they look at which I actually think the new host Margaret Brennan on face the nation is pretty fair I Do or this week a joy to have an apple is when people see George Stephanopoulos ac Bill Clinton I don't care how good is questions are bad questions or so Chris Wallace his goal is to say tough questioner\nThat's it he's ... he's not going to be afraid to go after you\nSo I Know what frustrates people but I Do say I I don't know anybody who doesn't think Chris is fair uh but I Know that some people think that maybe he should be easier on the president I I kind of like his tone it it helps me get ready for this year\nThey listened W. H. I. O. in Dayton, Ohio he Dave [noise]\nPrevious caller that and I don't agree\nWith Joe ... show thank you love your show and I love watching you know ... for it anyway a\n... and we don't usually with with the issue is you um you see problems and I see problems with forward story I think it's tactically\nIt doesn't help Trump gets fifty one votes he needs by going out there\nAnd and making a cartoon of it nothing he said was inaccurate but you don't say everything you think it's especially because your audience is this\nNot to the audience in Mississippi it Susan Collins and Murkowski because and Jeff Flake who you might not be able to win over but just don't make it easy for him I feel like\nYou have just made it harder for Collins to vote for Kavanaugh that's my point\nOkay okay well I can kinda understand you're on their get no Senate or the other but as far as Trump supporters I mean people are so many people turned out that he rallies that they can't even get in\nYou know for our lines and they still they go home and they still want to watch struck this report charged up I'm not worry on a little bit\nI'll tell you what the lead in the last Quinnipiac poll shows you shouldn't be worried at least you have a reason not to worry that much because Republican favorability is rising\nUh in just the last three weeks in September a day thanks and by the way you don't

and everywhere else a and alerted way he comes from a deep background in politics and more as well as race relations what the hell do you have to lose the name of the book one Trump's war on civil rights now this is Trump's line was used that line title\nBecause I thought it was such a such a provocative line some people say condescending other people say straight truth and then\nTrump said black community in this country\nMight as well live in Afghanistan here I'm paraphrasing but it's that Afghanistan is a direct quote\nThat things are worse in the black community than they are in Afghanistan because of poverty violence in the street you know Chicago Brian people shooting each other not bad schools all the rest are and he said well what do you have to lose why not why are you voting for Hillary Clinton and not for me right so this was like such a powerful question and the book is an answer\nHe distorted the reality of what it is to be black in America in twenty Eighteen\nAt a time when forty percent of the black population this country's making between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars twelve percent a hundred to two hundred thousand so I'm clear majority of black America\nIs in the middle class or beyond so these are striving people given what obstacles exist historically slavery legal discrimination ongoing biased especially in the public's the private sector\nI Would think boy what a great American story people who at times had had some difficulties been denied equal I Believe in American the American dream\nInstead President Trump

Would sound that indignant if I were a if I felt that I was unjustly maligned but then it went on the interaction with the members\nWere sharp and partisan and that concerns me\nOr that is\nAbsolutely right Kavanaugh is absolutely right in the sense that this was a coordinated campaign designed by innuendo and false representation\nTo smear the guy's reputation including accusations of gang rape I\nMean anybody that would not be upset in fact\nBrian I remember one Michael Dukakis was asking a debate what would you do if somebody murdered his wife or something terrible what would you do and they gave this kind of bland and emotional response he got pilloried for that and here's a guy that comes out swinging when people were swinging at him\nAnd he's getting pilloried for that I think he's a human being\nFirst and I'm with you and the thing is to if you're somebody in society that's working their way up and then somebody ... it's tough enough but when you break Cather you spent the last thirty plus years living is a very laudable life are on and off the on the job in off the job\nAnd they want to go back to the Nineteen eighties and call you a gang rapist and drunk\nAnd you watch your kids and you see them upset and you watch your parents and you see how humiliating they are and you wonder what happened in my life I was about to get the most prestigious job in America\nAnd now I have to worry that my integrity might be last forever I thoroughly get it but the fact that people are talking about this now temperament\nAnd they're talking about high school drinking does that also show you they have nothing else\nHave gotten nothing else for one thing I think a little bit of a different take on it the people coming after him with their questions were being highly partisan again using innuendo to attempt to do exactly what you are saying\nDestroy his reputation he could either ignored it either pretend they weren't bi partisan they weren't using innuendo and miss truth to tarnish him or he could come right back out I'm I'm my gosh at some point you just got a call people out for what they're doing I think\nThe career this supposed to be given back in your mind\nSo I understand your frustration you talk like a real person or on a regular basis with a God of experience but I Want you to hear what I think is a this just blew the lid off Jeff Flake for me and I like the guy you know I thought for a while I thought he'd get over the fact that he doesn't like the Republican president but he despises them\nAnd then they thought well he got yelled at in the elevator and he was overcome with emotion he didn't want women to think that he was ignoring the allegations of sexual assault so he called for this FBI investigation and Republicans had no choice but listen to why he did it listen\nSenator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running out of ... and not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp two parties that there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nI thought he was doing what was right now he's talking about currency and value and politics if he was staying on the job like you wore he would never done what he did what does that make you think about the authenticity here\n[noise] um let's just say\nThat if you come to see if you think something is right you do and it's important you do it no matter what including no matter what the electoral politics period end of story and that's what you're elected for and every now and you take a vote and you still have to explain it and I may not be able to explain it well but that's what you do\nAnd so I'm going to disagree with Senator Flake no ... for his position that may be the case but also for I'm I'm the better way would be it was important is the right thing to do I'm taking the vote and let's see what the consequences are by the way I think John McCain did that on numerous occasions\nI obviously or he did that and he got under George Bush's skin and he got under a obviously Donald Trump skin a lot\nNow and it probably in New York who knows could happen to me tomorrow\nIs all these protesters disturbing everyday life people trying to do their jobs or spend time with their families or or a loved ones we saw with Ted Cruz last week\nWe saw it with a we saw with cures Nielsen we saw with Sarah Huckabee Sanders and that's just off the top of my head Mitch McConnell at the airport and then member Jeff Flake got harassed right here on friday listen\nYou're not you know\nWe we know what happened he didn't say a word or he was a he was saying you know she was obviously something horrible happened to her and she was taking out and Jeff Flake but listen to what happened to let everybody here what happened when you got confronted by a protest or listen\nTo what we're not for\nEveryone they're the\n\nAre you OK as a person to go ahead and not a criminal charges for\nGoing\nTo fall\nAnd that's what she got a full FBI investigation center Cassie you actually you know we worry about being politically correct you actually are actually engaged the issue in the protest here she was not ready for that\nAm being politically correct Brian because by golly give our country gets to the point where an accusation can destroy somebody which everyone who is there says isn't true I can tell you that everybody in our country is subject to being destroyed and\nHave you been harassed by protesters I hear they're crawling all over the uh the Capitol building\n[noise] um they're all over\nThe Capitol building um but on the other hand a it is time to push back it is time to push back on people to think that uncorroborated accusations are enough to destroy a life lived a above reproach up until these uncorroborated accusations\nUm and if we don't do that prime they're coming after everybody\nA there is no there is no stop as to as to how this weapon works\nYou know that the president brought up the other day in fact he said last night at the rally cut five\nThat's a very scary guy for young men in America when you can be a guilty of something that you may not be guilty of this is a very very very difficult time [noise]\nWhat's happening here has much more to do that even the appointment of a Supreme Court just [noise] it really does this route you are certainly guilty until proven innocent\nAnd Chris Coons said as much the president recognizes do you think we're talking about something even bigger than this\nTotally by the way this is just to the left or just started going to the they went up to Nikki Haley saying girl is things about Nikki Haley\nUm and so somehow um they're going to charge again ... to rumors as a way to discredit people in the right um and you can't prove a negative so of course you say how do you just proven negative\nUm uh the Christians and others know better than that but there's just a taxi to destroy\nI tend to Cassie give me your prediction it do you have you heard that the FBI report is in will you be one of the senators had read it carefully\nAbsolutely I'm really carefully because I have no doubt it's going to be misrepresented by those on the left and\nYou've got to respect them but nonetheless I if if people on the left are going to be ... be misrepresenting than people who are right need to be able to set the record straight\nSo then the procedure would be if it comes in today you have a cloture vote tomorrow and then you could vote on ... tomorrow will be Thursday coach a vote on friday and then you'd actually have a floor vote on Saturday\nTo thirty hours and so whenever that runs out whatever time it's first filed suit was filed at ten o'clock at night on friday a Sunday Morning that sort of thing\nAnd we ... center Cassie or would you talk personally to Centre College Murkowski make your case\nYou know we are having we have regularly scheduled lunches and there is a group discussion and they fully participate I have great respect for my colleagues and I speak other speak\nBut we speak to a group or not Hector anybody we're speaking to a group respecting the need for folks to come to a decision I think the process is working very well\nDo you think we'll all we should all see that recipe I report\nOr if you could one let's face it a Kavanaugh's than smeared\nAnd as Mitch McConnell says the first one is obituary will refer to the such terrible it can't hurt

six seven at night\nYou're listening to the bride Julie Joe and you're a home for a new dog and stored in the way down\nI talked to [noise]\nBe performing the behavior\nUh was was quite out of bounds I don't ever remember anything like that and you know somebody who has\nTestified a under difficult circumstances I Would wonder about you were never so emotional well look\nFor eleven hours you couldn't event\nOr that is a Hillary Clinton speaking to the Atlantic\nI Am so over Hillary Clinton and George Democrats are listed approval rating I think it's in the thirties amongst her own party more to become I'm never over I Can't get enough you watch the stories seven o'clock and she's already here in Studio if you're smart enough to be watching the stream\n... welcome back to science where you started this whole thing with your interviewer Brett Kavanaugh yeah\nI mean it's remarkable alright what a week on as you know I feel I feel like the ... and all that I spoke to um that Monday morning last Monday\nThe Brett Kavanaugh that was on Thursday was kind of simmering loaded beneath the surface he was obviously very upset very stressed out very uh intensely concerned about this entire situation where there's during his family\nBut he's trying to keep a lid on it and I feel like by Thursday he had been advised or maybe it was his own decision to let that led just pop off and that's what we saw in there\nAre obviously a ... but people are saying that he went over the top and they're worried about his temperament now among them is somebody he really has to win over and that is Jeff Flake cut their team\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the remarks or the initial defense that too\nSo ... if I were if I felt that I was unjustly middle maligned but then it went on the interaction with the members were shore and partisan and the concerns me\n[noise] so where do you think flake is with that [noise]\nWell I I'm going to say that I think like it's still open minded um\nI talked to him about this last night he believes that Jeff Flake is still open minded\nUm but he was clearly disturbed by judge Kavanaugh as a performance and I and you know he's especially in so pretty clearly tried to walk back a little bit after that it said I was talking about the judge I'm Talking about the whole situation\nI think it's grossly unfair no matter where you stand on this to come after him for his temperament and that hearing if he had gone in there all controlled like he was on Monday morning people would say he has no passion if you were accused ... how could you just sit there and answer the questions like that\nThere's no satisfying some people on this issue clearly and you know when you look back at what Clarence Thomas said to that Judiciary Committee he was as angry as Brett Kavanaugh was their different people so it's expressed in different ways but he went after them and slammed them for their political edition of his process in no uncertain terms\nAnd nobody is saying that judge that Judge Thomas shouldn't have been serving on the court all these years\nUm I I think it's grossly unfair and I also think given as judicial history it's it's very unfair to suggest that because he has personal feelings about what he's been through that he's going to throw all that are out the window as a judge 'cause we've already seen for the past twelve years on the circuit court\nThat he has a very um appropriate judicial temperament so you know I\nDon't know I don't think that some people would be happy with his response either way\nAre you telling you have a son in college I Do are you telling him right now if he screws up he's not going to get on the Supreme Court [noise] have you told him you know that's one of my\nSons about this and them and my daughter as well\nKevin ... is when the it's a charges have been leveled against and back then to think\nThat you could be\nSomething from that far back come up after thirty six years of your history and your work life is is sending it really is\nAnd that's who are at because we're still debating about what he did on beach week or thirty four years ago Martha sticking around rank you'll meet Joe phone calls next\n\nInteresting challenge [noise] I'd talk show host point seven million K I find that each station [noise]\nIt to anyone until twenty twelve and then it came out in the therapist discussions and that it's in the notes so that that's consistent with their story that she didn't share it with him in the late nineties\nYeah so that is uh something that popped up and now we also understand to according to the boyfriend\nThe export friends is I don't have an extra grind that Dr Ford helped a friend of hers prepare for a potential polygraph exam Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect how public gross work and help with clean become familiar and less nervous about the exam when asked did you did have you ever take one or prepare for 'em before she said she\nHadn't yeah no I mean that if that if his story is true that potential for lying under oath and that was interesting question when it came up when the prosecutor asked that question did you ever health anywhere for path I see where she's coming from here and now it appears that perhaps they had you know some of that testimony that led to that question I thought that was very interesting so with\nThis sweat next story is fascinating because I have an oddity who feels like he's on a roll with Stormy Daniels which is an odd things to say a feels like I got another client and this guy's going to blow everything up yeah she did a her credibility she goes out there and says\nWell your your your Brett Kavanaugh was by the punch bowl did he spike it no we still don't know it was standing there at the al ... solo cups around standing there at handling girls drinks who came to the party to go to a party I Would assume parties that he is even confirm these there and she's a college person\nAnd then she stood outside a doorway when there was group sex going on and he might have been somebody who has a reminder\nOf image she's got so many ...\nFifteen to like twenty five I think she said you know and then I I mean it's just so her story has so many holes in it\nIt's incredible I I Can't figure out how and then he said oh can you know some of your friends who are with you there verify that you were there and NBC called all four of the friends they couldn't get one of them to verify her story or\nAlan Dershowitz was on he said that I think that outbreak capital should be confirmed but he wanted to see an FBI investigation first Kevin ... speaks she speaks he says I think they're I think he's in it you know I think you should be confirmed but I still want to see the FBI investigation\nAnd I would start and I didn't know where it's coming from the time which I think that's the third accuser thought to myself why ...\nI think the FBI to investigate every single one of her claims and if it turns out if it turns out that she made it up out of whole cloth that she never met cabin on that she was several years older than that she along with others or by herself\nSimply made up a story the FBI should conclude that she should be tried for perjury and she should be sent to prison this becomes a very important education moment because we have to teach the women of the world and the men of the world\nThat there is no genetically linked aspect of telling the truth\nI think that he makes an excellent point\nAnd I think this is what we all need to get back to the idea that all women should be believed is a false premise\nWe need to strip away gender some questions of truth it doesn't matter who's the man and who's the woman in his toys what matters is who's telling the truth and you know there's a lot that we still need to discover there's a ton of these stories out there\nBut if you strip that away you are at least on the right course to figuring out where the truth lies yeah and I think that's where we're at a now when Donald\nFor my son's here's where Donald Trump senior should cut it\nWas just a time when your father\nOne your husband or your brother when your son\nA terrible things you're stopping a person was never meant should that are just things that was horrible and they're firing me from my job mom I don't know what to do\nThem ... about I think you know\nAnd who do you worry about more your your daughter or your\nYou know what I worry about them equally when it comes to this and I would say that one of the big lessons for young women from this whole thing is as hard as it is\nIf something happens to you you need to document it right away you need to tell people what happened do you need to tell your parents you need to tell the police you need to have whatever evidence you can possibly grow up in that situation to prove\nBeyond a reasonable doubt that what you say happened to you that is my message for young women and I think it's a very important\nFor young men they need to be extraordinarily careful because we're living in a time in this meat you moment where the pendulum has swung too far and where an accusation becomes an indictment and that is not the judicial system that we live in in this country\nExactly a and by the way the other thing I Want to go to Theresa W okay the business in other words you wanted to bring up a few Theresa Martha ... so you're getting sued for short seven o'clock you want to talk with the protesters\nYeah um my issue with them is like with the women have accused him like the protests are in the um elevator\nJust because she wants to come out there and screen everyone thinks oh my gosh something that happened to her how do we know that I feel like I Believe in the uh liberals when they say\nAnybody think that these women are the type of people that could do that because we saw that on TV we saw all the women were in the ... we saw what they were doing and we heard what they were saying I mean there was a woman\nI Can't remember what ... was she was on the TV talking about very gross things that you know go along with women's bodies every month and it's almost like they were wanting to blame all men I just don't get it\nRight or they come out and they say that this happened to me we don't know that\nAll right I I Would say the either yawn that you don't know whether or not you know the women in the elevator went through these experiences I'm going to see and they did I I I think they probably did\nUm but their experience does not translate to this situation\nThese crimes are individual crime they are not a broad brush that you see all men with each one of them it needs to be determined on its validity and so do you know Jeff Flake and Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Christine afford\nTheir situation that they're all determining the truth is completely separate from every other one of the situation I was Bill Cassidy do when he was confronted yesterday listen\nThe more women are more down\nEveryone there is a\nThe doctor when it was for you okay with the person to go ahead and stuff and not currently charges would move\nThink we're going to do more to do this on the phone\nI hadn't heard that exchange that is really remarkable\nAlso to see the president tapping into this about you know your son your husband because that that's a very bold strategy and the president never shies away from saying that he something that he thinks is tapping into what a lot of people are feeling in the country\nBut I Do think that men are the majority of which are good and and don't spend their time assaulting are attacking women feel under siege I and we're actually going to a men's pound tonight we did a women's paint on the other night uh for moms\nAnd we had people on both sides of the fence who felt that you know Kevin ... was was guilty and and other women who said that you know that they didn't feel like the charges have been proven\nTo never going to talk to men are about how they feel about about this issue\nGreat uh Martha ... going to host or show at seven o'clock tonight we're back to wrap up this hour brand kill

and gentleman [noise]\nI Can't say for certain the judge Kavanaugh was president and the frat house Uribe event but he was still at Yale during the time period attending Yale Law school and I suspect he may have attended what would have been a big party and the ... the newly purchased off campus house what and why are you talking about more Rodman\nYou see ladies and gentlemen this is the problem\nThere are no valid accusations against bread capital [laughter]\nThey're saying that he should be responsible for what happened at a frat because he may or may not have been on campus back in the Nineteen eighties that's what we're talking about here it's it's despicable [noise] All right let's go to the phones Lakeland, Florida Paul welcome to the program\nOh it's a it's a pleasure to listen to you you're actually using words that sound like we have some emotional ... who knows um they give her a commentary I wanted to answer your question in regards to yeah I think it's about time that are fighting\nA or the rights of American people and for the constitution president comes up and says those sorts of things even though it inside the riot because it's actually the truth is your ah emotionally stating it it seems like emotional group has replaced facts in this issue and not only that they have been able\nJudy ... whether this guy should be a judge when it's supposed to be done by committee who is the Bozo\nThat said okay let's let America have their way I don't know what the Republican side of the guys were thinking but it seems like for the last Thirty years

somebody's trying to say something continue to talk over them and play the game at their game until they shrink back because that's how fights are what\n... and ... and pulled the problem here is that

campus at the University of Texas Austin\nYou've got the United states senators that now I have to have armed guards because of the the violent mobs it's it's just unacceptable Paul appreciate the

not listening to talk radio\nBut people like you Claude are going to be the saving grace of the country because you're taking a stand and you're speaking out\nAnd we've got to do that folks we've got to do it by the way congressman Andy Harris yesterday on this program we had the breaking news that he was that the protesters actually physically forced their way\nInto his office they were they were trying you have to imagine the scene up on Capitol Hill they were the staffers many of them are just out of college or maybe their interns we're talking about young people here\nAnd there they were trying to keep the door closed but these these um I I suppose muscular feminist shoved their way through and they sold to the Congress but we think at least one person may have been arrested I don't know\nBut every person who did it should've been hauled out of there in handcuffs club thanks for the telephone call let's go to Glen listening to us in Manhattan New York Glen welcome to the program\nThank you very much my comment is in regards to surprisingly something I just read it in New York Times on line and they are quoting this article about the ex boyfriend talking about\nShe claims that they broke up because she cheated on him but this was what was astonishing she uses credit card or\nAfter they had broken up should probably was on the ... took her off the card and I found it very odd that nothing ... or because this is somebody that could be corroborated\nWith records and so forth and would be a direct hit on her credibility\nBlend that's a that's a great point I read the the same article you read and you're right that just popped out it was sort of buried in the story\nA and the times has a bad habit of doing that but um what what really struck me as he threatened to take to reporting her to the fraud department if she didn't stop and that's the only reason she stopped using that card\nThat's correct and I just want to say thanks for keep up the good work\nHey Glenn appreciate the call and thanks for pointing that out that is a great observation and again it does go back to her credibility and I just hope that chairman Grassley\nHas the has the man parts and I believe he does because he's demonstrating bat lately I I think he needs to bring her back and she needs to answer to that\nAgain if Dr Ford perjured herself off to jail that's what I say All right I'm let's take another call before we uh we have to go to break here let's go to Aaron Monroe, Michigan hello Aaron\n...

I'm\nNot I don't I don't I never expand the baby step on emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly vulnerable and I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like it is you might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really\nSprings in December you don't want to have zero money I'll go along with that part but I don't think that's what's really happening you're making eight thousand dollars a month average\nSo I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month whatever so anyway set some aside but we're not going to call it an emergency fund and we're not going to add to the thousand dollar account we call it a hill in the valley account the Helmand valley is the volatility of your income\nThe hill is when they had to come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to set a cup of ground over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts wanted for emergencies and one is for if you run out of money because you don't make any money in a month\nBut dude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow to analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run out of money\nI mean you can go make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if you told me he made forty thousand dollars in real estate business I can imagine you having some zero much but you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money\nA year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back and track your revenues in charge revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nIn giving in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are then okay said some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is\nAnd uh but no we're not changing the emergency fun we might have a hill and valley account if you truly have a volatile income Mark's with us in Seattle hey mark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nYeah thank Dave hey it's a great honor to talk [noise] yeah I Know you had a great impact on change my life five years ago I'm getting like you\nGot a net worth of a half million dollars uh [noise]\nWhat happened was was five years ago I I left a small company with a great a company culture when I hear you talk about your company that the company I was working for a very similar culture\nI was making an average salary or for what I did I went to a competitor I was much more than you're making a I was making a eighty thousand dollars a year where you make now I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year on your\nQuestions what I make my question is is I really miss that small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really\nReally interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost my passion for my work\nAnd um you know I show up to work every day I get great reviews um\nI'd probably go back but I Want some equity or I Want some indication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually worth in the marketplace\nThis idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less\nIs not necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going with\nSo maybe that particular company can't pay you but if you want you can probably find somebody with a decent culture\nAnd pay you what your worst\nThis is the day Ramsey\nYou know statistically when it comes to life insurance or protecting your family that women are more likely to be uninsured or under insured than men just doesn't make any sense women make up half the workforce contributes mightily to family incomes and in many cases are the breadwinners and take care of this\nA loss of income or the need to replace family care\nIs equally important for women\nAs it is for men single moms working moms stay at home moms all need term life insurance rates are actually lower for women which is why I send your designed or insurance they shop the top term life companies to find the lowest rates available you can compare rates on line ... dot com\nOr call eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two this is something every family has to deal with that ... dot com or eight hundred three five six forty two eighty to\nThey're not good at anything so I just don't get it so that that's why we endorse credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank and I'm just a\nA huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and it's what I did\nEverything I endorse on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation and that kind of a thing I don't have anything is inconsistent like I'm too big or too good to do that I I'm not I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell you to get but\nYou know ... you know in most cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York, Pennsylvania Hi Ted how are you\nI'm doing better than I deserve how're you doing just the same how can I help\nAlright well thank you and your staff right you're doing it's a blessing thank you um how will be needing a life saving operation about ten to Fifteen Years I don't get hit by a bus\nAnd I want to know if I ah I should continue funding NHL stay with my employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks a year or should I just put a that extra money into a Roth IRA her for a while\nThey're matching a couple hundred bucks a year yeah ... and more okay showed the the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you've got to have in ten years what is it\nI think the liver ooh I got ... yes see so you know fortunately the ... you can't live without\nYeah heard that you know [laughter] oh okay yeah it's it's a it's a slow a slow progression then\nYeah it is they they estimate that you know Seventeen years out so okay I got to figure to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to retire early you know if I\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're going to want is a ... ... you got to have the cash in your age essay or somewhere else in and investment to cover what is going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking health insurance is going to cover a large portion of this correct\nYeah that if I don't retire um then I'll be on um either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nYeah I think I'd be on cobra or I'd I wouldn't retire because this is I guess this is a multi hundred thousand dollar event isn't it\nProbably yeah\nYeah and so I'm thinking we're going to time retirement around this a little bit um or and or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the cobra but the cover only last what two years or something\nUm you can keep that indefinitely so I think that's number one I Want to make sure you got health insurance to cover the vast majority of this I don't want to\nTime that poorly a but then how much have you got coming out of pocket a over ten years you could put five thousand dollars a year into that age essay or whatever your big the duck double is what's your ducked double\n[noise] um [noise] ... yeah ... or ... whatever the duck double is on the age of say a year\nOh now that age I say that helps\nWith an H essay health insurance policy that as a I ducked about policy\nIt it depends uh depends on the policy I pick to either six to nine nine thousand\nDollars is what I'm Talking about you can put up to that amount per year into that savings account\nAnd that would be six thousand yeah yeah I Wish I really fought nut yes and I don't touch it until I you know pretty dire\nYes here's why out when you're when you need the money out of pocket to cover the whatever comes out of pocket on on the liver surgery or and you keep your health insurance in place and you've got this big juicy health savings account sitting there in you know not to\nUse mutual funds in it and let it grow over the next ten years be as big as it can there's no downside of that whatever you don't need for the liver transplant or liver trans whatever the processors they're whatever you don't need you can pull out and just pay taxes on it no penalties\nAt sixty five and so um you're going to want to build that up and you just not going to become sort of what you don't use you can use for retirement\nAverage sixty five so I I Would love that up knowing that you've got this coming down the road\nFor years and one of the most asked questions I get is day one are you going to do a live event and our city\nWith a radio show and book tours in our growing

open phones at AAA eight to five five two to\nFive you're dropping we'll talk about your life and your money it's a free gall Shay is with us in Reno ... welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave thanks for taking my call today sure what's up on the health\nInsurance question for you and I'm hoping you could give me some insight on it we adopted our two children about three years ago and they came from the foster care system so we don't get a lot of services but one thing we do get is health insurance until they're Eighteen and it's provided through our state Medicaid system\nAnd every year my husband and I kind of go back and forth on whether or not to keep it or to put them on his plan through his employer and we're getting close to that um [noise] time of year to make that decision\nOK I'm ... wood is in or your plans cover that Medicaid is not covering\nThey're both in healthy thankfully I guess are um you know the thing we always come back to his unknowns of any kind of health issues that they may have ever\nIt and it's a basically welfare insurance [noise] um it has covered their needs up to this point because those kids are healthy and they've had you know minimal minimal\nIncidental freight if they had some kind of a major event that he'll Medicaid would not do a good job of covering and that his insurance might\nActually it's more the opposite I'm not worried about the major stuff because like we've had to go to the ER for you know my you know a scraping a bump and they pick up the tab for everything it's more the ongoing care there is um you know it's very hard to find providers who take it there's a bit of a stake then we feel\nA little strange having that kind of coverage given our own financial position you know that our kids are on a um there's a bit of a stigma that oh I don't feel having it so it's just it's just kind of a dilemma we face every year and\nI Do or you know in November we can make a play or I heard you uh uh you know free food stamps because you are adopted a foster child you know that would feel the same way as what you're saying um\nIt would yeah I mean I well I don't look at you when he gives me a red light then that takes care of their you know their their financial needs and [noise] um so I don't know this is not an easy now which is a question now does it cost\nTo add them to your husband's policy\nUm I think it would be nothing given the policy Ron has a high deductible each has a plan that we have and there is no cost ... family\nAnd why is it a question if it doesn't cost anything and it's better coverage\nThat's a good answer there probably isn't a as an question I guess the only question would be just changing jobs in the future if he were to leave it you know you know and go somewhere else\nKnow what I mean you you just have to go over your kids from then on you're done you're done good you opted out you know I don't know you might be able to opt back again if something got crazy but um but for now you could opt out okay with that man I guess yes for that matter I don't know that you have\nOut what's your household income or about\nSeventy okay and what is your son\nOur album for making about twenty to twenty five hours a week\nHe's working twenty hours a week yeah [noise] okay what's he doing with the rest of his time\nReality he he he doesn't want to\nHave a job that will cause liquid this job because he's\nBeen trying to get into this job forever 'cause\nWhat I Would add conflict with his job he's only working twenty hours a week\nRight here on call 'em for this job\nTwenty hours a week or the whole week\nTwenty hours a week maybe twenty five or ... or ... is a TV station and he he just on a good thing and they have a football game and then the game it's for the game\nYou know what would you be on call for football there is no emergency football\n[laughter] but he's been trying to get into the TV station for years\nI got that part where he's working twenty hours a week and his mother is calling me 'cause she came by his dad gum twenty thousand dollar bill I'd like for him to work another forty hours a week on top of the twenties playing football\nAnd so she can pay is freaking bills so you're not calling me how would that sound that would sound awesome\nI I Try to tell him that when I get out and get them to come through and I think and I guess when I have to pay out\nBecause he paid the Thirteen days late at at least thirty days late every time you don't work much\nYeah yeah there's a great place to go when you're broke to work so\nUh what I Would tell him to do is get into financial piece university and get his young budding gear and start paying that I Know I I mean if I'm you I'm going to be all up on this kid because he's twenty eight years old and he's a slacker\nWhen you're fifty what got a fifty fifty years old and you're having to pay this kid's bills yeah I'm mad at him right now I don't want you to be two and a good loving mama's kind of way I'm not trying to disown him I just want to knock him out on his little head OK\nYeah and then you you better plan on paying it if that no mob doesn't get moving okay right so it really does you know ball and knock it out and then you have chalk it up to that and but dude I'm telling you ah we're going to have some discussions is he married\nHe lived through the girlfriend okay I'll bet she works forty hours yes there yeah there you go [noise]\nAlright open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Katherine is with us from Portland Maine Hi Katherine how are you\nA thank you I think he's about my budget I Do the every dollar budget among baby step to great I protect my expenses for the month [laughter]\nProject what I'm going to be paying for debt and then sometimes something happens like last month when my car broke down I had to have a tone and repaired and it costs to almost five hundred dollars\nHello somehow in my often that we know that one out of the ... do you have your your baby steps one with a thousand dollars right I Do know that would be an emergency that you would use that for\nOkay but that's what I was confused about because the way I handled it was I simply added a new line item to my budget for that item and then reduce the amount that I pay toward debt for that month so I get it wrong\nThat would be okay you cash flow did you just ... but if you can cash flow it that month that's fine I didn't have to come out of the emergency funds so you were paying more\nFor one month 'cause you got kicked in the kneecap with this thing but usually you're not going to have that month and a month out now there's some things if a if there's a recurring unexpected event it no longer is unexpected\nFor anti and you know you don't have anything budgeted for car repairs well that would not work because most cars are going to need some repairing over a period of six months you know they're going to have anything\nThat she did for car repairs\nYeah I probably would put something in there for that because the ... your budget needs to reflect the real world and the real world is you're going to spend something on that car in a given six month period of time it might be tires it might be maintenance that might be oil change it might be a five hundred dollar toe you know\nBut you're going to spend something on a car in unless you're driving really nice brand new cars you're going to have been something on the car during that time so your budget should reflect reality in that regard\nSo probably going to add a little bit of a sudden it to be a lot fifty or a hundred bucks or something and let that build up\nAs a sinking fun they call it than the every dollar software or in them on blow up I don't care where you build it up but somewhere you build it up and you ah have the money in cash then for your car repair as it comes up and that's an example of something that is recovering so it's no longer unexpected\nEmergencies should be unexpected things\nThings that are are often enough that we can expect them aren't emergencies anymore but you did good yeah you did fine just to cash flow through that emergency slowed down your debt snowball for that month and then you pick back up next month hopefully won't have another one of those and you can really\nBuild it up and go from there so good question and you're doing good keep after Tom is with us in San Francisco Hi Tom welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDo appreciate you're doing a great thing I've been an avid fan for three days now\n[laughter] I mean can you [laughter] I'm On earth\nWe have about three hundred okay and and student debt another hundred and Fifteen and automobile than a line of credit that type of thing so I was about four Fifteen totally do\nAnd you know we make a pretty good income shootout about one twenty annually I met one eighty three hundred come on I mean my question for you it I wasn't going back to school to get my master's programs only twenty five okay to feel like they wouldn't be a very real our ally on it\nBut over the last three days are starting to think maybe maybe I shouldn't [laughter] just want to get your take on that\n... masters in one\n[laughter] oh it would be in software engineering ... ...\nAnd it would increase your income by more than twenty five K [laughter]\nIt would probably be but it's hard to say I'm there wouldn't be a winning case and you raise because of the category I Would jump into\nMhm okay he would be doing that you can get back into it might get back in touch over a year then from\nThat point so that's really nice return I think you can put that in the budget and the reason you can put it in the budget as you make so stinking much money\nNow you live in in a very expensive area granted\nIt's crazy expensive\nBut I Want to live in a really rough near ... you know but you guys are really you are really standing\nHoney ...\nAnd so I mean how quick can we pay off four hundred well we can pay off four hundred and two years if we do it in two hundred a year that may be living on a hundred I'm not sure you can do that after taxes in your area so you probably got a three year and get out of debt plan\nDaddy like know vacations you don't need to see the inside of a restaurant and don't you dare talk to me by buying anything else you bought enough\nAnd in the process of doing that can you we've twenty grand a week I ran into the budget [noise] sure\nSure and delays you buy\nOf your life so we see that it's time to address this mess\nThis was a\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites\nFull of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dot com slash have to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new it finds them for you it's powerful matching technology scans thousands of resumes\nIdentifies people with the ride skills education and experience for your job and actively\nInvites them do apply\nSo you get qualified candidates fast and right now my listeners contrived zip recruiter for free at ... dot com slash Dave that's zip recruiter dot com slash Dave zip recruiter the smartest way to hire\nBut both of you know the mall and\nSo if you if you don't have any money and you're saving up you can't afford a Bentley you can't afford to go to a super expensive college and there's nothing wrong with that by the way I didn't go to a super expensive college so you go to an end state school there in Florida\nFull ... near one but wonderful both of them in state tuition not that expensive and uh that's thing one your college selection\nAs at the least expensive college that will help you get the degree that you need to get is what you need to aim at\nWith rare exceptions and you're not going out of state and you're not going super expensive private the second thing is then you start looking for scholarships and you make scholarship hunting your full time job\nOr an after school job that kind of a thing and you start applying for and filling out the scholarships forms and riding the essays and\nYou'd probably ask for a thousand scholarships and you'll probably get turned down for nine hundred and fifty of them but if you get fifty one thousand dollar scholarship she just went to school for ...\nThat'd be pretty cool not a bad part time job\nThe third thing is planning on working a lot while you are in school don't borrow money so you don't have to work work\nGet good jobs jobs that pay a lot dog walking cutting grass jobs people don't want to do what they pay a lot to do I'm not talking about minimum wage crap and if you're going to live on campus go ahead and be an R. A. B. a residential advisor or written us and what they call it what is in RA\nHow it is it is a resident about okay so there you know the the babysitter in the dorm okay and uh you get free dorm for doing that and sometimes free tuition for doing that and sometimes free tuition free dorm and pay for doing that she'll be an R. A. if you're gonna live on campus\nOr work in the cafeteria get free food do you live on campus have you can get a job working for the university the tuition might be completely free\nAnd that might be different to something to look at it so that's the kind of stuff you look at but figure out where you're going what the steps are to get their figure out the cheapest way to get their figure out scholarships for somebody pays you to get there and then plant and working your butt off and those\nMore hey Alex welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nMr Ramsey how are you a thank you for everything that

to five\nFive two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five will started off with Katie who's on the line in Ogden, Utah Katie how can we help\nI think are taking my call Cher I'm why am I feeling\nWhen my husband and I found out that pregnant and since then I've worked all kinds of our job to pay for him to finish and he recently finished he's got a great guy now and we're starting to kick our debt but they've rounded how I'm such a difficult but\nUm to help out I've been applying to places that I don't really want truck out just because you know we need that money and I don't have much else going on for me\nAnd I'm twenty six I've got two kids I'd like to stay home um but I Know I Want to work and I want to help out and I and if I feel like I locked myself and I have no idea where to even start to find\nYeah well I understand that you feel that way but that is an absolute wiser you have to acknowledge the fact that that's just a lack of confidence there's some self doubt it's creeping because you've been at home for a while\nAnd here's another reality reality is that right now to Katie in America we have more jobs that are available than there are people who were unemployed it is a fantastic job market even for stay at home moms meaning you want to stay home but work from the home\nAnd so what you have to first do is get very very clear you're in that first stage and that is the stage of discovery\nSo you've really got to get clear on what you do best and if you're struggling with the confidence on that I Want you to sit down with two or three people in your life in the next two or three days I mean right away make this urging people who will tell you the truth\nAnd I want you to say to them what do I do best of all the things I Do well what do I do best and then the second question is\nWhat do I love to do you seen me you've been around me I'm twenty six have been enough work history for you or even in high school and college the subjects the topics the people that you are interested in what moves your heart what makes you come alive now that's what you're going to ask somebody else because that's\nBut I think about selling my house buying and he'll play you know where I live up there\nThere is some sort of liability well go ahead [noise]\n[noise] no I get someone who was that get hurt a lot I Know that could apply for the and they go after they fight with who say they will go out to the fitness but if I Lived in the same building what that there but I don't know I'm Wondering if that would be an issue well\nYou've got a couple of things going on here but you're going to want to own a a little bit him on each of them first of all I'm probably gonna be state specific so you definitely need to look at the law and your state in any type of regulation\nI'm you're going to have liabilities regardless whether it's a stand alone studio or it's where you live so you're you're going to have liability if someone gets hurt and you need to know what those are and to protect yourself with insurance um professional insurance products based insurance if you have a product that type of things do you want to look into that\nBut I Do just want to challenge you and one thing for ... I Love your idea I Love the idea of a wellness center I Love the idea that you're helping people but here's a traditionally encourage people to do\nBecause you don't currently have a yoga studio and you don't have the idea of validated\nI Want to challenge you to start a little bit smaller and a little sooner\nSo I'll give you an example where is there a wellness center community center yoga studio ... studio somewhere where you could start your business sublease third base in their off hours builds your brand build the demand you have no risk no overhead no upfront costs\nAnd you're able to validate your idea until the business jet defy you getting your own space be that a duplex that you live above or your own standalone space I'll give an example there are a lot of churches that will operate when they're getting started out of like elementary schools the elementary school right next door household they don't have to go on Sundays so they rented out to a church that use it on Sunday\nAnd it's just great deal to win when it's additional revenue for the school the church has a place to go without having to\nIdeas a bad idea I Would just talents you just start smaller and sooner on a lower risk level lower cost level and validate your idea and build those relationships build your brand in your demand\nGet that going and then when you're ready to have your own studio it's the next logical step it doesn't feel like a terrifyingly so definitely wanna look into laws and regulations for liability but also when you think about your space before you make that big commitment\n[noise] Patricia are you a lot of phone are you working full time right now\nRight and that was the question I work full time and I went to Iran and on I was planning on going back to share that way I'm making more money but it'll help them find like business as well\nYeah I well of course you can I just wanted to know that fact because this this that piece of information please beautifully knew what you're saying\nShe's going to have to do this on the side anyway she's not in a position to open up anything I don't think you would try to go right on open it right um I I just want to see maybe do a little bit of yoga for some people maybe two or three months when I see if you can get a small group of men pay you\nBecause it's everything you just said but it allows you to tip toe into it or the nurse practitioner thing that's going to school to get that will make more money I Love that too is going to lower to cash flow have more cash piled on when it's time to to operate so I mean you you nailed it there I I just think ... you know don't rush into the\nWell and the other thing I Want to call out for anyone listening right now that has a service based business or like a yoga studio you have a tendency to think that the studio is the business it's not if you are and what you can go anywhere you can go to people's houses you can go to the park outside they're coming and paying for you don't feel like you have to have a location\nBefore you can start your business because you are the business so you can start tomorrow Patrice ... out of your living room if you want to or the ... down the street and by the way you should\nFor you they're not hunting for the building triple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight to five five two to five ten

Michigan bill how can we\nCan all across the honor to get back to you good luck on how can we do well\nI've been all in the IT field for about Twenty years and to this point it really hasn't ban I haven't progress is hardly career as I originally hoped and wished I had\nA long story short is I'm back in January wife and I went through F P view and as would have gone to a baby steps ... to right now\nGoing through some of our stuff planning to get a grabs they'll go on a we came in to some old home movies I'm such some stuff that she had gotten from bad um when he had died um and\nThrough all these things we found you know we had a lot of old age millimeters old VHS law stuff and it was like okay we have all this stuff\nUm I started converting it and I really found a passion for that that I haven't had in a piece for quite a while and I'm thinking okay this sounds like something I could turn into a great business and love doing going forward\nUm questions at this point lead\nBill let me interrupt what is the bit to get right to what is the business with the military or what is the business\nI'm converting legacy formats like eight millimeter VHS wide films and all that uh could digital content and properly preserve them\nOkay and so what's your question for us then\nUm we bought a question I have is just um\nSure I'm going through it properly and [noise] the um more\nTell you what Bill question bill crude he's ready to go she can [laughter] because we only have a little bit of time here I Want to be able to get to your your solution\nWe want to make sure we might help you out here's the thing about the great news dead\nOr when you were entering a space where there's already people doing what you want to do it means the ideas prevent though you're not doing something that's never been done before there are actually businesses that have similar type services what you then no is yes you're solving a problem and if you're solving a problem it's a viable business idea\nYou just have to find the people that have that problem that had the eight millimeters they want to preserve them\nAnd you're going to learn how who that person is you're going to go after them and build a business for them so you're going to price for them you're going to create marketing language\nThat speaks to them right where they are the the best part about this bill it you know the idea is valid because it's been done before what you're going to do\nIs you're going to build your business and you're gonna do it better and you're going to serve your customers and they're gonna want to come to you because you make a unique space for yourself\nIn that market a bill I Know my book is for women but I'm going to send it to you men read it all the time the business principles are the same and it gives you plan to take that idea to market I Hope it helped them we'll get we'll send that to you ...\nTo a great plans will follow it and and here's the thing a ... a lot of bills out there he said something that's interesting he finds these old things and you realize way way out this\nAnd and you are giving him the steps the book is going to August ... but I Want to just had when they try it just tested on this and all of that trial last call here's why some passion should be ...\nIt changes things when you turn it into a business\nThat would you made a great point other people are doing this he just got to find people that are willing to pay him to do it and keep paying him into others have you need to tell you about bill he's going to start really small but start right away stop thinking about it stopped getting whammy just do it\nA business [noise] don't go anywhere\nYou heard me talk about our deep there for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity theft last year yes sixteen million\nTwenty six percent of them had to borrow money from family or friends twenty two percent of them lost even more money by taking time off work and nine hundred thousand victims took out loans\nJust up as a freaking nightmare\nThat's why the only plan I have for my family and my entire team is through Zander insurance ... takes over all the work to solve

it's the smartest most affordable way to protect yourself\nTo validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can I run this whole thing without having a boss that kind of backed me and you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited to Haiti because you're just going to do more of what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken said\nYou've got this light at the end of the tunnel when you're going to start increase your family household income in other ways to your husband\nBut in the meantime if you want to spend the next two to three months building up the demand the client the relationship even just taking people to coffee starting to gather interests of other independent projects you could run on your own that could run through this new architecture firm that you're going to run\nWhen you decide to leave your fulltime job it the next logical step where the business can support you the income is there of course that's only going to help and your husband had income\nSo you're all ready I Would say twenty to thirty percent down the path of doing this you know starting from scratch or not like I have a full time job and I want to do this totally different thing how do I started out\nYou're already doing it you already have clients you're working with I just want you to\nDo more of that and then the next few months as you build that up that will start to ramp up as your husband's income comes in and it looks like first year he probably should be able to comfortably leisure Labor Day job\nAnd it comes down to a formula you gotta work days baby steps to his baby stepson the dream so when you put enough money aside plus decide businesses there and then that's how you get to that number where you can step aside into Christie's point does not have to be a ... jump right it should be a nice move and it just takes a little bit of time and patience lays on her way\nThe light at the end of the tunnel is an important point can cause so many people feel like how can I sustain this well you're not until January and we need that light in the tunnel you know this is the first season him to put my head down for a season that man had the

I'm\nNow and I don't I don't I never expand baby step one emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly vulnerable and I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like it is you might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really\nYou really need to stop and think about what you just said but anyway if you're going to go to zero in December because nobody's buying a house in Colorado Springs in December you don't want to have zero money I'll go along with that part but I don't think that's what's really happening you're making eight thousand dollars a month average\nSo I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month whatever so anyway set some aside but we're not going to call in and emerged\nCome the hill is when they come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to set a couple of ground over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts wanted for emergencies and one is for you if you run out of money because you don't make any money in a month\nBut dude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow and analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run out of money\nI mean you couldn't go make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if you told me he made forty thousand dollars in real estate business I can imagine you have in some zero much but you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money\nA year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back in track your revenues in charge revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nIn giving in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are then okay said some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is\nAnd uh but no we're not changing the emergency fun we might have a hill and valley account if you truly have a volatile income Mark's with us in Seattle hey mark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThanks Dave hey it's a great honor to talk with you I had a great impact on changed my life five years ago um do you think you are currently I I I got a critic question I'm In baby steps eggs are the only thing right now I'm paying off my um do you get a net worth of a half million dollars uh [noise]\nWhat happened was this five years ago I I left a small company with a great a company culture when I hear you talk about your company that the company I was working for had a very similar culture [noise]\nUm I was making a eighty thousand dollars a year what do you make now I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year when your question is what\nI make my question is is I really missed that small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really really interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost my passion for my work\nAnd um you know I should have to work every day I get great reviews um\nI'd probably go back but I Want some equity or I Want some indication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually worse than the marketplace\nThis idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less\nIs not a necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going with\nSo maybe that particular company can't pay you but if you want you could probably find somebody with a decent culture\nAnd pay you what your worse\nThis day Ramsey\nYou know statistically when

yeah\nYeah it is they they estimate that you know Seventeen years out so okay I got to figure to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to retire early you know if I can\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're going to want is a ... ... you got to have the cash in your age essay or somewhere else in and investments to cover what is going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking health insurance is going to cover a large portion of this correct\nYeah that if I don't retire um then I'll be on um either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nYeah I think I'd be on cobra or I'd I wouldn't retire because this is I guess this is a multi hundred thousand dollar event isn't it\nProbably yeah\nYeah and so I'm thinking we're going to term retirement around this a little bit um or and or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the cobra but the cover only last what two years or something\nUm you can keep that indefinitely so I think that's number one I Want to make sure you got health insurance to cover the vast majority of this I don't want to\nTime that poorly a but then how much you've

I'm trying to find where he did something wrong dodging taxes is not again is it is the attacks cheat or did you set up a game\nAnd the game was this this this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this\nAnd you're like okay so that's what the game is that the game and as long as you're saying these parameters as long as you're staying here\nWhatever happens happens\nIs do they go fine and they put together a bunch of people who go we've got this this this this this we can move over here we can do this week but some of this new trust we could start this over here we can move this year all of a sudden we can set this up all of corporations offshore the whole nine yards and we come back and go we stayed inside the parameters this is what we owe you know like say that's not fair\nYou set up the rules if I beat you that is when\nUpset because they feel they're owed that money money that had been packs but for money that have been made money that the government didn't earn that Fred and his wife and the trumps\nGreat great great great and then of course Cuomo last night goes all he goes off on this and it's hilarious how Chris Cuomo goes off on oh who he is and blah blah blah blah and this whole side and and he was born on you know he was born basically at home plate the silver spoon the goals as if Chris Cuomo does it have advantages life\nThis is about honesty on one level president saying that he got a million dollars from his father when he got sixty\nThat he says he was self made and Britain Trump was only good but he was great when Fred from obviously had way more than ... than he's ever had\nAnd we've seen this clearer timeline that he has been just been feeding from the friend trough his entire life isn't this the truth isn't this something that he should own instead of saying he's a self made man\nWell first of all\nHow much money did he get remember you're converting it into today's dollars he's worth billions and even if he got four hundred million he's worth billions two billion three billion one billion he's done well go to Silicon Valley go find venture capitalists find out how much money they've given out and how much does it work\nMy God I can go back to cylinder we get five hundred million dollars to a company that failed\nRemember that five hundred million not a tax break here's

that come on Chris look where you are ... you know they have in the last name Cuomo cared a little cache with it you don't think it all\n\nThe thing everybody wants to call everybody out on stuff but here's the thing I'm going to tell you guys on the left his base doesn't care they don't give a rat's ass they don't care how he made his money well what\nYou think that's the thing that's fair that's what you want you want it to be fair because for whatever reason you believe that money is the government's money why so into giving the government more power and more money please for the love of God tell me why\nYou it's grotesque I mean it's just unbelievable and and you know my habits so I'm so impressed by the quality of the journalism and the care with which this has done\nBut there's really a larger political message here which is that if you get a W to like most people you get a salary you have basically no chance to try to cheat on your taxes I mean they they they withhold a certain amount every two weeks that's just sort of how taxes work in this country but if you're rich like the trumps you can set up a system like this\nThat's right but you set up a system like this within the parameters that the government has set up and because they can beat the system\n\nThey can beat the system they can beat the system that you set up\nWhose fault that just come out and say we want

or at least on and say look I Want to know if he's owned by the Russians okay I can get that even though he is doing so many things against the Russians\nThat aren't in his best interest there are other things you could come out and say well more curious about this are more curious about that but okay at least I can understand that and he did say look if you want to show is taxed\nSession with OPM other people's money this obsession with that is insane I can never be this obsessed over somebody else's money this this I Need I Want to have to it's somebody else's you didn't build that it's

government's gonna take it all the government's going to take it and they're going to decide what to do with it you can't leave your family or anything but a very scant amount\nRight because we decided that she would everybody's going to do I think I put their money away the minute they have a chance that last few days on earth that last few years on earth they're going to spend that wild and crazy 'cause everybody right or left isn't going to give the government a chance to have it and they can scream on both sides yeah yeah we will do that we're kind and nice BS\nBudget crap it's the
