them all this and all of a sudden what once was it seemed to be an insurmountable lead in the polls has now evaporated\nShould be a huge warning sign for the Democratic party because all year we've been talking about how democratic enthusiasm has been outstripping Republican and how that could lead to the eventual blue wave\nTax cuts are talking about the broader economy even the threat of impeachment to the president nothing really fired up the Republican base until now\nYeah and part of that is because for the last two years they've been told how racist they are how stupid they are how the mess the countries in his all of their fault\nThey been devalued over and over again and this Kavanaugh thing is really hit them in the face and it is it is amazing and I don't think they\nUnderstand that they don't\nCause they live on oceans and because they live on oceans they feel that there's so much better than everybody else and then everybody else is just a bunch of ...\nAnd that they shouldn't have the right to vote and vote shouldn't count as much in their their opinions shouldn't count as much and and and all of these things and then they're looking this guy and as soon as I get torn apart and they're realizing what a bunch of BS this is\n\nAnd I'm not talking about whether or not it's true not just the way the entire thing was handled how political it became and they're looking at their value is getting shot down and their value is getting attacked over and over again and now they're stepping up and say you know what I wasn't really going to get involved in this but I think it's maybe I I just might\nWhat do the numbers show about who the public would prefer to control Congress Democrats or Republicans right all year it's been true that Democrats have led on the question they continue to lead on this question but only by ... points now that's been cut in half\nIn the past month and guess what all of that movement in in the past week has been among men just in the past week those men have gone from being evenly split on whether they'd vote for a Republican or Democrat in their district and now saying they prefer Republican by ten point\nYeah yeah\nYou know why 'cause they're looking over there and what do they think they're seeing themselves get bashed over and over again\nFun I can easily be in this position like that\nI could easily be be be told that I I I Am a rapist and every man is sick and tired of hearing how horrible they are let me tell you some ladies you know this right now the talking heads that are out there\nYou know angry and pissed at the world you know sitting on CNN so boxer or any of these other shows but we're we're talking about real women out of that they're working their butts off doing their thing is going through you understand\nYou get it men are sick and tired of being sold out horrible there are we all know rape is bad even amongst criminals right I understand this even among the worst people on earth\nThere is a code in a hierarchy\nRapist and child molesters will pay a price in prison you don't think good men living good lives out there don't understand that but we have to preface everything oh let me say this first rape is bad [noise]\nThey're sick and tired of hearing it they're sick and tired of being told their entire life for the last Twenty years the only way that they are where they ours because there are a man or because of this because of that it's never because of who they are not the greatest nobody in the world is\nThe individual that's been taken away\nNow we're lumped into categories year in categories there in categories year categories there and it's ridiculous and men are getting blamed for everything and they're sick and tired of it and look at the Republicans going I may not believe a lot of what you're saying but I'm sick and tired of being called the demon\nHe also stressed that there's um a month from the election any number of things can in have happened in that amount of time and whether Kavanaugh eventually get through or is eventually strong will really have some influence on how fired of Republican voters are anything can happen in those thirty four days yeah\nAnything can happen absolutely true and it's a lifetime in between now and that day\nBe a a a tragedy that takes place that takes her eye off stuff or or or focuses on something it's a long\nTime but it's not just about an incident here an incident there there's a lot that's going into this and it's a lot that people are missing so you sit back and he's got a\nYou're not catching on because for whatever reason common sense is no longer a part of politics now politicians run and now things are fought how things are talked about it it it's just

a gambling hand but I didn't have anybody for all that I can do it or it has to do just win baby [laughter]\nBut I think that I'm very close with my\nCar and I think they're going to\nI think the Democrats will will pull out won't be as big as they think a a victory when it comes to the Congress but I think that the fight they have right now\nIsn't going to go the way they want in the Senate they have too many seats that they're they're trying to hold on to I think the much Sally in Arizona is starting to pull away from cinema which is one they thought they could have Heidi Heitkamp is dead in the water she says she's not voting for\nFor Kavanaugh but she's twelve points behind and she's done they've got too many to defend and I don't think they're going to hold onto it the way they thought they thought it would\nEnthusiasm benefits that the Democrats had over the Republicans has evaporated since mid September to this point in other words because of the cabinet hearing so the signal now and I trust the American people for exactly this reason they saw what we saw they care about the constitution sodas Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd what they saw are a bunch of senators another politician\nOver conservative okay right just right now it's like a cheese you get that not known as an Hoover conservative and she's right she's absolutely right\nYou you know when sports they say it's getting hot at the right time and this may be the right time and this\nMay signal through a lot of people out there get out and vote in ways that didn't and no matter if all of the other tunes that they were playing nothing appealed to anybody I don't like that song and I'm like that's all I thought we were I like that\nAnd that's the thing they hit the right tune and they had nothing to do with it it was actually the Democrats who were the ones that are joining up an exciting the right side of the aisle\nWe like the rule of law we care about fairness we don't want to be told that were out guilty until proven innocent this has been rejected where they are now saying that in the polls Democrats were going to regret what they've done\nIt's possible three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and shows your Twitter again a long time between now and election night [noise] it'll be interesting to see how this plays out and if there and here's the other thing that we're not talking about the Republicans could definitely fumbled is the rest of the way\nThey could and I think I like I said I still think that the ... in Congress they're going to hold is going to be fine until they can pretend to we're going to the gym and then it's going to go to the Senate diets never going to happen\nAnd I think there is still that worry as well\nUh but at the same time I look at this and I still think there's just too much that they've gotta fight right now and the Senate's watching them fight and do the things they've done\nI think Feinstein and some of the others have put some of the ones who were were in a in a dog fight who had a chance maybe to flip proceeded to hold the seat put them in more peril\nBecause of the way that they acted because of how political just

do it for twenty Thirteen earlier on how to deal with Israelis back twenty Thirteen to not do it I'm obviously that this\nUh this incident with the excuse that they've been looking for to quickly go ahead and for the transfer\nWho we have very complicated situation this is the one reflection of it when you have the as three hundred are coming in addition to the U.S two hundred but we have an ally turkey a NATO member who's getting the best for\nSo do Pat's or the countering America's adversaries who sanctions act and other measures ... what do you see the the us reaction now both regarding

the sanctions the cats are related sanctions against Chinese\nOr one Chinese agency and the Chinese individuals and executive director of that aid and right for their purchase of as four hundred and ... thirty five fighter jets off I think that's certainly a shock to the Chinese to the Turks\nUm there was just a report today that the Indonesian or putting on hold a their purchase of sick or thirty five fighter jets because of that concerned about sanctions\nSo I'll go should be taking this seriously that um you know the competition has worn turkey that this could lead to sanctions or not if they follow through on sanctions and kind of set the precedent what China\nUm you know the the the light she'll be flashing red or for turkey whether they actually stop 'em you know I I I'm a mistake I think they go they go through with it\nBut boy I Want to press you on how the Russians deal with the Syrians in Damascus Russian military intelligence is excellent Russian networks are first grade throughout the middle east always have been there are a lot of Russians married Syrian so there's a ... there's a comfort here working in the audience and\nDo the Russians trust a Assad in any fashion have they totally penetrated his organization did they know everything all the time\nI have a one person basically making decisions I don't know if they know everything all the time but they've got no alternative they have this kind of multigenerational\nAir base I mean I'm In so they they're holding on him there's no there's no political alternative for them they don't they don't see anybody else that can basically guarantee 'em their equities uh in in Syria so I'm not sure it's a it's a matter of trust thing or not but it's that's the kind of\nThey've got a foothold novel avant and Assad is\nThe partner for that I'm and I'm not sure you know how ... there's a there's no other way to for them to move\nAnd as far as it relates to the United states or Israel or other key players and the reason that just kind of the reality now and we do the Russians are dealing with Assad as they are and Israelis are kind of doing it doing with the Assad regime in a very I'm kind of realistic way and\nI'm targeting what they need to target and same with the Iranians\nUm and so I think it's a it's more of the actions than than any trust to having maybe here when they get the three hundreds to Assad it's more about making sure that\nThe kind of that crack troops that Assad hazard or really lax uh don't end up shooting up there on aircraft as we saw when this incident that they have something that's more advanced now that can actually tell Russian aircraft from Israeli aircraft are from you know other aircraft\nNo we have another front where we're seeing a an ally a moving closer to Russia in some regards to the president's ... beach in\nTo Russia I think when the seventeenth to Sochi do you see this as a an opportunity for Russia to establish another base now the deep consolidated the hold in Syria a naval air force base they ... they do in in Egypt what what else could be on the agenda for them\nTo feel they've had I mean I think if it's a fascinating trip on the seventeenth I mean ... visited Egypt cc's previously visitor\nI haven't seen some of the kind of basing things come to fruition yet and so that's that's in my mind is that the key thing on the agenda the Soviets had some basis in in western I'm\nIn western Egypt do they want to revive somebody's airbases to they want to revive some of the naval kind of access they had um military and they were actually had to Egypt in front porch there so I think that's what's really interesting here to watch that district is coming about fairly\nQuickly um and again builds on already military and economic idealistic made in the past couple of years so it's\nIt's it it should be concerning for the U.S where you have is yet for traditional ally I'm continuing to gotta get get cozy or with the Russians and part of that is when we're not engaging with\nThem you know we still um we're still waiting for a in a bathroom Egypt to be named or the state department or David Shenk or the effective for Near

difference\nNo no there's a big difference in other words within\nIt it is part and the FBI it's a separate branch what are you talking about\nWhat no you can give it to the Democrats then you give it to the Democrats them and they and they present it and\nPeople get to see the FBI were well what'd you forget about is the FBI is not investigating anything once in a criminal matter it was a background check they in fact what the FBI would deal with it would be put into the three oh two white which then the Democrats and the Republicans would both have\nYou have the Senate the information you're making it sound like the FBI but then do an investigation on it no it would end up in the partisan body anyway that's in\nFact the only purpose the FBI served in this scenario is to deliver that information to the White House in the Senate\n\nI mean she would officially be dip putting it into the three oh two had she'd done that during the process and the way I agreed to take it out of the way they they tried to put it in the process would chairman Grassley twice his call for it\nAnd ah if ah Feinstein of Feinstein would have gone right to the FBI at that point they could have done it that way she could have given it to the absolute and do go that way no so it's a useless conversation\nAnd and anyone and if if that that would if forward if that's accurate the report that they tried to do that\nA and Ford's assuming for its lawyers were telling the truth again they're trying to circumvent the system so the information will get out but won't be in the three oh two after

said in the last caller brought up was she was willing to turn them over to the FBI\nAnd our and our point was ... when I'm when I said no it's like because our point is that go directly to the Senate to begin with yeah there there is no investigation they wouldn't be in bed they simply take it and give it to the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd if it ended up in the report we wouldn't see it that the the\nOnly senators would set the only the centers wouldn't see it and there for a goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence mhm and she wants to people was that she wants to people to see it so then the people can decide give it to ... directly outside of the three oh two\nBecause then the other members of the committee including Dianne Feinstein would get it and immediately leak it\nExactly or\nGenerating we wait for orange or just released the entire right to the to the Washington Post and let them printed completely sure\n\n'cause they're not political [laughter]\nNo I mean from you

I didn't so predicted it but I thought there was a great chance that Obama\nBecause there was nobody else and Feinstein you know or or or ... she's getting old and you know Schumer is to New York and so it would still be Obama that would be the leader for a while of the Democrat Party he's nothing anymore\nNow going back to the the tragic night here in Dallas in July twenty sixteen when five

about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because they're broadcast the six PM broadcast news broadcasts was over so they went to like Facebook so I'm watching it\nOr yeah twenty sixteen months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen\nWaters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us\nNothing and I thought to myself you know there because that was one of those ah cracks in the foundation if you will of the left although it had started happening before that for me\nIt was telling because you had young activists and the two that were speaking were African American what does Obama done for us what does Hillary done for us\nThe left or the Democrats the Democratic party thinking they're going to get the when you don't get the win just because\nThey may agree with you at the moment\nThe protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single cause no it's no rational right and it it it always will be that's why the party\nHas no direct lines out that's what you get with identity politics because there is no there's no ... there is there is no general issue or goal ... goals that they actually want because when you split everybody yes when you when you continued to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party\nA particular political goal this is probably the closest to you'll get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh\nYes if the activists are are are going

heightened today and tomorrow up until the main vote on late Saturday or early Sunday Morning whenever it happens but we're at this point\nBut it is all of this chaos\nBefore\nThe actual vote and what is it that that matters it's only about the vote I mean this has further proof that this was only about the delay delay it as long as you can in hopes an outside hope I guess that Kavanaugh would pull his own confirmation and withdraw his own confirmation and or the president would do it\nUm that wasn't going to happen or the one wants to let that loud that wasn't going to happen but this president\nAnd and now we know very clearly it certainly isn't going to happen by the nominee himself but\nYou look at this entire process and it has been distorted greatly there is no guarantee here that that cabinet we will be confirmed with the actual legitimate process of all of this in place well\nYou know when you when you hear Dershowitz or talk about you know McCarthyism ... and and what happened at that time when you know you someone who accuse you of being a communist and so you'd get enraged and they'd say well sorry you don't have the ...\nUh you know against you are and I thought ... which you know really when he said he said it was so you've been a director forty years and now you're losing control because somebody's calling your comment if you're on the temperament for the job so you're out and you're blacklisted from the the ... you know from the industry\nAnd it's something that liberals used to have in their mind and I think the important thing is\nAnd it's obvious because you and I have been having this discussion\nA back and forth because it is the left\nIt is you know ... we call it the supposed to be anti fascist yet what are they promote what is their actual mindset it's authoritarianism and its fascism it's a you must live the life that that that we that that we wish you to live and what you see here what you see here\nFrom the Democrats the mindset that they're promoting everybody that you see Michael Moore and Amy Schumer and whatever whatever Hollywood people are down there screaming and yelling about you know a Brett Brett Kavanaugh and\nBelieve the accuser that the the the defendant has no rights at all the defendant is automatically guilty that is the mindset of a fascist yes that's not the mind set up somebody who believes\nIn the American constitution and the spirit of America and the spirit of due process in the spirit of the bill of rights\nOf the United states it is the mindset of a fascist\nWell and and what we call somebody when we say they have the mindset of the fascist we back it up with the ... not just oh he talks mean therefore he's a fascist no wonder is exact words and what is he actually wish to implement when we talk about President Trump\nAnd you know they started on that uh and now they've moved on and this is a very very important thing\nEnough people hated Trump where it's stuck for a while and then they decided to move on from Trump and they moved on to Kavanaugh and all of a sudden the realization as we spent all along it was a bogus argument completely bogus\nAnd allies against Trump to begin with but then they moved to somebody else\nWho more people look at and saying when all this is somebody who really really like\nThis is somebody who we really would like in that position as much we don't like Trump this was a great great great great pick and then you see the same tactics used against Trump that might've been okay for some people because they despise them so much somehow hit somebody they like and then they realized oh no if it can hit him than it can hit him\nOh my God they can come after me next thing go after anybody and that's what you learn\nWith the fascists mindset they'll pick out an attractive target to get people\nYou know motivated behind them even people of you know well of goodwill\nAnd all of a sudden those people of good will wake up one day in state and sometimes they wake up in a society and it's too late it's not too late here in the United states and it's not too late in this instance\nAnd it looks like that because people have fought back\nAre you now have you know created this unity in the Republican Party but remember it only goes so far because people are good will buy into it at times yes because it fits their political narrative but it is the mind what you're seeing is the mindset of a fascist\nAnd the fascist in this case is not the Republicans it is the Democrats and it's not debatable\nWell I mean it's very simple when you look at the group that says they're anti fascist and their name in fact this condensed down to those condensed from those two words there the group that's willing to go out and hurt people used violence\nFor thought they're the ones who are acting on it they're the ones in California who create laws that if you don't talk the way we want you to talk\nWe can send you to jail in New York we can find your business to the extent that you will be out of business\nTell me that's not fascist you you don't create the ours that somebody wishes you to create we will destroy your business you wear a hat\nYou go to a restaurant and try and have a peaceful dinner we will come on to that private property and we will shout you out\nYou'd think like us you behave like gosh you reject the bill of rights and if you don't we will destroy your life\n\nRepublicans are finally coming around and you're not even realizing oh my God\nThat's what that party has become and it's not the fringe this is the important thing that this is not the fringe this is the main stream yeah this is the Senate Judiciary committee it's the mainstream power of the republic or some of the Democrat Party\nAnd you have a Maxine Waters who doesn't get any grief from the left for saying this is what we need you to do this is what we want you to do go out and get in their face every chance you get\nAnd all of a sudden you've got pushed back yeah right because the average American will put up or for a while until all of a sudden it's like whoa okay the lines been crossed and I believe many people believe\nNow that this line has been crossed I Hope they do mhm let me put it this way I'm not going to make the prediction that they have you\nAnd that more people will start rejecting the the mindset of fascism that is being promoted by the mainstream of the Democrat Party yeah as we're always say tell us where we're wrong you can't eight six six Ninety ...\nHow much do you know about

I had been expecting the Republican Party to stand up towards the Democrats and\nDoing when they did years they did this and I think that they finally did yeah they do for years for years they have\nNot no no no but that's what's caused me to go out and vote because I Want the Republicans\n\n\n\n\nAnd or do the exact same thing again this has\nTo stop we have to let people know that\nYou cannot politicized and weaponize things such as sexual assault in order to you know have political\nGain or political advantage to do with the end with with Brett Kavanaugh getting on to the Supreme Court this this not in and I hope that people understand that\nA couple of things you know there's a there's a few things going on out there and one of which were going to be talking about more next week at the ramifications of the midterm elections it seems in now Republicans are over the top Republicans on the one energize how did that happen\nTo have a very simply because you you know I wrote a piece about this call the the rule of law versus the mob rule and when you look at what is happening on the on Capitol Hill where senators are being accosted you you just had Sheila Jackson Lee one of her ... got arrested\nBecause that person was putting out the personal information of Senate Republicans we know what happened to ... sent me this is just intensify and now\nWe have a a report that Planned Parenthood has come out and said that they're going after every single Senate Republican votes Ah yes for Brett Kavanaugh the ACLU has come out and take a stance against Brett Kavanaugh so now the ACLU was supposed\nTo be about American civil liberties is just so politicized organization\nSo what Republicans and I think you know Americans we're seeing\nIs that you have a ... that is taking over the United states of America and it's being led by the Democrat Party\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you know senator Spartacus Booker carried on and Kamala Harris or you look at someone like Richard Blumenthal you know I'm here at Fort Sill Oklahoma\nWith the first Infantry Division or a artillery reunion with men who served in Vietnam and yet we have a personal out Richard Blumenthal sitting up there talking about honor and integrity when he lied about service in Vietnam this is what is causing people to come out and say enough\nIt is colonel is so interesting your book coming out now hold Texas hold the nation victory dead tree a dead reverse to ah William Travis saying that's the message he wrote well you know we're gonna we're gonna fight to the end against the Mexican army who barely out numbered them or we will died they died and were burned alive\nAnd that is the mantra but you talk about more politics you you worry that taxes could or Republicans could lose taxes and in ... lose the country\nWell what I see happening has is is a repeat of what happened in Nevada and\nArizona New Mexico Colorado\nYou see the left coming in and they take over major urban population centers and success for red states and then they flip them but what is so amazing is that people are coming to Texas which is an economically successful state because of the ... of the conservative policies on taxes regulatory environment\nAnd you know they're thriving but yet they want to have the same failed economic policies and ideology that day a ramp from from California from Eleanor from New York and New Jersey\nAnd I think that if the the left can take a state like Texas and bake a competitive\nAnd they can win the thirty eight electoral votes there that does not bode well for our country and that is what you see the strategy of the progress of socialist left all across the United states of America is to go into major urban centers in red states in places that are economics so set a successful looking Florida Andrew Gillum and Florida look at states\n... says of what has made Georgia and Florida and that also you look at Texas successful so we have to sound that clarion call\nYou well yeah and by the way the first at first it could be against Ted Cruz although he has about four or five point lead a low over Mr O'Rourke who wisely the President Obama did not endorse that would have helped a cruise because he is not popular in Texas so on whatsoever\nYeah and but about upon further review or rock shouldn't be popular he's talented he's got charisma but he's certainly doesn't reflect what I thought outside Austin, Texas represents a but we'll see Ted Cruz has got to step it up and maybe as a I look forward to your book it's got to be great uh and of course when does it come out\n[laughter] it comes on October six things you can pre order right now I ...\nI go get it whole Texas hold the nation victory or dad who tend to colonel Allen West thanks

Mitch McConnell today I mean they really had been fighting the good fight they haven't I mean and Chuck Grassley today so I mean he came right out and said that this is uh this is mob rule and we've got to stand up to it\nYeah and ... they were they were right and again look I think the White House has been very transparent process uh you know we agreed to this second hearing we accommodated the standards are class for supplemental\nUpdate huge cabinet background check ... listen to all of the voices and this debate I ... I have been ... clear and wanting ... hear from Ford listen uh and the statements such ... jet\n... I think it was yesterday put out a statement that said afterwards viewing the report they're not even a hint of misconduct so we are confident that we have the votes and we'll look forward to such ... not being our next Supreme Court justice\n... the wall Street Journal is is reporting that are that the FBI investigation mentioned that one of the witnesses want a doctor forge witnesses was actually pressured\nBy some of doctor ... visit her testimony which I think is a polite way of saying change her testimony is the White House concerned about that report\nI'd certainly interesting are poor and I and I would encourage your listeners to go and and read it for themselves but there were a number of trust\nShe wouldn't be able to make the\nFirst hearing date because she had a fear of flying planes due to the alleged incident turns out she's a world traveler\nTravels on planes all the time I there were significant memory gaps are story changed in the first times than not struggling especially when you're using something I'm at the level of attempted rape and and so again I'm we're confident\nThat judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed and we couldn't be happier about\nThat drew also want to ask you about a judge Kavanaugh he had an op ed in yesterday's a Wall Street journal was that something that he coordinated with the White House to to publish\nWhy don't want to give every out of of of you know the behind the scenes conversations that took place but that that was from judge Kavanaugh for did not that he ever\nWere you guys are rare that he was going to do that were you aware was the White House or where he was going to do that\n[laughter] yeah Todd I I Can't get into the ins and outs of of of that particular conversation but yet but\nTo be a pretty simple question I mean this mess other state secrets or did he at least give you guys a heads up\nYes so we were aware of the op ed and judge Kavanaugh certainly made a strong case as to why he has to show temperament necessary to fit on the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I think what people have forgotten or over the last few weeks when there's been all this criticism of the way he handled himself at the last year and we've got the first set of hearing\nThat was his job interview the second hearing which judge Kavanaugh defending his reputation and his family so they're makes sense that as a human being I he would display emotion he would display anger\nAgainst the really egregious allegations uncorroborated false allegations that were leveled against him\nOh no doubt about that I ... I mean we've been supportive of judge to have it on I thought that his uh his report\nAnd would have done the exact same thing had they been in that in that position ...

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell just a little while ago on the Senate floor ladies and gentlemen uh wow thank you muster ... where where has that died ban I mean all these years\nBut he finally took a stand good for you sir and he's absolutely right\nI mean the the Democrats from day one we're going to try to destroy whoever Donald Trump dominant [noise] it just happened to be brought capital All right let's get right to the phone lines the triple eight seven eight nine nine one zero sugar land Texas hello Suzie welcome to the program\nHigh tide um I find that say first stop I'm I'm I'm libertarian Owen Sound the conservative libertarian but I'm not\nRepublican um and I I as libertarians feel we need to stand up to the Charlotte funded opposition it's appalling and you asked what people have done and actually when I started to realize what was going on with that said I'm a strong\nPerson use and constitutionalists people need to read what the sixth amendment about which ties into this innocent until proven guilty and I I had out libertarian social group we just kinda get together and discuss things with\nLike minded people who are changing\nAnd I actually posted something that's called the six ... revisiting I've told people then you need to watch once who had the cuckoo's nest you know remember what exactly ... six ... them and then you can be guilty plea approved ... the things the inquisition always kind of things from people don't really think about because\nThey are out of touch with what's going on right now and it's scary not just Republicans I'm a mom over twenty two year old son\nAnd a Twenty one year old daughter and the scares me more for him them for my daughter I think we all need to stand up and realize ... the topic\nWhat is going on right now not only is bad for politics in general for culture like society\nWell Suzie there's there's no doubt about that and you're you're absolutely right to be concerned and especially your son I was um I I was all the the the college fix dot com website during the break\nThere is there's a report coming out of the University of Washington Suzie get this\nStudents there are running a website called ah make them scared\nAnd people can go on this website and they can just accuse anybody of sexual assault without providing any evidence at all and most of the names on there are a male students at at the university I mean this is\nThis is really frightening where the leftist wanting to take the country\nWell why did this with the whole title nine thing were male students were not given the right to defend themselves when they were accused of college campus so this actually started quietly a couple of years ago thankfully Trump will not back onto a device by the\nFact that anybody I I'm\nSurprised that the African American community is not up in arms about that she didn't they used to be accused with any evidence and that was wrong that why is it okay now for wine black white male female to be accused without the right to defend themselves and be considered guilty just accusations that is appalling\nWell it is appalling Suzy ... and I'm Glad that that we have people like you are listening to this program that want to stand up to the Soros back protestors because you're right cirrhosis footing the bill for all this and I would say probably minutes couple of hours we're going to see these protest explode again\nIn the in the nation's capital normally the protesters wake up about this time of day so they'll probably be\nThe cans seem to know that the libertarians don't find that this is okay either and we all need to come together to save the culture say society\nTo protect the innocent and said I don't think you you know finding this alone civil libertarians which all ever change tend to think that's just wrong it is not acceptable\nAs soon as events are well that's good news to hear and I sure do appreciate you listening to us on Syria sects them for fifty thank you for calling in a boats again this is where\nWe are right now and uh it's in a as we're in a rough spot in America I mean we're talking about fundamental rights that are that are coming under assault the idea that that men and America should not have due process because they're men [noise]\nLiterally judging people because of the color of their skin coming out there and attacking white men saying that white men are the problem in America that's absurd\nBut we have elected leaders saying this this is again we're not talking about random protesters out on the street these people are elected leaders of the people\nAnd if they had said that about black people or Hispanic people they would have been run out of the country [noise]\nSo we're going to look we're we're opening up the phone lines today on this Friday because we need to talk about this and we need to plan and we need to prepare\nAnd we also need to get the information out and this is something that's very important because at this very moment Google and Facebook and Twitter they are cracking down on conservative content\nAnd so one of the ways that we found to work around that to get you the information you need is to provide you with our free newsletter that's how we do that I encourage you get a copy of an invite your neighbors to get a copy of it touched orange dot\nShouldn't we don't

the fear of flying and the the polygraph and are\nAll very suspicious very yeah ... ... and I'm\nSuspicious characters actually that an hour showing up at fit\nBehind the scenes you know that her lawyers really seem to be representing more the Democrat opposition than her\nSo um this was a delaying tactic um and so that you know hundreds or thousands of protesters could come into town intimidate senators but at what price to this man's wife\nThis man's children this man's mother and his own good name and so this isn't me to this is a kind of McCarthyism and uh I think the American people are saying it for what it is I saw a poll Kim straw so wrote about this this morning it was NPR PBS NewsHour Maris um that um\nThe Democrats have lost some enthusiasm they had coming into this election it's because the American people I think see this as a this is a a smear attack\nThen of course I'm from the ... and our Fox News bowling indicates that the same but this was having an impact on those down ballot races a across the across the country I Want to get back though to what this is really all about Dr John Allen and you point this down in in the press release you guys\nCourt for a generation and we're talking about some very big issues and not just the pro life as you were talking about free speech as well and really what it means to be an ... an American I mean these are very big issues\n[noise] that's right I mean the constitution is crystal clear about the freedom of religion freedom of speech and freedom of press\nBut the left has a very particular view\nUm and it is a freedom from religion not freedom of religion and may be freedom of worship but not freedom to exercise every day in your business or at school I mean we've seen that now state but stay up and down the country\nUm they are for marginalizing or people of faith people with religious conviction about the constitution clearly protects that and I'm Kavanaugh is an originalist he is a constitutional list\nAnd he believes that you know if the laws are going to be changed it's that\nThe Congress that has to do that and the president it's not the Supreme Court\nAnd um that they want 'em left is still in the court they want people who will essentially legislate from the bench and you're right on the life issue on the liberty the freedom issue um this is the way you know they like to change the law because the people won't vote for this\nAll right Dr Johnson we're going to have to leave it there I really appreciate you coming on the show today and voicing your your support for judge gambit on\nYeah tell your folks at let's all call mentioned and Collins and flake thank them for the vote and encourage them today that's important\nOh yes and we're all over that Dr Johnson ...

get a job doing\nHuman Services um what I did before I was I [laughter] I Can't tell people who are trying to get um\nAh he doesn't have them attention he gets about Fifteen hundred and Social Security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do at this stage for him um I Do provide him so I took over all the bills\nThe rest of the ... [laughter] I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying all and I'm paying all his spare the sale half about um ten K. left on the equity ... two thousand on a credit card mhm eight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd how much are you able to put on the debt\nI'm putting everything\nMost of the turnout to honor everything on on that much money does that amount to what is it\nA month [noise] ...\nI think it amounts to about\nA thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nIf you will have on the car eight and a half and chew on a credit card\nOkay and you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done and the year okay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a dead in a year right rankles\nGet him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and they still work in the studio plans I don't understand that right\nOkay so there's going to come a moment and it will come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I'm afraid of you know my prayer is at least that he gets through this year\n... and that way you get free and if he's a hundred percent that free house and everything you can probably make it on his Social Security if you had to write okay not yeah not ideal not what we want but we can probably get there and uh\nThe next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get debt free then let's build an emergency fund a three to six months of expenses but we get past that then let's start building some nest egg for retirement but the fastest way to building\nThe baby steps in other words [noise] okay that sounds good I'm asking if I had a bank loan um someone that have H. B. K. and all you know four and a and it\nCan be paid off in twenty forty three and knowing that\nHe went and will live that long\nWhen two reasons one is they're stupid and the second reason is counting on the house I've got a lien against the house right now that you know\nAnd so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral is part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the question is\nYou know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry I mean they'll they'll loan anybody that's breathing or not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid show there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nAnd ... and so the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and then it's like no they would've offered a dog that credit card\nSo I mean and dead people get credit card offers show is you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how are you\nOn the umpires have I got to require retirement okay\nPretty good mhm\nI click here at sixty two it'd be better to file for Social Security and weight while before we take for we have for the whole time and they ...\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it to see if you're white from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes of you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it by not taking after four O. one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation oh\nThat would definitely has [laughter] yeah you gotta you gotta kind of gas and you've got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... deaf I drove a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that and those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety\nAccording to the stat tables right now and so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question man thank you for joining U.S Open phones AAA eight to five five to two\nAnd I know well I'm\nI I when I spoke to the lady she said I could ask you a question and I just got the starter pack off of your website for myself for my for my

and go\nHave you ever done stuff like that and we'd anymore how much\nI mean we play baseball we play football we spent a lot of time arguing about the call 'cause we we'd we'd always argue about whether somebody's out of bounds we played and played and played and played and played run in and out of each other's houses and one mom always had some lemonade one mom would always have some\nBaloney sandwiches I mean it was a great neighborhood\nAnd I remember being a little kid and some of the kids I played with started going to school I thought man\nI Want to go to school you know be cool to go to school when I can go to school I'll be happy than you ever thought that and and then I got to go to kindergarten and I thought man next year I'll be in a grade with a number on it\nI'll be happy then they teach you to read in the first grade I'll be happy then\nAnd when back when I went to school and I don't know where you go to school but I mean we had one through six was elementary school and and so you know you're about a second grader and all the sixth graders there the king of the hill right they own the school right and so you're like man\nIf I could just get in the sixth grade I'd be like the big dog on campus I'd be in charge I'd be the I'd be ruined the school man\nI'll be happy then then you finally get\nTo sixth grade and you know what you look over there and we had what we called junior high school and middle school which was\nSeven eight nine the school I went to and man if\nI could just get out of six ... middle school you know they've got they've got P.

University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to it you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a new emergency ah no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college you know five twenty nine or an ESL and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plans here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\nAnd so if I pay a an item\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to sell ... at all or none\nNo it's not an all or none or what the it's it's essentially a they're looking at the three million for all the and or or you know obviously one point five for half\nOkay so you just don't want him going\nYeah and my biggest concern is a risk yeah I mean we are not oil people\nYeah I think one thing I'm asking is women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling half\nWere deciding on how much to sell\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it would I go by oil rights within my answer would quickly be no mainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay\nBut that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars in the middle kitchen table would I go go by our rights in West Texas where the if the answer is no then it's time to sell\nFor the same reason I think you know that you wouldn't know why and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know when we're afraid the stock market crash yeah well\nIt might but I I got to tell you start getting less rock markets less risk than drilling holes\nYeah we'll hundred percent sure that you don't ...

because one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value\nOK okay you're not violating that though show or good or the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand good and how much debt other than the eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\n\nOr we have about Ninety thousand\nOkay that that that includes the car the car and what is the Ninety thousand on\n[noise] mostly student loans or we have some tax stuff a medical bills\nOkay so can you pay off forty five a year making one forty and be debt free in two years my answer would be yes\nYes and um that would mean that if you want to keep her car there's nothing out of line with keeping it but just at all so I mean we're not going to keep the dad a regardless of the interest rate we're just going to get rid of it but you know so but if you told me you owe thirty thousand dollars on her car I I Would sell it in a heartbeat\nOkay because when we were it wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't fit neither one of these equations\nI mean you wouldn't be dead already in two years probably and on top of that uh uh of of course you'd have too much tied up in vehicles and so that would change my ... and that's how I use it shifted decision making paradigm that's all it is it gives you a critical thinking\n... filter to look at this and say what are you doing there what are you doing really good question thanks\nThousand dollars in cash huh huh I'm I Know that other than my house um which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I\nI mean I have about fourteen thousand coming in\nAs a gift for my one year old college fund um [noise] so I'm going to be putting that into it checked five twenty nine I think for him and and kind of picking out some growth stocks mutual fund\nTo I don't know if your quotes from their ... um so my question is what are kind of my\nWhat do I deal with this kind of pile of cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses for for um you know every any given month is about twenty\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only income right now [laughter]\nUm so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shy shy throw it towards my how he owns a little bit every year or should I put it someplace\nElse we teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation than if you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses um and that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so uh twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate as adjusted emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans\nNow uh what do you make\nAll right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a any tension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well\nIs that mandatory\nOkay\nAll right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent is a Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousand ten thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four O. one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have just opened up a rock or re ... with a better man which is one of the oil and high hundreds for me I'm familiar\nWith what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo shortcoming they're they're they're doing pretty good\nBut none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in ... at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time and a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would do just go to smart faster at Dave Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the ... best in business I don't care what you do okay I had an effect my income at all\nBut people have always asked me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each uh unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred is eleven thousand\nShipments across four types of growth stocks mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put forth in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international now once you're doing that and you have the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it in mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine\nOkay I just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that that's maybe step three is fit or babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different in in you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it\nAnd in what you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget uh any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last baby step and that's max out all retirement\nAnd invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr what you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I find that my budget um all the ski jumping around that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you guys are better than I deserve what's up\nSo I have ah currently two hundred and twenty three thousand ain't got a hundred and Ninety\nAdditional from a service academy or three years ago\nUm and that the remaining thirty case like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously much smaller so my question is I'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly for the hundred and Ninety three thousand of reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact it will eventually end up any collections account if I'm not able to pay the amounts and fall I'm\nYeah I'm In what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um and I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year my also\nWow so you might learn if you guys are on the Internet I'm sad and so what I'm going to just put this on her Ninety three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can 'cause you got wonderful income you'll be different two years\nIt's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start someone thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou're gonna get a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYes or so yeah a little known fact if you are just enrolled I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either ask the surf through endless service or you're assigned\nTo the recruitment and death\nUm and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it it goes over to the U.S treasury so you have the option\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with this I did not know that you have to learn something wow well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business\nYou have to be intentional with every decision you make\nAs an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter\nDot com slash Dave to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new it finds them for you\nIt's powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes\nIdentifies people with the right skills education and experience for your job\nAnd actively invites them do apply\nSo you get qualified candidates fast and right now my listeners contrived zip recruiter for free at zip recruiter dot com slash Dave that's zip recruiter dot com slash Dave zipper crude or the smartest way to hire\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nWrite I actually last January took myself you know of of her checking am because\nHeart when I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs yeah well we know and and so he wasn't in his right mind\nI rest my case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to participate in her healing\nGood life and make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent for mom of eventually\nBut if you can get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual but to do that was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again\nBut you like going to see last time not because she was healthy but because she was on healthy yeah and I'd like to get her up and running in healthy\nYou know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't she going to hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again broke you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that have it and those that love them but the good news is I have seen hey innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nOur now she only to the Medicaid if she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nWell there's you you don't want him just in a in a fall the rest of their life\nAs I Know I mean they had control their she'd only war to the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen yeah uh as as as early mentally ill and she is way says she's not on a couple of different minutes\nHer ... her only shot then is what we're talking about but our goal is\nYeah and it happens to people all the time so what does she say right now when they call her on the show you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nYou know are you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you're just a you know because they're going to just I don't think I should be talking she should\nBe telling them to be either one of your among them long conversation it's got nothing you get nothing because all their donors ... her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs go and then we start negotiating and trying to work our way through the debt right\nWell my husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate\nAnd I aren't going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah\nOkay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months out there they're going aren't\nPliable today but she's got no money and you're not giving her any\nNo so they get nothing they get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people called collectors\nUntil let's say I mean she'll she'll I'm a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight hundred there did she say look it can we work at a deal\nYeah or you know they got Thirteen hundred bucks you haven't seen any money in two years I'm no backup and working again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that in the settlement in full will do it and get an in writing and no electronic access to your\nChecking account because whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's a filthy industry\nAnd so you got to treat them like

[laughter] I Can't tell people who are trying to get um work with a nonprofit that housing\nThe bank\nUh he doesn't have them attention he gets about Fifteen hundred and Social Security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do\nAt this stage for him um I Do provide him so I took over all the bills and I do provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that for him to buy food\nAnd what are you doing with the rest of the gas and I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying all on than all his bills he still has about um Fifteen K left on the equity loan ... two thousand on a credit card ... eight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd how much are you able to put on the edge\n[noise] I'm putting everything\nWill turn out to on everything on on that that much money does that amount to what is it\nA month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about four thousand a month it was pretty good\nEight or eight and a half and chew on a credit card\nOkay and it you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done in a year\nOkay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with the dead and a year right your ankles to get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and he's still working the steel plant them understand that right yes I was going to come a moment and it'll come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I'm afraid of you know my prayer is at least that he gets through this year\nMhm and that way your debt free and if he's a hundred percent debt free house and everything you can probably make it on his Social Security if he had to write okay not yeah not ideal not what we want but we can probably get there and uh\nThen the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get dead free then let's build an emergency fund a three to six months of expenses but we get past that and then let's start building some nest egg for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement is to clear that dead and to have that emergency fund and blood\nAnd is still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay that sounds good I'm asking is why a bank loan um someone that have H. B. K. animal you know four and they and they can be paid off in twenty forty three and knowing that\nHe went to live that long\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid and the second reason is is they're counting on the house I've got to lean against the house right\nNow that's yeah and so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is [laughter]\nBodies were either not breathing money you know what I'm saying the lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nAnd ... and so the industry is you're stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it's like no they would've offered a dog that credit card\nSo I mean in dead people get credit card offers show is you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offers you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how are you\nOn the umpires have I got to require retirement okay I'm going to hear about a year and a ... inch and then I'll have a while we pay off of what he good mhm\nI quickly of ethics you too would be better to file for Social Security and weight while before I ... well we have for the whole entire family\nYou can run the math out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it to say no words if you wait from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it will you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally speaking\nI you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it by not taking out their four O. one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take\nIt earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different parts to that equation\nAnd you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation\nOh that would definitely have\n[laughter] [laughter] yeah so you got to kind of gas and you've got to say you know average death age of a male and the U. S. is Seventy six averaged ... deaf I drove a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that and those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety\nAccording to the stat tables right now and so um that that's what you've got

not a a lot of friendliness going on meaning the Republicans and Democrats states are Democrats and Republicans\nStates and they\nDid what they thought they had to do and I looked at the way that

that in dated urban planning so that our understanding is that there was an urban were other day we damn stress shore cranium\nThe unemployment rate's actually the lowest ... the lowest rate we've seen since Nineteen sixty nine so I think that that sort of confirms but it'd be other numbers we're seeing right now and that is that the economy is actually really healthy at the moment\nYes kind of me as healthy it fails healthy people I talk to\nTalk about you know what this just it feels like it's motor along don't get me wrong we're going to have a slow down and hopefully it's not another crash I don't think it will be but the way we're spending and borrowing you never know but the ... this economy feels good and heading into a fourth quarter\nThat is huge and I think this year we're going to be massive fourth quarter and it is a it is it is the confidence is there\nPeople are looking for jobs don't have to worry they're finding jobs and people are having the opportunity to to essentially ghost jobs they're getting job offers and they're thinking this sounds good and then five minutes later they get another job offer it is it feels like a real best a robust solid economy

out there I mean getting college more as we look at it we think oh it's it's it is if you're just kind of like the Olympics the reality is there's so much money there's billions and billions of dollars in it and one of the places that billions of dollars comes from is the athletic side of the Nike or Adidas\nThe Under Armour the and one because these kids they go out to recruit them young ages you who you're going to play for which AU team but you're going to the night cap you going to the ... camp it's vitally important and then a lot of weights they'll try to follow you to certain schools\nA lot of fans think well they want to put shoes on kids in eighth grade or because they think that you know they they might be an end and this kid might be an NBA player and he's going to be a Nike a endorse or when it gets the NBA\nThat's a small part of the center of what they really want to do what it is Nike and Under Armour largely want to do is funnel kids to the schools they sponsor and then they are human billboards you know within this amateur sport\nThey are human billboards for whichever apparel they're wearing and that is one of the most cynical things so Louisville signed a to sign a hundred and sixty million dollar contract with the leaders\nAnd all these kids are wearing Adidas stuff from the bookstore by the way you can barely find a book you know after you you know after you get through all the details gear and that's true\nYou know at Ohio State with Nike or\nUnder Armour at at UCLA where the former football coach said now everybody's going nowhere big time because we got this huge contract from Under Armour\nAnd I was like really you have seven Nobel Prize winners who came through UCLA you had John Wooden and it takes being associated with them Under Armour to be the time so everything is sort of turned upside down by the money and by the\nCommercial partnerships with a shoe companies\nTalking to Michael ... love and his new book which is amazing last temptation of Rick Pitino story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball\nYou know now we've got betting we've got all of this stuff money's huge March Madness the whole nine yards we always wink wink nudge nudge Israel played the pools and played the brackets and stuff I think this is going to affect the this moving forward because the NCAA it's holding on\nFor all they possibly can as far as their you know hey we're just amateurs their student athletes they get a free college ride but they see the money's at the coaches make that the NCAA makes and now you've got betting and how's that going to play into this\nKids who play these games generate money in ways we don't even think of the recruiting sites you know rivals dot com and uh you know the whatever bleacher report runs and I I Can't even remember all the names of them but they're they're all these\nUh betting all these recruiting sites that that run on\nFocusing on the decisions being made by Seventeen year olds well you know what these are big businesses\nThe the the several of them have been bought or sold emerged in the last few years for like three hundred four hundred million dollars at least so\nYou've got that you've got you know all the hotels and restaurants to benefit you know that are sitting outside of the stadiums\nAnd now you're going to have legalized betting which means more betting and that's off the sweat and the muscle of the kids were playing the game so adjust well multiply the inequality that we have now and it's really intolerable you know you can't say after a while\nYou were giving you a thirty thousand dollar a year scholarship\nGuess what you're generating forty five million dollars in annual revenue at the University of Louisville or which was the highest of any of the schools but you know tens of millions everywhere\nYou look I ... and that's that that's the thing that's insane is how much money and I don't look I mean like this past weekend I watched Alabama destroyed the raging Cajun or Louisiana Tech or whatever was in football they're going to get their million dollar check and that'll pay for the rest of their football season I understand is that it's a business\nAnd and that's that that's fine I got zero problems with that uh I just but I don't like is disingenuous by the NCAA that saying that hey this is this is not really business is all about amateur athletics and when you and I both know what's BS and the reality is\nThe FBI had to look in this because the NCAA didn't want this stuff on covered because they're they looked like they have egg on their face because they're allowing this stuff to go on right under their nose\nOr that is all absolutely right\nIf you look at the FBI charging documents on the indictments the FBI comes off as pretty naive because their whole case is\nSort of positive on the the FBI has uncovered a this these this wrongdoing and these characters who they have indicted were violating the spirit of of amateur ism and and you know letting these in these players be\nCommercially exploited and I'm thinking well okay but the NC double a itself is is it commercially exploitive organization that didn't take a Christian doctrines or one of his one of those charger or these Adidas characters to exploit them they're\nThey're signing up for that basically 'cause that's the way the system is\nYou know the ... thing is as always interested me because you'll hear about these guys and it doesn't you don't know it's it is it is we don't find basketball players playing high school basketball anymore what travel team beyond the EU and some of those guys\nGenerate massive amounts of money they're making quarter million dollars coaching AAU basketball and some of them end up getting jobs at these colleges if they bring the right kids with them and I think it's not just a college you know or an NCAA thing and I think that it it goes much deeper that I don't think people realize that\nWell that's that's a big word of this problem the the grassroots circuit which is funded by the shoe companies and kids may play high school basketball but the hunting ground the recruiting ground is the ... circuit\nAnd college coaches love at first of all they're getting money from the shoe companies but it also means instead of and this was sunny ... brilliant ... was the man at Nike who brought Michael Jordan to Nike and and pretty much design a system um\nSo what Sonny understood as college coaches don't last\nCompete against the uh five ten kid who is covering him\nSo let's put together something we're number one all the best players are playing against each other and just as importantly let's put it in Las Vegas on our land oh and let's let's put it in places where these college coaches can come and stay in five star hotels and eat great dinners at night\nUh so that's what you've got now so part of the unwinding of this whole system\nIf you really wanted to do it would be to send college coaches back to the small towns and high school gyms and believe me they don't want to do it\nWhat what what what's the solution here going I must solutions based guy I I think at some point in time ... you've got to throw your hands up and say look this is the system we've got we've got to figure out a way to\nTo do you do not so much keep it in it and keep a disguise but let's just be transparent about it and figure out the best way of dealing with it but going forward what do you think the best solution is is it is it that no more one in ... those kinds of things would that take some of that out of it just either you're going to the NBA you're going to college for two or three years how do we work around this\nWell the number one and done which I think it's coming only takes the top ten or twelve kids out of this equation and they can go right to the NBA so that does a little but it doesn't do much\nUh the solution is to cut the kids in this in to a significant part of the revenue which means not we're going to take your stipend up from three thousand to ten thousand it means we're really going to pay you were going to figure out a way to pay you in\nThere are some people in the NCAA who who don't want to do that I think there are some who do want to do it and legitimately can't figure out how and I and I get that because there are title nine problems you know the only they talked about revenue sports you really talking about profit sports and that's men's basketball and college football\nSo can you pay them and not pay the women athletes is that right is it\nQuarterback who you you know paid as a freshman and sophomore what did he starts thrown interceptions and and somebody somebody takes his job you could cut his pay you're going to fire him\nOr are you going to pay your star point guard on the basketball team more than the scholarship kid who's who's like the ninth or tenth player on the team these are all the things that you would have to deal with and they're not easy I think they're legitimately not easy\nAnd I think as much as a lack of a will to to cut kids and there's there's a lack of of a real understanding of how it might be done but I there's got to be a way to do it and I think they have to do it\nAbsolutely I I think there's gotta be something done sooner rather than later at the last ... you know the story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball Michael a cycle of free speech coming on today and a book is a is a great read and it's interesting you especially if you've got young kids out there who one day are looking to go into a sports and maybe have a chance at a scholarship\nYou should know a lot of the perils that are out there appreciate

E. O. J. P. Morgan Chase for these past fourteen years among others would say that he did not himself need a tax cut\nBut I think there's broad agreement that the piece that has to do with empowering business to do better on the world stage did need work and uh so I think the president and his Republican counterparts on Capitol Hill deserve um the credit\nTo the extent that they did advocate for abroad bit of tax relief which is helping the economy probably for the next couple of years so there's I don't think there's any getting away from that\nTalking to mark ... dot com as we discussed the economy and because we all that's the one thing I started telling me that we all share and the economy I get what you say you're right left you not my president he's my president tribal politics all the stuff we all share and the economy we buy things we sell things we work we have homes we got things we've got to take care of\nRight now the market itself is the job market is good you're seeing more and more people to feel confident enough to quit their jobs and wet and I always like when people say well you know the growth rate for for jobs as far as money is that what it was it a lot of ways I tell everybody because very rarely do you get a raise your work a lot of times what you do is you jump across the street\nBecause they're willing to give you a raise that your company is not going to match\nSo there's a lot of that I don't think gets added in when you look at this marketplace you look at the job place if you're somebody right now is this a great time for entrepreneur is is a great time to jump jobs is just a place where you feel like now is the time to strike\n[noise] well I think you know first of all if you\nUsa you have the opportunity to do something that no one else in the world can do because we have the uh widest deepest capital markets\nWe have the greatest uh innovation in off the planet and that's why you know we continue to create companies that do things that really don't exist anywhere else so all large businesses used to be small businesses we know the legends about Steve Jobs and\nA Jeff Bezos beginning in their garages so they were small businesses to begin a there are some measures out there that suggests than there are a little controversial but there are some measures out there that suggests that small business is growing as well as it used to\n'em and I'll just sort of\nLeave that there for the moment ah and there are some who are sharply critical of the growth of the likes of Facebook Google um Amazon the list goes on and on saying essentially a they are crippling tech entrepreneur as them by essentially doing what Facebook did buy\nA essentially buying Instagram and then seems to be in the process of killing Snapchat so there you know those are all inevitably a questions that have as much to do with regulation as anything else\nBut to the broader point I think it's All right now is a superb time to be looking for work to be starting a business and you know people always have challenges no matter what the point in our history or they happened to be doing that uh you know if you people succeeded by building businesses in the midst of the depression\nFor goodness sake and and the same can be said of in two thousand seven two thousand eight two thousand nine so if somebody has the vision has a great idea and is
