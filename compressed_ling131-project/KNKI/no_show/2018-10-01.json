I Love the way you split it has it has a what a Sunday in years I I Love the way you have to put out of there because when you went on the other day if they don't count you know\nWell there's two of them so I mean I'm not going to get away throwing a party for him when he's over thirty six and one on Sundays in his last do you think this is all contract which is the only reason I don't know they're\nNo well first of all it was a situation were what were you going to do you weren't going to give them another chance it was all his fault you thought that you you know he was the problem with the team if that if you felt like that uh then you should a fire but look ... in that position look what you got out of it you got the number one pick so\nYou know maybe it didn't turn out so bad now\nI don't think he has a massive\nContract I just kind of digging right now I don't think this was contractual issue I think they're giving them every opportunity but there are just some bone headed coaching moves that were making the on both sides by a guy that's making ten ... allegedly a season and by a guy that may not be but I just I started looking at the numbers with a huge accident\nAnd the town I think I see on the field with Cleveland right now you've got a new general manager an entirely new front office I mean I I don't know this is probably ended up being the first guy to go this year we start working on her coaches hot seat rankings\nDo you think that they purposely kept him because of exactly and I I'm not saying they could have ever predicted this but it it crossed everybody's mind years ago\nEven saying that for a long time now it just may come through because of the suspension urban Meyer but I mean is it so far fetched I mean what do you think the why would be to say that urban Meyer is going to be the head coach\nHe's got himself a franchise quarterback\nDotting heading into this week Mitt I actually I can find a tweet I I'm too lazy to dig it up right now and I taught for him and coming up next\nBut I saw a couple of NFL guy say hey see people around the leagues and the browse might have the best defense in the ... so that played out today but they've got town they gotta miles Garrett in there the rebuilding their offensive line that got young play makers they haven't been afraid I mean Nick Chubb had over a hundred yards on what two three carries sixty are touched\nDown rather than at the time that happened and how many years and by the way you see that's exactly Cleveland played this right they were lousy for years they got the quarter back to their future it worked out good for them now all they needed that coach of the future and that that can be urban Meyer after what happened to them this year\n... I think I think it would be ... and he's in a situation at Ohio State to wear Columbus is embracing him but still the rest of the world is still ... questioning every single move\nAnd the whole silence whenever Ohio State tweeted that out this week and how that came kind of a means city if you will\nI hadn't really thought about it too much already but I think that's a damn good perspective or at least projection about what could be next in Cleveland and\nI don't know if a good season and I don't know what you would consider a good season I mean this is still a team that as we all agree could easily be for no right now right so I don't know what Jimmy has them or what a John door she would look at it as a good season\nBut I still think ... and less they go ten in six or eleven and five right I think they're making a change and I'm thinking with their roster they're not going to be afraid to swing for the fences right now not at all\nNo why would you be a I Would think that there'll be some you know a a pretty high up coaches that would like to get that job so no I first person I've already contacting urban Meyer right now uh I'm not wait until the end of the year I just want to gauge interest and and and see what goes on from there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nI truly exceeds any expectation already dream are sort of ever have about a hospital I was told when you go

out of the country isolated showers and you're trying to get a night mostly audience fifty five and more scattered showers and that is arms anticipated throughout our Monday the high seventies chances for showers and storms Monday Night anti said Hi every sixteen\n... hot I talk a lot of ...\nAbout an economic things last week and and so with the the announcement the day that that a new United States Canada and Mexico\nTrade deal has been done and were stating that because no longer is it North American it's United States Canada and Mexico right name has been changed\n[laughter] a ... of a couple of economic indicators are you know the month of July was was horrible I mean it was the highest in five months for trade a deficit soybeans killed us or not being able to sell soybeans\nA Europe isn't going to be able to make up the majority of the story being lost it we have had and civilian aircraft got hit a real big in in in July uh last week economic indicators coming out that big you know because of the tariffs are that were put into place just about a little ... about a week and a half ago\nThat it was starting to hurt a manufacturing not only in China but the indicators in the United states you could see them going down as well you and I've talked about this many times you can scream that you want to get\nThe trade imbalance down but the reality is the only thing that matters is economic growth that's a strong thing that the president\nHas had right now you know that there are people in the White House like Larry Kudlow might not be Wilbur Ross might not be Peter Navarro\nBut you know the ... and they're telling him you cannot have these kinds of massive tariffs with Europe the United states Mexico and\nChina it's going to kill your economic growth if you wish can be president didn't twenty twenty you've got to reverse course got you got to come up\nWith a ... a deal if you wish to isolate China politically you probably can survive that but you cannot isolate the\nThis deal was done so quickly at the last second knowing the administration knowing that look Congress is not going to approve just a free trade deal and you're going to go in there and say okay fine NAFTA's gone and nothing replaces is going into the going into the midterms\nAnd then uh wanting to have economic growth in two thousand Nineteen and twenty twenty and you've just said ... gone massive tariffs on China won't deal with Europe you've got advisors to the president's saying you can't do this did you hear a Christian or was the one they say that\nWas the one that that got everybody to calm down\n... ... ... there was one right read that and I'm like well really well\nI mean the reality is is that again uh you you head into the mid term you don't have something done you're not going to get anything done uh on the Mexico deals so you're left with nothing\nOr you get this when and claim you know you can at least claim that you're selling more dairy to Canada\nIf you can if you can call it a win\nWhich if you're selling more it's it's not less well look we so we ... we said this already that they're you know to try to to try to regulate and international economy and sorry I Know people don't want an international economy but the reality is you can stop it\nBut even I Can't stop your ... you can isolate yourself from but you can't stop it it's impossible\nBut when you have as we talked about in Mexico per capita were a day if you look at the trade going back ... back back and forth across the border and it's a tough thing to figure out because as we said before remember forty percent of what comes in from Mexico\nAnd what a good comes in from Mexico forty percent of that good was made in the United states and the average product has\nPer capita that's their population\nFor every dollar they ... they you know they tend to watch we sent them three dollars they're smaller country\nThey've a third of the ... you know close to a third of the population of the United states Canada has like what one eighth of the population in the United states\nAnd we were uh selling them like for every dollar they set us you know for every dollar you know we bought as in you know per capita that's per person\nIn the United states of Canadian products per capita they were buying roughly eight to nine to ten dollars over the last couple of years per capita is what we were selling them there were smaller country you're not going to equalize the trade deficit it's impossible oh there's no way you'll ever get there\nOh I don't care how much more dairy you're going to sell them they'll never consume as much as the United states won't even be close no\nSo uh again we'll see what comes out of this and it probably we you know start leaking out hopefully in the ... next couple of weeks especially since now goes before Congress and we'll update on what's in there for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nGoing to pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles where the chance of showers today we'll continue to see the chance of rain along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida\nYou'll note we've already seen some snow and the higher elevations of the mountain regions of some of the northern tier states Idaho Montana north and South Dakota so if you're traveling in

means getting in your face which means expect more of that where ever you are if you're a lawmaker oh I'm Sorry if you're a Republican lawmaker\nThey don't see they don't care about flakes hatred for the president they don't care about his disdain for see I don't know if he was looking to coon by his situation now he knew he wasn't going to win in November So he decided not to run\nThen he of course has been going off on the president on a number of things holding up procedures and and and essentially are a number of items hostage so he can get his way\nHe was ... going to the left repeatedly but see Mr flake they don't care about you or your disdain for Trump\nYou can be in agreement for that disdain with them they don't care\n'cause you're still the bad guy so he goes in and he of course decides he's going to hold up to vote I'll I'll support it in committee\nBut I'm not going to support it on the broad vote well there you have the essentially the door open for others to say okay we support that as well\nSo now you have the background check not in this is not an investigation\nIt is they've done several already they're gonna do another one and the scope is limited and see the liberals got on onto the president for limiting the scope of this is only about ... the accusations but it does include there were mirrors accusations not just the Ford accusation right\nSo now you have again the claim being made and now it's going to be ... by the way we could have done this\nJuly thirtieth with the Ford accusations\nAnd you got what the FBI going and doing interviews they will not make the decision they will just hand their report to the White House the White House will send it to the Senate that's how the all of this has got to work\nSo you delayed it by\nA week or if you're the Democrats you realize this thing is going to go nowhere new start screaming perjury\nWhile the house isn't going to bring up perjury charges perjury for what exactly what specifically and where's the proof that he lied about it\n\nSee the problem with the Ford allegations is that you cannot they ... they think it's impossible to prove or disprove based on what has been present well\nThey initially jumped on the fact that there were a a of friends of a Ford who said he lied when he said but he lied about his drinking right\nOh yeah right\nHow just how is that I you know he talked about the fact that he drank and mhm and in high school he lights\nOrder in ever said he ... he never he said he never blacked out right now but he said he fell asleep after drinking ... which might have you know but but how do you [laughter] well I didn't get much perjury you you don't know if he blacked out or not so how do you get 'em on perjury for that but I don't I don't understand\nWell you know what's interesting here is if we're going to go off on that then then what about every person who wants to run for president because I don't know I remember a rock Obama and the and and uh and him smoking pot and the story of him\nSmoking pot in all of this but they're just sending the perjury of it oh no no no I Know but but the point is the perjury is what goes back to we want to label him as a bad guy he's a liar he's a blackout fall down drunk right\nWell\nThen this was and then you've got the pushback of course on Sunday from a Lindsey Graham and and others are where it was you know look this guy is not a stumbling drunk\nBut at the centrally goes back to label ... labeling him Kavanaugh at such from high school or gosh ah I thought we set that standard with Bill Clinton with with ah with Brock Obama\nAnd others oh it only matters is if he's if he leans right\nIf he's a threat to the left then we're going to shout well we never you never heard of a guy drinking beer in high school really\nI I what I also love was how they move the goal post were first on friday a and part of Saturday it was he's two part just because of his reaction attacking the Democrat asked the data that they that he was that that he was too\nWell the part that turned into cars than the the uh uh the report came out about ... Britain's Ginsburg back and twenty a sixteen where she said uh that I'm\nA\nShe calls Trump fake her ... she's getting involved in politics you shouldn't be getting involved in politics and this is a direct accusation at you by individuals mhm he didn't take on and say the entire Democratic Party he said you well and I had written in in one story or because\nThere was no promise a that he could he could he could rule without bias or something to that extent and I thought are you kidding me you've got started on my or on tape on record\nSaying it is the job of judges and justices to legislate from the bench\n\nThe whole thing is this is it because if it were another let's say Elena Kagan that the president nominated now there would still be objections he must be up to something that would probably be the objection [laughter] it's Trump he must be up to something\nI mean he could have nominated Merrick Garland oh no no no no no no we look further into Merrick Garland and he's the wrong choice I mean it it it would have been something some kind of objection\nBut for the media that there's no promise that Kavanaugh would leave is biased side\nElle Zhu what first of all but they still don't get it right but then they dropped that they dropped that in became his temperament it became his anger it wasn't that it was directed that because once against Berg thing came out of the women Ginsburg has been political all the time\nPetition or the or the or the ADA too uh to change their um [noise] uh uh\nTheir ranking up him as a from well qualified and because of his temperament because of its scream or because of his anger\nMhm yeah right\nThat's where they've gone I mean and so it's just they just keep moving the goalposts Nichols holds because goalpost because Grassley and flake let it happen they allow them to move the goalpost and here we are and it will be two weeks\nEssentially passed when it should have happened the vote so that's on them ... ... but did they have the numbers last week while they wouldn't have without flake\nYou're talking about friday as part of why they they have the ... they didn't have the numbers and had no choice well apparently this is where it had changed recording goal reports this flight was able to convince the others a handful of others to get on board and support the background check\nOtherwise da da da da da da da da and uh she's gone to them and said you know he doesn't have the temperament disturb because he got angry excuse me somebody you're not just\nBeautiful ... they they sit there and they accuse you\nThey do not not her but they said without any cooperating evidence your and attempted rapist and you're a rapist oh yeah because of the you know because of the uh uh you know you're a gang rapist mhm and they say that and you get angry at them\nAnd so then they scream and yell and say you don't have the temperament to serve no beautiful ... that's what they're doing now mhm just keep moving the goalpost\nWell because it's every you they know it's a this is the debt\nIt's like the old throwing a Hail Mary hoping to land somewhere that it will eventually block Kavanaugh the problem is what they don't see is the fight on the right and the right does not include Jeff Flake\nMhm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMhm\nMhm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n... were the radio [noise] very much Ira ... every girl you've talked about everything will follow search to social issues and news of the day whether you're a lawyer for your job story you're the one ... the Seuss wrote a review [noise]\nAll across America eight six six Ninety ... these are currently and I'm Mary McNamara good morning [noise] well as the old rock stations used to say welcome to walk over [noise]\nYeah [noise] but as we call it [noise] October\n\nI just sort of talked Tobar I I had a bunch of friends around it used to work at rock stations they used to just rats are about all the time and you asked a question do any rock stations still say that today it's rock over well how can\nThey not what are they going to make an announcement we're no longer do in the rock Tobar thing we're not doing that anymore we're not no you got to keep doing it you start it you've got to keep going\nWell I have had that much I have friends in rock radio I've had uh friends and acquaintances in the media all over the place all over the country ... one of them is a man by the name of ...

the supplemental background check the witness was about will be interviewed all agreed to fully cooperate they will answer questions asked and then I'll walk but it would give the same answers they've already given under oath and under penalty of felony perjury\nThis was announced on friday and I said here's where it's different because you can compare forge testimony to her what she told the Washington Post\nThe Washington Post things could change drastically by the time she testifies and some things didn't change\nSo\nNow what different is of course the Washington Post doesn't have prosecutorial power doesn't have there's no bearing there there was no nothing that was said and this is not a criminal investigation so she wouldn't be charged with with lying to investigators here with the FBI but\nIt is official record after she testified so the standard is the testimony given on Thursday mhm she hasn't been interviewed yet not Ramirez has not testified under oath she hasn't been interviewed according to reports on Sunday\nSo at some point Dr Ford is going to be interviewed and our first story changes after sworn testimony\nThen that opens the door to perjury\nAnd the report will go to the White House and then on to the Senate committee wants to White House reviews or that report which will come later this week and mark judge that he would fully cooperate right\nAh in in this investigation even though he did write another letter over the weekend ... uh to the Senate Judiciary committee the FBI will for a second time along with Maryland authorities as well as every prosecutors looked at this evidence admit that there is no felony federal jurisdiction here mhm\nOr after the Democratic party attempted to have Kavanaugh rested on Saturday [laughter] merrily officials reiterated their findings that by their standards are worst charges possible would carry a with them a one year statute of limitations ... additional prosecutors Ron record setting the evidence is instead\nYou couldn't even get a grand a grand jury would even indict\nWith all the law enforcement bodies are well what all of the law enforcement bodies continue to point out that there's a lack of time and place and while the accuser was a hundred percent sure that something happened the accused and three witnesses or a hundred percent sure they were not witnesses to any event resembling the description right\nThe FBI or will also have like greater amounts of evidence against Dr Ford or if you're applying\nFor miss remembering her one hundred percent clear account of the mysterious Safeway stuck in door if it only had one her complete inability to figure out how she got to work from the incident and the continued refuted ... by her best friend that such a gathering occurred with her president is likely to tip the iceberg\nA therapy notes will likely be required to be turned over ... why they were not turned over to the Senate Judiciary committee is inexplicable especially since she used that as cooperation upper first telling other missed a mysterious incident but that's really interesting ...\nDoctor for its own family not one was capable of coming to work support [noise] uh why weren't they\nThe FBI may need to ask given that she was living with her parents at the time right there you go [noise]\n\n\nThat likely is more involved because of the fact that it was not a part of public record Dr Ford testimony is a matter of record and there's only so far I think with Dr forged case\nThere's only so far you can go and it would basically be the parameters would be everything that was outlined in the ...\n... but I mean politically if they get ... and you know and they get hurt\nThat point no they'll try to but no there's not going to be they didn't have a point to begin with but what can they build what's allowed when someone like like did what he did\nWell will the Republicans at that point move on and by the way to just see the story too and got a little bit of publicity that uh the uh the weekend poll that came out or the poll that friday or Saturday and showed Holly up two points\nOn I'm I'm On tester no no no I'm In I'm In\nOh yeah well it and and we wondered about a Claire McCaskill McCain if that's if that was that there was going to be a last minute yes vote although politically I think it would be too little too late\nOr it could be potentially we'll see I think what happens\nUm you know later this week\nBut I think the hesitation by those senators who backed this ... you know the further investigation the\nFBI background check then I I think politically they can be damaged even if he's confirmed you did the damage anyway you allow this circus to go on created more of a circus as a result of it\nAnd we know flake is not up for reelection which is why I think it it became more convenient\nThe the other the other senators likely jumped on board a you know and and by the way they are they did so potentially at their own peril politically but flake had to be the guy because he's not up for reelection\nHe had to be the one that went forward and requested this and the president you know comes in and says okay fine by the way for what a two week better part of two weeks Democrats have been screaming\nBut now they're screaming about it [laughter]\nLet's go to Robert in Johnstown New York Robert welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show Hi Robert\nHi how are you guys doing real good thanks for calling\nI got a point but uh you asked how far can go after the interview everybody I think they should end up doing is kinda got if there was any inappropriate behavior in the garden was a ... anyway it's completely\nUnder as we understand your we understand your point [laughter]\nI mean really how those two women a cameraman get in an elevator with the U.S Canada in that building that's what I Want to know\nWell I it's again it was it was pretty crazy with if you if you uh were following the procedures on friday morning with the committee and then you have the Democrats walking out and then they were of course outside doing their own press conference and everything else so\nYou had a ton of chaos I I'm with you but that it's not I guess as secure as you would think even for senators it's not as to cure or as most people would think it is in that sense when\nAll this all decided as it was that particular Saturday\n[laughter] I Know that was the target yeah right right yeah that would be that right but that would be the target yeah I mean that would be the target that they would be looking sure I understand it does seem like you're you're\nThe question in your mind is seems set up huh [laughter]\nI Would have to say yes that that that that's what that's like set it up right [laughter]\nRight oh I just moved in and they they can front of me and they made a good point and so I Do agree with them yeah and and and that's where\nI was a cameraman oh right yeah\nWell it it's likely was getting to it's inevitable point and and also Lindsey Graham is probably the perfect person in that case because he has crossed the aisle so many times\nI think a lot of people in that regard likely didn't see it coming\nAnd also didn't see it working the way it did and building momentum\nAnd while ultimately it didn't work or in in in moving the process forward thanks to Jeff Flake it did it did I think build even more momentum for Republicans in general\nWill see that translates in November at election time but a five week from tomorrow by the way\nWell so but I but I Do think that Lindsey Graham actually what what do you know the what he said I I think he I this is what he believes that oh no no I I think any so I think it was old school understand what the Senate's Raleigh and you advice and consent\nAnd and as you said that's why he brought up sort of my or ... I'm sure that he had problems with Kagan and sort of my yard and the things that they believed but that isn't the job to job isn't the job isn't to say\nAs a senator it was never supposed to be the job of senators to say do you agree with me at every point\n\nA no All right well then I'm going to defame your character as a justice [noise] right\nRight but that was that was never the role to begin with it's are you confident the president gets to pick who he wants on the Supreme Court yeah no I don't think it was pre determined I didn't mean to imply that it was pre determined that that Lindsey Graham\nIt just happens that he was yeah a pick to do that uh it just so happens that he did do it and he really was the perfect person to do that in that setting eight six six Ninety ...\nThe conversation using the shell row tell a hotline eight six six nine zero seven\nHundreds of flat bed and specialized million mile drivers blight because if you like driving for a local trucking company with national power than we have a long term home for you dance ski as a family of sixty locally run flatbed and specialized companies in communities all across the usa and Canada\nWhere you can put down your roots you on short haul or long haul want to drive our late model truck or your own truck you like to drive zone over as a team of\nAbout the challenge of specialized loads than the desk ... family of companies is your million mile\nHole if this along with consistent miles great pay and top tier benefits sounds like what you're looking for go to drive down the dot com and learn more about our family of trucking companies find out flat in specialized opportunity they fit your needs at Dr ... dot com\nThat's driving the a and E.

the day there were pulling out of the agreement and he was willing to fight it\nUh there's all stems from him saying basically that he was going to take\nSome time ago and as a publicly traded company the chairman of the board and CEO\nYou can't say that because you're a centrally by that statement especially if it's on true and that was the whole point is is that did he actually have the funding was it or was it secured hadn't been promised to him\nOr any evidence that that he had access to funding to take a private\nThat started this whole thing into okay and then of course the or some other things that he has done on social media that question his ability to run the company but this especially because you're manipulating the stock price or the company\nUh it had a jump when he announced that the stock price at a jump because it was you know people investors if it were true might have been able to make good on something like that uh and do well if they drove the stock up\nBecause he would have to buy out all of that existing stock\nThen it came out on friday which was interesting actually late or Thursday and friday morning the investigation\nShowed that because he came up with

lettuce had to you we go to Terry in Georgia Terry you're on Radio Welcome to the show high\nThe ex gentlemen great show great show first time caller here I'll be brief but I have a real problem with uh [noise] it seemed like the Democrats as as well as the Republicans was giving the doctor so much praise\nAnd to me it was it was there was no competition to me she seemed like she was just totally full orbit or working on education [noise]\nUm she didn't come off as being too bright um for one thing [noise]\nI think myself and this was a theory that I'll be briefing you and you guys talk you talk about it but I'm taking she was a set off from the get go I mean even I think cabinet all was just happened to be the one\nI think she was on the on the road getting ready to run with federal with with admiral which whichever a nominee\nA guy that um it's just that she was too much lacking when she when she said she believed a hunger for say that it was cabin All right then and there I mean\nI well I I I Will tell you that and to me when when they say that she's credible as I said the reason she is incredible because she only remembers one thing\nAnd I would uh ... never happened but I Would love to interview one of these Democrats who say she was credible how\nForget about the fact that her own witnesses she is not there is no forensic evidence and witness even the ones that she names that ... story but the fact is what she says her cells\nIf you just came in you say well look how couldn't remember this so clearly but you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this her testimony alone irrespective of the other ... evidence or lack of evidence her testimony itself\nWas not credible mhm yeah I mean that's that's what a centrally was at play here whether or not she was to be bullied because remember what they were calling for first she needs to be heard she needs to be heard she needs to be hurt well then she was heard well that's not enough\nWeight about well if you believe her testimony to be credible then that is enough hertz speaking in front of the American people we don't get to see the FBI questioning her on television\nThat's not going to be before the problem\nSo tell me wasn't why wasn't there about this process [noise]\nAnd that's what the left wants you to believe it's not a fair process [noise] actually it's very fair [noise]\n\n\n\nCode or ... or ... or ... she had one last away\nWho cannot afford the yeah you're you're ... you have that you and we'll have to wait ... you would act like you would have\nTo ask the Democrats that question I Can't answer for the Democrats as ... as I said very easily that's why she's not ... that that's why that alone she's not a credible witness unless there were people to bakar up when they say she was crying\nBut when you say I'm a hundred percent somebody did it\nWhere I don't know when I don't know how did you get there I don't know how did you get home I don't know\nAll you know what she did it but any information surrounding it and then the witnesses that you give\nGive contradicting testimony that you gave its not credible right the ... and that's why I said I don't know how many tests the Democrats that specific question but again as you see for example George Stephanopoulos last question when they don't answer it just moves on\nIt's like okay give me an answer\nYou want to look something that bothers me more than even even the the the ... which we call the fake news is the lack of guts of journalists to say I'm not leaving this question until you answer it right because it's that important that there's an expectation\nYep huh remember\nWho ... who who was it who at the bottom of the follow up question where was that was that ah that was here in ah in there was ... wasn't oh no yeah yeah yeah well ... okay uh one where you had a local reporter here\nAh from WFAN ATV in Dallas but no the one you're referring to was Chris Wallace and then they came back and said well we weren't told there would be ... of ...\nThat that if you asked a question didn't make sense to be a follow up question right that that there was actually an and this is something that has to stop\nThis ... this kind of bugs sorrow world respect\nThat we have for politicians when I'm a journalist and I ask you a question if you don't answer it I'm going to ask the question again and then I'm going to come down right to it and say you're not answering my question well I don't feel it's important oh so you won't answer my question I Want you on record that you don't have the\nReal world where the fact that a journalist is supposed to give\nA politician who won't answer a question on an issue but as the reason that you brought them on the air with you ... don't waste my time if you're going to be come on the show had the guts to answer my question but if you're gonna be got let's go away\nI feel like I'm Talking to somebody right now and yelling at them but it is well you're yelling at all of them and and you know that's but that's that they get away with it drives me up for you know because people like well Stephanopoulos and everybody else allow them to get away with it\n\nThe the person especially a public servant who's being interviewed does not dictate the questions\nNope no I don't know what would they do when they don't answer the question they do when when when they don't answer the question they are dictating the questions ... well and that's just they need to it it's very clear to us but it's just data we're going to help this person build a narrative here so let's talk to them\nLet's help them build their own narrative yeah we'll forget journalism right oh\nI'm Sorry then my question isn't the one I should be asking all my focus should be elsewhere you're saying well okay and and the easy\nThing to do is the challenge her own owes answer as soon as she gave that non answer I Would have said okay so you're saying the Democrats did\nLike\nYour your your\nNon answer their tells me that you're basically admitting the Democrats did\nLeagues is you can [noise]\n[laughter]\nBut this is why people right at ... at least to frustrate the daylight Saddam ... this is why people hate it nobody going on with Tim Russert because they knew it didn't matter which side they were on\nThey knew they were going to face tough questions or remember for two weeks in a row none of the Democrats from the Senate Judiciary committee would come out with Chris Wallace for what they do is is if you do that\nYou become black balled yeah\nThey won't come on your show any more because you demand that they that they answer the question everybody knows what the questions are going to be [noise] yeah\nWhen you come in we look when you're a senator and you come in to talk or you're the president or whatever you're somebody the White House when you go on a show you know while you're going on the show ... they'll tell you we want to talk about this\nAnd so you know what the general questions are going to be and your goal is okay oh look I Need to get my staff around here we need to figure out how to way not to answer any of the questions out of white filibuster\nWe the every journalist knows everybody on ABC CBS NBC and Fox knows that which is CNN they all know what's gonna happen mhm they all know they're going to do that when it's somebody gonna finally say a you're not answering my question would you answer the question\nAnd at that point what happens is you're not going to get the major you're not going to get the major personalities anymore I think about this we live in a society\nWhere the media believes we need to get the major personalities on the major political personalities who run and drive this country it's important that we get them on the air so they won't answer the questions that we asked them\nYeah that's it face the nation no let's face it the other way\nJust going to go out there and pat each other on the back unless you're a Republican and this week is weak this mhm we there [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter]\n[laughter] your mom [laughter]\n\nI might as well be giving that answer to every question here mom [laughter] what do you think late that you're a mom\n[laughter] [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] ... because that's the ridiculous nature of this why not just make it why not just make it I Would have a group of buddies I went to grade school with and we play this game of grade school Scrabble ridiculous Scrabble\nThe words actually you got to make up a word nothing can be a real war word and you've got to use it in a sentence when you put it on the board\nAnd as long as you just use it [laughter] okay [laughter] so that's why I Would just make it again [laughter] because that's all it is exactly nobody's taking a the their constituents\nAre seriously in the case of a Jeff Flake he didn't care well ... ... you know how she could answer it I don't know I don't know who would yeah I don't know like you're asking me a question I Can't answer right why didn't we but why didn't we get the I don't know that's a

and they're not going to get a chance to talk about\nYeah so there you go ...\nI Want to move away from ... that doesn't look good for the narrative are yeah well no because those those are huge points that he may yeah I mean those are those are huge points first about the lawyers we'd ask that question without that we'd ask that question early on was she made it seem like\nFord made it seem like I never knew that the committee wish to talk to me what the committee talk to the lawyers and that's what we had asked that question we said that hasn't been that hasn't been resolved and Tom Cotton coming out over the weekend insane her lawyers didn't tell her\n\nAnd they need to that and and as you said for lawyers will face a Washington DC bar investigation for allegedly not informing heard that the Senate Judiciary committee staffers were willing to travel to California to interview or well why wouldn't say\nRight\nI mean who's working for your pro bono are you\nYou're not working in the best interest of your client if you're not giving them the option that is the charge of cotton is making there which is huge because that shows why that's why wouldn't your lawyers be working for the best interest of you\nBecause they're working for the best interest of someone else yeah well how much you're paying them as a client I'm not paying them\nOh\nSo are they actually working for you and that's where you and I talked about this Friday and Cotton's making the allegation\nThat you know they'll be facing the Washington DC bar investigation for not informing her when you asked a question why didn't they inform her if she didn't know why did and will those questions be asked by the F ... uh well I mean you would you you're looking to\nThere's a serious allegation is just\nAs much to prove her wrong as it is to prove him wrong or liar\nIt is just as much about finding out well in fact the entire purpose is finding out the true it is not necessarily to find out which one is lying because one of them is lying\nIt's about finding out the truth which means it's equally as much about the person making the allegation as it is the accused\nThe other point is we're Feinstein and the Democrats in the media we're always trying to make the point will Feinstein did or best one wouldn't know she didn't\nAnd as we subtle long if you listen to the show we still look there is a process\nAnd I'm Glad the Tom Cotton pointed out the process and and ... and they said they do this hundreds of times you and and Dickerson he doesn't know who will not sensitive because no justice sensitive on other issues but things that are highly\nSecretive that we don't want people to know about\nBecause we are doing you know in in different investigations and so this is actually done where she should have when she got the letter she ... the protocol is you go to Grassley\nYou're the ranking minority member you go to ... you talked about it and you say okay what group well probably what we used a ... you would have said was look we can lead to contact her back\nAnd tell her we can do an FBI investigation if he wishes to this to go forward we can do an FBI investigation and we can keep her name out of it for a certain period of time but we can definitely do the FBI investigation we can actually interview\nWe might not be able to but as to the point of the investigation absolutely we can did Feinstein tell her that\n\nAre Feinstein's goal was to hold this as long as possible to bring it at the last possible second yep\nKnowing that they're only play here was political in nature\nNot actual procedural other than delaying the process itself they were calling for the FBI investigation but the Democrats didn't really want an FBI investigation had they wanted the investigation Feinstein would have made that happen right away\nWhich tells me one thing a couple of things they didn't buy into her story number one because if they if they felt it was fully credible and could be proven and backed up by an FBI investigation than Feinstein would've acted July thirtieth\nAnd you know something I I I agree with the Democrats they they did you shouldn't do an expanded they should do and expanded uh uh you know a background check and they should uh talked to forward and say ... or ... your lawyers with you by the way why didn't you tell her that they were willing to come and see her yeah\nSo is anybody paying you besides her let's let's let's expand that [noise]\nI Wonder if the Democrats really wish to be expanded huh\nI'm doubting\nOkay we're done it's a week okay we're going to vote no anyway so it was [laughter]\nWell because what they need is a new unobtainable\nCoal\nSo in this case uh like you said Ramirez she needs to be hurt she needs to test I I Believe that will be the next thing she needs to tell her\nFrom her and you just go down the line and you see how far you can extend that now the ball is in procedurally the balls and McConnell's court yes\nBut the vote is not know where the votes fall is not\nCan you stand to lose a Jeff Flake yes if you have man my camp who still on the fence Donnelly gives a known now if you had mentioned you can lose if you've got mansion you can lose you've got high camp and if you've got to call in and if you've\nGot a tester do you do you want to fester he said no so if if\nThat goes forward how many I guess the question is how many can you afford so you can you can lose if you've got if mansions on you can lose like in one more\nBecause you've got fifty one mhm and so imagine would make fifty two you could lose than to still have fifty and have the vice president break develop right\nAnd if they think they've got that then McConnell's not going to hold it up at all if they've got a lot they had the hope they would have done this over the weekend I I I have the feeling that they will I have a feeling\nThat if the FBI investigation comes in and you know even if it\nTalks to re mirrors and said look nobody can cooperate her story either a ... on this in fact we used to get the same thing with the the witness is there a I think at that point they will have the vote and then what do you ever hear about this together doesn't die forever it probably dies forever\nSomebody said they'll keep bringing it up now they won't they\n[noise] well not at your end up getting nowhere rent produce anything for him yet it it has it won't affect his decisions they can't write so they you know if it once you see it on the Supreme Court well though impeach well they could impeach but\nJudge on that all you would need you know and and so you could impeach not removed from the Supreme Court but that's wasting time and energy for the Democrats no they're never going to get\nA you know to the the the sixty two on the on the lack of evidence that you have an any of these cases right now right because you're not going to learn anything new about this about the alleged events and we're likely to learn nothing new about the alleged events from the FBI background check eight six six Ninety ...\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have

Trump for benefiting from doing business was foreign governments it's a violation of the emoluments clause of the constitution um\nThe plaintiffs led by Senator Richard Blumenthal argue that Trump is

you\nWell there is a the monuments clause in the constitution states no person holding office may without consent of Congress except the president of any kind from a foreign state watchdogs insist\nThat Trump is violating that clause whenever his hotels or golf courses to receive a payment from a foreign\nGovernment okay but once again I Know it's you know no no it's not only that it's impossible to go to court on because if you take him to court remember president William Jefferson ... ... ... who said what is it\nDefined ... yeah yeah well do you read that wants to decide to if in fact the monument cause was invoked here and that's what the case was about then\nHe would ask for a legal definition of what is the gift\nIs a gift big gift if services or return for it and my and yeah that would be no\nI like that okay so now you got to go to court and get a judge to to do what you just said you made the decision you're a lay person I'm a lay person\nVery simply no it's not a

... that's President Trump just a few moments ago are taking some questions about judge cabin on\nI Want to I just want to ask this question here maybe maybe one of our great blisters maybe you guys can help me figure this out so the law enforcement and Montgomery County Maryland there on the record they said they'd be more than happy to to investigate Dr Ford's allegations\nBut there's just one problem Dr Ford has not filed a police report nor has she asked for an investigation to be conducted\nNow why do you suppose that is why do you suppose that Dr Ford has not filed a police report and I understand that the statute of limitations and all of that and I understand that the the law that is in place now was not on on the boats and in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut I'm just curious why habit I mean she's gone to everyone else but she hasn't gone to law enforcement I just find that to be very curious All right let's go to the phone lines uh guys I Want to go to Jerry Jerry in Milwaukee Jerry welcome to the program I haven't heard from you in a while\nThey Todd I'm\nListening Donald Trump I mean I I got two big allies out of that by Donald Trump or he said he wanted a sketch and you really want to investigate or you could have done this investigation two weeks ago the only reason we doing it because\nRepublican senators like um like snowing Murkowski excuse me Collins Murkowski and it's like\nWhy the investigation he wants to votes so that's the only reason he never wanted investigation into these claims until there are limits to these types who investigation the White House counsel has put limits on this investigation so Trump would like to sew twice he was lying but I I Wonder also wind when you said that\nSaid she was credible because he knows he wants he has to appeal to the middle class I mean to middle swing voters that he doesn't want to alienate them so he's saying things that he wants to they want to hear it but he still recording capital so at the end of the day why can't keep supporting your wire hot\n... what what is the president lying about the the the Democrats demanded a seventh FBI investigation into this guy and the Republicans said fine okay we're going to give you another FBI investigation\nMy question is when you look at the ... the behavior of the Democrats Jerry help me figure this one out maybe maybe you know the answer to this so the Republicans offered to go to California and sit down and interview Dr forward so she would not have to go and go through that spectacle last week\nBut her attorneys never told her about that they never told her about the offer why do you think that was Jerry\n... on him and my own a reason to it but they weren't the\nInterest and crushing but that doesn't mean that credibility I mean she's cradling ... who knows\nWhere you are but others what Jerry why was it was one that she was yeah that I you know what I'm not Donald Trump Jerry I'm Todd Stearns radio host I was able to watch your testimony I'm going to get I can let you speak or at a secondary but I was able to watch her testimony\nAnd I was just not convinced that's just me the ... the president may feel otherwise\nWhile I'm not convinced beyond yes I've had to say life in a court of law beyond a reasonable doubt but she's not the only person there's three women have come forward to the allegations that's building\nAnd not once read of evidence ... look you can have thirty women come forward Jerry but they don't offer any evidence there's ... there's no one to corroborate their stories that's the problem for me give me the person with evidence\nLet's not have any limits on the investigation\nA year two years three years four\nOh you you mean you you don't want to Supreme Court nominee being held up and not getting the votes is that what you're saying\nJerry why is it why is it that came forward why is it will Merrick Garland what would they were following the Joe Biden ruled Jerry if you've got a problem with that go talk to Joe Biden\nThat you know that's the U.S you know nobody\nCared about me ask you that's the truth and I can corroborate that Jerry outlier unlike doctor board and the other women\nLooks aren't bite in rural or just something they said this is Joe Biden made a statement and they took it and ran with it they just didn't want Obama making a Supreme Court\nBut I mean I mean to believe that some great principals that search but you know\nHe got to pick the Jerry so that your argument holds no water no wait\nNone whatsoever Jerry appreciate the call [noise]\nAgain ladies and gentlemen\nWhere's the evidence that's all I Want is where is the evidence AAA seven eight nine nine one zero your calls coming up that

O. J. Georgia Welcome back to the program Joe\nSaw a great great a great show as always uh uh this is ridiculous the the media is against Trump or the Republicans need to take a stand and he needs to be

backtrack to your question I Want to answer about why she didn't go forward\nTo the police I worked in the legal field for forty years she worked in a prosecutor I Know on the planet would have taken place because they have nothing to go on to something called\nReasonable doubt and\nShe had nothing to do on that would give them a grand jury a reason to move forward on even on that there has to be something called the preponderance of the evidence that means there has to be a vote\nIf you will of let's say fifty one can forty nine saying if enough evidence to move forward let's move to the court for\nFor a regular pet a jury she has nothing I'm not saying nothing happened I Am saying that\nShe she she came forward to to do this testimony because she knew the police wouldn't be able to move forward with this that's the reason why she could say that she was afraid she would say that she wanted her privacy I say if somebody\nPut me on a bed and started grinding my body and somebody stood there and watched and had a good laugh at me like she said you would bet I would go to my parents and say I want something done\nNow in terms of Kavanaugh the thing that scares me about him is

the White House I Want to [noise]\nAll right a little bit of breaking news uh and and folks and this was really no surprise\nThe now the United States Senate the Democrats are saying the FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against\nJudge capital and they also um included a a long list of of people that should be interviewed witnesses in Studio with us is Jonathan Gilliam John did not know surprise here we knew this was going to happen [noise]\nRight and I think that that they take away from the headline is credible witness is they're so they're telling us that Michael ... and the woman that he brought up that said she was at ten rape parties and was herself raped one of these parties who never went to the police and none of that information ever go to law enforcement\nThat that's credible in any way nobody's verify that validated\nSo I listen I think the president was right in making the scope of this just forward um because the other uh the second person that came out there was no crime committed the third person or that came out with ... um is not credible\nHe did but the president's got a great got on these things or will it come back to haunt him I doubt it but the fact is what I don't think he realizes is that he is allowing he's the he's the CEO of this country and he's in charge of these different agencies ultimately\nAnd he should not allow politicians to utilize our federal agencies for their their own um\nCriminal or miss TV is doing which is what's happening here 'cause remember as we've discussed this is not to determine guilt or innocence it's only solely to put weight on a congressmen and senators to say no\nSo if that's the case\nOr the FBI has no jurisdiction is that it's not in the scope of what their uh their um their jobs are or their authority and so I don't I Would love it if Christopher Wray had come out and said no with the bureau is not going to do this and it's not in the scope of what we can even legally do\nSomebody's lying somebody is lying and we know that the uh the case or out of the allegations out of Rhode Island are that are that Senator Whitehouse um ... you know put out there we know that that guy we're attracted what he said but now Senate Judiciary going after him they won criminal prosecution\nWhat about the others I I Do a job that I think whoever allied needs to be punished [noise]\nAnd I think we should throw Feinstein whoever leaked information in there with that so yeah I'm\n... uh but yeah anybody who lives should be held accountable in this case but see again Todd here's here's the issue with is\nThe FBI is investigating something that's outside of its jurisdiction so let's say they a lot to the FBI if that goes in front of a judge is the judge is the defense attorney gonna say listen to the FBI was not credible you see what they did with the president before they created a false date the dossier that got false uh they got\nHow can you uh prosecute this person for uh Eighteen or one one thousand see I think is what it is a ... ... ... that's the problem that we have with this is no different than when\nA judge comes out from the Ninth Circuit court and make some ludicrous decision that that could potentially put a lot of guilty people out of prison this is the same problem that we have here what you're predicting what do you think's gonna happen between now on friday [noise]\nWell so we were talking off air about this and nobody's really talking about this um it could go either way and one of the reasons why it could go against Kavanaugh is the fact that people in the FBI and into the OJ that we have seen in the past two years\nAre willing to create false evidence to a convict somebody in the court of public opinion you're talking about the deep state the deep state and the CIA [noise] uh that really happened\nAnd if that's the case it's it's easy to make an assumption that they didn't get all of them it wasn't just McCabe and Peter Struck in in a page or these people exist in the deal Jay and in the FBI and if that's the case who's to say they can't come up with other evidence\nOr other you know a create stuff we just say they can't come up with a diary that was supposedly from you know thirty six years ago\n... that's what bothers me about this is that when you start going down this road of we are actively going to start pursuing a people to find evidence where there's a crime that has not even been proven [noise]\nHow do you know what they can create well ordered to to uh\nGive credence to the end you see that was that's been my concern along Jonathon ... at our our time is up here but um [noise] what's going to happen at the deep state gets involved that's the scary thing and that had a great unknown right now American people need to be\nReally really cautious and what they believe are Jonathan always appreciate your dropping out reshape the MPAA boats were getting to your calls

Terry on the phone hello Terry walking to the program\n[noise] hey uh\nMy I I Am curious about all these all these Washington insiders politicians their kids all go to the same high schools the same college is [noise] uh\nWhen they go home at night and the Democrats do they look at their kids and say now you're not going to be a ... be able to be in public life now because [noise] because of your grades because of this or that because we've already we destroyed it for you [noise]\n[noise] well now ... now ... let me see if I if I understand where you're coming from on this because the the accusations that were made is that this guy Brett Kavanaugh he's no good\nOr because he's a white guy and we know all white people are horrible uh we also know that he came from a privileged background so we had a lot of money maybe didn't have to work so that makes them even heart worse\nBut beyond all of that uh this guy Brett Kavanaugh I went to a private school and the lead just all boys school so that means he is basically a um\nLeft her own children\nYeah yeah that's true it look it's a great ... that's a great point\nAnd and I think moms and dads and need to have that conversation with their children you know how some we we've heard that in the news in recent days haven't we cherry where moms and dads have to sit down with their children and explain certain things to them about society about life\nWell maybe it's time for\nWhite moms and dads just sit down with their children if they go to a a private school and have that conversation with them that if you go to a private school if you are a prep school granted that maybe people are going to look at you differently maybe you're going to get stopped\nAnd you're going to get asked questions maybe you're going to be subjected to things that may be a public school child would not be exposed to go ahead I'm curious\nWhat what I mean just everything is now on the record or I mean all from social media from a a even their yearbooks everything and and the Democrats own children now are they going to be able to achieve anything in life\nAre because they're going to say no no you did this in high school you did this in college I'm I'll be ashamed to go home\nAnd I can look at my kids and so now I ruined it for you\n[noise] well then then Terry you have a responsibility as a parent to stand up and do something about that and everyone listening to this radio program has that same responsibility we've got to change we've got to change this and we've got to put a stop to it\nUm I'm not sure

this hour in Chicago Hi Alex how are you [noise]\nTo memorial better than I deserve what's up [noise]\n[noise] well I had of course you're going to be we can help me out with I recently sold my condo and I was able to walk away with twenty seven thousand so I have it in my savings that I have about twenty six thousand in between student loans and car payment\nModel that you are oh sorry how much of that car a Seventy nine of the car okay so most of it's a car okay yeah\nMhm and then a a eighty five hundred is school mhm and I wanted to use that savings that I made to kind of put a down payment on your home but after listening to your show\nFifty to five good for you okay well I\nI Want you to get into another home I don't want you to do that with a debt\nSo we've got two options um one is pay off everything in rent for a little while and save up a down payment and then by or two is sell the car\nGet a babysitter\nAnd use the money that you would have paid on the car is your down payment and pay off the student loan either one's fine with me I'm the cars not that abusive it's just it's just the large lion's share of the problem right so you do you know what kind of car is it\nIt's a twenty six teams shove emailed it he liked it I Love it okay All right well I mean do you want to rent for a year in order to keep it\nAll I'm renting now so I sold my condo and I'm renting now you know I mean well it's funny a home okay so I'm okay with that\nOkay so if you just you know write a check and be dead free today and then ... money really really really aggressively for a year and you've got your down payment right\nYeah and that's you know what that's what we're doing but a debt while you're moving into the home with your emergency fund in place um and your debt free which is how we always tell you to buy a house I'm open you know sometimes we where you're selling and buying you have to do it a little differently but in your case it's kind of cut and dried isn't it\nYeah it's a pretty simple pretty simple analysis you're either going to\nSell the car and buy a house now or you're going to keep the car and buy a house next year so many in a year or Eighteen months or something like that how long you want to save up to do that and I I think that's what I Would do probably in your situation\nUm yeah I think it is Karen is with us in Miami I Karen how are you\nI'm fine how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm low or you know my mom lost her job in my ... and um\nMoney one she actually gets cut it and I'm really worried for her and I keep telling her to get a job you know then she says she's trying but I feel like a she's kind of an motivated to try and look at the moment like I've even given her business ideas and everything on things you can do at home maybe but she really hasn't done anything and I'm not sure what to do\nHow much is that the ten percent and ... about thirty five and so I Would use it all up wake up at all okay and what's your interest rate on your home for ... who can shoot about market there and you are a hundred percent sure that thirty thousand dollars will cause the amount of be dropped\n... we populated that it'll be like thirty one involving them or we have we have the money to put a ...\nYeah and you can argue confirming that with the mortgage company prior to doing it obviously you're not going to just send them the money\nYeah we want to make sure that the ... going away okay and PMS costing you what\nI think the caller i._d. quite high amount on higher than Ninety million dollar income\nHousehold income or around my plate with a hundred thousand\nOkay here here's what here's where you are in our baby steps and you probably already know this but let's review show our other listeners are caught up you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement orange you\nCorrect that's baby steps for five is kids college the Sixers payoff files fairly so really the question is where we can put this on five are we going to put this on six there's\nNot a ... there's not a dumb or wrong answer here either one is fine whatever makes you feel good whatever's good idea I'm I'm probably going to take twenty thousand of this and put ten each in five twenty nine pounds for these girls\nOkay you're getting hit your college sneaking up on you fast and I'm all for all the other ten at the house um and then I'm gonna system and then I'm going to set up a monthly amount to add to the ten beginning it\nHundred bucks a month each or something like that not and I'm like\nWhat we do have a four year old\nChild and then you know then we can just spreading around but however you want to do it but ... I Want to put a substantial amount towards college and then you make enough to be able to just beat on this mortgage pretty rapidly but six hundred dollar a year or return on the thirty one thousand dollar\nInvestment is not that great\nBut how can we you know so I'm going to start the kids' college and then I'm going to just start paying off the house\nThe natural result of working your baby steps six is you're going to get down below the ... get that dropped but then you're just gonna keep beating on the house to after that and it's going to go away completely so good question it's an

things thank you for your response out there\nWe really really appreciate it [noise] friend of mine sent me this article earlier it's very interesting lawsuits filed against insurers in recent years for their practices around universal life insurance highlight the risks that these products can pose to on wary\nFinancial advisors and their clients\nTrans America a X. or Lincoln national are examples of firms and the cross fire of litigation raising the cost of insurance and certain universal for raising the cost of insurance and starting universal policies nationwide life insurance company also privately settled the lawsuit with two individuals in may\nRelative to variable universal life insurance cost John Hancock subtle lawsuit related to\nUniversal life insurance costs for Ninety One million unlike other products like term and whole life universal life which is permanent cash value life insurance allows buyers to make flexible premium payments\nThat flexibility allows buyers to fund policies with a relatively low amount of premiums to keep the insurance going however\nUm I don't know why is considering the amount of money that I make 'em do it if you um how much we can get that I said unlike or pick up her pay check 'em can was about in a realistic cat that I Want to say to that I Am\nUm monthly about eleven hundred\nAnd is that and that's after graduating say okay what is your degree\nIs actually called like ... but um I actually got a chat with the tea just to help me find my career\nSo when we're your career kick in\n[noise] um I'm I'm actually ... while I'm On the side of my education will take the class I say about the flight crew by year\nOkay well at eleven hundred a month we're talking about a little over Thirteen thousand dollars a year that's you're not going to you're going to make it on that in Raleigh\nOut on your own okay you're not making enough to do that so we've got to get your income up that's why I was asking and so um yeah we need a double your income\nOn pretty quick here as fast as you can and when you can double your income and then I Would go get a you know an inexpensive apartment maybe a roommate or whatever and just get started on your own and the main thing there is make sure you have no dad do you have any debt at all\nI'm going to have about a hundred thousand twelve thousand dollars in debt I'm ... I'm I kind of that too um that they're taking care of that I just thought that I can stop leash and more credit\nWhere do you mean they're taking care of that\nSo they ... they are fake who I pay a whole not long after\nThat you know we don't need you to establish any more credit you don't need any that you you don't make enough money to breathe hardly okay so when you are one hundred percent debt free and then you build an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses are like five thousand dollars is set aside for\nYou just start saving as fast as you can and you won't put down as much as you can possibly put down how old are you what you said you're twenty four\nOkay go ahead well you got a good plan so hopefully in the next twelve to Eighteen months you can see that income spike up as you start using your cosmetology degree\nAnd um because you know when you were Thirteen thousand and when you get your twenty six thousand quick as we can this doubling that's still not a lot of money but that'll at least get you out there and get you moving in and get your career to start to build so hey\nThanks for the call we appreciate you listening Ian is with us from prince Edward Hi Ian how are you\n[laughter] Hi Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up\n[noise] well my wife and I we've got five boys five kids and we just moved into our dream on all three years ago or ten twelve acres to walk through with the kids turn around but the last few mind for just started your plan and we're in baby steps you\nGeorgia thinking um I mean we've got thirty five thousand I'm dead besides the house and we're just not sure if we want and we need to sell the house just to be free or which is ... through the next ten Fifteen Years and just make it happen\nTen to Fifteen Years you mean payroll house and everything\nYeah like ... where you know we have twenty eight years left my mortgage\nMhm so what's your house you hand them\nIt's about Seventy K take home pay\nTake 'em but All right yeah and um then what is your house payment\n[noise] it is around twelve hundred a month\nAnd a house payments not on the line here that's fun you know but you gotta lotta carrying you've got a lot of kids and you're not used to\nLiving on a limited budget and you're going to start that were egg yeah because you got thirty thirty five an hour to clean up I mean you really need to clean that up it's probably\nWhat is the thirty five thousand in debt what kind of debt\nA part of the law and my parents and part of it is lamb credits twenty five line of credit and ten grand and alone from our parents\nOkay Mm So just a line of credit what'd you bond with the line of credit\nOh it's just been life has just been there about a piano a few years ago [noise] I'll just miscellaneous things\nOkay and that's over right yeah not doing that anymore right\nNo no no we were like we are just sick and tired we just want to be free yeah we love the place\nWould not I don't think they need I don't think you need to sell the house houses now killing your twelve hundred bucks out of a fifty eight hundred dollar take home by not out of line\nYou're oh you're okay on her house but you do have to get your written budget get on every dollar you're written budget and get that going as quick as you can every dollar dot com and I'm starting to you know using the app on your phone\nAnd you guys need to squeeze every dollar so that you clear there's thirty five because if you can clear the thirty five you're going to have pretty good room in this budget even with five kids and you can clear I did just going to take a year and a half two years just a year and a half two years of Seventeen five a year out of Seventy thousand take home that's doable\nYou couldn't do that as a lay down and you can do that a thirty five thousand out of Seventy thousand with five kids that means one year I don't think you're going to do that so somewhere between the one in the two and the challenge landing on Eighteen months Richard is with us Richards in Salt Lake City Hi Richard how are you\nHi Dave I'm great got how can I help [noise]\nSo I was wondering about emerging\nUntil we have a fully funded an emergency I knew that I have three to six months [noise] good to have about Fifteen thousand in there [laughter] I'm at my job for a trip they account and they match up to Fifteen hundred dollars a year great um should should\n[noise] holy funded to get that match that's wonderful in the ... of course you can only be used for one kind of an emergency and that's medical bills will lots of other kinds of emergencies pop up and so um do you do you do both of you work in this house was a single income\nNo single income okay and what's your household income around sixty and what do you do er nurse\nYou're a nurse okay very very stable career\nMeaning that if you were to lose a job you can get another one in twenty minutes\nNursing is just a fabulous career field so in terms of ah accessibility even add hours anytime you want to add hours you can back it off you can change direction all kinds of stuff you just really and landed in a sweet spot there so very very good on that given that you've got that type of a career that's not\nSo specialized that it might take you six months to find a job if you lost it or something like your six minutes um then given that that's the situation I Would back and do you fully fund you're at it you find that I just say between the three to six months of expenses range I Would back down to the three months\nOkay and so that's kind a like partially leaning on the H essay as part of your emergency fund but it's certainly not we're not really counting it because I mean you can have lots of emergencies that have nothing to do with medical on your life\nWhen you can get you again you could lose your job you could um have the death of a relative and you had to pay for the funeral or wanted to pay for the funeral you can have all kinds of different things happen transmission blow out of the car\nAnd all kinds of things that can happen that aren't medical and you can't use the ... medical\nSo I don't generally counted in the emergency fund but I'm looking at your career stability and the fact he got a big fat I just say with a big fat match on it which is just wonderful both of them then that makes me very comfortable with being almost three months\nOne question I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance is to replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse or you have kids yes unique term life insurance it's the only way to protect them until you're out of debt and the build up your wealth\nYou're only digging a deeper hole if you waste money on cash value plans since it robs you of the ability to make real progress and that's why I send you to the sand or insurance and I have for Twenty years that's where I get all my insurance and they only offer the plans I recommend it is not expensive it's not complicated\nAnd Zander will be there as your guide every step of the way\nVisit ... dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two you need to get this taken care of I can give you the advice and I can tell you where to go but it's really up to you to take an important step to get your family protected\nThat's Zander dot com or eight hundred three five six\nYou know we talked about this and if you make thirty thousand dollars in this country are more bless than probably Ninety nine percent of people in the world and I think you just kind of have to square your shoulders and say hey this is what I Want and\nIt wasn't fun you know she was she was working three literally three jobs she had three different jobs really I got credential that another university and I would go in because I have a lot of time off with my job and I I didn't want to I didn't want to drive three hours and stay the night on my days off and and at the university and and work extra but\nYou know seeing them in the rearview mirror made me want to do with that much more than just get it done and it's you know I I mean what did you might get that gift for my average income was probably you know without working extra is probably one Seventy five up how much on that extra\nProbably another ten or Fifteen just in a short period of time and then and then I started getting more opportunities at my at my institution um and\nListen I was gonna buy a beat her for a thousand bucks and my dad's got more cars and he knows what to do with and I said hey I'll give you a thousand dollars if you let me drive the Pontiac for the next year and it's an old beat up

just going to investigate it investigates they they can be there forever today and what they could eventually catch him on or whatever they're trying to do\nIt could have nothing to do with anything

I'm going to teach me the ... [laughter]\nMy love David Garcia who supports in ... they just never met Ninety nine percent of these people but if you can get out there and like the big race with Martha Mick Sally 'cause Trump\nIs kind of come out\nTo Arizona next couple of weeks you've got cinematic style you know they're going to try to do everything because this is one of those seats\nThat they believe they can flip this is one of those seats they have a shot at flipping can we flip this seat and it's really interesting when you see because the look the midterms for a lot of people I saw a ban and over the weekend he was on the bill Maher which was a very interesting thing because bill are said hey look let's treat this guy\nKind of cool can we just be nice and he comes out and he says you know what I I like the fact that you come on and you're just this is why the Democrats\nI don't do interviews with the Breitbart than the Fox is really that stuff I Want to go into the you know into the teeth in line that's going to lie and said let's talk about stuff and I like that but he also said that this\nThis right here will be a referendum on Trump and this is the first chance where you can look and see what may or may not happen and you've also got to deal with the president\nA president's party almost always loses seats in the mid term elections there have been like two exceptions in the last Thirty years second apart his prospects are generally linked to the president's approval ratings currently Trump's average approval rating this past month\nOr two points lower than Obama in two thousand ten when Democrats suffered a disastrous midterm\nInteresting very interesting and with this comes a potential here\nYou know with you know the whole thought process of hey could we started an impeachment and that is something that I think smarter Democrats who are more politically astute who aren't just riding on emotion want no part of I mean you're not you're not hearing that from\nThe ... and the Schumer's and stuff because they understand what that does to a country they realize that but there are some serious issues here that the Republicans are going to have to deal with\nBut there are specific problems the strong for Republicans first\nSome forty Republican incumbents are leaving while only Eighteen Democrats have announced their retirement and it's just easier to flip an open seat second twenty five House Republicans are districts carried by Hillary Clinton two years ago mainly in suburban districts literally from coast to coast\nOnly Thirteen democratic seats are in Trump friendly district and it is here in suburban America where the president's approval ratings are particularly low\nYeah that's understandable more rural America\nA and I I look I think I I I'm\nI Believe that\nI Believe I Believe there's going to be an issue that you know I think the Democrats feel like a it's all going this is going to be this is going to be a runaway thing we could feel the momentum building building but they just got so much to defend and that right there is is the issue comparatively to the house\nSenate is completely different the map for two thousand and Eighteen\nIs nothing less than a nightmare for the Democrats only one Republican seat is an estate Clinton Terry that's Nevada\nBut ten democratic incumbents are running in states that Trump carried five of them by landslides and in those states comes approval ratings are better than the national average right now Democratic senators are facing serious challenges in Florida Indiana Missouri North Dakota Montana yeah\nSo I I think the worry that the Senate is going to be lost I wouldn't be surprised when they picked up a theater to that changes a lot of things are a member a lot of ... we're looking at the Senate here and the Senate is\nWell Kavanaugh it's SCOTUS\nI think a lot of people worried that they were going to lose potentially\nThe Senate and the house and the impeachment may start but the reality of the whole thing is is that they're able to hold on to things that will be huge just in case they do end up blowing out cabinet gives them an opportunity to come back with somebody else Amy Coney Barrett or whoever they choose which would you know I give Trump again another opportunity if they're able to pick up some seats\nThen that would give them some breathing room which I think they would love to have like any party would love to have\nYou ever it's in the red states where the Kavanaugh nomination may play out particularly influential ally remember only senators not congressman not house members vote on confirmation the feeling was that these red state Democrats might be pushed to vote for confirming having all the recent allegations\nOf may make that differently also in these states centrist Democrats\nOne of the national Democratic Party yeah and why is that important well because\nOnce this is over\nPeople start throwing their hats in the ring and over the weekend Elizabeth Warren time [noise]\n\nFor women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that and a woman at the top\n[laughter]\nAfter November I Will take a hard look\nAt running for president [noise]\n\nShe's going to wait till after November six because she realizes if\nThey don't get what they think they're going to get this blue sue nominee that maybe just maybe people are ready for the the rubber progressive side of things I still think that she's going to throw around the ring I still think that but I also think she realizes do if if if if they are served\nMeaning you buy that I mean you know like hey you got served the the Republicans and they're able to hold potentially some some more of the house and they thought they were and definitely maybe pick up a seat or two in the Senate than the reality is is\nShe got to think or is this what people want right 'cause it's okay to whomever aggressive in New York and LA and Chicago and San Francisco in Seattle but it doesn't work elsewhere\nRight in Massachusetts it's okay to be super progressive but is middle America ready for that\nAnd this populism an advantage over the weekend said it it looked at the populism of the the socialist movement if you will the let me take care of you movement let me do all of these things movement is growing and I wouldn't be surprised if we had the populist moving to Trump versus the populist movement of somebody like a Bernie\nVery interesting three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and shows your Twitter you can tweet at somebody an friended me 'cause I did a video earlier\nUh doing lots of videos you can chat banter show t._v. and and all over you know the YouTube's into everywhere are about the sick and tired of the White House and the guy in

Benson shows your Twitter you could tweet at us still a lot of your are are are are texting and tweeting about Kavanaugh and you know people say you're in the middle you're independent what do you think about it look I think that both of them gave powerful\nPowerful statements ah I Do believe something happened to or do I believe it was him now I think it should let it play itself out I got zero problem with that I Know a lot of people that we should just voted Mitt already doesn't work that way how many times I just plain to people the way it works right the way it works is you\nNeed these votes flake\nCollins because if you don't have that we can vote you don't get to take their votes wages vote for the\nSake of it they may vote no and then he's dead and the water and then what well how do we make them vote well they want this and you're going to get this and I don't know if there's going to be in anything that comes out at the end of this I don't think there is I I think in the end that that that what\nWe have now is kind of what we have which is you're going to have to figure out for yourself\nAnd will they get a little bit more time I don't know but also remember that this isn't one of those things where the FBI is going to come out say oh you're holding\nThis is not a criminal investigation same way that the proceeding was not a criminal proceeding and that means that they can subpoena witnesses they can't force people to answer their questions they're not necessarily going to draw conclusions\nYeah is Dan ... is right there who were just absolutely love was alive he uh he's right so it's not like you're going to we're not going to get anything super Rachel Mitchell who was the woman who was asking questions she put out her little thing and it basically\nSaid look there's no prosecutor in the world that would carry for a case like this you're going on flimsy\nEvidence at best he said she said she said he said\nAnd then she that he was the one that perpetrated it so nobody would move forward in a situation like this\nBut that doesn't matter right again it's not about cabinet all it could have been any but you could look Mickey mouse up there and they would accused him of rape Mickey did you do something to many twenty three years ago I had not didn't matter it's about just bat\nOr you can I help you Kamala Harris you\nMake you would have been all pissed off to open this has been out of crime\nIn\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three I met the Joe is your daughter Hey Ryan slums going to join us next we'll talk about immigration and his story and why he doesn't want to open borders ...

[noise]\nTalking about different experiences depending on skills language ability and much else\nTalking to ... a melting pot or civil wars new book consent of immigrant makes the case against open borders so we look at like I look at immigration I think we've got to start thinking outside the box I Would love to see us do something kind of European based in the sense of\nIf you're a part of NAFTA or whatever this new thing is maybe there's a lot freer and easy to move in and out of countries where you can come here and we know you're here a centrally for lack of better term as a ... call you and make the money and leave\nRather than this fake thing that we're trying to do now which I just don't think is working around I just think we're failing miserably at it and neither side really wants to do anything about the immigration and the real way\nI respectfully disagree with you there I see where you're coming from and I do think that there are some ways\nI'm you know to address the system and more sensible ways my concern is having this kind of guest worker migration and freeing up creates other problems down the road because let's say you're here as a temporary guest worker for three years five years what happens is you form routes\nYou form relationships you start a family right and then you say okay now we're going to enforce the rules at this point down the line\nI don't think that's really going to work in a society that value civil liberties Singapore has a guest worker system that works decently well but Singapore is willing to deport guest workers who become pregnant\nAnd that something that I really don't think Americans have the stomach for and that's why I think allowing that kind of temporary immigration you have to be really careful about it you have to be willing to really enforce it on the back end so I see\nYour point and I do think that you know for example you could make it easier for retirees states in Mexico you can make it easier for professionals are burning a certain income to make that kind of movement but I think that moving too far in that direction could have downsides\nThis incredible idea but the reality is is when we go to put it in the act attraction we never follow through with the way that things are and then it becomes more about feelings than facts and that's where we run into real issues\nI Would go even further than you Chad there are a lot of times when people make an argument for a certain policy without ever intending to follow through in a way it's almost like a fake policy or going to say this is going to be a temporary policy but\nWe're not doing any of the things we need to do in order to actually make a temporary I see that a lot in policy debates and I frankly think it's pretty dishonest and misleading\nRobots government isn't that's politics right oh you do something wrong to get to get elected and really nobody cares outside of that 'cause nobody ever hold your you accountable\nFor your actions so let's talk about the ... you talked about the immigrants we we need in America which and and there is there is a need for for people not just gets workers you know people are going to pick our fruits and vegetables and whatnot\nBut there's a lot of other skills coding and things like that we're we're falling behind and we need those people here how do we go about doing that in a way that is you know you know I I Do the guest worker thing out there but how do we bring people here on merit you know like a meritocracy if you\nIt really is true that you have people who are educated in the United states or who have a job offers who could absolutely support themselves\nAnd they often find it very very hard to get a green card partly because there are so few green cards available to people on unemployment basis we give out green cards the vast majority of them to people\nBased on whether or not they are related to someone or whether or not you're the adult sibling a someone who is already residing in the country and much else and my own view is that that doesn't make a ton of sense you know maybe you can say okay that that could be a point in your favor but that shouldn't be the only thing we consider we should\nLie on the safety net I think that would make a lot more sense and by the way it would actually be more predictable and rational people who find her system totally crazy and maddening would really appreciate that too it would be better for Americans it would be better for people who are trying to see hey what are my guide post\nWhat's being expected of me if I Want to live in the United states\nWhat was your was your life like I mean you grow up you represent New York so what is your life like you you're obviously son of immigrants so they they come here what was there a simulation like what was yours simulation like it in in into the culture of America\nWell in my case I was very lucky partly because I was part of a really small group part of a really small community so when I went to school the vast majority of my friends they came from different backgrounds they came from all over the place and we spoke English to one another and we\nJust grew up in American culture\nAt almost by necessity but then when you have folks who are growing up in isolated segregated enclave community as it can be a really different story you find yourself almost trapped in this community and you find yourself alienated and separated from Americans from other backgrounds you know that's an extreme case but it really does happen\nAnd some corners of the country and my fear is that that might\nBe even more the case in the future if we don't adopt more controlled and managed system\nI look at everything ah my big fear is inevitably you know ... over you this that and the other people scream stuff because that's all they know how to do is that America we we have a culture in America and for whatever reason the people on the left in particular\nOr afraid of our culture because they only look at the ... of our culture and not that good and I always say that you go around the globe people love American people that come here and I grew up in a time in an era where kids in my school when I was a junior high and escape Cambodia and the ... and they embrace the culture they loved America they believed in the American dream if more than most\nYou know other people's go soldier the American flag makes people uncomfortable it's insane how do we get around that\nIt's really tough because basically right now when people advanced those messages are this idea that the melting pot of some terrible thing you get rewarded for it you know these are ideas that you know members of the elite had embraced and that's something that I personally find\nPretty scary because if you don't have a melting pot story if you don't have a unifying story about all that Americans\nDo have in common that's where you get this incredible divisiveness and would you pick one group against another so I agree with you I think that's a big concern and I think that\nThat's why I Want an immigration system that is more sensible rational and balance because that is what allows immigrants to really become a full part of American culture\nIf if you were to have one thing you can do and immigrants just one thing they come to you and they said around you have one thing that we're gonna we're gonna allow you to put this in here what would that one thing be\nI think we should adopt a points system in which we select immigrants based on their actual qualities\nWhat it is they're bringing to the table rather than purely basing it on family ties I think that would be a huge huge improvement over the status quo and I think people would feel a lot better about immigration if they knew that folks\nAre are taking into account uh the contributions people are making and whether the immigration system is actually in the national interest and in the interest of all American workers\nLast question coming on today a and this will will will just quickly go off topic what do you make of the craziness when it comes to the whole Kavanaugh and everything going on right now\nWell I'll just say that Brett Kavanaugh is a guy who has always been in liberal institutions he's had friendships with liberals he was literally hired as a lecturer at Harvard\nOpposition there was to him long before any of these abuse allegations came to light we're just in we're through the looking glass were in this frightening leap partisan environment and uh and I just don't know where we go from here\nNo me either me either melting pot or civil war son of immigrants makes the case against open borders a round salaam hope to have your own again appreciate your coming on today great book for anybody out there who really wants to understand things thank you so much in to look forward to talking to you again\nThanks for having me shed\nThank you that you had mentioned shows your Twitter C. H. A. B. E. N. S. so and it's very interesting and the assimilation part I I I don't know how many times I have to tell people this to me that's the most important part when you become a somebody who comes here the reason they're coming here is because America is America not because you get to be you\nJust in a different place and I think the people who embrace stuff like that and understand the greatness of what we have to offer there's a reason they want to come here they see something different than most of us I think a lot of us we've lost the site we can't see that the force of the trees and it really is interesting\nThree two three five three eight twenty four twenty three at you had been to chose your twitters which had been such a\nUnited States navy veteran jak holder talked about the first strike on Pearl Harbor\nA I have for the first wave hit we had construction crews it Oklahoma a battleship Oklahoma attorney turtle up ... ship was up we are in construction crews out there on the bottom of the ship cutting holes in them but on the ship a rescue and seeing them prep has to be in there\nThat are in dinner protect the legacy an honors the sacrifice of American veteran here more like something that\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your eight states", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pinetop", "day": "01"}
