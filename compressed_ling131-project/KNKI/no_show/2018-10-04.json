we could start this over here we can move this year all\nOf a sudden we can set this up all of corporations offshore the whole nine yards and we come back and go we stayed inside the parameters this is what we owe you know like say that's not fair\nYou set up the rules if I beat you that's when\nThey're upset because they feel they're owed that money money that had been taxed before money that have been made money that the government didn't earn that Fred and his wife and the Trump certain they feel they should get that money\nThat's what it's all about greed governments great great great great and then of course Cuomo\nLast night goes all he goes off on this and it's all areas how Chris Cuomo goes off on the oh who he is and blah blah blah blah and this whole side and and\nThis is about honesty on one level president saying that he got a million dollars from his father when he got sixty\nThat he says he was self made and French Trump was only good but he was great when Fred from obviously had way more than ... than he's ever had\nAnd we've seen this clearer timeline that he has been just been feeding from the friend trough his entire life isn't this the truth isn't this something that he should own instead of saying he's a self made man\nWell first of all\nHow much money did he get remember you're converting it into today's dollars he's worth billions and even if he got four hundred million he's worth billions two billion three billion one billion he's done well go to Silicon Valley go find venture capitalists find out how much money they've given out and how much does it work\nMy God I can go back to cylinder we get five hundred million dollars to a company that failed\nRemember that five hundred million not a tax break here's five hundred million dollars\nHere here's five hundred million of course\nEverybody's resume is padded everybody's who's going to get up there I go I said it was on my dad my dad nobody's going to do that come on Chris look where you are ... you know they have in the last name Cuomo cared a little cache with it you don't think it all\n\nThat's the thing everyone wants to call everybody out on stuff\nBut here's the thing I'm going to tell you guys on the left his base doesn't care they don't give a rat's ass they don't care how he made his money well what if he cheated did he cheat or did he cheat according to you because you want that money 'cause you think that's the thing that's fair\nRight you think that's the thing that's fair that's what you want you want it to be fair because for whatever reason you believed that money is the government's money why so into giving the government more\nUnbelievable and and you know my hat is so I'm so impressed by the quality of the journalism and the care with which this has done\nBut there's really a larger political message here which is that if you get a W to like most people you get a salary you have basically no chance to try to cheat on your taxes I mean they they they withhold a certain amount every two weeks that's just sort of how taxes work in this country but if you're rich like the trumps you can set up a system like this\nThat's right but you set up a system like this within the parameters that the government has set up and because they can beat the system\n\nThey can beat the system they can beat the system that you set up\nWhose fault that just come out and say we want that money just come out and say I want that money we need that money that money's ours come out and say come out to be the greed that huge scream about all the time how horrible it is just come out and say\nWe need that money that our money people need that money come out and say it I don't know what he did but here's the thing I don't give a rat's ass I\nUnderstand why some people were out there or at least on and say look I Want to know if he's owned by the Russians okay I can get that even though he is doing so many things against the Russians\nThat aren't in his best interest there are other things you could come out and say well more curious about this are more curious about that but okay at least I can understand that and he did say look if you want to show is taxes that's on him but he says a lot of things as do a lot of politicians\n\nBut this obsession with OPM other people's money this obsession with that is insane I can never be this obsess over somebody else's money\nNeeded if you die we should be able to take it all that to me it's crazy to teach them if you came\nTo me today and say you're not allowed to leave your family anything right the government's gonna take it all the government's gonna take it and they're going to decide what to do with it you can't leave your family or anything but a very scant amount right because we decide that you know everybody's going to do a pitch their money away the minute they have a chance that last\nFew days on earth that last few years on earth they're going to spend that wild and crazy 'cause everybody right or left isn't going to give the government a chance to have it and they can scream on both sides yeah yeah we will do that we're kind of nice BS the

a survey of people who are members of the council Foreign Relations and said in twenty drop is Russia threat and a number of them said no and therefore they concluded Russia was not a threat that\nDay they issued the report was the day the foreign minister of Russia issued a ... a threat to use nuclear weapons against NATO missile defense sites and that's my friend mark Snyder has done since twenty twelve the Russian military or civilian including Mr ... have you issued thirty\nThreats to the United states and our allies to use nuclear weapons these are not been implicit these men explicit threat so what they basically done in this twenty eight team report\nIs instead of having Fifteen hundred and fifty warheads under the new start treaty we would have\nThey think around to sixty we'd have to ... submarines that see that would be it the other three would be a import and when you look at what the loading start we'd probably have as low as a hundred and thirty warheads\nWhat would happen is instead of having five hundred and nine targets meaning land based missiles bombers and submarines spread all over the country will be down to five to ... see to set up bases and bomber base bombers would not be usable\nOf the war has would be put elsewhere and then they have this crazy idea that warheads and\nWell they're empty silos in Montana that used to be minute men silos\nWhich gentle Cartwright the negotiated with the Russians that we would not put missiles in them so we put all our warheads there and then we put a bull bull's eye on it painted bright red so the Chinese and could no they just took out all our work as we didn't matter whether we had submarine bombers or ICBMs left which we wouldn't\nUh wouldn't have any warheads\nSo in their twenties twelve report they said it is reasonable to believe that the Russians and the Chinese the Syrians the north Koreans and Iran have targets equally in about a thousand that we could rationally save needed to be hit and retaliated against and taking out\nThose numbers have all of a sudden crashed to less than a couple of hundred and what they've decided to do is no military targets would be\nIn any country no conventional or military targets would be it in a red ... choice strike we'd hit their banking their communications and there are cities\nAnd that would be it and we wouldn't have to retaliate quickly because cities banking communications don't move they're all sitting there so we would take at least\nNo less than Seventy two hours to respond if we wanted to and if we put warheads out in the minimum silos out in Montana or give you an example for a minute man base to put warheads back on the missiles you can do three missiles per month gr wing and their three wings\nShe could do nine missiles a month you could put one more head back on minute man if you want to but they want to get rid of a good player on global zero wants to eliminate all minute man so we would go down from well over five hundred targets to as I said by\nThe artist with me and we do this unilaterally\nYes unilateral surrender work if a unilateral surrender include\nCool uniforms because well because their job will be exhausting to guarantee that unilateral surrender has been sustained by the fall\nWhat's interesting that the ... and this hundred and seven page report\nThey're they they don't talk about verification because you can't verify for example will be alert and that's your favorite thing it's like turning off a missile well with a keystroke on the computer I can turn it back on\nAnd I could targeted wherever I Want to target it nobody will know so there's no verification of course but then they say and this is toward the end they say\nEverybody has to now not to use weapons first they have to vow not to deploy attack submarines in certain areas the oceans in order to make the submarine safe and this is what they say in which everyone and I'm quoting sincerely vows\nTo do this quote unquote so sincerely vows is like a marriage\nWedding is used sincerely vow to you know on her and uh be true to your wife or your husband that now is that we we now have marriage and a nuclear policy instead of\nTrust but verify it's if they sincerely vowed to do it then it's okay and that's literally that is a quote from the end of the book or this hundred and seven page book so now we're gonna have unilaterally ten percent of the Russian force\nWill have it somewhere between twenty and forty percent of the Chinese force and we'll have about\nTwenty percent of our current force that is allowed under a treaty will get rid of everything now one of the things is really strange is\nAll the submarines had a whole new summaries about sixteen missiles every missile Bruce Blair says put eight warheads on which is by the way the maximum you can put on it what happens if the Russians busts out of the global uh the new start treaty\nThe edge and we would have no hedge we would be stuck at about two hundred and fifty survivable warhead to the um that would be it and the other guys to build what ever they wanted a bill\nGardens you have about a minute So Peter I'm you mentioned something before about how potent has been a threatening the fence of use of nuclear weapons\nHe's been doing that especially with regard to the Baltics we've just got about thirty seconds if you can run them through how global zero would do with pollutants threats to use nukes to start a war do they have a plan Peter a thirty second\nOh no no no I'm not at all that's the whole point of building low yield weapons on a cruise missile or a D. five that rain missile it gets there quickly within you know twenty to thirty minutes which we don't have anything that can get there that quickly today that's why it's not a question blow your weapons is the question can you get them to the battle\nA potent by the way announced this new strategy in April two thousand\nAnd two thousand six he said this is how we're going to do it and we're going to exercise this way and we're going to build these things and then twenty fourteen announced everything's going to be built done deployed in the field by twenty Twenty one and this and I'm quoting are strapped commander General John heightened\nSo potent started doing this back in twenty two thousand in April and during the Clinton Administration

may be a response especially from a religious circles and even extreme circles inside Pakistan and so I don't think it's an issue that can be swept under the rug\nAnd especially if you know that if

United States\nIn China and uh because they have a lot of businesses that operate ... quite a bit of money in China so I expect very little uh agreement between those three parties on this and the Chinese are are\nI think are banking on that because they know that the Europeans are kind of split with the Americans right now both politically and economically\nAndrew I'm what is the state of the Chinese economy today I mean specially after the September numbers is it a better than people say or where do you see it going well\nThan the number so far I haven't been that that exports were up fairly helpfully and imports were up uh I have the August numbers which were up ... percent which is pretty good showing 'em so there's a bit of weakness in the export powerhouse area of quality ... province in the south with it which accounts for twenty percent of exports\nAnd they're you're starting to see a bit of a recession so we may be seeing the beginning silence if but so far the economy's been held holding up surprisingly well\nAnd it's not because of trade friction or is it does some other factor\nOh I'm pretty sure that the weakness can go out and going is because of trade friction or the data it's inconclusive at this point but given that they have a lot of small businesses export um different kinds of cotton goods and other things to the United states I'm sure it's trade related\nAnd one other question on on just the technical aspects of this it took me a little bit by surprise but I saw that China's going to borrow three billion dollars why are they doing that\nWell they because they basically investors in the west to fill us too that a Chinese government that is perfectly sound to us because they have a large a trade surplus\nThey have a three trillion dollars of overseas and foreign exchange and they have not defaulted on any national external debt I'm so it it's a good bet if they can get a decent interest rates are going to look for overseas Capitol\nYeah but why would the Chinese need the money\nWell\nThere's a huge amount of debt so they're looking to try to extend that into a get new sources of capital overseas it's it's a reasonable strategy\nThe puzzle China is looking for a negotiation with the United states or not the U.S is looking for a negotiation with China or not are they in a waiting game Andrew and how long the wait how long before things deteriorate\nI think the Chinese have more or less given up because of the Trump Administration is it's I don't think it's really interested in a settlement there's actually asking the Chinese to change the entire basis of their economy\nWhich the Chinese are are unable to do\nIt would be one thing if the Trump Administration said okay look you've got a you've stolen some of our technology in certain cases you're steel mills are being supported by the government\nThese are areas that we think you should focus on instead the Trump ... the ... and others make very broad brush statements and the Chinese think are starting to get to the point where they're washing the hands of the whole thing them figure it's a political football\nSo if they wash their hands what is the timeline does anybody advance a timeline just this go on to spring Nineteen spring twenty how long\nI think this is going to go on for a number of years because the Trump Administration as I said it's not going to alter its behavior so far we've not seen that\nAnd the Chinese themselves have figured that um so they're going to try to deal with their own domestic economic problems in terms of slowing growth the only thing that I think it helps if it's a lot of small businesses in America stop start going on or have a large unemployment and putting pressure on Trump's base we haven't seen that yet though\nSo Andrew in Hong Kong what is the mood about the Chinese economy long term I'm I get the sense that people are pretty optimistic but where do you use it\nThey are pretty optimistic because so far the crash that'll bring people up in predicting half mapping or the economy it's definitely\nLenders but not massive default and the leadership is tightening script over the riskier banks in the system so so far it's been a kind of a of a gradual decline but no collapse and then you got that booming tech sector with the huge\nA bite do ten cents I'm and other ... about the Amazon of China that are doing very well and doing very well for western investors so that's a a an OK picture\nAnd I get I gather the central bank is basically decided to um ease up a little bit on the money supply basically make a little bit more cash available and that has been able to get the country's true right\nThat's exactly it they basically after tighten credit for awhile and shutting down some of the risky a fast\nThey start are starting to open the spigot again and they're hoping to fuel growth in small businesses will have a lot of employees to keep employment off\nUnfortunately it looks like a lot of the credits just going to go to the state firms that are the most inefficient so this is really not good for China's long term I'm structural growth but it's just the way the Chinese system operates\nA we have about a minute Andrew I'm I'm most interested the Chinese confidence believes that the country can grow without an accommodation with the United states is that correct\n[noise] while there I said they're not happy about it\nBut she didn't pay the president is dealing with you know he said he's dealing with 'em and attempt to cut down on pollution he's got a lot of domestic problems\nAnd he's looking at a Trump Administration that hardly knows what it does from day to day so his attitude is if I Can't control it I'm going to have to

operate in the cyber realm I think they're ah they're sharing best practices\nAre and they all learn from each other and so they can you know and of course North Korea does something that's useful\nOthers can pick up on that in North Korea one thing we know about them they are very good at learning or from others and so I have no doubt that they're trying to gain any kind of a skills and information from the Russians from the Iranians from the Chinese\nAnd the you know to improve their capabilities and and so again this is why we really need to focus on this threat\nThirty seconds ago

shut everybody down and that's their plan demonized is get people to go up and that is so the next person they attack nobody stands up as well\nThey believe they're breaking your well right now\nAnd I tell you all of it I could literally keeps you all night because the stories are just so\nUnbelievable this is coming to a theater near you [noise]\n\nYou have to donate a malicious fake news unfold propaganda but is social media over the past year [noise] it's not clear that so called fake news can have real world consequences the\nRussians in my opinion and based on the intel encounter and tell people I talked to\nCould not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided and here's a here's I don't buy America guided by Americans and so voters who are being targeted with all of this false information\nAre genuinely trying to make up their mind what does it mean\nIt's a danger that must be addressed\nAnd then the rest quickly five part of the legislation is making its way through Congress to lose the government's response to the foreign propaganda Silicon Valley is starting to grapple with the challenge and it's rather a fake news\nThere have been a series of studies academic studies or since the election trying to figure out why people voted the way they did because it defied all the polls nobody\nThey saw in the media but\nMore so a online it's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones who claims that nine eleven and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs but Trump doesn't challenge these lies he actually went on Jones's show and said\nAnd your reputation amazing I Will not let you down you'll be very very impressed\nYellow shown show was on I taught one oh six point seven\n\nKids Alex Jones\nI Want to have it on the show\nAlmost censored comedians out there is a pop bottle is flooding\nWatching his whole cabinet offer us do\nEverything for says everything these other women say none of the witnesses say it happened [noise]\nAnd then Ford says will she Shaq\nAnd it's just other worldly and then there she's involved in a weird DARPA program\nTo implant memories and painful and then she's a globe Trotter bragging how she's you know went to Haiti or whatever and everywhere else Costa Rica\nAnd then she says but I prayed to fly\nA and I was afraid of the grass\nAnd they only gave her to question which is not a polygraph maybe like twenty thirty forty questions just to warm up\nBut but but getting serious here because it's obviously satire drills courting I'm sure it by being absurd we haven't shared it was a joke in the article you on one paragraph before the video will be like oh how dare you say that's for click bait we're not doing that\nWe're putting it out so much money I mean Matt Damon really didn't ripe you unless you went and I just want them\nTo this Christine Blasey Ford's clash and then she did hypnosis on you and and then I guess maybe if you believe or that Matt Damon ... maybe it's proof\nWhere obviously trying to make there's more evidence that Matt Damon\nGo by the leftist standard of rape accusation equals destroying an honorable man's life\nMatt Damon is far more guilty than judge Kavanaugh of raping me because I was gonna fly down to the studio today is you know and I sat on a tarmac today 'cause the Clinton brought for six hours and\nAllegedly Matt Damon broke the plane because he didn't want the secret out like there's a couple of people being like no way it's Matt Damon and I'm like oh that is my rapist\nSee anyone can just make this stuff up it's it's just it's ridiculous in and we need due process because you can't prove a negative I Know you've had this Alex and I know I've had this when you're accused of something you can't prove you're not something it's a logic\nInverse that that makes it so someone can just have control over you so that's why instead of just in a constant state of back title I now and I'm just doing the same thing to them and except in a way that's obviously satire because I don't want to bear false actual witness\nYou know ... to destroy their lives but you're lucky that I really Matt Damon is a gremlin he can take on that forum got into the building the plane ripped up some of the enemy onyx things could have been worse than on the wing of the plane\nAnd then to him and wanted me to survive though because he doesn't want to kill his victim because he likes to know that I I get triggered Everytime I hear high like them apples or even if I use an apple product I think about good Will Hunting and of course the vicious rape so it would have been mercy kill if he did take down the plane and he noted that seven\nIs Matt Damon ah in in this\nDream this false memory you hadn't planted stand well\nPart elephant and ah he has little and and Ben Affleck was there laughing all I remember is the laughter Alex I don't remember where it was I just remember that there were stairs and laughter\nAnd for that I Want seven hundred and fifty grand\nAnd or any of my other enemies want to talk smack\nThe day she testified what is it now I heard it was over a million\nI'm sure and and her ex boyfriend just came out did you I'm sure you saw this where um they used to always be on prop planes he witnessed her and he swore this he's he just war this uh uh with fear of perjury that\nThat he witnessed her coaching another woman how to take a lie detector test and she got 'em for bank fraud this this news just came out like late late last night and the mainstream media won't report it like she's a proven liar\nAnd they're not afraid to fly and it's not only we just have to believe him we have the witnesses of her own saying she's a globe trotting loving to fly fly some places are sixteen hours away\nWell yeah and it's you know the leftist use our own morality in our own sense of honor against us and and I'm I'm a mom do 'em at this point and I know you are as well that they will just use our deference to actual victims that really do need to be heard like the victims of Harvey Weinstein for example a\n... and they'll use that and they'll use that to put us in a state of fear and the state of immobility and that is when they just acquired power and if they get total power wearing ... and that's why\nMy role is to fight it was satire like I'll do these it's time videos and stuff and and jokes and stuff like that and that's good at waking people up to the absurdity of it\nUm but you know everyone has their role to play but at this point more Americans need to shoulder the burden of fighting or the left is global is nonsense is truth everything is power this Machiavellian nightmare that's happening because it's easy to be if you just say what you believe\nMonitor the drawing should get a break come back and play Mitch McConnell saying they won't be belligerent eclipse\nPolls show and I'm gonna get too many come back debt major shift in battleground states for Republicans for Trump now this somehow just a witch hunt went too far\nAnd she didn't tell anybody and then none of the friends saying is true in the globe trotting are a lot about that and then the whole family CIA left this coup balls I mean I really think they have gone too far here\nYeah they they they woke up a lot of people like I had just this week a few people that are more\nA higher up in LA that haven't talked to me in a while like tax me how I'm doing and stuff because I think they finally saw that appeasement just means you get eaten last and it's a lot harder to dismiss a cabin on like the centrist\nEagle Scout you know Gail guy it was like the left is trying to prove that they can do it to anybody at any time even Mike Pence who never as along with a woman they could do this they could say well a ghost was touched\nLike they they they're they're trying to do a power display were no one's safe and that caused the show there's going to be a red wave\nThere's no way are people that I Know that aren't we never would vote and think I'm Crazy or like dude we can't let the Democrats take over the house these people and saying they've weaponized rape accusations like that's a sacred thing like rape is horrible\nAnd it's like you can't do this to men because men are naturally protective so we're we're gonna believe women a lot of times and then when you see the obvious you know Feinstein this archaic war we each like when you see someone like that and they're real motives it makes you\nJust all that shit is they are raping the truth and then you have this coach seeing our team got raped by the ramps and he gets suspended or fired we're now they're even raping language\nOh well the rape of the language is how the left does it you know I'm starting to realize the reason that they actually banned or to kill a mocking bird my mom teaches a literature is a it's not actually the N. word which the ... and where does know by the way but it's because it shows do ...\n\n\n\nAnd it was a liberal\nAnd go to\nThat is but we're not saying it's not minority saying\nWe're bringing back when they won't ever offer even veteran wholesome

defending that I think now the jury found him guilty okay I but I still have some questions\nBut Kavanaugh there's no history of this he's on a ... not settling rape cases and then the Democrats

talked about how many never Trump or as we mentioned this last week how boom I said ooh wow all of a sudden they are absolutely\nIn in supportive of up cabinet and furious and I haven't talked about the never Trump or is that I Know that had built alliances with Democrats because of their hatred towards Trump yeah and now they're fighting with each other because when it comes down to it\nWell except maybe for Bill Kristol [laughter]\nThe one the one old out except for except for Bill Christ and I haven't seen anything from George and it's like ... yeah exactly so you know they're not part of the ... he\nEnemy of the GOP legal establishment a Supreme Court nominee from central casting\nAnd it and you know and it's a great point spend twenty six years in public service and the hope what what and that's why it's not about him what I think it what I think it is and I think it's bigger than just Cavanaugh\nI think it's the realization from ... from a I think you're the realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump yeah and\nDon't like where the Republican Party is going\nWhere they've realized uh we got to come home for a while because those people are insane I Know a case you're Cortez yesterday said the writers insane\nOr we'll go through whether she actually had any substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see what what are the left is doing to Kavanaugh when you see the presumption of innocence is is gone when an allegation itself is enough to destroy someone's life\nThis goes beyond a political issue it goes to what one Trump the election it is but it is the culture war but it's also and and and I say a culture where because it's a war on\n... it's it's it's about it's about fairness\nIt's about the belief and the constitution look we don't we were never tremors we've criticized Trump when we were you know we were never on that never ever going to vote for re voted for\n... are you and I don't practice political I dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're not going to see us at rallies going ra ra ra whatever my candidate does we will tell you who was the best ... well you know who has the best idea on what particular issue and why and we ended up voting for the person who most\n... [laughter] I Would only vote for as I read Rick Perry and one of his was one of his first interviews after dropping out of the election and twenty six being you know well uh you know I guess he wasn't your first choice they told the interviewer will know my first choice was\nMe [laughter] and and so I I think when when you see that that ... it it's just been it's been brought back to many of these ... going on and many of them who started making alliances with people on the west yeah\nYou know trying to build these emotional as I saw on social media from some of the people but I Know that our number Trump hers but all of a sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this\nI mean you really ... this is what you really we wow\nWhat will you know we thought you know this is almost like the McCain funeral what we thought that there are actually people out there in the Democratic side they don't want it to come together to find the common ground that we have and now the realization is no they don't and I think a lot of people just as a wake up call\nLook the party isn't perfect [laughter] I'd be listening to the show you know when we talked about the Republican Party or a\nOr listen to the pocket from yesterday show [laughter] but the the the party isn't perfect but again everything's\nWhen you get to this point of the actual election it's a binary choice\nMhm it's a choice between this group in that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one and I think that's what a lot of uh never Trump or is looking at right now saying\nWhoa you know who you know when when um oh ... who was at a I'm trying to think of the the the the person oh oh yeah yeah it was a ... member was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump rather vote for Hillary right yeah\nI thought this would because I I Know I saw that a a Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that\nKind of thought process doesn't exist right now well except for Bill Kristol\nA and and uh that uh Jonathan ... is it ... they're at a use it\nOn Fox News on the on the the the money block and I think Fox Business news as well he was one of those [noise] otherwise conservatives that what\nCame out with the I'm with her remember that yes hash tag I'm with her right yeah by the way that was after the the the house report the house GOP report the eight hundred page report\nOn been guys\nSo I I think that's you know what's happening so again or you look at that and you say wow I live really look for Republicans then I see this Washington Examiner\nOr which is a for anybody to know a very conservative outlet GOP gloom Republicans predict house majority will be swept away by democratic spending to nominate\nFive weeks before the critical midterm elections House Republicans are outgunned and out man as a constellation of wells tourist democratic groups dedicated to winning the majority overwhelmed GOP defenses\nFrom financially flushed superPACs flooding the zone with advertising to grassroots organizations directing money and volunteers to targeted areas around a dozen political groups\nAre feeling the Democratic party to flip twenty three states and capture the house on November sex in a toxic environment driven by discontent with President Donald Trump the barrage has become too much to handle for the two groups\nManning the barricades for House Republicans the national Republican congressional committee or official campaign arm in congressional leadership fund their designated super PACs are guys are taking a beating said robbed Sims a Republican consultant\nA and former and our she's the executive director said Tuesday in an interview with the Washington\nYou know the money that's being spent by the Democrats and the vulnerabilities we're there to the point and these are the people the money people behind it saying we're going to be swept by the Democrats yeah so which one is true\nWell ... and and there's what you ask why you have the election right exact election and\nAnd remember um ah oh Casio Cortez her opponent spent ah I think it was somewhere around three million and she spent right\nMerge early enough money doesn't always win you know it it is the message is also the motivating\nFactors that we've talked about and clearly Kavanaugh one way or the other I mean ... and and I I Would agree with the peace to a certain extent a written in in a ... at our CPA and I'll get the author here in in in a minute or they deserve the credit\nBut the idea that you know it's theoretically it could benefit either side you know to a certain extent again but typically what do you see historically a there's been a a the younger demos\nTurned out for the primaries this year they don't always turn out\nNecessarily in November for a for a mid term so we'll see if that actually changes this year because again what could motivate them and and a number of things could happen\nBetween let's just say I Kevin ... confirmed on on Saturday or Sunday and he's on the bench on Monday everything's going to change and there will be something else for people to talk about that Trump about or whatever it is and that's the difference so we'll see what happens eight six six Ninety right I\nWas really my camera and record it's radio [noise]\nThe conversation using the

we will tell you about the explosive testimony given by a top FBI lawyer [noise] ah to the\nHouse yesterday and and this is like whoa I mean this is this is really some\nInteresting stuff which shows you which uh and and and this is what the Republicans have always stated\nThat the getting the Pfizer Warren was all about politics will get to that here in just a little bit but we found out the process here by how\nThe Senate Judiciary committee will uh be able to get a look at the actual background check right that the FBI has done and the actual report aired you've been doing some\nOr during the break on that yeah so there was back in two thousand nine by the way the Democrats control the Senate and the house then a a memorandum of understanding a centrally a which is they rule in the Senate that was that was created to keep the background check\nFor a nominees secret okay\nUm you and under that rule the procedure is is that there is one copy paper copy not electronic there's not the three oh to report\nOr from the FBI on Capitol is not going to be sent via email you can't take pictures of it um and\nYou can make note if your a senator looking at it but your notes will be secured in the same way that the forms will be and those forms are highly secure so\nIt's going that one copy is going to go into a room with the senators the GOP will have an hour with that the Democrats have an hour with it we were told it was being widely reported that they were looking over that a late Wednesday evening I'm the report from the hill a\nEarlier in the day Thursday Afternoon into Thursday evening was that they would review it on Thursday\nOr but the report came out that they you know it was the senators had it and I assume we're reviewing it and taking that time to review it or at least the G O P might have been a as latest a Wednesday evening so that could pour over into Thursday\nNow there's been some some concern there are and of course protests by Dick Durban right a Democrat to whip a he has been you know of course Bogle through this whole thing but that's who Dick Durbin is\nHe's you know freaking out that it's they only get one hour they only get one hour they only get one hour if you look at the number of senators\nOr that you know and they only get thirty minutes each\nThen that's going to be a problem that would take of course fifty hours and total well\nThis is again typical that you would want to ... you're trying to keep it secured you're trying to keep it secured so you basically go in you know the left goes in the Democrats going as a team the Republicans go in as a team\nOr again the rules are prohibit them from taking pictures they can make notes but those notes will be secured and and and uh possibly destroyed actually uh you can make those notes along the way so that you can go over those with your colleagues as you are reviewing the document\nActually ordered the supplemental background check\nHe's been more than

goal a so there's a where we are cloture vote on a friday the Senate all members of the Senate will be able to see it the next couple of days at a statement\nYou and I were looking for an update to the story\nA just a little while ago and we did that during this past break and a Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying that all senators will have an opportunity to review the report ... over the next couple of rice\nAs we go back and you know because the the cloture vote could happen you know late friday so they could take all day Thursday and all day friday\nUm and I suspected that well while he may not allow multiple copies to be made again there's only one single copy\n'em that he could easily say well OK over the next couple of days we'll we'll take our time with it and it won't be the the one hour restriction a you know maybe a each of them can go into that room are either as a group or individually and they can you know take their time with it\nUm and and they likely will do that but I'm I'm guessing they will do that either in one large group or or smaller groups even ah in order to to see everything\nUh we'd seen the story of late yesterday that the top FBI a lawyer a James Baker offers explosive testimony on a normal handling of the Russia probe into the Trump campaign ah and that's a Fox News headline from uh yesterday was going\nThrough additional\nMaterials you're in the last hour and saw the he'll dot com and John Solomon\nThey really wants to the desert or art at rice or is there a card or rightly I Believe it was both of them that did the story on the visor court's review in the Obama administration this goes back to ... way back in May of of of twenty Seventeen\nWell his story goes to the specifics of it and the specific of the allegation will get into the the the details of it but here it is the first line congressional investigators have confirmed\nThat a top FBI official met with Democratic Party lawyers that's Perkins Kuwait\nTo talk about allegations of Donald Trump and the Russia collusion weeks before the twenty sixteen election and just before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump campaign so that would have been late September or early October ... at the latest or in twenty six things\nWhile while we're up yeah general counsel James Baker met during the two thousand six team with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee\nLong for [noise] which is the organization that pain fusion GPS the higher the former British spy to get the stuff from the Russian\n\nI'm not saying they won't do it but but uh there's a huge disincentive for them to to to do that but you probably could see them saying look and it it's going to be that it's already that's from the liberal media or NBC News on on Wednesday\nWhile there are dozens of people thousands of people I think they said over forty people\nThat have said that that have ah have information at potentially they could be witnesses that's one of the words they use to potentially and their story or that that could help substantiate all these claims and blah blah blah\nThat's not how this works they don't get to control that but but nonetheless that will be the narrative and you'll probably see a couple of senators or during the day on Thursday or friday more likely on friday as they try and hold an elevator doors open\nThey did an interview enough people ah they didn't talk to Ford or\nThere's new allegations that are coming out yeah uh that are uncorroborated too so we need to investigate them since there is no cooperation we need to find the ... I mean it's going to go down to the ... but I I I Do believe that\nBecause the uh Republicans most likely want to abide by the rule that Democrats will do everything they can\nTo claim for example is Adam Schiff has done all along and Adam Schiff ... not on this but Adam ... who will be talking about\nUh the whole a Russian collusion investigation coming up in the bomb shell\nOr out of a of a DC uh yesterday about the James Baker ... uh uh apparently telling the house or the house ah ah I don't know which panel it was\nBut uh in in test closed door testimony yesterday telling them he talked to the Democrat the Democratic national committee's lawyers right before they got the warrant right and and and James Baker top FBI official\nOr at that time which without question shows the politics played a part any talk to them about\nWhat was going on me talk to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion investigation that was going on which is at the little league the wrong thing to do right now you cannot nobody can defend that\nIn an investigation so it's getting to where you and I ask\nQuestions over a year and a half ago is this where this is going and we ... you know what I'm saying is every question that we asked about where this were what might have happened here and what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question on has come true it is\nIt's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we can say right um that well first of all one of the first questions the big question really was there a potentially is there are we looking at\nPossibly a gross abuse of power under the previous administration\nThat that a person or persons\nKnowingly used false information to which is a the Giuliani pointed out you know there's a there you have it there's your your your perjury um but they they in soliciting for that uh Pfizer court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up falling off the top of the hour might point out Adam ship is do Adam Schiff\nHas claimed for the longest time that there is collusion their ... and since we can see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and out of the feeling the Democrats do the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah I Know in this because the Republicans won't release it so they won't release or do they know the Republicans won't release of because Republicans\nYou know a ... ... ... ah in the in the Senate want to keep a this\nAnd the fact that hey we can't be black but not every background check we do have every ... of of every judge we're not going to do that\nAnd so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may force the Republicans to release it here\nIn the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I could finish the show here in the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours\nThe rest of the show go home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM [laughter] so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in the ...

Democratic National Committee\nFusion GPS was a research firm who then hired Christopher Steele the former British spy to compiled the dos TA or lead gene Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the

campaign\nAccounting irregularities thing it's like a pencils home things like that and just you know if you're new to the show what we've always talked about is the Democrats have said Trump polluted

they got from the Russians are to get themselves a Pfizer worn a secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd what we're being told now is that somebody from the FBI met with the law firm who helped initiate the whole thing along with the DNC and the Hillary campaign right before the Pfizer warrant was issued and just weeks before the campaign yeah so hopefully that does I think that

I'm meteorologist John trout\n\n\n[noise] hey how are you good that [noise] ah well I'm curious about and it's just something that went through my head\nIs what do you uh what do you guys think about the idea that the whole reason\nThey held everything and that they've been doing what they've been doing and they laid the groundwork for in the hearing by a claiming that he was kind of partisan and attacking them\nIs that they didn't think they were actually going to be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh so what they've been doing is laying the groundwork to once he's elected and is on the Supreme Court from this point forward\nThere are going to claim he's part is in and try and demand that he recused himself or abstained from any votes\nBe happy to do with anything they want to but they they don't they can do\nHe's you know it's not he's the only person that can recused himself\n[noise] okay yeah they can't scream that\nWell they can they Graham those rotifers sill screaming all day long but they'll get nowhere with getting where with it\nOkay cause I've heard lawyers you know try and\nNo show that judges short recused themselves oh yeah great out our well you know when they lose\nThe electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know that we should do away with this process we should change the way that Supreme Court justices are seated than we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our ways so we should change the rules right\nAh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah I Can't remember we've even there's been some cases ... said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves a I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we ...\nWe're seeing the down the it got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argue the case or something um then but but again that's up to them because if it or\nOr there for example they're arguing the case that deals with the law you know with the company\nAnd their wife works for the company and writes for the economy at that point you have to recuse yourself but to say as we've been we we've heard for example well they can't he can't roll on anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at them that's not going to hold any water\nYeah ... you remember when the talk about or you know his nomination this was back during the Gorsuch nomination process or the talk was well the the president should nominate his sister\nYou know and it was like okay that's [laughter] she would have to recuse herself from every case of that [laughter] well that company is indirectly working with my brother's company and the and you know you you get the the the whole thing\nAnd and of course you know the fact that uh well she's part of his family but the the the process and you and I were having this discussion during the break\nThere is a great deal of respect by everyone that's seated on the court right now for the process\nNot that they make a decision that we always agree with in fact the uh well I can think of three that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter] but we can talk about that\nBut the procedure on procedural issues all of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court have a great deal of respect for those procedures and how you move forward with the case\nOr it is not it is not driven like the social media world of today\nOf um an questions that come out of them and then the media takes them and runs with them often out of context uh they did that with Scalia or but you know there's but but still in terms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect why each of those that are ...\nAnd ... but I I think can make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the federal judges to begin with is not the social media world that I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that it's not the social media world that we live in for example most people don't know\nThat a former Justice Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great great friends were great on Mondays to make that their ... their their family their families used to vacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find\nTwo polar opposites so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we haven't said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to ask the judges privately what they believe\nAbout the process to Kavanaugh is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that way because they don't even\nTo the door this is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate in two thousand nine\nControlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the the content of the three oh two secret is likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if this uh if some content came out just imagine that we never\nBecause the claim would be in the Rio to accept that they found that they couldn't find any anyone with first hand knowledge of the event or the claims then they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well they know the Senate knew back then\nThat you take something like that a simple claim that cannot be backed up and it could be it could\nDerail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but here's here's the point\nThat nobody's talked about\nWith all the federal judge ships out their forget about the Supreme Court just the federal judge ships out there\nThat background checks are done how many thousands of claims that are uncorroborated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are on cooperated in order to defeat somebody\nAnd never get known to the public eye only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rule ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete ruled the Senate complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority that is a more construction is wild journalists core and then learning of this this rule now it puts it all into perspective\nShe knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI to vet as a part of the official process it would've\nWould have been in the official three oh to report and you wouldn't hear about it when it would have never\nName would have never come out because everything would have been on ... ... ... would not have been able to then cooperate and then at that point it died just like probably the thousands of other allegation and you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices\nOver the decades and that that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now what makes sense as to why\nFeinstein for her politically white worked to her end and and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to lead to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it\nNow you know why Lindsey Graham was so enraged yep eight six six nine to read I\nWas very much about their records radio [noise]\n\nBe a part of the

older than we are ... so he's an old school Democrat ... he may have his opinions of what he wants day to day onto you know what we should do with immigration or or how far a welfare should go or what taxes should be\nBut I'm the constitution there used to be agreement between\nLiberals and conservatives on how they view the constitution that's one big difference that we have today and that's why you have somebody like Dershowitz who is now openly ostracized by the liberals the whole thing that he\nCan't even go to Martha's Vineyard anymore because they rejected him right are there because they knew somebody who was a constitutional is who believes in the constitution\nAnd hold dear to their heart and believes in freedom of speech and\nBelieves in due process or are under the under the law\nThey only believe that when it fits their day to day narrative and that's really the difference in liberalism ... liberalism of the sixties in the fifties and\nEven going before that believe in

make a great point in the never conservatives are the left by the way that it doesn't matter it's got nothing to do with Trump this has nothing to do with Trump\nAnd and we have talked about how this has United the ... the Republican parties and the different factions and even the never Trump hers and it has it has helped to unite them back to coming home to the Republican Party\nAnd a couple of things that they wrote here they said Democrats were so worried about Senate norms that they hid Mrs Ford's name from Republicans for six weeks founder a lawyer midwife the lie detector test who's results they still haven't fully disclosed an orchestrated the rollout of her accusations\nMr Trump's rhetoric is too often divisive and disassemble ing button no action in his presidency comes close to matching the hardest and viciousness of the Senate ambush of Brett Kavanaugh\nThese are today's democratic norms and\nUh it's as a media sometimes for us to be puzzled that more than eighty percent of Republicans across the country tell pollsters they support Mr Trump despite his personal flaws\nThe never conservatives which is a left or the reason and the assault on judge Kavanaugh is the latest showcase of their ... methods Republicans have figured out that if the left can willfully even gleefully destroy a man\nAs distinguished us Brett Kavanaugh they can and will do it to any conservative who threatens their grip on power sure Republicans are well aware of Mr Trump's excesses and false woods but they have also come to understand that the resistance to him is not rooted in principle\nOr some August call to superior character they know Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen despite\nMeans necessary Republicans across America can see and certainly there are senators voting on judge Kavanaugh should realize that the last hate them as much or more than they load Mr Trump conservatives understand that and for the American left\nThey're all deplorable now ... yeah I think that's a I think it's a great piece and and right on target which is why you see I think more of a United front much more uh more United front than I can remember with Republicans in a long long time\nAre you here and it's more than just about this it is about the fact that they now understand how far the left will go what the left is about\n... and that's it and and this is not something you usually forget there's what another five weeks are less than five weeks now before the election\nAnd I think\nThis is not going to it's not just a motivating factor for the election I think it's a motivating factor for the Republicans in general I think it's a motivating factor for those in power [noise]\nUh not just to try and retain their power [noise]\nBut beyond that to do something together as a party and and get to work on a number of agenda items we'll see if that happens [noise]\n\nOr has released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks\nBefore the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out a former FBI\nFrom ... the Democratic National Committee is private law firms just we we like to do this because we can do it within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats that ... used you know they accused of the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original a charge what we found out since that time\nWas and nobody disputes what I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign gave money to their law firm ... law firm ... who then\nGave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the crumbling which was unverified still to this day and verified in order to uh destroy the reputation of Donald Trump\nDuring the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it\nTo destroy the legitimacy of his election after he was elected a lot of that information and that ... from what we know it was the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd so now we know that right before that the FBI\nLead counsel met with the law firm Perkins Cooley that really when you look at it they're the ones that started you know the the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign [laughter] we got to the law firm\nThey were the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS to me they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers right and I would counsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said\nThe the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others in that law firm that would be you could just easily I guess a compartmentalize that as part of an investigative process\nWhy would why would the counsel for the FBI do as I say well as well as he says to talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion\nOr just weeks before the twenty sixteen election but it was lawyers meeting with lawyers right why why not an agent asking some questions of the attorneys no it was attorneys and attorneys meeting so former\nFBI general counsel James Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee he's private\nLaw firm ... that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay research firm fusion GPS who then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy\nTo compile the dusty a oven cooperated Ron intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a Bible testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect that dossier was connected to the ... main law firm and and it was the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the Pfizer court in October of twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI\n... officer so high that Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed a Jim Baker was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to divulge the testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the Perkins could we law firm\nAnd the FBI we bought the state of this I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four yeah you can do a couple of season\nThough you could do probably more seasons then law and order a couple of seasons of it because we've always broken down and since we've been on for such a long time I do believe that you know you could include us in the group that was first in asking ... so many of the important questions on this and when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing\nTrump of colluding with the Russians to hack and or changed because of change then to hack\nAnd or to change the outcome of the election and in reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones who colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump\nOn verified information still today is\nHeld by the way if it's done verified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's fall after [laughter] after ever over after over two years right so\nAnd and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that\nIt was to destroy the legitimacy of a lead shit presidential election in the United states and they tried to do it by taking that information that information and and ...\nSo the Pfizer court to spy on the Trump campaign is exactly the accusations they and they don't make it against Trump yes they still make the say he's treasonous for Russian collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party\nAnd all those things that I just brought up right now\nAll the way to the whole Pfizer court and you everybody knows it's true I don't know of anybody decide or or that as it tried to\nEven debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others at circuit news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out um and what was going on the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together in the last two years here's the\nProblem with having something go on for so long where it is active because it is still active Mueller and his team are still working which means it's still relevant\nEven though right now and the left they've gone very quiet on it\nIt's that you have more time to shed light on the truth\nThat's a problem for anyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario\nWhat you think about it I Can't even apply to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right the longer that you go on and you look at the you know the allegations that have been made the story start falling apart as more\nInvestigations go on as you've seen you know with the ah the ah you know Evan Eddie's right a thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it still remains\nYou know a mill cooperation for these particular stories right they they go nowhere\nAnd like I said more the truth of what we have seen it but the Democrats dead wood Dianne Feinstein did you know the the the fact of you and I talked about this earlier the fact that\nThey actually could have kept her name secret yes now that we know how background checks for gun yet and they keep it secret they could have kept her name sacred\nMiami and all the processes yes they could have done it and she chose not to and Feinstein made this thing move forward\nOr if if you look at this I mean this is where we got to had she'd done that in July we may not know Dr Ford's name because if it was part of the three oh two and was not backed up by anything\nThat information wouldn't have been made public it wouldn't have

thousand nine it was the Democratic controlled Senate that came up with the protocol and this new rule that what you learn in a background check stays private yes\nIt is going to be known only to the senators and and the idea is that ah I'm I'm certain that was back then but you can easily apply that to what's going on today that if a claim 'cause the FBI is not doing a criminal investigation\nI hate the fact that we have to keep saying it but I feel it's necessary so if you talk about how a background check has done for those that were in the military that had certain clearance\nA you know all too well or going into the military uh and and maybe you have a I so I Know someone who's who who had both parents were immigrants\nAnd so there was a that there was a a a special kind of background check okay we're going to look into basically a who you are as an individual and your family and everything else the point being is that they're there to vet you okay and this case they're there to vet Brett Kavanaugh\nBut it could be that uh a neighbor says something well that Brett Kavanaugh I used to play hopscotch in his underwear\n\nWhich we all know to be true I think we can all agree on that\n[laughter]\n\nHe didn't use real chalk but the the whole idea is that someone's going to make a claim the reason the FBI as part of it is because they have the resources in order and the training\nFor the most part get it right but they had the point being they have the resources and the train to get that done that's why you do that that's it's part of the process but there could be a claim let's just say one that's not backed up by any witnesses from something that happened decades ago about a nominee\nAnd then if the media got hold of it then it would turn into something that maybe didn't warrant that kind of attention because it didn't have anyone to back it up\nI'm I'm sort of familiar with a sounds familiar vaguely familiar with\nBut now we know this answers the question why didn't Dianne Feinstein go forward to the FBI and include this in the original one of the other six background checks on Brett Kavanaugh\nBecause then it would have officially and she knows this would've become part of that three oh two\nThis rises above legislation because as we know those decisions made at the highest court Thirty years yeah this is this is going this this is a

basically a composition type poll based on all the polls\nAre in all the districts are for the house seats it's interesting to look at it but I'm not so sure that I buy that well as of right now it's

revelation was confirmed a bite testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon\nOr the other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday\nAbout the contact between Perkins ... law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground about the FBI's use of news media\nIn twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump\nThe interview was one of the most productive we've had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said\nAnother said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI about FBI media contacts citing ongoing investigation\nBy the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nA new how much the FBI and Justice Department has withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the dance the fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump\nAnd so that is you know breaking news because what you have there you have\nYou have the first person from the last administration the Obama administration that worked in the FBI you have them now on the record yeah according to John

Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the source to say he said they talk\nAnd why why would that be why would that be\nSo that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure in the upcoming days of the news want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to an air record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices this from Bloomberg now\nOPEC largest producer is currently pumping about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that just shy of the record set\nIn November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting in every single demand for barrel she said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nUh the key insights distance from Bloomberg their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again\nTo pressure from Trump\nNow we talked about this because we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil in the war yep we beat Saudi we'd be ... every other country and somebody called up and they said well banal ... prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors in a ... there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you produce your own oil here and we become a record producer of oil that's money that stage here\nWell and and you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you had the fed chairman making the comment that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably good\nAnd you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and and energy exploration and and and production is key you don't have to have you don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations only the regulations were holding us back\nThat we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nI'd give I'd give credit here to President Trump yet where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia ... excuse me we're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we funding when you're a military where we're there for you all the time mhm uh and\nWhoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia ... pact member I deal pact member [laughter] a very good deal back in the field that member right Saudi Arabia to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we've talked about when he does extremely good things we've talked about the fact that no other there was no other Democrat courses nor the Democrats there's no other Republican that could have gotten\nThe cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quickly because we talked about the new NAFTA agreement and um but every weld stops it to be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we had said look we said this a long time ago we saw one of the reasons that we're concerned [laughter] ... babies\nI'm One of the original terribly terribly [laughter] you know one of one of the reasons that we were concerned who said look eventually when this agreement comes out it's not really going to be different\nThan the agreement that that we have\nU.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like a lot like the old NAFTA mhm Mexico's only significant concession was on automobiles in parks rules requiring more production in North America higher weight higher wages for workers and potential terrorists if its exports to the U. S. exceed two point six million vehicle that even though there's a cap because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance\nThey talk to judge Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower priced models now assembled by Volkswagen miles to in a few other manufacturers in Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry\nBut they're not going to ship to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariff and it will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we upset and they said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from studying at expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments\nAre they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with South Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that goes to the limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed right\nAnd as we said all along are we there's been a lot of us\nYou know industry that has suffered because of this and you end up if you end up basically with the same deal or things that you claim are great things that can't be enforced or as we say the things that hurt the economy and will hurt lower income people well then\nWas it all worthwhile and the farmer saying just days ago that you know their their bail out that they got their government money they don't want that they

gastric a gastric surgery yes the ... the band and all that kind of stuff which I hear as much safer than having a apparently what they do with\nThe stomach is like a balloon and they cut ... much of that off and then ... and then really connected and it's very small\nThey make a poodle ... what do they do a balloon animals you know what\nA you know what I Wonder it yeah that's a very rough ah well compared to what they used to do this gastric band\nAnd I don't know the exact medical term is much safer because what they used to do literally was take a piece of your stomach\nAnd a quarter to coordinate off okay they would take and I had um a friend of mine who died two friends who have had that but I had a friend many years ago who die from this at the age of thirty eight years old ... she was about\nAnd she wasn't that huge I mean you know we we make fun of that TV show my six hundred pound why she wasn't six hundred pounds she was about three hundred and pounds but she had the surgery and what they do is they take about ten percent of your stomach\nOkay I heard they you end up with about the size of this I've I'm Talking about the old served yes let me\nGet through this because those tend to all kinds of stuff okay and I'm having a torrent of trouble getting it out with my throat hurting like it is OK okay\nThey take about ten percent of your stomach and then if it was like a balloon like get along balloon right and they literally time off ten percent of it\nThey make the rest of it non functional so your stomach\nIs literally ten percent of ...\nThat I'm Talking about was that if you force yourself to eat more you could get that ten percent to grow like ... okay well over the course of six years that ten percent grew to be\nOnce again the full size of our original stomach and she regained and went back to weighing the three hundred pound a guy from three hundred the one forty and went from one forty back to three hundred\nLike losing an entire person now think about this you take a balloon or\nJust oh just for think thinking purposes one of those long skinny balloon and you'd take ten percent of it and you're tired stringer outta and\nTie okay and then you deflate the rest of it and forget about it but then you start blowing up that remaining ten percent and you may get the same size as the original balloon so were you were done\nJust the skin around it or the membrane around or whatever's around and I'm not a doctor sure\nIs stretched thinner because it's gotten bigger right and when it got bigger the next time it exploded but\nRemember if you take ten percent of something and turn it back into the hundred percent it is really only one percent of its original size\nSo it's this is one percent of what it was it was very dangerous ... the most dangerous part now of the new modern surgeries that they do for weight reduction where they cordoned off your stomach\nIs many people after they have the surgeries have\nSubsequent surgeries\nTo help those veins more people die in the surgery that than die for the surgery for your stomach homeland guy yeah we're ride raised here and I got rather before\n\nWrong

three minutes ago at a hospital down the street do you think there is any person on this planet if you did not take the one hundred thousand men and women who worked for the FBI\nThe three hundred

know I think there's got to you know the White House that could pass that\nWhere anyone in the Catholic Church will go past I Would say no different completely out of judgment once again but I think here's\nHere's where we are I Do I I I agree with you to the point of finding someone without a past that would be suitable for the job\nI also think that the adolescent way that this that our culture

Mitch McConnell Dow took to the Senate poured again go to bat for Kavanaugh his competence and uh and really talk about as a poor into the entire situation here's a little Dianne Feinstein a moment ago\nAgreed that the investigations so should be limited we do not agree that the White House should tie the FBI's hands it's simply not credible\nBy FBI agents not only to senators lack the expertise of FBI agents we were only given five minutes to questions judge Kavanaugh\nFive minutes or every single person Eighteen people and then of course you had the prosecutor from Arizona so Dianne Feinstein isn't the ultimate delay a game I Know the people on the Web to might be saying that she did a good job because you delay the process and it was really a later time bomb and everybody's place in ...\nBut uh to me I just think overall most people don't respect what she's saying don't respect collapse you blow up the process\nAnd certainly don't by the fact that she wanted she agreed to limited and the scope they didn't want to have a long investigation Blake said I'll give you one week of all people jump way to give you one week you're not voting for him anyway senator who does not voting for many recall robust year\nCarl I just play Senator Feinstein talk about how disappointed she is about the scope of the investigation are you\nA wire we surprised that Dianne Feinstein or any member of the Senate Judiciary committee would complain about the scope of the and the time of the uh FBI investigation and it didn't turn out the result they wanted a week ago\nThey said seven of them signed a letter saying all it was three days for Clarence Thomas well they had you know Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday and that there is no cooperation there was nobody\nWho has come forward and say I can I can attest\nTo the fifth give I witnessed support to these extraordinary charges\nAnd that is true and Brett Kavanaugh is somebody you know and they're still getting complains Dianne Feinstein that didn't get all the documents but a lot has to do with your the president you work for there's things that they're still top secret and confidential right\n... right and look that's also an exaggeration\nThat's going to the president and make sure that they made the strongest powerful argument on behalf of everybody in that doctor who's advocating different options\nAnd that they were accurate and complete in prayer and\nYou know it it it may be the Democratic ministry says that the staff secretary puts their finger on the scale and as a policy advisor within hours they have a more important job which is the impartial up our to make sure that the document that's going to the president is the best documented could be regardless of what the argument is that it's making\nUsed French towns in a person you do respect who's also unhappy ... homeland security secretary there buys or to President Bush who's also unhappy with the FBI did not interview a cabinet or poured ...\nI personally don't believe as a prosecutor that couldn't have a credible and complete investigation without an interview a doctor for now I think what they are going to hear from the FBI is that they were constrained in who they can talk to buy the scope of an investigation but\nIf you take that on face value that they were constrained to investigate\nThe allegations of sexual assault that still doesn't explain why you don't intervene Dr Ford\nSaying they already have her testimony and they already have his testimony is that fair well that is fair but what what and not get out of that well you don't get out of that the therapists notes which you could have asked her for permission to get and you don't get the polygraph or the polygraph report which you could have asked her for\nAnd so there are a lot of good reasons in a thorough investigation into foster care I think I Would have had their agents back out to do that your thoughts girl\nWell I understand where she's coming from but look if the Senate Judiciary committee chairman has asked for these documents and Dr Ford's a lawyers had refused it why do we think is a ... a FBI a interview with those power that they are going to be any more forthcoming for some reason or another\nDoctor Ford's lawyer's Deborah cats uh the lead\nFran it'd be nice to have them but they're the windows FBI agents walk in to do

but but I really believe the Republicans need to follow through and they need to investigate these folks who brought these accusations anyone who testified under oath if they were found to be line they need to be punished here\nBecause this is this doesn't and even though he's on ... let's just say he gets confirmed he's on the Supreme Court it doesn't end for judge Kavanaugh just like it never ended for Judge Thomas and I think somebody needs to put their foot down and say the people got to pay if they lied they are going to have to pay a price\nWell Todd I'm inclined from I got to believe what you just said is what should happen because you look at the trauma this put people through 'em and certainly making charges like this against a circuit judge is problematic lying to the Senate problematic\nIt's a must you have proved that somebody lied and then again I go evidence I go to prove\nWhat can you do another one that troubles me the most is Michael ... ...\nThat's where sworn statement an affidavit penalty of perjury she just seems to have fabricated things under a whole cloth and then in the interview with NBC backed off them if there's any case for somebody who should be investigated I think it's that case and that client\nBecause otherwise you open the door for people could just fabricate things to the United States Senate and that's not healthy for the country or for anybody who's going to get confirmed Democrat or Republican\n... ... and and that's a fair statement ... we're going to have to leave it there I really appreciate your coming on the program\n[noise] thank you thank you for having me whether that\nAri Fleischer ladies and gentlemen uh one of the great former press secretary during the George W. Bush administration and they're good friend of Brett Kavanaugh back when they worked together [noise] it's a\nIt's a mess ladies and gentlemen it's absolutely a mess\nOr look I you know what we're ... I was going to take a break let's I Want to go to the phones because um there is somebody who is is is angered at me that this this normally doesn't happen this early in the program oh let's go to Houston, Texas David on the line David why are you upset with me\nWell I'm not that I'm Upset um I think that\nThat any even show Christian listening to you and I've grown up around them they've been close you won't live I'm not\nBut I was ten years old they spend in my life I Know you're the first evangelical Christian and I'm not exaggerating bill has ever or call other human beings I've never heard that\nAnd and what it what it makes me think is that the hypocrisy that event jolt Christians many out there that it was for arts Donald Trump man who was\nMind boggling and it's almost like when I did in those events churches look across the crowd and you kind of know sleep some dealing drugs\nOn the weekends did where are you ... what are you talking about\nHer that if any any and every church in this country and you know\nDavid you're on that and I can smell the all the way up here in New York City that's a load of bull sir but go ahead and it tells you\nAll have your astronauts yelled at your to invite your past you're on the show and I'd like to hear your Baptist pastor refer to other human beings as equal\nWell David I don't have any you know what David I'm going to go a step further I'll tell you I thought Democrats were evil before all of this mess and I'll tell you why\nAnybody that believes it's okay to killing unborn baby that's a pretty damn evil person in my estimation and yes I said damn I'm a Baptist I'll pray about it later but that's pretty disgusting a despicable and Yes sir it's evil in my book\nAnd what those Democrats have done to judge Kavanaugh and his family it's downright evil to David go ahead\nWell I mean you you may look at it that way and we may look at it as a what Republicans do and and you know for me it's of course it's it's it's like it's like all of the Christian teachers who are gay and then you find them in a hotel with a little boy\nOkay I don't know where I don't know what you're talking about right now David we're talking about judge Kavanaugh and we're talking about the Democrats intentionally destroying a good and decent man simply because of politics that's what we're talking about is that what you would like to talk about\nWell Todd I Will talk about that and I will say\nWell how would you hold on David let me let's just set the ground rules here this is my radio program we're talking about judge Kavanaugh the Democrats and I'm not sure what little rabbit you're out there chasing and if you want to do that that's fine you could do that on someone else's radio program\nBecause of what they've done judge cabin up and clearly you disagree go ahead\nWell right and I agree that uh\nBut uh if the any of those accusers why'd they should absolutely be prosecuted you and I agree one hundred percent one on print on so that they shouldn't be prosecuted anybody this happens it happens look at what happened to that pretend to be in North Carolina was that at Duke\nWith a woman claimed that she was raped and Rolling Stone to the big story yeah absolutely that ruins people's lives\nAnd it is possible that it's happening here but it would be it has to be one hell of a cook all pot for all of these people just like what Trump for all of these people to get together and coordinate ally and just like Trump said before\nThe election two years ago that those women Who Lied against him\nHe's going to sue them after they actually horse he always says that never happened ... you you're white or Republicans should have a backbone and the ... the FBI investigation out the capital is unclear whether it was incomplete or not\nShould be into the accusers who determine if any of them should\nBe charming let me ... let me ask you a question here in fact there is a shred of evidence where is it because every person that the accuser said could corroborate their stories could not corroborate the stories\nNot Well Mark judge\n... a man well but mark judge should've been caught before the committee bark judge is the person I mean normally these cases are completely he's that she said well there's no one else in the room business a case where this woman is claiming that mark judge has no room there is so get the FBI interviewed him\nAnd if they if part of this report is we interviewed march or\nDavid there were nine pages the FBI report nine pages on mark judge out of a forty six page document nine pages are more jobs\nIt's all of those nine ages that needs if\nThat includes an interview with him where he had the opportunity to verify what he had written a it as being fact and where he was questioned about certain stats and those nine pages included interview\nMan I'm with you I'm with ya and and look elections have consequences you know Obama a pointed to a liberal justice to the Supreme Court\nTrump's going to pour a point two or more conservative justices court\nThat's absolutely reasonable I I have no I'm not arguing with democracy here what I'm arguing with is that Republicans in the Arab League and particularly shop\nAlways have their finger on the scale and so if the if the if\nThis is not a case of that and this was the cleanup yeah investigation where they were allowed to go wherever the thing with them to find out the truth about these accusations I have no problem with it All right if the nine paid just in an interview with judge a you and I have no argument on that\nDay but All right David we gotta we gotta take a break here I appreciate your call a and folks again I don't I look I enjoy when liberals comment now when people disagree I I in ... but were I'm not going to let you take over the radio program if you want to do that quite get you're on TALK show and I'll be happy to call it the ...\nI'm Scott Goldberg senators on both sides of

forward and Karen Hoffman is that the Democrats and the attorneys are new walking up\nTo four and that who caused a leap\nHere's my ... my mother was sexually abused by my grandfather was sexually abused by a cousin\nAnd my two kids were sexually abused by their uncle and that doesn't make me an expert or anything but if my if any of their stories came out where they asked for it and you know my city and in the day I Would be totally her\nAnd she's like are there for\nA for Chinese\nNorthern Democrats even care where who the best story it was totally confidence\nWell it it was told that confidence Dan and that's I'm ... and that's a big concern\nUm because if she you know no matter what we don't know what happened we don't know what happened\nBut but if in fact Dr Ford went to her congresswoman went to Senator Feinstein and said you know what I I I don't want to be public I don't want to go out there I don't want anybody know what my name but here's my story if you can check it out\nThat's one thing but for then but for the Democrats to take that private information and to share it with activist attorneys and to share it with\nThat evil David and Houston evil\nAll right we've got to take a break their AAA seven eight nine nine one zero that's triple eight seven eight nine nine one zero Dr Segal says there is a medical connection to all of this and we're going to talk to him about that coming up in just a few moments stick around everybody will be right back\n[noise]\nUm [noise]\nSay oh well that's probably really screwed up well he took the money and all these people you know why don't you hear a lot of ah\nI'm of two minds of this so I Want to give you both sides of the story there first of all some people would say that if you've been through it you develop the kinds of empathy and compassion that you need to share with others who have been through similar experiences however however however you're making an interesting point here 'cause everybody that her testimony said well wait a minute\nShe sounds like an extended post traumatic stress a lot of anxiety a lot of mental health issues are they all tied to a ... a an ... a near attack really I mean really I mean it was a sexual assault right as she's telling it but nothing actually ended up happening\nIs that enough to trigger a lifetime of these nightmarish\n... memories and to what extent issue impaired\nThose early is important questions but the other question is are some some of her psychiatric issues not related to this event maybe ... maybe they're outside of this or that maybe she has\nSome concerns anxiety problems that are not directly related to this event all said I don't think it disqualifies her from from being a professor it may increase your empathy but that is an issue how how functional somebody is when we got taught starts here very nervous but a great radio host for example\nI'm not nervous I very relaxed today Dr Segal okay I I stand corrected right ... thank you for the telephone call appreciate that I'm going back to your column in USA Today\nAging alcoholic and then all of a sudden poof he became this upstanding citizen who does not have that issue anymore isn't that is that possible\nWell anything is possible but we're talking about a Seventeen year old here in high school and the whole thing keeps getting blurred between what happened in college and what happened in high school I don't know about you but I don't know that many you know raging alcoholics and high school your point is right that he doesn't strike me if you're asking me character is analysis\nAs somebody that was that went from being some kind of blubber ing alcoholic to suddenly end up as an actual predator right so so the profile doesn't fit what I'm used to seeing I'm I I I as a physician I'm not used to seeing that problem go away taught\nThat you know that you're that you're you're you're this huge blackout drink or in the next thing you know you're cooking for ... I mean I mean for Kennedy ... I'm getting mixed up with these are from the cooking for Kennedy you know he has been a really serious\nMinded person and and I also by the way don't negate the idea that President Bush forty three and his wife are now currently stumping for him because I Know President Bush and he's a pretty good judge of character and I don't think he would be it be promoting judge Kavanaugh if he didn't believe in him on the moral level\nI mean it really you know when you when you look at what's happening here I mean we've we've been talking about how the Democrats have been playing politics with this I mean these are some serious issues and if in fact Dr Ford went through something\nThat really that really cheap and see what the Democrats have done they're playing politics here and putting people's lives in danger\nWell we don't need all of this blurring of of of boundaries of memories and and and deception and and lack of court corroboration and again I Want to say again memory is fallible there's no such thing\nOvertime memory gets memories like a magnet Todd you got the magnet and things keep getting attracted to it and they land on the magnet and then the thing becomes a combination of things that are on the ... that's like memory it's not the way you thought it was\nI I went to a situation I'll tell you a great story I was on a beach in Venice, California with my sister and we he she ran into a guy she hadn't seen some are since art school she ... she ran up to him gave him this huge hug and I had a premonition that we're going to spend the rest of their lives together\nAnd I remember every detail of that scene\nMy sister does too but she tells me that I wasn't there because she doesn't need to remember that I was there she only needs a narrow memory and narrow vision and that's the same thing as someone that's attacked if a person is attack they're going to remember very narrowly the attack they may not get the identity of the person right\nDr Segal I think you've hurt for for dropping by a terrific column and USA Today how could both capital and Ford seem to be telling the truth trauma alcohol and time\nFolks I Would encourage you to check that out that we've got to take a break here we're going to get back to your calls Dr Marc Siegel working at will be will be doing medical questions next week is that All right\nI Want to know how many

welcome to the day Ramsey show\nMore than ... better than I deserve what's up in your world\n[noise] ah so recently this week uh found out that uh my wife would kinda racked up about forty can a credit card debt behind the scenes are so kind of those slap to the face you know kind of found out this week with this last weekend\nSo it's pretty pretty tough to swallow\n... so she was hiding it from you\nYeah I'm ... and I you know I Can't just blame her I mean I I got to take some credit because I never kind of went and looked and kind of a paid any attention and this is the second time so about two and a half years ago kinda the same thing and I kind of laid out a budget and then kind of slipped away from that budget and I think it was\nJust kind of rolled back into it I assumed everything was going okay but it just kind of wasn't\nOkay so you gave her a whole\nYeah yeah it is your fault you know yeah um\nAnd it's our fault on but basically she was out of control didn't know what to do and are just borrow it her way\nInto a mess and neither one of you had your head and the game\nOkay\nSo ah are you already to stop the cycle I'm show you how\nYeah a hundred percent and as a this this week and so there's a I don't want to say more\nTo the the problem with that kind of a solution but\nA on Wednesday this week I got a I've received at twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance check that I haven't put in the bank yet because I wanted to wait till I spoke with you to see how I or go attack us I don't want to I don't want to do any other dumb things I Want to continue I Want to start from scratch off the debt but I got to do it the right way\nOkay let me ask you this then I'm it sounds like you're taking ownership for having kind of a dump this on your wife and abandon her or is she taking ownership for the shame\nFact she was ashamed and so she hid this from you because she didn't know what to do but she knew she was screwing it up\nYeah and we we had a couple of conversations are ... for a church and we have some a marriage and Richmond stuff and we got to look into doing some more of that to kinda get up in fact I mean I I don't want to say I'm the the nice guy to talk to but I think that yes we've accepted responsibility\nYou know I don't know that you are necessarily hard to talk to you just abandoned her\n\n... yeah you ... your laughter out in the cold she was doing the best she couldn't she screwed it up really bad and was really a shame to tell you it sounds like that's the way it goes\nThe reason I'm asking and the reason I'm poking at you a little bit is because it changes what to do with the twenty nine thousand okay now the other possibility is and I don't think that's what's going on here but you tell me because I'm asking you it is the other possibility is a this woman is a deceive her she's alive\n[laughter]\nWas that helpful you didn't already know that the ...\nBigger fight once it goes up [laughter] you might as well have a smaller by quickly\n[laughter] so here's the thing if you're afraid to discuss with your spouse a purchase\nOr a financial issue that you want to discuss that is not a financial problem that's a relationship problem\n\nI got to tell you there's times I I mean I I have a ton of money I'm a multi millionaires times though I think I Want to buy something and I'm going to sit down and talk show and hey I Want to buy this toy\nI Want a bond with a gun she's like you don't mean not again you have too many guns already people already would think you were crazy if they know what I mean and you and I collect guns by the way so\nYeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're going to find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something but I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so you know you don't need another car you don't need another but you don't need another inner tube to pull behind the bar actually collect those I got too much too many like toys right or for the grandkids and for the kids to play on\nAnd so you know I I get ready to buy a toy and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our\nBut I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked to sharing about this she gets ready to buy purses too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys this too expensive\nBut like she says one of those purses is equal to\nOne of those guns [laughter] uh well maybe maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know isn't it funny how as adults that have the money even\nWhere there's not a stress on the finances have it a little bit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your life not theirs and one of the seven habits just talk about money even when it's hot\nIf your spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas one is you've got a broken relationship and they are intimidated by you to the\nSpouse is an arrogant rebellious immature prints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with their lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child in the grownup body and goes and buys whatever they want to buy but know that it's wrong so they hide it from you know\nMost often we find hidden that though it's the what the guy was on the last call\nOne of the spouses has been given all of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling well ends up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and now the shame is multiplied and its shame based hiding its guilty\nCondemnation based hiding so they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job handling the money\nIn which case if that's your spouse you are partially responsible does like that guy said\nHe was he on that because he should have been more involved you shouldn't have dumped this on his wife and you shouldn't dump it all on your husband\nYou shouldn't dump it all on either one of your both of you should be involved and I want to be again can carry that ministry of weight wants all the decisions are made but every body ought to know where every dollar is going pretty simple stuff\nSo you probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who has almost been on Oprah more than anybody\nOprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we could get on I've been on every other show back in the day you know I've been on a sixty minutes I had been on Larry King remember Larry King was on the air\nExcept that couldn't get on Oprah and they would call and teach us so finally they call and we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah and the very first family\nOf course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah\nWhy would I Do that because Oprah was wrong [laughter] that's what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea\nAnd uh I had told the producers I said what's partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not loving his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars if she unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy hadn't got he he doesn't know what's going on under his own roof he's freaking clueless when his relationship\nAnd so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and Dave you say that it's partially spoiled and he owes or an apology I don't think I agree with that and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology because he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand dollar the debt and he don't even know what the flips going on under his own roof\nAnd she's like well he delegated it to her I said oh this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you're delegated in business you would always inspect what you expect you would never just walk away and hold it happened you wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that this is marriage is not a joint venture God not say and now you are a joint venture you sit and now you are one\nOverwhelmed and the guys angry 'cause he's finding out he got a grand and debt that he didn't know he had and oh man they looked like a Jerry ... Springer episode or something and um you know and I'm a I'm Stan I'm making him apologized to her for not being a good husband\nBecause of your wife can run up your husband can run up a hundred thousand dollars in debt and you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life or their or psychopathic liar\nOf the two but most of the time it's you just did you just dump it on them and then and then you gripe because they didn't do it right after you dumped it on them and walked away in close your eyes\nAnd what we'll do ... well\nYou know you thought but you didn't even care enough to get involved\nAnd know what was going on and so Oprah's all upset with Dave because Oprah was wrong [laughter] didn't work out well the rest of the show what we got through it [laughter] so here's the rule of thumb then\nWe see couples who have a good marriage have been married ten years or Fifteen Years or Twenty years\nSit down and start doing a basic budget together we're every dollar has an assignment every dollar has a mission every dollar as a name before the month begins on paper on purpose every month before the month of begins a unique budget it takes about ten minutes\nOnce you've been doing it a while\nBut it takes about three months of doing it to get really on the same page and get a rhythm going we see couples that agree on their spending before the month begins on paper on purpose increase their level of communication\nIncrease their level of cooperation\nThey began to agree on their goals and their productivity with their money goes through the roof\nYou'll feel like you've got a raise when you learned through this together\nOn paper on purpose before the month begins give every dollar a name\nThat's why we named the world's best budgeting software\nThe best that for your phone every dollar of every dollar to name [noise]\nDid you know there are more than two million real estate agents in this country two million\nWhen all you want to do is buy or sell a house you don't have time to sift through ads on line or email twenty different people to find a few agents you want to interview our real estate EL peas have years of experience and are the top agents in their markets in fact\nWe recommend less than one percent of the agents in the country that's why many of our listeners have success\nWith an E. L. P. Richard in Mississippi did and this is what he had to say there are so many real estate agents today than it is refreshing to find someone like your E. L.

P. near you\nYou know how how do you explain to other people because I Know I Know what the answer is but how do you explain to other people the level of intensity\nThat is required 'cause you guys I

look where do you get that fire from was it desperation [laughter]\nHad made the decision and our heart that um we weren't going to do that and so I had um we had just individuals that kind of had the perspective that I'm living with a student loan was um you know and it was\nNormal you know it was just a mediocrity and like that was just a part of life so emotional barrier rumored for laws\nBy God so people are some responses that we got where like you know you don't need to do that or you know that you could put this into your life but we had just made the decision like you know art student loan was just so astronomical that we couldn't live with it\nAnd so and we were really we were ready and willing to do I'm told to do those zero budget you know there's your expense budget everything out every dollar had an assignment and every extra dollar went to our student loans so we were making payments like in the grand jury making payments to have your mom's\nRight we had to have a big shovel and so we put everything we had towards it and we had like zero last for like just everyday living like eating out\nGoing shopping um socializing entertainment like that did not meet our budget line item and not for our budget and so um you know the sacrifice was overwhelming and the consistency like it was really a marathon to the degree that it was extremely painful to\nLive to two years like and that lifestyle you know but um I Would have to say like during those times like\nPrayer was everything like I really had to choose and I really had to praise through um just the frustration of that type of lifestyle and really be uplifted in the spirit um\nTo really be focused and to maintain that lifestyle and she's kind of he had countless hours that he worked ... hours like twelve

Henry and I had become really good friends I Love Henry I love that book too\nAnd one of the things I grass from reading that book and other books is this\nThere is a difference between forgiveness and reconciliation\nThose of us that are wise in emotional maturity spiritual maturity\nAnd those of us that are Christians are called to forgive when you forgive you set yourself free\nFrom the bondage of the fence you're offended and when you forgive when you're a victim and you forgive you're not setting the victim\nSomeone and not be reconciled to them young lady called a minute ago and

for the last two years his wife has forgiven him and taking him back and been reconciled to him but\nNot the sister in law she didn't want to be around it\nSo here's the question at what point for someone's misdeeds do you forgive them and then at what point are you reconciled to them they're different\nGuy\nSomeone rapes you what a horrible grotesque violent unbelievably violent crime I Can't imagine can't imagine going to say something like that\n\nBut to not forgive them of eventually as you begin to heal from your emotional scars\nIs to not set yourself free from that very difficult to do I'm not saying it's easy but when you when you do forgive them you set them free but you would not be reconciled ever to someone who raped ... meaning you wouldn't go on a date with him\nYou know someone steals your wallet\nYou can forgive them but you're not gonna you know leave your wallet with them later your new wallet for them to watch over your money you wouldn't be reconciled\nWith them probably ever in that situation but in the case of that young woman she was not\nRight and uh her sister in law was wrong or brother in law I don't know how it worked in his brother in law but anyway it was ... I guess her husband's family is well understood it but anyway the the lady that the the wife is who was wrong to\nShe forgave and was reconciled to the husband as he supposedly just putting his life back together I don't mind me I did but as I like to go I don't know the guy\nYou don't know the guy well once you knew that you can always do it well you know people that I haven't done it can always do it you know\nAny one of you listening is capable of adulterous affairs\n\nEveryone's capable of that and if you think you're not capable of it you're just about to have one I mean really that's just ridiculous so at what point do you forgive someone when they've done something wrong at a distance\nLike that\nI can forgive him and you know I Hope he's turned it around and I'm not going to sit around and ring my hands and be mad at him and worried about him I Hope we turned it around I Hope he doesn't hurt her again on his wife\nI'm I can I can do that now at what point am I going to trust this guy again that's what reconciliation is at what point am I going to trust that his conversion his turnaround is real\nSee we run into this all the time when they're coaching because one spouse lies to the other one about money what we call financial infidelity\nYour husband your wife lied to you and ran up a bunch of credit cards and you didn't even know it it's hard to trust them again\nAfter that\nYou're going to stay married you're pretty well instantaneously gonna have to sit down and go okay I forgive you but I'm not necessarily going to be reconciled to you financially I'm a I'm going to watch over your show\nBeen found to be a gambling addict which happens like every week\n\nFootball betting is destroying families financial is its own be leave all\nSo he comes in he discovered she's discovered he's a abetting addict an online betting addict the gambling addict and now he's gotten treatment he's in gamblers anonymous and he's seeing his pastor and he's seeing a counselor and he's doing everything he supposed to do does that mean she just turns over the checkbook to him and let him go run havoc again no\nNo it's a matter of fact we recommend that when someone's recovering from an addiction like that that that they not have control and they don't have any access to money for a while\nUntil trust us rebuild overtime but ten years later ... should be rebuilt ten months later it should be better than it is now\nTwo years later I should be better than that it should per aggressively rebuild trust\nAnd so if ten years later you you're still or you know you have not bet on a football game again you've not lost any money gambling again or you trustworthy at that point yeah as much as anybody else isn't so we're not going to treat you like you have no\nAbility to handle money the rest of your life but for the short term yeah we are taking all access to money away from you till you prove that you can have a little bit absolutely but then gradually trust is rebuilt and overtime is rebuilt\nIf you cannot when someone has\nOn something like we're talking about here has has ... has not when when someone has demonstrated over an extended period of time that they're not entering into the negative behavior and you can't forgive them and you can't begin to trust them in that area then it starts to be honest\nDouble life adult for survivors or whatever he was doing on addiction whatever it was sound like it was all about\nTwo years is a long time you should be some level of trust rebuilt assuming it's all real now if there's indicators is not real\nIf they're still looks like he's sneaking around if he's still got behaviors that make everybody question whether there's a real then that's different but I'm assuming this cash right and if he's straight for two years then\nYou know it starts to be your problem if you can't begin to trust at that point especially given that his wife already\nShe might just be an enabler she might be\nShe might be ... and that could be what's going on\nCould be that he's cleaned up is alive and you're just suffered you can't forgive see that's the difference there's a difference in forgiveness and reconciliation they generally happen at different times [noise] generally forgiveness should come faster than reconciliation\nOf our pet a dog and it provides may\nThis is the Ramsey [noise]\nGet asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial\nNeeds that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are in your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice this

L. C. or are you a\nGeneral partnership or an escort escort okay do you have articles of incorporation that defined what happens in the event of death\nUm I'm not sure if I could find what happened to me than a dad and now I'm not I don't know you need to have a what's called a by\nCell agreement okay and it's funded by inexpensive term life insurance\nTerm okay the trivia with attorney or certain if there's a whole lifestyle has it ever goes whole lives as the only one that has a\nRetirement benefit later okay that means it as a savings element and that means it's twenty times more expensive for the same amount of insurance\nRight now you got me he's like oh when you're you know when you're sixty this is what are the cash the cash value will be yeah\nYeah and you know the next number at the end and I'm like okay so here's the thing if you spend one acts instead of twenty acts to accomplish your business goal\nOf being able to buy out the widow of the one that there's a lot that died right uh that's the business go and you spend one acts of doing that use the other Nineteen next to invest and you'll have a whole lot more money than you would have had inside this piece of crap policy that he bought and sold you\nOkay that's the problem whole life life insurance has a horrible right of return it's loaded with fees and uh if you die they do not pay you the money that's in savings that you pay the extra create they only pay the face value and so the ... the money that you're playing time for the\nMoney that you're paying extra for to create savings is all being done poorly that's the problem here\nGotcha okay that makes sense yeah I'm In I'm a new listener so I've\nWhatever it is in the whole like you know and then you go with the term ...\nOr you get term policy in place first case she died while the ball right an issue but once it's in place and you cancel the garbage policy but again you're going to save so much money doing this and you can accomplish the goal and that it's going to help you clean up your escort corporate documents by having your attorney and\nIt's not it's a one page thing but it's yeah ... and then you need to cover that with all the four of you sit down the spouses and go okay if he dies I won't be getting money to buy you out sister in law okay you're going to be out of the business that's our thing and um and if I die\nMy wife's going to be out of business because my brother is going to buy her out and he's going to have the money to do that from life insurance\nFrom the okay from this new term policy\nAnd it it has stated that that money has to be used for that\nOr that specific bought for the ... yeah yeah ...\nThat's the by cell agreement very standard stuff in a situation like you're in\nOkay awesome I really appreciate your health\nThank you brother thanks for calling him opens owns a triple eight eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money [noise] John is on Facebook what do you think of group life insurance is is a life insurance today\nUm group live insurance means that you're buying life insurance through your company that's what you would have to mean by that that's the only type of group life insurance that is because you can't buy life insurance on the entire group\nYou buy a lot of insurance on individuals you could be it can be furnished to you through your company as a benefit and or you could buy it as a part of your group health insurance or benefits package or life insurance benefits package um\nIt's okay to buy that it's usually if you are buying it Memphis Three of your employers furnishing it frees free shut up okay but if you're paying for it it's usually\nAnd the insurance world is you leave the company you can't take it with you so let's say you had a cancer scare or a minor heart attack and now you're not in trouble\nYou get diabetes now you're not sure of all [noise]\nAnd you leave that company you got no life insurance that you can't take this with you\nSo it's okay to have a little at the company but I wouldn't have it all there this is that I Ramsey show [noise]\nAll big John extraordinary things start from

to be Jay in San Diego Hi Jay welcome to the day Ramsey show\nMore data ...\nBetter than I deserve what's up in your world\nSo recently this week uh found out that uh my wife had kinda racked up about forty can a credit card debt behind the scenes are also kind of this\nSlapped in the face you know I kind of found out this week this last weekend so it's pretty pretty tough to swallow\n... so she was hiding it from you\nYeah um I and I you know I Can't just blame her I mean I I gotta take some credit because I never kind of went and looked and kind of a\nPaid any attention and miss is the second time so about two and a half years ago kind of the same thing and I kind of laid out a budget and then kind of slipped away from that budget and I think it was it just kind of roll back into it I assumed everything was going okay but it just kind of wasn't\nOkay so you gave her a all of\nThe responsibility of handling the money and you weren't involved in the money\nA hundred percent okay yeah yeah it is your fault you know yeah um and it's her fault on\nBut basically she was out of control didn't know what to do and uh just borrowed her way\nInto a mess and neither one of your head your head and the game correct okay\nSo ah are you already to stop the cycle I can show you how\nYeah a hundred percent and as a this this week and so there's a I don't want to say more to that\nReceived at twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance check that I haven't put in the bank yet because I wanted to wait till I spoke with you to see how I go attack if I don't want to I don't want to do any other dumb things I Want to continue I Want to start from scratch off the debt but I got to do it the right way\nOkay well let me ask you this then I'm it sounds like you're taking ownership for having kind of a dump this on your wife an abandoned her or is she taking ownership for the shame in fact she was ashamed and so she hid this from you because she didn't know what to do but she knew she was screwing it up\nYeah and we we had a couple conversations are ... for a church and we have some a marriage and Richmond stuff and we got to look into doing some more of that to kinda get up in fact I mean I I don't want to say I'm the youngest guy to talk to but I think that yes we accept the responsibility\nNow I don't know that you are necessarily hard to talk to you just abandoned her\n\n... year left or out in the cold she was doing the best she couldn't she screwed it up really bad and was really a shame to tell you it sounds like that's the way it goes\nThe reason I'm asking and the reason I'm poking at you a little bit is because it changes what to do with the twenty nine thousand okay now the other possibility is and I don't think that's what's going on here but you tell me because I'm asking you is the other possibility is a this woman is a deceive her she's a liar\nLet me just kinda clarified this for you there is no positive effect to your marriage when you lie to your spouse\n[laughter]\nWas that helpful you didn't already know that did you [laughter] well I'm trying to avoid it by ear you're all you're doing the cooking it up it's going to be a bigger fight once it goes up [laughter] she was one of a smaller by quickly so here's the thing\nIf you're afraid to discuss with your spouse a purchase or a financial issue that you want to discuss\nThat is not a financial problem that's a relationship problem\nNow I got to tell you there's time\nWhat bothers toy I Want to buy another gun she's like you don't mean not again you have too many guns already people already would think you were crazy if they know what I mean and you and I collect guns by the way so\nYeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're going to find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so you know you don't need another car you don't need another but you don't need another inner tube to pull behind the bar actually collect those I got too much too many like toys right or for the grandkids and for the kids to play on\nAnd so you know I I get ready to buy a toy and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our\nBut I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked to share and about this she gets ready to buy a person's too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys this too expensive\nBut like she says one of those purses is equal to\nOne of those guns [laughter] uh well maybe maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know isn't it funny how as adults that have the money even\nWhere there's not a stress on the finances have it a little bit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your life not theirs and one of the seven habits just talk about money even when it's hard and it's almost always hard\nTo talk about it keep it clean and\nIf your spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas one is you've got a broken relationship and they were intimidated by you to the spouse is an arrogant\nImmature prints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with their lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child and the grownup books\nOften we find hidden that though is the what the guy was on the last call\nOne of the spouses has been given all of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling well ends up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and now the shame is multiplied and it shame based hiding its guilty\nCondemnation based hiding so they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job of handling the money\nIn which case if that's your spouse you are partially responsible just like that guy said\nHe was he on that because he should've been more involved you shouldn't have dumped this on his wife and you shouldn't dump it all on your husband\nYou shouldn't dump it all on either one of the both of you should be involved now one of you again can carry the ministry of weight once all the decisions are made but every body ought to know where every dollar is going\nPretty simple stuff\nYou probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who had almost been on Oprah more than anybody\nOprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we can get on I've been on every other show back in the day you know I've been on a sixty minutes I had been on\nLarry King remembering Larry King was on the air and Sally Jessie Raphael you remember her with a red glasses you know all that I've been on all these different shows\nYou know everything out there ... except I couldn't get on Oprah and they would call and teases so finally they call and we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah and the very first family\nOf course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah\nWhat happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea\nAnd uh I had told the producers I said what's partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not loving his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars if she unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy hadn't got he he doesn't know what's going on under his own roof he's freaking clueless when his relationship\nAnd so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and Dave you say that it's partially his fault and he owes earn apology I don't think I agree with that and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology because he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand over the debt and he don't even know what the flips going on under his own roof\nAnd she's like well he delegated it to her I said Oprah this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you delegate in business you would always inspect what you expect you would never just walk away and hold it happened you wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that this is a marriage is not a joint venture God did not say and now you are a joint venture\nHe said now you are one and these two are not one they're not on the same page and so\nYou know the poor lady sitting there crying because she's so ashamed and overwhelmed and the guys angry 'cause he's finding that he got a grand and debt that he didn't know he hadn't oh man they looked like a Jerry ... Springer episode or something and um you know and I'm a I'm standing on making him apologized to her for not being a good husband\nBecause if your wife can run up your husband can run up a hundred thousand dollars in debt and you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life\nAnd then and then you cry because they didn't do it right\nAfter you dumped it on them and walked away in close your eyes\nAnd what we'll do ... well you know you thought but you didn't even care enough to get involved in what was going on and so Oprah's all upset with Dave because Oprah was wrong [laughter]\nDidn't work out well the rest of the show what we got through it [laughter] so here's the rule of thumb then\nWe see couples who have a good marriage have been married ten years or Fifteen Years or Twenty years\nSit down and start doing a basic budget together we're every dollar has an assignment every dollar has a mission every dollar as a name before the month begins on paper on purpose every month before the month against a unique budget it takes about\nTen minutes once you've been doing it a while but it takes about three months of doing it to get really on the same page and get a rhythm going\nWe see couples that agree on their spending before the month begins on paper on purpose increased their level of communication\nIncrease their level of cooperation\nIncrease their empathy for each other for the stress of the other ones have been carrying that they didn't even realize\nThey begin to agree on their goals and their productivity with their money goes through the roof\nYou feel like you've got a raise when you learn to do this together\nOn paper on permission before the month begins give every dollar a name that's why we named the world's best budgeting software for every dollar\nThe best for your phone every dollar value of every dollar pa name [noise]\nDid you know there are more than two million or real estate agents in this country two million\nWhen all you want to do is buy or sell a house you don't have time to sift through ads on line or email twenty different people to find a few agents you want to interview our real estate ... years of experience and are the top agents and their markets in fact\nWe recommend less than one percent of the agents in the country that is why many of our listeners have success with an lp\nRichard in Mississippi did and this is what he had to say there are so many real estate agents today that it is refreshing to find someone like your E.

P. near you\nYou know how how do you explain to other people because I Know I Know what the answer is but how do you explain to other people the level of intensity\nThat is required because you guys I mean it was not panic but you were focused to the point that you sacrifice so deeply that normal people looking at you all had to think you lost your minds I mean you guys were on your game on\nWhy look where do you get that fire from was it desperation\n[laughter] yeah I think it was a ... bad living with a stand in line with unacceptable for ... and we just have made the decision and our hearts that and we weren't going to do that and so\nI had and we had and we kept individuals that kind of have their perspective that I'm living with us getting on ways and you know normal you know it was just a mediocrity and like that was just a part of life\nIs Sallie Mae is going to be a room mate for life\nWhy do people you know arts and responses that we got where like you know you don't need

assignment and every extra dollar went to a student loans though we were making payment like in the grand jury making payments to have the results of\nRight we have to have a big shovel and so we put everything we had towards it and we had like zero last for like just everyday living like eating out\nGoing shopping um socializing entertainment like that did not meet our budget line item and not for our budget and so um you know the sacrifice was overwhelming and the ... and the like it was really a marathon to the degree that it was extremely painful to\nLive to two years like and that lifestyle you know but um I Would have to say like during those times like\nPrayer was everything like I really had to say I really had to praise through um just the frustration of that type of lifestyle and really be uplifted in spirit um\nTo really be focused and to maintain that lifestyle and you kind of he had countless hours and that he worked ... hours like twelve fourteen sixteen hour days off for weeks and months out of time um but he was just very focused and just stay prepared\nStaying in prayer to really I'm kind of meet the marathon that we were I'm experiencing\nAnd those are

tech right now in Silicon valley running the world and and and the craziness of that and trust me I I deal with it on a daily basis basis trying to do stuff have Facebook hacking thing like I don't think a lot of people understood how big that was\nOne of the reasons they didn't is it's being reported that Facebook was purposely not allowing those stories and that was on a feed\nSo stories about they were being hacked was being blocked as spam by baseball so that was interesting to me I was like there is an example of when a giant corporation can't control a message\n[laughter] this is the message this was bad towards them and they're you know their algorithms are saying oh yeah we should allow that through that spans what wasn't span that happens like\nYou're not fooling anybody off the establishment media it's not real it's not real talkative Paula mono or a tech guru we moved from there to this is what I find interesting we're going to do as we know more and more about the brain we're going to get to the point where we can\nReally understand it and eventually you know I say we're going to be downloading all kinds of stuff and you may live forever may not be in the body or in right now baby an other bodies or inside of a computer and all of this stuff\nBut as far as like violent people shocking the brand 'cause we've always tried stuff from the bottom ease we've tried shocking stuff we try to potentially shocking the brain could make you less violent\nSo a new study where they've they've brought a bunch of violence offenders mostly you know physical violence that kind of sexual assault type of vendors and\nYou know get physically violent and\nIt was really interesting forty seven to Seventy percent of people reduce their what they want or their desire\nTo express in a violent manner they were able by this bird shocking the brain it was giving them the ability it seems to readjust their thought process and ... channel the anger in a way that wasn't a violent aggressive act\nThat would be physically attacking someone says wait ... minute treatment ... what is this small\nStudy I also look at it in in how we gonna do this in in the future when it comes to things like people with post traumatic stress disorder are memories where maybe we can block it or shocking out of you as if it doesn't happen and there's a worry that\nIf you do that you may change the person that you are today but is it better doing that than living with the thing that has happened in your life\n... and sometimes maybe you want to change the person you are today did you are becoming a super depressed person or a super problematic person you're not be able to to really cope with life\nThey have seen when it comes with depression potentially twenty plus percent improvement using a electric magnetic electro magnetic stimulation of the brain\nOn depression patients so if it helps with that and that's something you know you don't want to be a depressed person and we society ... violent people running around so if you're in prison could this be somehow instituted were prisoners that are violets get this as part of their therapy before they're released from prison\nArea it's ... it's not like doing ... I'm not doing you know the bottom ... not you know and it's not you know something that would be invasive to pace and it's like ... hear for twenty minutes in this contraption that goes on your head and we will treat you for your violent behavior I think it's worth a try\nYou know what ... think outside the box ... ah and find the\nWe saw yesterday that a lot of history to fast food on a daily basis and it's become a way of life here in America it guess what the the burger people who are serving you may be leaving the touch screens are coming but there is a bad thing because what do we do ball\nWe buy more and that's the death ... for uh the the regular human service\nThey realize the McDonald's is put all these touch screens and a bunch of their stores and they're talking about putting at least a thousand touch screens or a thousand stores will be adding touch screens to him every year or they're they're trying to getting faster than a year and the reason why is\nIt is fun they realized people find it fun and because it's fun they order more\nSo once he hit that big corporations bottom line\nBurger King or Wendy's everybody's going to say why don't we protests means in here if people are gonna have fries with it [laughter] have you know the super size during an order maybe you know desserts\nThe touch screen takes the place of everything that you can't really train a person at the counter to do which is up so your food items they try to but it never has apparently works as much as it does when you're in front of a computer screen it feels like a game almost anyone edition of buying food\nA game and it's a game that's when you're sitting there and and I've I've done it you know walk into some of the newer McDonalds and stuff and a look and there's a line for me 'cause people for whatever reason to also knows there's also people are scared\nTo go into those thing yeah and it's the same thing when I go to a movie theater and there's a line and then there's two chaos that are just like people are still this fear that that somehow that's not going to give you something to get inside the theater or your food's not gonna instant possible for that tip for me to order there I got to go to this kid [laughter] and and and\nSo I Do I go from the computer do those that's the other thing still judgment do how many\nIf you're not going to judge me computer I mean as much as I Want [laughter] wouldn't that be like if you go or I'll take to double a quarter pound or if you're really really you don't like it\nBut I noticed when I go into these places are going to go to the movie theaters that people are afraid to use the touch screen like it's not real and I just go over not being bing bing bing bing bing bing and it is kind of fun 'cause I can do it myself and the whole time I get out of bed that you've made by armed\nWhich I don't think it's nice either but I Do think that a lot\nWhatever it is kind of fun I admitted they've got his animations that come on screen and you're you're ... and also it's really easy to customize yes as you can tell I'm an effigy auto or McDonald's ordering as [laughter]\nUsually systems quite a lot I can have like extra onions and are no man days or whatever just a few punches on my finger\nAnd I don't have to worry and check like you do with the drive through did they actually hear me that they actually get my order right that's right because the only thing that you hit the hits him to the back of the ...\nThat is so she had to get my I grew up and right\nIf I screw up its on me if I tell you something to screw up and I got a check all the time because I Know the chances are and this sounds horrible to say it for a lot of places around the country\nMaybe English isn't the first language and there's a there's a there's a barrier and a gap there and it's tough and oh goodness me you can just do plus you can customize and a lotta times there's things that you want and then you go up there and you're like if you're telling somebody\nYou just like okay this is how I really want it but I'll take this if you get half of this right I'm good you know that you can get the whole thing right and it's easy and it's a game\nYeah what a cheeseburger ended up putting took and I want to cookies on it we're not yeah [laughter] well I'm going to go ahead go ahead no no I was gonna

know they're talking about how much Brett Kavanaugh drinks and how much did he drank and you know that some letter came out but they they read right before they asked me a question from the you know the national association of law professors\nSaying you know that the Brett Kavanaugh shouldn't be confirmed as I said look\nYou know I'm really tired of this I'm I'm really tired first of all\nWe're all sitting here talking every night for three weeks about what's another ... says and I'm I'm tired about talk you know talking about yeah ladies who couldn't get into a State University you know and and frankly it next we're going to be talking about you know the\nThe uh the ivy league association of janitorial professionals don't think that we should be in a a conforming capital we've really jumped the shark chat this completely jumped the shark and it's really important for your listeners to know that if they don't get out\nAnd vote for the Republican incumbent house members this is absolutely a dress rehearsal for impeachment and if the if the house goes blew the president will be impeached\nFor Jay walking in the first quarter of twenty Nineteen oh my God that'd be interesting to watch\nAnd he'll take them on and it'll be it'll be great maybe they get Alister backers apologizing first thing the other day and the Pennsylvania governor's debate I don't even know why anybody would bring them in to do that but it it would be very interesting to see the way this thing works I think that this though\nSo cabinet I'm saying is really set it up and has energized the the Republicans are but will they get out there you know every between now and November you know there's more than anybody Michael that is for ever and politics and God Knows by Tuesday\nTrouble of said something something will happen and Kavanaugh will be in the back burner and by friday he'll be Forgotten Man until we hear about him again when the next session comes in after this session so it is still an attorney until the election\nIt is but let's let's let's let's walk it back reverse engineer this if you're running a congressional race and you know I I run many of them are you doing a series of six to ten to Fifteen pieces of mail that mail starts\nNext week right if you're doing TV commercials if you haven't defined yourself and to find your opponent by now you're already out of the race but you're commercials to get out the vote and move people begin next week right\nAnd if he's confirmed on Saturday the protesters and scream earth and wild antifa types they'll be in motion burning down bank machines\nAre into Wednesday of next week by then they'll run out of the paid or the money they get paid by George Soros you know maybe mommy's calls it back to clean their basement rooms out\nAnd uh and so it will dissipate by Wednesday Thursday then we only got twenty five days twenty three days that still a lifetime but then the mail comes and the TV comes and the radio comes and the phone banks come\nWe might not be picking too early I don't know that for a fact but you're right we probably could have drawn this out uh with the help of Dianne Feinstein\nWell it's going to happen I mean you know there's no way that that her office didn't leak this information and and I got nothing it's Dr Palese for it I think something happened to his traumatic whether or not it was him we'll never know because you and I and nobody else were in that room or whatever it took place at night\nBut the whole thought process of how her name got out there and how this I feel bad for it because I feel like the Democrats threw out there and I don't think she was prepared for it and and it became a you know they're just like you by any means necessary and to me I find that to be really just an awful thing to do\nYeah I I've been thinking that way too I I Believe something probably happened to to ah Christine Ford I\nBut I got to tell you look at when she took her her uh her a polygraph flight you understand but at the time she was visiting her friend who was an FBI agent right an FBI agent who she helped to coax according to her boyfriend\nWho wrote a into the United States Senate under penalty of perjury I bet she ... she she trained as a psychologist\nTo try to beat a polygraph when she joined the FBI these things were happening remember Brett Kavanaugh was being interviewed or in in in private man a classified sex session by Democrats by ... by a Dianne Feinstein\nAbout personal accusations on the same time at the same time\nPractically the same moment that Dianne Feinstein staffers were introducing Christine forward to lawyers\nThat are activists and the Democratic party so yeah I Believe that she was outed by Dianne Feinstein I Believe a staffer and Dianne Feinstein office probably a out of a leak that a wetter\nBut she really a completely a clean hands in how this came out and when it came out I don't know and they don't\nI gotta tell ya I think if I'm Christine forward I'm kinda glad I didn't have to talk of the FBI under oath\nThat absolutely absolutely a micro Kudo a former a campaign or an advisor to a President Trump a last
