who was in the building was an economy ...\nHe's and then he gets a good pep talks like you'd I joined your show last night and and I believe there was like in some insurance sound or something like that that that you played for me and I feel like maybe that was what he shared with the cowboys\nYeah no I ... and uh and he definitely had a few a few things to say um that would that I Would say are borderline inappropriate or some things that were very bothersome I'm now before we get to counter McGregor uh we were able to pull some sound this is exclusive a week we contacted Notre Dame uh we had him up we said hey give us some of your best\nPre game trash talk from the great Brady Quinn this apparently was Notre Dame against us see here was Brady Quinn several years ago\nThe garden so I I don't listen I I'm offended by it I'm I'm bothered that that's\nThe kind of language you use radio and who do the job I mean it don't jealousy I or where your cells 'cause I was back with Joe Davis and the booth that wasn't you know\nThey don't bring up that name around me don't bring up that\nPoint on the you know why here Joe you know I mean it's an immediate Joe Davis I don't think it showed

an Irish kid who hails from doubling yeah Ohio I'm but went to the home with a sham rocks and then went to places the funding out I Would hope that he could see eye to eye with another Irishman or like some whiskey\nYeah I'm telling you and and our hearts and all adjusted my last name all all call myself Joan his own knocks a if that if that will be what gets done I'll put an apostrophe in it and everything man I Will I Will completely ruined my family tree to make it happen for some free whiskey that's what I'm willing to do for the show [laughter] I don't do it [laughter] it's called being unselfish\n[laughter] um but but back to the storyline which were supported by the way a role mode doing Dallas Cowboys games it's\nIt's almost as if he thinks they know it's ... it almost sounds like it's hard for him to give a complement sometimes the deck [laughter] like it it can never really just be a genuine I was just an incredible throw or great play like if it's almost like a little bit of just holding back all the time [laughter] I Know what I'm saying are\nI Do well I think that it's uncomfortable conversation because I I've heard that him and Jason Garrett\nWeren't on the greatest of terms when they left when he decided to leave the Dallas Cowboys and apparently there was an offer on the table from the Houston Texans\nAre for him to come play quarterback and he decided against it um and he's got he's got a broadcasting job he's got all the money is ever going to need in the world and and good for him and he got out and he is relatively healthy you would think and he took a lot of damage later in his career but\nI I heard that human Garrett weren't on great terms because he was bothered that Jason Garrett didn't let them compete for the job when he did come back and when he was healthy\nAnd now you've got cowboys fans out there that have a petition going trying to bring back Tony Romano retirement because they're pit stop of adapt Prescott to play but that played okay look he's not lighting up a lead lighting up the score\nAnd that was against the best defenses in the NFL or do you think about it you tell me who do have coming in that game\nI ... I was leaning towards Jacksonville but it wouldn't have surprise me just from the home roads split the Dallas's it wouldn't surprise me and I can't trust played ... I I just can't do it man\nAnd I honestly think that it's an infection at this point because there are times where that great world class defense looks like the defensive version of Blake mortals during games and I don't get it\nDon't understand I I'm telling you it's like a plague on that team I don't in in everything you hear about Blake portals is all those guys rally around him and he really really like him but you're not telling me at some point somebody there on the defensive side of the ball isn't pissed off saying\nWhere'd you Leon Ramsey yeah like about a guy [laughter] ... maybe it maybe ... have you seen that dude\nHe's got to be on something man there's not many people on the move like that I'm going to be honest I'm sitting there with my wife and our baby and we're we're watching the games and in particular go hey watch this number Ninety One guy jump off the football and sure enough that very point end up getting a sack\nAnd she goes how like he's really fast I said you know he's been doing that the entire season like there's no one who moves like him\nUm but it is odd to see how they can go through these times I don't know if it's a lack of focus or a scheme because it did seem like today that game\nEvery single time there was a pressure there is a strain that was perfectly executed or when they gave the one on one opportunities out there you know there was a place to be made or the spread 'em out I was a quarterback run 'em when they weren't expecting it\nSo it was odd to see it and maybe that's more of the coaching staff\nAnd sons sought Washburn defend your hack it I'm not sure what the draw the conclusion too but you're right\nI think and this is the thing we should do it on the show I think we've got some pretender Z like there's some there's some I just do not believe in right now\n\n\nIn the wrong side of this\nPeople get it and understand and respect him a lot of poor or being able and willing to do give for all his life is life is good Chris life going right right there is no question Rob and\nHere's the thing ... pi any objective observer if you just cut the noise and all the emotion and look at what he's doing this

Barkley but does it prove that you can have a great running back but you still need a very good quarterback you have to have a quarterback who at least can make a play extend to ... keep a play alive

we'll get to that here momentarily on Fox Sports radio now we promised you a an\nNFL game that you were going to be lied\nTo about did we promise you that but a little bit of an audible during the break we will be getting to that in about seven eight minutes from now so stick around that is coming up here shortly before we do any of that though we do want to let you know we were brought to buy discover\nBecome a new card member and discover card will match all the cash back you burn dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more at discovered dot com slash match limitations apply I'm white so Brady Quinn the Sunday Night Football game of the week I'm fascinated\nBy the New England patriots hosting the Kansas City chiefs we know about Kansas city's off and we know about Bill Bill ... reputation against young quarterbacks and they've got extra time to prepare and all that does this game play out any differently than how it usually plays out with a young quarterback going to New England to play the patriots I think it has the potential too\nBut um a couple of things more homes was six years old when Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl think about that [laughter]\nThat that's that's the that's that's the big difference in age between these two quarterback so you'd think the side to your point of decision maker will be on the side of the patriots\nI'm Casey will be without just in Houston tonight is a huge blow air ... various does and back Eric Murray there are other safety he's not going to be active for this game um they've got a bunch of of you know younger players now trying to step up its defenses struggled but\nThey have been very good on third down so that's kind of something to watch the night to see if they're able to get off the field they're down\nAnd um and then the last things just how they're going to utilize some their personnel sorry killed tribes Kelsey a semi Watkins typically village that takes away your top two things already that maybe the case there's a lot of weapons though I'm for Kansas City when you when you think about that so it's tough to take everything away\nAnd then for the patriots you know we've already sick and push the Josh Gordon I take him and then the addition of Edelman now with rock they've kinda got those three weapons what I think you give them the edge because they're playing at home and because they're just so tough to stop right now now when they've got all three of those pieces working for him\nAnd this is going to be one of those ... like similar to the first Super Bowl against the rams where it was grind the clock out and if our defense can stop 'em at least we hold on to the football as long as possible and give them less opportunities to score\nAnd that's it would feel like that would make the most sense you mentioned the patriots dominance and how long they've been um dominant for um\nSony Michel the last time the patriots had a losing season Sony Michel was five [laughter] I had that like he was doing arts and crafts for Mother's Day like he was putting making a shell Nakhle is probably not that far\nAway by like you're you're you're getting assistance from the teacher like she's got in your hand along the putting glue on there he probably eating the glue\nYeah and you didn't want to do shit like poster boards or shells on them and you got the ... on the back of 'em um it's amazing how\nOne of the regular season a year ago right and Andy Reid and the and the chiefs put one on him and I know it's weak one and it's much different later on in the season but he was able to exploit some things with the patriots defense\nTo me this is ... it's what makes watching Kansas City chiefs game so much fun this year because Andy reads almost like an old Mason he's got this brand new song and he can do so many more cool thing she was already good at his job to begin with and I can do so much more with it and I wonder how ... going to respond to that\nYeah but I also think we saw the cancer the chiefs of a sudden flame out I mean they ended up winning six of the first seven games that are six and one right and that's that that fell apart and so I think people are wondering now right kids to these five oh we've seen this before are they going to fall apart or can they keep it going and it can they keep it together\nUh and I just think it's very hard to do with with where they're playing this game that I knew who they are playing against 'em but if you if the rest of the division I I think they're they're going to have a great chance to win the AFC West as bad as the Broncos look as bad as the raiders look of charges will be something to contend with\nA book that they've already got a a lead right now against them but that that'll be kind of the the team I think they have to look out for and then\nNow your in laws are from the Boston area ... huge patriots fan yeah uh your mother in law and I sat at dinner when I was back ah I don't know if you've ever heard of this place doubling doubling the island yeah yeah so we were at dinner and I was talking about a blow drying hair because she's a hairstylist\nRight now she would probably do a little bit more than you but you're pretty uh pretty early in the door and all that stuff\nAnd then and then add Faso the rooftop bar from what I remember a your father in law and I had a deep conversation about which is the best toothbrush to get I remember that and I was looking up toothbrushes on Google because he's a dentist or yeah or it's honest but yes I mean the same difference [laughter] I mean a construction worker landscaper same thing you're both\nBut [laughter] but\nYou've got the red Sox hosting an ... an ale championship series game against the defending World Series champ the Houston Astros I mean is this split TV Time are they more dedicated to the football what do we got Brady with the inlaws\nYeah more more football right now um I I think football kind of comes first then it's baseball after that if if it was the world series maybe different maybe trying to do a split screen but as as of right now it's the patriots first yeah it's a busy time in Boston you've been to Boston right what are you there ... all one of the best sports town traffic though Trump's not that bad\nBut what are you OK so right now I like LA is probably the war yeah it's the LA is the worst the worst place I've ever been for traffic where you could for example you could get up at four AM the ask crack of dawn and for some reason there's traffic\nAnd it doesn't there's there's no there's no reason for it but there's like a bunch of people up and someone decided to get an ax and be a jerk and it's holding everyone else\nI I hear that's why I drive in the center divider and I don't even mess around and get them to sit in that driving them above it all so I just get in the in between on the center divider and I just roll man never ...\nI'm I'm afraid to admit this people like way before this I have told you this yeah you have I Know I say there's probably are now\nWhy not who cares but if you do just give out your license plate number [laughter]\nWell no I don't really have any more it's super everywhere I Would ever I get an opportunity\nI just I I drive in the uh the colorful and admitted I say stupid but a traffic jam on the other four lanes and then there's this other lay it all they'd be outside let's just breeze than along and so yeah I take advantage\nSo I Wonder if being in the humidity\nIf you are able to recover faster and recovery is such an important part of being in shape if maybe that just plays to the advantage I think everybody has an advantage you know the dolphins go play in Chicago in January ... or December rather\nUm you know the bears without a death in vantage in that climate I just think this is a built in advantage for the dolphins and I wonder if we look into it may be similar to how we look at Denver when Denver plays early home games if you've got to start factoring that anymore because I mean the adult industry you know at home right\nUh what went down and the dolphins bears and would you like me to break it down for you\nI I Would love for you to do it but I'd like to put a shock lock on you can I give you thirty seconds is there any way to get a little bit of a like a clock or some sort of music\nOkay give me forty seven too long okay let me give you thirty okay All right I'm ready ready to go get the clock and ready to do something here we\nGo [noise] ...

the same game\nWell the best part was hum my in laws are here and so my mother in law actually had that on the bears and and I may or may not have\nPushed to wage around the dolphin show it was just down the stretch and and as soon as that fumble happened that was like that's that's probably what this game deserve this team has been so crappy back and forth that no one deserved to win like we both deserved to kind of push or at least in our debts\nOf what will you tell her I said Hi by the way a sure now I mean you listen we talk here it's what we do\nWhen you were clocks watch radio a

I'm really glad to meet someone who doesn't get hungry [laughter]\nI think that that's\nGoing to\n... or\n... [noise]\n\n\n\nAnd then you really don't know if you're the offensive line that quarterback who they're responsible for the first thing you always address and you walk into the line of scrimmage is All right if we've got to pass play\nWho did the five offensive lineman have rights typically they have the down Lyman usually the guys their hands in the dirt and then they'll have you know one or two linebackers depending on how many guys up their hand in the dirt well if you got all these guys standing up and and some of these guys moving around at some guys are are the bees that got numbers in the twenties and thirties some guys got numbers in the fifties\nYou're not really sure what you guys are going to what's what you guys aren't\nAnd what linguists doing right now circuits used a patch or homes is the first year starter is\nThey're putting all these bodies were on the line of scrimmage ended up dropping out some of those guys like they they did with the Dodgers heights our inception and then they're pressuring him and they're getting hits on him so he doesn't know where that free runners it'd be coming from\nAnd that that makes them think slower less decisive which leads to less accuracy so that's what they're doing right now so far it's been pretty effective\nSo glad you said that because I was going to say the exact same thing and that just gives you an Iron Man that you you and I do an egg on edge yeah I mean it's it's always tell people and I been\nThe more pressure in the pocket the less you've got a rocket [laughter]\nAs in like a red rocket yeah well I mean uh you know uh you know what I mean it just uh yeah it's just uh I I'm for a second Bogle is you know I'm just I I Am I'm a firm\nBeliever that if you are if you can make things messy up\nFront um it's a long road back you know what I mean that I didn't rhyme\nBut it's not supposed to run and we're talking ... here they should just fall I thought oh yeah I thought this was like one of those things where you got everything the rhyme so it sounds like no no this is I don't think people know football philosophy is not about rhyming this isn't Dr seuss okay this is a philosophy\nAnd the football culture and all I Do is spit out football philosophy it's what I Do Brady ... and those guys I Know that how do you know I don't know what to tell you\nJust what I Do All right so I I Do I Do want new um and listen I'm not here to to Robert dance on any grades here on Fox Sports radio because there was a really cute story that was going on in the NFL for a couple of weeks it was really cute I'm telling you like I even fell for it I felt for it a little bit\nUm but unfortunately we should have paid more respect and we should have listened closer to some of the great voices of the NFL in years past um because apparently one of the great voices and one of the great soundbites in years past in the NFL\nApparently they called their shot when it came to the twenty Eighteen Cleveland Browns when they said this\nWeek they were and we let them\nKnow we're not letting them off the hook the browns looked awful on Sunday that looked awful ah this was I'm not surprised I actually in my knocks locks I Know you're very familiar with that um weekend overnight radio knocks locks I Do off five picks each week and the chargers that would be going well the chargers plus\nConcerned concerned like I'm not concerned I just I think because\nThis team ended up being I don't say media darling but after a hard knocks we saw these characters you know everyone fell in love with with you know Bob ... Todd Haley and Gregg Williams and an injustice Landry and the passion and you kind of felt like you knew this team\nAnd so I think people wanted to root for them\nAnd the thought was you know after last year not winning a game\nEveryone kind of came away thinking you know any any success will be greater than what they've had and then in that tired narrative that everyone keeps bringing up as well they got more than more wins this should have the past few years [laughter]\nYeah okay [laughter] like we get that no this is a new year like huge action once more the fans were more everyone wants to more than what happened the past two years that was debacle let's move on\nAnd what what was being sold to us is this the team that can contend\nThere not a contender okay they are who we thought they were and that is a team that's more competitive\nWill be when a seven games what they've got ten games left is that right yeah\nI mean think about that they've they've gotta when um let's see if they have those games I don't know that I'm that I'm buying this team's going half\nOf their games for the rest of the year ... best\nProbably and and if it's not no disrespect to them very young team they were in their first year with Todd Haley as there oh see you know Gregg Williams in their defense has improved mightily with this team and Baker may feel the rookie quarterback they don't need to win the super bowl this year they do need to go to the playoffs this year\nThey seem to show improvement and I think they've already done that and they'll continue to do that and hopefully by the end of the season they're planning their best football\nThat's going to be able to compete with a division or that has the Pittsburgh Steelers who are probably the most talented seem in the NFL the Baltimore Ravens who've got a point differential of Seventy one points\nLike like that's not even just to put in the context okay point differential meaning how much they're off at destroying versus their opponents okay\nSo they're showing Seventy one more point to the season and their opponents that is more than Kansas City in New England combined this year\nThat's how that's how good the Baltimore Ravens had been playing so that's a scene that I don't think you know you go back to looking at that game you're washing like okay like I don't think it's going to work out later on this year for them for that matter but I think that was more of an indication of you know Baltimore and their struggles than than what they're going to be this year I think they're more of a playoff team\nObject that coverage with ... digs am eastern three I'm back on Fox Sports radio\n\nAnd the devil a college football [noise]\nWhen it goes down in your town that promise you all talking about football for paying for you is that we're the ones\nThat you get to the states Fox Sports radio sports without it will be season is here so we're getting down trees all stars\nBecause the only thing that matters is October ...\nAn ounce the asking can use tomorrow one one\n[noise]\nLike every other way and when they worry\n... and I are going to tell you about how one NFL team has already started their fire sale or so that'll be coming up here and just a couple of minutes are up for those of you listening on a podcast right now you don't hear music you just hear ... or saying something like move that body and I I'm not sure we [laughter]\nWe speak to your family your song [noise]\nI Know you pick this no man I don't think any of the music I Love both\nFor actually you know what now that I think about it tonight\nI let Aaron ... music\nYeah let me play even one elementary they also and I got married\nWhen I Love ...

I don't care he can Crowley wants I don't care what what players get emotional I don't have an issue with it like when people get sensitive and go\nBack and punched a fan on the sidelines what you do in control your anger\nShut up you're the same crybaby who slammed your hand on the steering wheel when somebody takes your parking spot and you're lazy ass has got to walk an extra five feet to get

it's it's one of those deals like people even know how to diagnose what exactly he was head budding and punching designed like at least yeah things got feelings do\nYeah I didn't I didn't have an issue with these guys guys these passionate he's out there trying to win men functional\nSide though it's it's it's always overblown um but back to the conversation in regards to the raiders okay it it just seems like the writing is on the wall you already moved the best player that private property Reggie McKenzie will ever be able to be a part of drafting or is that is that fair to say or is that yeah\nUm well he was part of I'm trying to think because he was part of the Packers front office but he wasn't he didn't have control of the draft did he\nIt wants to his pick what he was a part of it so maybe it's inaccurate saying that I'll say as far as his draft selections\nI don't know that you ever find a better talent or a guy that seems like and this is a bit of an overstatement but even though it's early I think ... could end up in the whole thing yeah he's he's got that capabilities that good of a player okay so we can say that much I think any general manager\nWill be lucky to draft a talent like him\nFair to say yeah okay so\nBecause you know they don't they're not on the hook for a ton of money after this year in his contract there's rumors of Carl Joseph it was their first round pick under Reggie McKenzie who you know it has had its ups and downs during his time there whether or not you want attribute that to his play um his health\nWas the fact is that a real folding door defensive coordinator position\nUm all those things have amounts of him not being the player they're hoping it'd be another mark Cooper who looked incredible when he first burst on the scene as a rookie and then he's all of a sudden kind of had a couple of ... what the hell's that that one alone I don't understand the ... and again I think\nThe best coaches they look at what they have and they figure out how to make it work\nThat that that's what you do like when that nag interviewed for the job in Chicago right he didn't look at ... and say okay you know I Need to get rid of this guy or he's not exactly what I'm looking for he said what does this kid do well\n... how ... what kind of off and so I Need to run and how can I you know surrounded and build talent around him it's been the exact opposite with John ... and he basically got there and it has this old school mentality of this is my system this is what I Do if if you don't fit that then you know we're we're going to move on\nAnd I just I don't think that's a way of one getting players to play for you but I don't think that's the way you become successful in this day and age I just I don't I don't think there's many examples of that in the NFL\nYeah um it almost feels like and and I know because we've got to take a quick break here in ... uh get to Steve just saying it for what you're training but I actually I don't think that John groomed and\nMay I don't think he's been wrong about his assessment of the Oakland Raiders I Do want to get to that uh would break when you're coming up next year on Fox Sports radio I'm ... so we will get that here on up I saw it right now do we go to Steve to say good for the latest including somebody at the goal line looking to\nTwenty three seven at Oakland isn't the lead trying to promote an entertainment product and they're sending the raiders overseas so\nLong man ... gotta go civil justice thought you know this is probably what England is thinking right now about the NFL and not sending their best I Know that's not a British accent that exactly what they're\nThinking right now anyway under three minutes to go to have to admit to England

... wants to be negative we've had a positive show all out you know now I'm ready to vote on the\nNegative All right so because Brady quote wants to be negative\nUm we need some some music some some Fox Music something\nTo go along that'll work so Brady Quinn is here to be the wet blanket to be killed joy to be the warm stream of urine running down your leg\nWhen you're thinking about your NFL team and whether or not they are illegitimate playoff team any possible Superbowl contender so brainy Quinn whiz away baby destroy some hopes and dreams here we go give us for any Quinn the PR tenders up the NFL through weeks six [noise]\nI I think as of right now there's a team that's three and three and you can make the case there Superbowl caliber and some aspects but there's one\nIn regards to their their office it's just it's not and I don't see\nThis and being able to overcome that and that's the Jacksonville Jaguars ooh\nI get it their defense is really good but when you get blown out the way they did on the road first the Dallas Cowboys that even makes me question their defense and that's really\nA couple of weeks now in a row and we saw a Kansas City put up thirty I Know they've got a couple of interceptions on a patch or homes but cream hot and went off in the running game he was still able to find Travis Kelsey and they were running a touchdown it just seems like this defenses even playing the same and the and the old quote that you typically hear it\nJust because they're true defense travels you hear that all the time if you got a good defense typically on the road they can still step up and play a ... at a high level and the defense wins championships and that I have to look any further than last year even though all the stats that were put up\nThe final four the fuel the game for the Philadelphia Eagles and really what gave them stability through losing Carson was going to Nick falls was\nTheir defense and it was a strip sex fumble by their defense that ended up suing the game in the end I just I don't know concern right now because their defenses and playing the same and boy ...\nI just that there's there's two inconsistent and and there's always those opportunities where he makes those terrible throws or a terrible interception that concerns me big time for the steam moving forward [noise] um I we talked about this a little bit earlier just\nIdea of the defense of some point they rebel like at some point there's going to be a time where it could be this season it could be wherever where they're going to rebel against Blake border so got me to think and rainy and I like to throw these at you from time to time periodically although it's become a weekly adventure here on Fox Sports radio every single Sunday night\nI'm reading when are you ready to play the when did they lose it on Blake portals game [laughter]\nAre you ready to of course okay because because Brady quit and just for everybody listening did college shot a week ago we did the windows open mail back um habits in game\nMelt down and Brady Quinn said it'll be before the falcons game coming up in a couple of weeks and as you saw last Thursday night there's no doubt back him had budding and throwing a one to combination at a swamp cooler on the sideline on national TV\nAnd while you were talking about what a bad look it was for the giants everybody out there it was a good look for this show because break when called a shot so\nWould you like to play\nThe Blake ... rebellion game\nYes okay so let's let's fire up the music we have a live studio band and you hear a game show music here\nThis is available to you and the idea behind the game is when do the players for the Jacksonville Jaguars specifically the defensive players lose it and rebel against played for those publicly this has to be done publicly\nSo here you're option Brady coin option one [noise]\nNext Sunday at home [noise] against the Houston Texans ... [noise]\nOption to [noise] October twenty eighth against the villa del ... eagles the defending Super Bowl champions in a game that is at ... stadium in London option three [noise]\nAt the Tennessee Titans\nThursday December six that is weak fourteen [noise] an option for [noise] every single week throughout the remainder of the regular season which of following is when the defense rebels against late for those in his poor play if that leads them to uh to to lose games that they should probably win\nSo there are five hundred see right now and they've lost two in a row so I'm I'm sure there's a lot of tension but I think they're good enough to beat the Houston Texans at home and I think you'll maybe have a decent performance as soon as you go down the stretch I I think it would take\nI think it would take something like this before that Tennessee Thursday night game\nAnd so I think it would take like a loss that buffalo and then come home and struggled versus Indianapolis\nAnd then by that Thursday night game on the road in Nashville versus the Tennessee Titans uh divisional opponent if he can't step up and give them the type of performance they need to win I think that is the moment in prime time or the frustrations come to a head\nReady to quit I'm just not this is Fox Sports radio coming up here in just a couple of moments\nRaining when they come out of retirement [noise] I I Will explain what that is your momentarily on Fox or trade I Know Brady can't wait a while before we do that unless you know we were brought here by discover card we treat you like you treat you checking in quickly on Sunday Night Football\nIt is the New England patriots holding on to a twenty seven sixteen lead seven minutes\nTo go in the third quarter a patch or homes with a long touchdown pass to start out the second happened the patriots go down the field this is this chiefs defense is there any sign of hope that they're going to get better as a season progressed as I Know Eric berries and banged up a little bit uh ... you played like he'd had the heel injury right he had he had the issue at\nThe ... and now it's like bone spurs or something that's developed from it but either way I mean he is employed so it's yeah there is hope because they could get him back I think what they're Justin Houston's back\nThe pressure in this game is probably a little bit different there's been times the forwards been able to get in the backfield but um be able to have children as Russia's makes a world of difference um and then plus you know Eric Marie ... I think once they get the full strength\nUm there there's no doubt there's there's no hope for the defense and I think they are getting better as the seasons weren't on Mitt\nBone spurs don't go away quick though those kind of lingering in that I had a bone spur in my in the bottom of my foot a couple of years ago I think wouldn't go away and it's painful you wake up in the morning and you go to step down and it's like somebody has got to switch blade underneath your foot kills so I I Wonder if this is going to be one of those\nAnd when you see a guy like that who suffered the Achilles injury and then he's got cars that you would assume that that's just over compensating right not knowing how to re walk dealing with that injury\nWell as I said you subconsciously end up you know trying to walk where it doesn't hurt like everyone everyone does that and then there's been a pain like you compensate and then you are sometimes that up hurting other things because you're compensating for what did you realize it or not or that could be part of it I'm not really sure\nYou know you can't even talk to me about foot surgery yeah every day\nSo hey I forgot about that dish probably shouldn't read about that I'm All right so a Brady Quinn um we will now uh we went out check in live as we go to the Texans radio network on the development of early round in a high round draft pick Nathan beat 'em in\nSecond attempt bills that are twenty five one back hook horse got here was one of the right side [noise] you know he's looking left he rose that way [laughter]\nParamount washed out for the right side of ... back to the left\nWhat the icing on not\nOkay uh early assessment of the career of Nathan Peter men do smart\nGoing to sum it up with the ... that I saw this that and fortunately I kind of have somewhat of a photographic memory so I'm I'm pretty sure this is the number [noise]\nShe is the only quarterback\nTo throw in nine interceptions in his first eighty pass attempt [laughter] and here's the thing about his interceptions\nThere are some like there was a tip the one that wasn't completely his fault and by the way they were in that game because I I think he came in did pretty good job\nBut man there's some other interceptions he throws that are ... I mean I it's it's an ... of the nine that he's thrown I think there is at least three that have been picked sixes like their directly resulted in points where the other team maybe even for it's just been really really ugly and\nIt's a it's it's crazy to think that they signed aging mature\nGonna make like five hundred grand or something like that um there wasn't a ton of money or in in the context of what he was scheduled to make but I think the bills paid him like four million bucks and decided to trade them away and so I think these are now and the raiders there on the hook for like five hundred grand just the rent tend to practice\nAnd you'd have to think he would've been a better option and he's been in the NFL longer so he would have been better to work with Josh Alan\n... and stuff like that mismanagement in itself is mind boggling modest the fact that they continue to keep giving them opportunities ... I'm not it's not my boy did so at least he's there and maybe they can go to him once he gets up to speed with everything\nI'm ... and also this and you pointed this out of a few weeks ago you said man I just hope that uh Josh ... can get through the season healthy um we're not even halfway through you already got banged up in the game earlier and I wonder if at some point do you think\nIf ownership is investing in a rookie quarterback like that and and they moved up that high to take him he didn't get any point during this process maybe they ... Germany until we get somebody to protect this guy\nUm we're not going to risk damaging his career like ... that has happened to some other quarterbacks you take such a beating early on that their shell shocked from it and and you don't know how he's going to respond I Wonder if if at any point that decision is made from a top\nYou know why because it's just you're probably more cognizant of that in fact than most some NFL people are because there's so many there's so many gum narratives and people out there who say well who would read if you can't handle the pressure you can't handle the physicality of the NFL that he's not going to make it anyway [laughter]\nThere's so many people who say that I'm like okay like come on or we are we really going to make that argument like do we really think that any of the all time greats\nHad God awful offensive lines I mean do we really want to like try to look at like they're off at one of the Buffalo Bills I think any quarterback stands a chance but that's how ignorant most people are like most people make that are you\nMentally tough enough to actually make it one day like people say that stuff because they've never been there and they don't get it and they can't relate\nUm I also think that you know for ... even though the minutes the playoffs last year the walk hurts him in him and Brenna being on the same team right I mean they they both came from Carolina that was their background I think they're they're both a kind of a of the same mind and and thought of\nWe trade off the draft this guy we want to see what we have in um we want to plan and see if we can overcome some of this stuff\nAnd they probably feel like some of the experience is good or even though it could be detrimental to the future but that's how most offensive by the coaches are I I don't think they know how to manage the quarterback position very often\nOr did this whole look we need a guy a ... this is the NFL it's tough to get out there we want somebody who can handle the pain you know what like standing in front of a train doesn't make you a bad ass it makes you an idiot right so just because he's out there taking a beating doesn't mean you're going to toughen him up\nWe've seen this happen to other quarterbacks in the league where they get out there and they take a beating early on David cars a perfect example\nI look color got crushed ... early on when he was in Chicago they they couldn't protect the Mike Marts had to take the seven step drop out of the playbook because they couldn't protect him\nBecause there wasn't enough time there I just think at a certain point\nI don't you have to to to look at this and say man even in a quarterback safe league like that it's turned into now we can't keep this guy healthy and he's a big physical player if you were an average size player elastic the entire season they're in Buffalo you know getting crushed\nNo chance and ... and that's where you kind of look at what they're gonna do moving forward them and they they better get to running the football I mean they they better really try to hone in on being able to protect him a little bit\nAnd and even their defense for that matter like like if I'm Sean McDermott I'm I'm trying to run the football to shorten games um to to not wear my defense out\nSteaks anyway but it's a it's a tough situation to be and when that's the case because this I I don't know what the expectations in Buffalo and the fact that went the playoffs last year [noise] um what what do we need to think that maybe that is the expectation around there but it shouldn't be because that's not the type of roster that they have\nAnd I think they've already exceeded expectations with being able to win a couple of games this season so far\nThe well we do have a special request that has been sending guy writes in and says hey Brady in fact I'm going to give this guy is full credit to give his Twitter account on the air because of this request I'm ... and I are so are you ready for this brings you ready for a request like this\nAre sure you know\nThis guy writes in his Twitter account is at bills mafia three two three three\nHave Brady bills fan here make it come back and play for the bills mafia you could have your arm in a sling and you would still be a trillion times better than Nathan Pete Herman worst quarterback ever\nIs Nathan Pete I'm In the worst quarterback ever won an Brady are you considering his offer to come out of retirement and played for the Buffalo Bills\n[laughter] always always consider the are the offer to play football game but as I said before they just signed a my buddy ... and we're together in Cleveland he was with Brian table there oh see I'm that one year two thousand nine with him so he's got a little bit of a background with the fence and and they're he's a good chance you know honestly if if the egg it's in there I think\nHe would do a good job and he'll do a good job kind of help and mentor Josh Allen [noise] um what was the other part of the question\n... two and a half\nTwo and a half interceptions I Believe case genome hit his interception total today from compared to ... ... ... that's the Thursday night came cardinals wrong yeah there's I I forget what it was not a game but they've not there is a little string here where they're definitely not as good as they have been the first guy I think it was like the next three\nOh man why wouldn't the NBA open up the season on that night and I'm Sorry I Know it's a Fox game but man that's that's these are so much for\nJust burning burning the network that I Believe a lot of it I said I\nWatch some baseball meanwhile fs one's got the baseball package and you can see Brady fs one every weekend you just said you'd rather watch the NBA central\nYeah but I'm not on Fox men fog or they don't want to be on TV okay everybody likes me ... ... what sort of on\nA ... I don't know what do I know the Celtics open up on Tuesday night there never mind we're not talking to be here is a football show All right so the over\nUnder as you might have interceptions guys\nCase keen them and Josh Rosen\nSeparated I gotta go through the playbook here I've got the cardinals playbook here I'm just look at all kinds of these or if you go ahead yeah uh you know looking at some of these are ...

I'm reminded that everything we thought we knew the week before it can be shot to absolute you know what and the NASCAR terms done blowed up the following week I I don't I I don't even know how gamblers do it I have no idea how personnel executives do it\nAnd then you see teams like the rams and the chiefs and I guess you do the patriots in this makes too or any\nThat just make it look so damn easy how is this how do they have this figure it out and the rest of us don't\nDoubt that don't forget about they made it look so damn easy today did they not or what\n... well okay so\nLet's put this at the top\nOf my help me figure out the NFL and why are we trust go ahead and the ...\nThe two weeks ago you had a new wing or you had in Miami topping New England on their way to the super bowl yeah there's no stopping the dolphins they get destroyed by New England they bounce back that following week up Seventeen to zip blow a Seventeen zero lead Seventeen zip\nTo the Cincinnati Bengals and lose going away might I add going away in that game ... then then after getting rolled in those two games they go out and beat everybody should pick to win the NFC North\nWith their backup quarterback in ... ... ... obviously an arguably a game that they had the most critical air you could possibly have Kenyan Drake fumbled all his these folks\nHow can Miami look for in up for two weeks and then come out of the Chicago Bears like that today how\n... what they were showing up against Cincinnati member was Seventeen three going into the fourth quarter so um you know they could do three quarters of play let's give them that in the Chicago game was back and forth it was just a tremendous game out there and\nUm when he fumbled I just I'm like oh my goodness that was the game they ... they get a touchdown they're all you have to do was fall in there and they get the touchdown and they win the game that that was incredible that have the right there on the half yard line they couldn't get it back and I'm thinking oh my goodness they're going to go on Chicago's got to go on to win this game\nOkay if you don't want to get into some ethics here but I did that you're standing up for your guys had had a Seventeen three lead heading into the fourth quarter but when you get out scored twenty four zipping set for them to those were picked sixes so that makes it oh well hey that's fine but if they're just pick Sixers\nDo you feel about that I mean jeeze one was one of the guys helmet bounce right to somebody you know ... so city oh okay well that makes it fine I mean I don't know why but I look up to them on where you know\nI already submitted my vacation time so I could go see them in the super bowl and when they lost two of the road the buses going you're not going to need the time off the fact that they want today I'm going to read submitted what do you think about that\nWell I can I just clarify because I I Do go back and listen to our old shows I don't know if the boss pulled it back as much as you did Arnie because you were already off that bandwagon our five I Believe\nBut kudos to you first sticking with him so then then okay so that's the that's the Miami Dolphins image weak the weak link that we have to try to figure out every single Sunday night\nSo help me understand the Dallas Cowboys helped me understand what the hell's going on there how can this team not have three off sensitive touchdowns in any of its first three games and then they go out and put forty\nThis was just about the counter McGregor mojo it didn't work for him in a cage it worked for him in Dallas but in all seriousness I mean are are are are are they good I\nMean I I don't know how that press God's going to continue running the football or get clobbered out there to he passed for under two hundred yards so it's not like he's carrying it up they had a good game they scored many different ways he had a good game\nThough the statistics don't show it uh Jacksonville defense not very good today but I'll give dollars credit I still don't think that ... got a quarterback going into the future\nSo let's just kind of similar on that for a little bit you're going to hold it against jak that he didn't have over two hundred yards passing buddy rush for eighty to him and I let you can't rush\nCurse or is it that he just racing better competition during the regular season 'cause you face a lot of third fourth and his daughters that good so you're a pile up numbers instead to get those guys and then in the playoffs those guys don't pitch during the bullpen and you know what I mean they're not starting a playoff game\nAnd you're listening to the odd job well when Chris Broussard Enron Parker about that we said that seven pm eastern for be emphasized it back on Fox Sports\nStrike up a band\nAnd let your school colors cry\nFalling through your speaker [noise]\nThe blaze breakdown I'm telling you my bold predictions for college football this year I had all the

Kansas City we're not it now\nForty as we go to the two minute warning softening plank on Fox Sports radio ... by the discover card we treat you like you'd treat you everything I plan to get into this segment on I don't know if we don't know if we really have the time because\nI don't want to throw it in another way to rub riggleman skewing my my kiss a deathbed for crying out loud did you watch about box to that yes yes I saw his nickname\nYou gotta you gotta go file some sort of trademark without Arnie or stop getting your picks right and then that way you won't be the kiss of death I think\nI Need to go on the TV show with him and we go battle back and forth to see who gets more wrong him or me we pick is not winters\nHow did you do last week we got to start keeping tabs yes I did I'm sure I did very well okay well let's just say you win a six an hour with all your picks last week so take that Robert\nHi so I I again I I have no idea what's going on whenever you know this is this is like a big twelve game it it really is this even though the big twelve play a little difference this week but I\nDon't I don't know if it's if it's just because they're that fast or if a New England suffers that much in a secondary but after taking what appeared to be a pretty safe forty to thirty three lead\nThey absolutely leave tiring kill wide open I mean aren't there was no one within boy ten Fifteen yards of him and he takes it to the house for a touchdown from what was that Seventy or Seventy five yards out unreal\nYou'll you'll like this too is is a guy out there locally uh I had a choice of what should I carry the patriots chief's game or the red Sox game against the Astros in ...\nSplit and put one in the ... when he did that but that's going on in the ... but that I Wish I Would have put that out yet but we know that football ratings are king Supreme for sure\nYeah so help me figure out what happens here with two minutes left you're sitting at third and one yeah for the ... or ... excuse me New England\nGo there they'll go for twice I don't care if they're on their own thirty four I'm you know it's this is the day of will go for it on Fort down so I'd be surprised if they tried to throw the ball I Would rather twice maybe go with the quarterback sneak\nThey'll run down the clock when the chiefs only have one time out I Believe and they'll get in the field goal Rangel try to win this thing by three and remember we got the three and a half of those of us like Kansas City is all those things in forest like\nYeah this this and you got back when you said\nOh it's going to work out for Kansas City had they gone for two they could be up by one now but then again if they miss that they'd be down by one you're thinking of this purely from gambling prospect of our as the finals forty thirty nine or forty one forty or if they if they would have missed it would have been forty thirty nine\nAll right so the patriots will keep this drive a lot\nI again we've had some good Sunday Night Football games last week wasn't necessarily the prettiest game\nBut it did go down to a a plane over time this week has been similar to me on this Sunday night to what we had on the opening Sunday night between Green Bay and Chicago there hasn't been I mean think about this this game was twenty four to nine and a half and\nNew England had done a pretty good job of able to harness Patrick my homes\nAnd let me get a touchdown pass in the first half and they ah they picked him off twice and now he explodes in the second half yes four touchdown passes in the second half he's\nOver three hundred yards passing he's at three fifty two right now uh but they could be in big trouble because New England is driving right here even though Kansas City has now our house scored them thirty one\nFans because you've been eating for years this is the recipe to lose in the first round of the playoffs or if you happen to get a bye week who is in the second round of the playoffs when you of all a fence and no defense and it's the data drop ins goes missing this is how you lose in the in the first of all of a hole playoff game like Kansas City so used to doing\nFirst and goal New England sorry for bally a he's a our intern who's backing the Geico Fox Sports radio studios trying to keep tabs our feeds a little bit ahead of him but what a perfect touch passed\nFrom Tom Brady to Broncos one on one with the safety again and it's absolutely owned that match up all game on ... will have at first and goal from\nWhat about the for your line is where they mark 'em down already I think it's right on so you're in a nine year old ... or like take you I got a little bit of a head on my way there and that\nYou guys yelled and I wish you could've saw a Bailey [laughter]\nSudden less [laughter] before it even happened because you got up David because of pages of the ball so [laughter]\nI sometimes this this maybe shows you how I might be insane but sometimes I'll have a fee because I'm a direct TV subscriber Arnie\nThat's a little bit behind what Twitter is and I'll go ahead and refreshed Twitter so I Know if it's something good or bad that happened so I can watch it because if it's something bad which most of today was for the Oakland Raiders yeah I I won't watch it at all so Bailey\nA un I spirit animals here uh down the stretch but um what part of today was good for the raiders absolutely ... absolutely not which will get to right after this came wraps up already I think you and I I don't know ... you carry two teams\nIn the old ... chart I only have one I don't know what to do about the raiders right now except for crumb dropped the giant rain this year so you can forget about that\n... oh we got to go for the good a good job you'll pick 'em up when they are ...\nAbout the mentioned they decided to move the ball over to kick the field goal I'm not so sure that that was the right move when you have what Seventeen Seconds left you a three time outs maybe try to get in the end zone instead of relying on a on a chip shots you go but you never know what's going to happen in this situation\nRight so instead of deciding\nIt in the hands of Brady they'll put it in the hands of their veteran kicker Steven got Kowalski here\nWith three seconds left in the game it is a virtual ship shot field goal yeah but it's only said craziness can happen Andy Reid Noshaq here is out of time out\nAnd the chief sorry twenty eight yard field goal attempt away from losing their first game of the season as we get ready for the steam to say gr update to snap is good to kick is up at\nThe patriots\nWhen I was just enough for daily so ah [laughter]\nIn all honesty Arnie this a hell of a win for the New England patriots I Know that people are going to dump all over the defenses here tonight and how New England could possibly you let I re kill get behind him with three minutes left in the game for a Seventy five yard touchdown reception which is absolutely ridiculous\nUm but I mean you're able to hang in there with one of the gun slinging often says and\nI think you're on to something ... can I say I look I Want to start looking to make a move to improve maybe the corner position or bring in another pass Russia at the trade deadline\nIf you think that the patriots are going to put a forty three points on the board on anybody else that's going to happen that goes to show you how bad that Kansas City chiefs defense is it's\nIt's just horrible and and you know the patriots I give them a lot of credit they played the perfect game they had the temple a Brady was was damn good twenty four thirty five for three forty did have that one fumble ah which costs are caused this team seven points I thought Sony Michel was fan\nAnd when they get on the road or if they have to play Kansas City on the road we'll see what happens\nSo you just said you know they've they've ... thirty eight in their last two games they scored thirty eight against the dolphins do they scored thirty eight\nI didn't get the dolphins would be dumb but never got off the bus stop it\nAnd if you're going to say well they're not going to school at forty three again yeah you're probably right the only thirty eight the last two weeks so I dug it I mean I Love these kinds of football games I Know the defense of purists out there will bitch and moan but a big win for New England tonight\nHow can you make sense of teams that get\nDestroyed in one week come back and do the destroying the following week teams it started out to window and suddenly are getting smoked forty to tip at one point and the teams that can't even put three touchdowns and the board suddenly exploding like we saw in ... I don't know Dallas today Arnie how do people ever make money gambling honestly\nOne Carolina has no Russia game whatsoever I expected so much more in the Christian McCaffrey I mean\nJeeze I where's the running game with them to camp Newt and has to be a lot more consistent than he is and you can't put it all on him\nBut you know I watched a lot of that game and and you know he made his share of mistakes plus he got up to a real slow start that we had six points in the first happened they got behind the eight ball was Seventeen the three so are you excuse me Seventy six so he's got to be a lot more consistent care a lot to get by people like that\nWild day the patriots win of course in this crazy finale\nTo the week six Sunday knocking off the cheese forty three to forty on Stephen got ... game winning field goal this season there had been three games were both teams have scored forty or more points three games already in twenty Eighteen we're both teams have scored forty or more points\nFrom two thousand fourteen to two thousand Seventeen are ...\nThere were only two so the ... load up in the NFL we'll talk about that much much more including your tweets I've completely ignored you already has this well for the first forty minutes of the show let's get after him next to Tony and playing on a Fox Sports Sunday\nWe'll [noise]\nThey're making them play\nWe're breaking it all the only one team in the NFL and its on watch of buffalo\nBut he's got to do is drop off the dry cleaning pickups to melt\nHere's an idea let's that save hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything all you have to do is go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance\nThat extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding to do that you do today\nThat's when the Michelin Man is on your side helping you sleep better and Dr Saper new Michelin premium ...\nDesigned with exclusive smart ... bean to Michelin blades flex to the curb of your which giving you unparalleled street free long lasting ... performance\nSo when the going\nMichelin ... it's a different you can see a billboard Walmart and then on her mind retailers scams [noise]\nTo Halloween themed events will be held back to back Thursday October twenty says the cello city park the slightly spooky trick or treat trail for boys and girls ages tenor younger it was a chance to address in costume and walk a half mile portion of the trail with a few spooky scares and lots of treats along the way\nThe trail begins at the senior field concession stand up six PM and ends of the old civilian\nParking lot next to the basketball courts for the most convenient tickets may be purchased in advance for three dollars at the parks and recreation department of shallow city hall or the family aquatic center the second event is the chilling terror trail haunted house done trail style for youth ages eleven to Seventeen\nAt Seventy I'm at the senior field advanced it gets there three dollars each and they're available at the\nParks and recreation desk a shallow city hall for the family aquatic Center for more information called five three to four one tourist\nYeah I mean when you're insured windshield replacement\nDollars in cash and delicious donuts White Mountain donor two wonderful launches a White Mountain cafe to automate dinners at Los ... that smog you'll also get a dollar and you can use a ...

Kansas City deep and they're\nThey're just future de remember now the patrons don't have an up and nearly as good as Kansas City and look how many points they put up I I Can't wait to see you next week when the patriots go up the road the Chicago after Chicago wants to Miami and see how that game turns out\nWell here's what I here's what I don't get is how can you get better defensively now Eric berries going to be back for Kansas City that is going to help them out a little bit but I mean do you look in the trade market\nRight now I don't eat so much in personnel I just thank God you do things differently Kansas City I'm not so look it up and I'm not a defensive specialist Chris ... that's more your thing\nBut I've got to start questioning that three man rush you know ... even though it turned out fine one time because Brady fumbled on one of them because I Know the guy came in lady at like a million years the do that but in the NFL if you don't put pressure on the quarterback\nOr you're in big big trouble whatever the three main Russian I don't think it's going to cut it I got to find a better way to get to the quarterback\nWell uh let's see we've got so much still to get to I I did have this because I did feel bad\nDid feel bad about saying when do you get to celebrate your team's victories last hour or so so I did drum this up for your knee for segment\nHere the forty seven day are\nWanting to believe all\nHer off your toaster I Can't take any\nPretty good call them ...\nThis was eight again we're both teams had the game on the bears were up by eight points and they just scored a touchdown it was taken away because of a penalty matter of fact they might have done it twice I don't remember off the top of my head and the next play the dolphins intercepted uh that's what it was Twenty one Thirteen they come down to score and gets\nCame down and scored another touched the glove twenty eight Twenty one\nAnd that's when their defense believe it or not let him go back to not have a good game I don't think yet any sex and this one so I got to give the dolphins credit I'm bumble on the half your line that just rip my heart out I go out of your fumble and the half your life when nobody touch do it goes to show you I'd rather be tired Frank or running\nThat healthy Drake or anybody else out there are so familiar you liked that one was unbelievable and bad play by Chicago by running on third down and setting up a fifty three yard field goal\nYou gotta get closer you can't just be settling for that that's what they did he missed it and dolphins were lucky enough to get the last second vehicle Chris\nHow are you what you're saying and and and that to the core of it I agree with you the man Mitch Trybulski made some awful decisions that really could have ended up costing Chicago even more he threw across his body twice one time he should have been picked off the language right\nNow for a touchdown is that what you're talking about yeah\nExactly yeah so so my thought is yeah I agree with you a hundred percent you try to throw the football and go after it but on the I don't know if that nagging has as much confidence in Michel ... in that situation right there based on what he had done throughout that game but yeah but I mean like I said when he may want to\nGo with those are shoveled paths or something like that a little screen or maybe you decide that has it off and roll out and see if you could pick up maybe three or four yards yourself or you got to do something instead of settling for fifty three yard or on the road or any pushed it just right\nYeah uh and you know what here's what's crazy um it I didn't realize 'cause I was we got the end of that game and then because of this stupid I was\nOn a switch back over to the red zone channel at that point\nMy gosh so if if you're in a market that only had the early game on Fox you got that a first missed a field goal by Chicago in overtime then as soon\nAnd I understand the rule is you know if you only get one game in the market is how it was described to me on one channel then they have to be off the air with games by the time the other game starts on the other networks still though only why can't commonsense come into play on why do\nWe even still have those rules how about if we went back Twenty years ago when we had them or even less than that we had the blackout rule could you imagine that it was at work it out on a ridiculous absolutely ridiculous without or or yeah I'll go see if that would fly nowadays\nBy the way uh speaking of the blackout rule just to show you antiquated TV rules I I broadcast from Norman, Oklahoma we're considered in the home market of four major league baseball teams so we have essentially for teams that if they're not being carried by their regional network or blacked out so I mean do you do you want to talk about you want to talk about antiquated blackout rules\nLook at what's going on I didn't know that that wow yeah\nBut I digress ... I didn't realize I mean again I Know as you like to say uh give me but I didn't realize that was a funny ... having the order to win the game on you by no stretch of the imagination was that it gave me for the dolphins kicker and if I'm not mistaken\nA it's not as if everything had been peachy for him so far this season either for Sanders even though he was three for three on the gay and he had to I mean right oh yeah he he's had a good season he came in later in the season with them but oh my goodness what what an incredible kick for him nearly at that fifty yard range to end up winning the game that's clutch\nNo it was it was obsolete because there were lucky to even get it that far they picked up a big purse down\nUm by a by Drake who would follow the ball um and by the way what did you think about brought us why or not too bad twenty eight forty four three eighty three touchdowns I'm not too bad at all young and Mary gave the dolphins a chance to win didn't create too many mistakes out there I I got to give him a B plus for his efforts\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHad seen the whole county's are currently recruiting volunteers for the medical reserve corps a national organization that responds to disaster volunteers will receive retraining some of which may provide continuing education credits if you're interested in becoming an MR see volunteer what the potential to deploy to local community disasters\nAs far as ...\nOn the top and one of the six twenty seven letter Saturn\nCold front diving on to really have a chance for ... hours in the forecast\nTemperature settling to the mid thirties or maybe some wet snow mixing into there is a mix of rain and snow early nine day than all scattered ran into the afternoon on all things that makes the sunshine to use the heightened your safety better chance for isolated shower three hundred storm on she said honey ascent shining times at our high right it takes some time [noise]\nI Need a year out which is Jennifer narrow more hot I talk a lot of the six point seven\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMhm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMhm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMhm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMhm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach child will receive a monster kid unfilled items to create a personalized lobster hands up and the monsters box they'll look good they used to enjoy watching these G. rated monsters Inc computer animated fantasy it deserves to be there will be a photo\nOf the capital of the kids are walking on the common sense you\nBring up like in LA just spread out on them for holding shows will be available for those who prefer sitting the causes three dollars for a child adults are free and registration is required in advance by October twenty six show law city hall\nFamily aquatic Center for online as activity are easy for more information on line three to four one or zero are you sure\nThat will last for their lifetime and you'll be cautious that the court appointed special advocates for a foster child go to cautious of Arizona dot org or ... at least five to four four one three five for Napa County or react to four or five well one one a for Apache County\n\nNeed hats shirts or jackets everywhere I did when your logo Voyager products from little bluebird studio that's right the company that does the best jobs green printing T shirts and holding now offers employed\nBloomberg studios there's a local company was ill designers that care about your company's image and brand\nCalled little bluebird studios today nine to wait three five one Seventy nine forty to go on line that little delivered dot little bluebird studio the company that care\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMhm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nYou're sixty four year old joke once the record\nFor Sunday's are seen Holly though for those of you don't know I also\nAnd on another network show now also had my own successful local shows in Los Angeles including on Westwood one's affiliate in Los Angeles seven Ninety K.

those on the left and those on the right\nBetween those who want limited government and those who want government to run much more of our lives\nBetween free market capitalism which has various names and socialism or even worse communist there are definitely people on the left who favor communism between those who see the United states as a force for good in the world and those who see the United

caucus committee you got people who are at the polls who know it'll take a look at you know all of ... you know and they see how people are voting\nAnd I've noticed that you know white looking for records that for some reason my grandfather and grandmother and my mother all voted for Obama twice even though they die before\n... did you report it to anybody do have tried to take some action\nI did and it's just that you know it it was kind of like a yelling at a stone wall\n[noise] they weren't willing to ... [laughter] yeah no this\nIs a real problem with voting integrity in this country was known for years that people in Chicago people voted in Chicago but now across\nThe country there are people voting in your case you twice they voted for Obama I mean if you don't have integrity and election system anything could happen it's amazing when you look back on it that Trump won that Bush won because I Believe that we're finding that kind of fraud that uh people who wrote in in California you you know\nWe've got a real problem when the you can trust the outcome of the election\nWell the thing is is that power to the Lincoln county Republican caucus committee changed\nHere in Cedar Rapids was that we got a whole new Patrick people in a whole new batch people actually interested and say I'm going to make sure my assault it's actually counted\nAnd so they have all these younger people who says I Love this idea I'm just going to make sure that this guy over here that I don't trust is being equal\nAnd that's how we changed from eight Democrats city to a Republican city in this last election\nWell that's good so there's still some good news even despite the fraudulent voted by the way that doesn't take into account illegal immigrants right\nIf illegal immigrants are voting and that's my whole point that's another topic if we ever allow illegal immigrants to vote Republicans aren't gonna win another election or at least nationally a ... in our lifetime ... there's no hope would you let people vote who aren't qualified or are not citizens of United States\nYou brought up a great little election\nI actually got to get her ... got a little something there ... there [noise] okay it's all depends on how you treat the individual\nIf you treat enough people who may be here illegally but are contributing to society you know 'cause I worked you know many a warehouse temp agency jobs where there are plenty of illegals that were working\nBut as long as you were treat them like human beings that not you know being angry because they're illegal just realizing that our system itself for so long that we know integrated at people\nBut because they are good to us that we are good to them [noise] maybe the idea that illegals would probably vote Republican is not out of the questions\nNot the problem is it's yeah it just because it's tied to want to get on to our topic necessarily the problem is\nIf you don't have a a way of entering the country legally than your sovereignty your borders me nothing I mean there's a big topic I don't want to go into you know I certainly think people should be treated well but whether they should be allowed into your country is another issue you have borders where you don't\nBut I don't want to open up that you were just right now uh you know it it's bigger than just a few minutes ... is not a matter of treat them well in fact I\nDon't even know I teach at night and many of my students may not be here legally ... the great people that's not the point I fault the government for not having a system that makes sense for all of us that's the real issue\nAnd speaking of issues let me know what you think at eight six

about\n... book of how you deal with how you deal with with his the rules for radical shade\nBeing the main student she put it into the says there is only the fight and this is what she is causing today with all the vandalism you spoke about New York city with the uh New York Republican club being hit\nWith vandalism and broken glass this\nIs all orchestrated then promoted by Hillary Rodham Clinton\nBill I don't I don't know if it's all orchestrated by her because she laws if you'd done such a great job but the fact is you're right the certainly the playbook Solomon skin and Obama followed that\nAnd taking over the young right the so they get a doctrine aid for the most part and he knew if you capture them when they're young you'd have them for a lifetime and that's why the nice guy a forget the last call his name but the idea that the you know if you're just treat illegal immigrants well that's okay 'cause they're good people you know we know they're good people but that's not the point\nYou know what I often say for years I've been saying it's amazing it's not amazing that these students graduate and they're on the left\nWhat's amazing is if anybody goes through our school system has come out as conservatives\nAre they just don't hear the other side they never hear our side actually when I think about I'm pretty optimistic that we could win elections after all that indoctrination because eventually you get a paycheck Missouri whoa wait a second\nOne is the government taking all my money what I don't agree with this stuff right but they've got to grow up they're going to get out in the world and they tend to be a conservative\nBut I Want to know what you're thinking I don't I don't want to be unfair to anybody you know I I think there's a civil war going on in this country the second civil war between the left and the right battling\nLower military it's funny in that sense they want less of a military\nAnd ... again they don't even believe this American exceptionalism that there's something special about this country how can ... go to a you know Berkley and not let people speak or black lives matter when did that start\nAs I mentioned Alan Dershowitz who is a big Hillary Clinton supporter speaking of Hillary said this is not the liberalism that he knows you let people who have opposing ideas speak and you try to win the battle of the the dialogue about which which system which candidate is better\nI don't see that going on not when you can't even go to a restaurant if they know you work for the Trump Administration not if they can from Mitch McConnell in the car with his wife\nNot if they won't let you in your own house where they come on the streets to to try to make noise or battling in the streets ... this is a scary\nThis is really very frightened about what's going on you got to get out there and vote if the Democrats win the house of representatives you're not going to believe the next two years what's going to take place you'll be hearing there'll be subpoenas President Trump's term is is going to be just the disaster that the next two years\nLet me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye which is also

in this country\nAnd it's for the soul of our nation I'm not going to go over everything I said in the first hour but you can see it in so many ways late in the left does not believe in American exceptionalism with just one of many other countries that don't believe in ... anything great about western civilization and\nThey don't take our constitution as a document that we can't change depending on the whim or you know their views at the moment\nThey don't believe in some of things in the constitution write the bill of rights where this freedom of speech freedom of speech only for them on their side\nSo that these are just a little sample of some of things going on in terms of the battle and some of the callers I can see is saying what I'm going to say\nWhich is if they take back the house and right now it looks like they're going to take back the house we're in trouble\nAnd they're just going to try to impeach the president going to try to teach Kevin ... ah they didn't

agreed with me in part I Do agree with you that the Republicans are probably going to lose the house now I don't want to um usually an optimist but I just want to be real it doesn't I don't know many seats it takes twenty something\nBut the fact is that um we're in trouble and it it doesn't look good cause of member the house is done on an individual basis\nOr area by areas state by state so it sure seems to me that uh we're in trouble and we could easily lose\nA house of representatives I don't think we're going to lose the Senate but we are going to lose the house of representatives if

Fred in Tallahassee, Florida Fred you're on with mark\nAnd mark ... real well how are you doing I'm doing good yeah the uh\nBill will be in our parents through since the Obama administration as yours\nA vote for him because they don't share your philosophy or your principles of course is another issue\nWhich is as a teacher part time teacher I can tell you this most students don't know our point of view what I often use is the minimum wage laws they'll say of course I Want my re uh want to get a raise or what do they call it also not just minimum wage livable wage I Love that one like it's a job of a business this may sound heartless\nA job a business to give you a livable wage no it's not\nIt's a job I teach economics job for business to make a profit if they don't make a profit\nThe job of a business to give you a livable wage and it's not the job of governments to decide what wage to give you that's what the Soviet Union did that's with communism is that's what's socialism is and as most young people they've never heard the other side where does the money come from\nI said that for years people do not know including adults not just young people young adults\nThat the government has no money to tone it just takes in ... from some group of people in the form of taxes and give it gives it the others when students here the snake I never heard that\nI never heard that before see conservatives couldn't win it's a harder thing to explain\nA than just being emotional and say you know whatever livable wage pro choice global warming of course the change the climate change when it gets very cold just see these catchy things they left and the Democrats a much better at that and conservatives are takes a while to explain\nWhy they shouldn't be a minimum wage or if there is you you just can't raise that arbitrarily of the government should do it some bureaucrats and do it\nIt takes a long time to explain capitalism why that's the best system ever created so far\n... this is tough to be on on our side it it takes a while and if you have a meeting against or oh good luck it's a wonder we win any elections is one of the President Trump won with all the things stacked against him\nA and let's go to David in\nGreenwich ah let's see where that is in Greenwich New Jersey it sounds like Hi I'm David\nGreene good morning thanks for taking my phone call um [noise]\nI I guess ... points on that you know President Trump is hated for what he says and and I get it it's not what he does you know let's not forget in this country that on President Obama came then I didn't vote for him but I like them as charismatic the money in this country and you should know this uh from as you're teaching the money in this\nForce corporations to invest money or make things happen I mean he's a businessman he's a wheeler dealer so he's hated for what he said\nNot what he died second I think the people in this country should understand that both the Democratic and Republican Party are are are corporations\nJust like if you want to I wanted to start our own\nRight on the radio corporation political party we could do it too so when they take us so personally thinking\nThis is us and this is ... is not an us and them their corporations and the you know that's that's how they lifted myself again I think to vote in this country you should have to pass a fifty question test and at least get a Seventy five so you know\nHow to vote why you're voting where you're voting what parties coming\nUh as far as the civil war in this country at a friend of mine told me when I Lived in South Carolina once and I mentioned the civil war and he says it wasn't the civil war it was a war of northern aggression because there was nothing simple about it\nWell we are in the ... civil war right now and with regards to this next election I Can't see it not getting more ugly than it was I personally predict there's going to be a red wave come a long time in Congress and that's because of the Kavanaugh hearings themselves\nAre and you know I'm and I'm just nasty question it's it's a it's a screw in question\nBut if somebody turned around tomorrow and said I mean the\nBottom of the bus drivers are taking the bathroom break a at a fast food restaurant and he says Mr Schumer Mr or or or ... or or Mr selling so expose themselves to be in the bathroom do they get a hearing from that do they not get a hearing\nI mean is it that ridiculous I understand what happened with the ...\nBut uh this country's out of control and if it doesn't straight now are there could be a civil war where the national guard protect our borders and if nothing else anyone living at listening out there should understand that you know there are countries out there\nFifty years and a hundred years we leave our guard down and we start terrible ourselves apart internally someone's going to make a move on I appreciate you taking my culture\nAbsolutely ... you know you're pretty articulate about it the only thing I don't agree with you for sure is a I don't I don't want to give it a test to see because just because you can answer questions I guess your test would include questions about government and so on\nBecause I've seen very bright people who don't have wisdom just because I have a master's degree I don't have a doctor but I Know people doctorates it just because they have a degree\nDoesn't make them very wise\nSo I don't think I Want to test for voting I Do want to make sure we had a caller about the integrity of the voting system that isn't real big trouble\nBut I certainly don't want to test for voting but I I I Know I certainly don't want to make it easier like you can a motor voting rights you can or voting the day of the election things you know or or voting even three months before things happen right that was a problem in Florida I think you know where\nWhere people had voted and they didn't get to see what happened the next few weeks\nI Want to be a reasonable effort I don't want to go out of my way to make a difficult\nBut there are people who die I remember in El Salvador they stood on line and they were bullets being shot at them obviously and bloody some of them to vote and they held up I don't know ... I Can't even think what color it was they\nHeld at whatever they were using to signify that they had voted we we don't take that seriously enough so I don't want to make it easy for the people here he sounds like um country take them so\nTo make it easier to people on a reform to vote\nThe same token you can of voting in of course a test of course that was as a bad history in terms of the south terms of trying to keep the blacks from voting and others so that that's not my idea of not you know but I certainly don't want to make it so easy\nSo yeah I've got a story later weekly here in\nThe Generation Z giving it away they're not voting because the this is great they got their ballots I guess maybe through the Internet or whatever but they don't know where to get postage stamps that's all true story they don't have a good postage stamps\nAnd I bet you there on the other side so maybe there was something to do with the caller was talking about let's go to John in Denver, Colorado John you're on was mark\nHey mark [noise] uh I don't agree that the Americans in a civil war the vast majority of Americans today or civil upstanding people with very bright minds\nAnd the reason Trump got elected is the the American public are disappointed yeah I mean the our legislator a Trump what got elected because he was an outsider empty because he's a businessman\nAnd he spend the money that his business\nAnd he's very a proven and he knows when he's in a bad deal and the [noise] I think what a great job with foreign policy I I I really admire him that he puts American sovereignty first\nA lot of recognizing the international court system up when you get ... influences the in our world I'm like the looming not either do to reverse they will they're so\nPowerful and wealthy and as a group [noise] they can they want to control the world they don't want a sovereign country they don't want 'em there they don't want a constitution faith slowly are ... ...\nAnd the girl or indicated in fact that's what you know what else\nI don't know you may I thanks I I yeah I was going to your your major point there\nUh I don't have to agree with the bill of berries necessarily but the you know right we have the Europeans who have a you know a whole system now that looks like it may be falling apart because people don't want far away governments to determine what goes on their lives but I don't agree with you I mean the I don't have to write that the civil war you can call it what you want\nBut the anger and the differences between the left and the right is very strong and as I said if if the Democrats take back the house this next few weeks\nYou know for like would you say you're just not going to like what you're saying it's going to be worse than what you saw the Kevin are here let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye which isn't the same as eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine Marcus are filling in on red or radio\nOr the books we would always told ... must be read [noise]\nListen to read I radio show wherever you are with our free app for your iPhone or Android more info at red eye radio show dot com and use the key word mobile\nTo any kids I think you know when I grow up\nI Want to be glass counter top in in you know when I go I Want to be a kid that\nFor the president I go I Want to be the when I go I'm going to be one free Singapore gay I grew up I Want to be the end I Want to be a fight that races around when I go up to be found kind of four and you're going to be a rocking chair and I know for the paper\nI like to me along the way\nWhen I grow up I don't want to be a piece of garbage and if you've ever said only I won't be\nGive your garbage another life recycle learn how I I Want to be recycled dot org a public service advertising\nYeah when you're insured windshield replacement dollars ...

your story once more insular\nBack with you again on the radio I was with you back for Sunday's or feel lonely I also think filling in another way networks show\nI've also had my own successful local shows in Los Angeles including on Westwood one's affiliate in Los Angeles seven Ninety\nIt showed the engineer said to me you're Martin last summer ... uh you know a practice run here and we did and I said the wrong full of the news station but I guess that's what happens when you're so used to it but we know the number here let's do it correctly eight six six Ninety red eye the same thing as eight six six nine o seven\nThirty three thirty nine and we'll be taking your calls in a little bit but first I Want to tell you that well we've been doing the last couple of hours\nWe've been trying to talk about the civil war between the left and the right and that's where I think has been occurring here for the last couple of years and I think it's the second civil war\nAnd you've been reacting to that on line I mean a through your calls\nBut first of all let's get it straight if you don't already know what the left liberals Democrats whatever you want to call them will do anything and everything to when they have no limits and they have no guard rails as to what is acceptable\nThis isn't even the era of Ronald Reagan where he can be friends with ... speaker Tip O'Neill I mentioned this last hour and have a drink with him at night and prison regular ask what has happened with all the vitriol during the day and Tip O'Neill way was the speaker of the house at the time you said that's the daytime does that night\nWe're way past that and you saw us in a Graham talking about that that these were his friends\nThat he he was saying all those things about because of what they've done their search for power\nAnd oh yeah probably now you can't even have a drink at night 'cause look what it may have done to judge Kevin uh\nIt has become an all out war anything as I said and everything goes\nNow lying as commonplace as with when I mentioned this with Harry Reid claiming Romney didn't pay any taxes someone as friends or someone told them that wasn't true and then he was a cold on that he said well it would work didn't it was a total insanity of the ...\nThat accusation\nAll of it is fair game now and now any accusation is to be treated seriously if it has made this key if it is made by someone on the left against someone on the right\nSo the assault you may have heard about this maybe you didn't hear about it that Keith Allison may very well have made or else and sorry may very well made against this girlfriend is not important news running I guess Minnesota for something I think it's going to turn in general are lieutenant governor whatever it is\nHe is on the left and maybe even more telling he's a Muslim which isn't exempt group I'm up against Muslims but you can't attack them\nThese new rules are only for those on the right the ends justify any means\nWe're evil and they're right check that correct they never want to be called right [noise]\nAnd maybe the ... to cross the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right they chimed in because they too are left to screw up before they our civil liberties group and so they came out against the nomination and I quote\nThe ... board of directors deeply concerned about allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to his longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh they passed a resolution stating they oppose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court there aren't credible allegations\nThis was the ACLU allegations that judge Kevin I was engaged in serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you say anything then that have not been adequately investigated by the Senate what would it be advocates adequate seven FBI checks eight nine what does it Dr Ford's credible testimony subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct\nYou mean the great thing that even the times wouldn't publish the an adequate investigation maybe they can investigate better and judge Kavanaugh's testament to the leaders of the doubt about it is a fitness to serve\nSilent on these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment of higher score to the land I'm trying to shorten it the standards for such an appointment on the burden is on the nominee the burden on the nominee to prove that something that happened how exactly does one do that\nThe burden is not met as long as there are hundreds of questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assaults assault get it on resolved allegations so if they can never resolve it which they can't because there is no cooperation then voila you'd never be confirmed\nAnd it goes on and on I I don't want to make your two depressed but there does again based on allegations I Want to know I just want to know where in the past the ACLU wanted someone convicted because of allegations\nBut this is what the Democrats and the left have no soul there was no place to go with all of this except down on the other and the loss of a piece of America telling me what you think\nOf all of this application of the selection of innocence and self righteousness of those on the left and the fool's on our side and if you agree with me that we're about or in the

political theater and she used the me too movement to try to do this and it just made up of fires and unbelievable\nI Am a survivor of me too I mean it happened to me and I didn't believe but the Ford for a minute not for a minute and they use that to make everybody I mean they just made a sham out of the whole thing and they said it back Thirty years in my opinion and I just I could just scream\nAnd I hope that it motivates everybody\nOn the Republican side to get out there and and vote because to me that was or what they did to carbon I was absolutely does that couple I Can't even ... it's unbelievable to me that you would do that to an innocent man for a political game it's complete craziness\nYeah so I understand we're yeah thanks so I understand where you're coming from it was hard for me to watch when\nYou know is the Democrats turn to a question him or not but the question them they just put on the show\n... pretty disgusting and of course was grim pointed out he voted for uh you know liberal or left his Supreme Court judges and they won in big numbers oh we we often are the part where the stupid party ... in my opinion and then the evil border hurt someone else save us\nSell the greed with me where would they do it may have dropped off let's go to Tyler in Reno nevada Tyler you're on with mark\nNevada mark and it's real I I think that ah I've heard all the way too much of rehashing of the last you know a couple of months of political he said she said and all the other nonsense [noise] one saying that the folks that listen to your show could do to help put the ball over the line so to speak\nFor whoever candidate that you want to support\nIs to actually get off your ... and go out and volunteer to\nSit at the polls on election day and Greek voters or what we found time and time again I've been doing this since Barry Goldwater ran for office years ago or is that if you have a friendly face at the polls\nIf you have people going to the polls that are still kind of on the fence of where they're going to go you get a seven to twelve percent push\nAt those particular polling places where you had these friendly faces now it won't do any good if you got occur much and it's all grumpy and you know wants to get in fights with everybody that the thing is is you just have a nice pleasant person there\nUh I always set up a little card table with a bowl of candy a couple of smiley balloons and you know say hello to the kids that come out with their parents\nAnd you can make a significant difference in your community both on the down ticket people and on the main ones like I'm going to be out there for a Dean Heller a starting here in Reno or on the twentieth of October or we start early voting I\nI I think that uh everybody else if they would take a few days off and participate at the polls they could really make\nRun for office of course in California last\nRepublicans don't usually win in California but I'm the personal touch makes a difference because they've done polls and and I've seen it in the audience was where they ask people have you ever met a candidate and almost all say they never have and when they meet someone and you had a great point in their ... decent that's how you can get a vote\n'em and Republicans used to be very good at doing that and then we went over to consultants and TV and I think we went to string some ways let's go to April in New York City are you pro Iran was mark on the road on radio\nHi I'm I wanted to comment you said you wanted to hear a comment about whether we're going through a civil war\nAnd I believe that there's a difference the civil war I think we are going to go through\nSomething similar to that but on the civil war both sides of very boisterous and we're willing to fight to the death\nFor what they believed in what's happening now with the media and entertainment and the and the young people they aren't they don't they only hearing one side we're not organized conservatism organized because when nice guys we believe in being in a civil\nBut this is not the time to be that way because the kids are watching and the nature of young people is that they want to be on the winning side they don't even know we exist where all the young kids in ... in school or in the high schools in the colleges the minute they have a conservative view\nThey screen that oh how can any person as a young person is in college be strong enough to stand up against this title wave and the media and the entertainment um people this at the songwriters of singers\nEveryone seems and is appearing to be liberal so all these young people they say well you know this is what we're supposed to be aware of the good side they think\nBut if we should be getting organized we should not be you know throwing rocks and and cocktails the windows like some of the ... you know group dies but we're not serving our records were being too quiet and I don't think every\nGroan American that's a conservative is going to be able to go against the tide of these termites\nOf little liberals who just following the tide they want to be happy they want to go one friend invites the other friend I'm going here we're going to protest we're going to go down and I'm In New York city\nWhen President Trump comes in there's like ... a protest is but I Would not go down there because I'm afraid of getting beat up and I might be the only one there would a different point of view we are being like um bullied\nTo just keep quiet and Chuck Schumer oh and and what's his name Cuomo what he just said lately that President Trump's he's trying to get all ... or any violence that goes on he's organizing his people to be violent there was something that happened on a metropolitan club I think they said\nNo no no no\nDid you hear what Cuomo said I couldn't believe it\nHe's he's a president from this is the way\nThe the Republicans handled things he got them organized to do that he set them up on purpose to go after the ... what is he set them up President Trump didn't even know but the kids here this and they believe that it's very serious because it reminds me\nMy husband watches on TV the History Channel and my son watches it he's twenty Twenty one and they show how Hitler isolated the young people got him to summer camp they were separated from their parents they only heard\nWhat Hitler was saying and telling them you are strong we are good\nWe will be ... feet and it gets old sharing with smiling\nThat because if I knew there was something going on and I wouldn't be the only one there and the police would be there to protect and make that children see that there's two ways of thinking but I don't think they know and we're letting it happen because they're trying to be polite\nBut they're they're gathering all the young people with the media and ... Taylor Swift and all these other singers let die I mean they're not thinking in school they not teaching them to think independently in college if they don't think with the crowd there'll be just slashed\nWhat do you think did you do because I don't think it's fair because that civil war the two sides fighting equally\nYeah well I Wish you considerably more passionate that's the first thing I Want to say you you had I'm teasing you obviously you're very good well here's some I have some optimism for you but you're basically right you may not have heard me say this is\nNot a wonder that students come out and the the liberal because that's all they ever here it's a wonder the any of them come out as conservatives because they realize that if your doctor and eat them you get them early then that's the way they're gonna think can be except for this whoever the president is seems to make a difference when Reagan was president ... more Republicans\nAre the fact that Trump is president and we're having some great success forget the media I Know that's a problem to get the schools I Know that's a problem\nThey tend to see what's going on and they ... more Republicans are you know take place in the time like that now you're right we got a lot of stuff against us and the Republican you were right the Republicans don't know how to fight I Can't argue with you and much of this\nBut despite everything and the attempt to destroy President Trump he won last time and I believe he's April he's going to win again in my first hours at a better whisper that 'cause I don't want to have a heart attack on the other side\nBecause the American people like I said this in front of a ...\nAnd again because the American people understood who he was and the decency and the the faith in America that he had and with President Trump you know you're going to get tired of winning despite what he does his Twitter's fees that are you wish you didn't say sometimes I think the bottom line is people vote economically\n\nI Am incredibly incredibly proud to be finishing\nA place where I Know my patients are gonna get the top notch\nOnly care but also\nSerious happening twenty four hours a day seven days a week every single person that contribute to the part of that nature family that makes that happen because of everyone that it was really committed to the nation everything\nSt Jude children's research falling into\nFinding your children are learning more things you do the work\nOn the talk of one of the six twenty seven letters that are\nDiving on three we have a chance for rain showers in the forecast\nTemperature settling to the mid thirties or maybe some sort of mixing into the mix of rain and snow early Monday that all scattered right into the afternoon I don't think that takes the sunshine to hide your fifty chance for isolated showers or a ... cheesecake hunting is enshrined a times at our high right if if you buy\nYour outlook is Jennifer narrow more hot I talk a lot of data and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMhm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nNo [noise] you were a radio\nTalk about everything from whether you all for your just won't be poor and regardless of more gun shoot a radio\nShow back to you again on radio arrogant Jerry he'll be back next week and for those just tuning in I was on with your back in December for weeks and it's a pleasure to be back with you again for this week from Sunday the Thursday night\nAnd for those who want to keep in touch with me there are several ways to do it check out the Web page mark I will show dot com or where you can leave me a message or follow me show you had called me on Facebook or Twitter\nOr email me had mark ice ... if you don't want to go to the Facebook page I'm Sorry to go the Web pages and see it's mark Iceland M.

that rough oh I Apologize Minnesota\nI'm ah I'm fifty five years old I voted for Ronald Reagan my first time I could vote my father was a die hard democratic ... party member the Democratic party in the Nineteen eighties was the party of the working man\nAnd now that has been it has been hijacked by the ultra liberal left\nAnd I am any national trade union\nAnd I'm told to vote democratic and I just okay okay\nOkay [noise] also my my uh my uncle was a job that Governor Jerry Brown press secretary back in the seventies\nAnd I'll jump Governor Brown is the governor of California now and I just I look at California and it's like wow this place is just it's\nIt's just crazy and the Democratic party is just so evil and visceral and all the Republicans and we do have a few of those but for the most part they're pretty down to earth decent people\nAnd I think Trump\nHas been the best thing that's happened to us politics and all I have a bunch of liberal friends and national Tom what did you vote for a spot I voted libertarian that way and get all that argument they will come after me but I did vote for Trump I think he did a great job [noise] uh it was so funny Hillary thought you had the lecture and in the bag and\nI remember I was working night maintenance the place and I came into my supervisor ... office and big ...\nThis week I I'm working in the solar signing my cattle Minnesota and I was coming back from work and Rush Limbaugh had the hearings on line when I listen to it I just I Can't believe the crap that he wants to Mr capital and they just they just\nCharacter assassination and then some and here's another thing\nI think back to a judge Bork when he tried to get on the Supreme Court and that guy from Massachusetts called Ted Kennedy just the the proverbial walked him and I just go crazy and then the then it really makes me angry as Mr Kennedy who was one of the biggest sexual predators in the world\nIs buried in Arlington National cemetery 'cause he died in her office that's wrong I have a big problem with that but\nAt ... here I helped a gentleman run for ... who voted for Trump he'd lost by five votes in the primary recall he lost by two points\nTo vote because our base that get out and support him and his opposition are flaming liberals and this and I like I said I live in Rochester humble male clinic list as a tax and spend county now the election in two thousand sixteen Trump\nWent all out assault acceptable to county where I live in the twin cities are very very liberal counties otherwise\nYou wouldn't want to make it we yeah we got to go when you got to make it you can hear more on ...\n[noise]\n\n\nOf all the could stuffy did well it wasn't about that if you just look as you\nSaid about the spirit of the law of the letter of the law\nHe really wasn't guilty of anything but it didn't matter what the Democrats were up to they were just trying to stall has to make sure he didn't get on the Supreme Court they have this feeling that maybe if they won the Senate which they're not going to do or you know they could make some difference in who the nominee was and I don't think that's going to happen\nSo they were out to destroy him it didn't matter\nStress me to watch the super ... such a bunch of ... there was Blumenthal I don't think I mentioned him tonight\nHe said at one point to that a lie telling one lie could disqualify you yet he told lies about his service\nIn in the military it's well known it doesn't want to talk about that a certain I ... do you ever feel you're living on another planet I often feel that way I watch what goes on but it wasn't really about the spirit of the litter in law it was about getting in\nAnd that's why the ... it was hills for months or weeks whenever it was\nA you got to know what's going on and that's why in the they don't care if they destroy anybody saw about power and Lindsey Graham at at the best it's all about winning and he said some at cutting out the you know what a and these were his friends but no it's it's ... it's reached new lows that's wife knows just joining us I mentioned the first hour\nThan we have a new civil war going on\nYeah with a soft civil war or not\n... it's a it's it's really a fight for the soul of this country let me know what you think let's go to\nMark in Fort Jones California and mark you're on was mark a marker ultra get your name that's for sure I Want to learn about Christine court yeah\nWanted to talk about Christine forward that Brett Kavanaugh I'm a I'm a former sheriff's investigator about marijuana interdiction here for a while and uh for the import is was doing a lot of things during her testimony that the suspects do when they want to cover up their crime and cover up their life\nShe's a psychologist or the little girl's voice raising me inflection at the end of this that the that that whole iris technique body language shrinking her head down toward her shoulders by sitting up straight out what the people in the eye quite you know always up for gays although the suspects\nHair because there is no physical evidence yet have in the country or we presume innocence in the lab guilt can be proven and there was no guilt proven toward Brett Kavanaugh any way shape or form and that makes Smith forward a liar and that's that's really what she is out in California\nWe have a move but what we have twenty three counties that have declared that want to separate from California and they're all day and the liars here are in charge of government or they're in charge of every aspect of our politics at last we fight nothing's ever gonna get better\n[noise] well I certainly agree with your and a lot of people said this about fighting back because otherwise we're going to lose the country I mean what made this country special is is it risks now if left takes it over and good luck so Marty couldn't remind him forget your name you know you use expressive very well\nLet's go to well here's a good point let's go to Troy in Nashville Iran with mark\nI have um I uh I've got a little theory you know we've we've got these kids and you know there what ten twelve Fifteen Years old before they're released\nOh are you There God can you hear me yeah now I kept going\nI'm Sorry I was saying you know kids to you when they start getting to the age of of even slightly paying attention to what's going on in the world they're twelve Fifteen Years old so these kids started paying attention and\nFor the last eight years someone that would have been spoon fed all this Obama stuff you know no winners and losers in field day now these kids are twenty twenty five thirty years old and all they know is Obama so now I've got a twenty two year old daughter and a twenty\nWith me at all the other one I got to sit down and and talk with her and I showed her some facts kind of changed her a little bit and then and then I've got my ten year old that loves Trump and he goes to school and all the kids in his class they\nDare Trump supporter so this generation that's coming that wasn't raised up in Obama um years complete my ten year old knows more about politics than my twenty and twenty two year old daughter too\nYou know and and I think that uh these kids when they grew up you know and basically\nAnd the Obama years so we've got this generation and we've got another generation that's coming up that uh is gonna be hopefully the generation that saves us you know so I just wanted to to\nYou know kind of let you know about that or you know it's a generation gap that I see with my own kids\nFrom you you got to get rid of your two older ones just\nTell me about it you know and and that's been you know the other thing about the Kavanaugh and and you've\nGot this a huge silent majority um that ... year they're they're\nThey're afraid you talk about fighting and that's what the Democrats and the the liberals are doing their thing I'm In the\nSilent majority is you know they're afraid to say anything like that guy you know earlier said that uh he voted libertarian you know instead of just coming out and saying hey I voted for Trump he knows better scare and you've got a small group of people\nWho are ... and the majority and I think this ... ...\nAnd uh all the spin on it is really going to show at the polls with the we've got a huge silent majority I'm you know so\nAbout losing the house I don't know\nJust listening to an end by the way you try you also made a very good point\nWhich is and I said this before who the president is makes a difference who the people young people grow up with that is what they hear and that's what they learn right that's why during the Obama administration to get a lot of young people over here is that side and now with Trump although we have the media against us which hurts a lot\nBut if they see the economy's doing well and their lives are improving the lives of their parents that starts to influence them in more people like that ... in his own microcosm in his family\nThe ten year old is a Trump supporter and the ones who grew up with the Obama you can't even talk to them\nI Know that feeling [laughter] I Would have my own house so I Can't be hard on him let's go to a ... in Fresno, California Iran with mark [noise]\nHey how are you sir [noise]\nYeah I think you're ready to argue that it was whether there was a civil war going on [noise] yep [noise]\nYeah no um [noise] it is going on and it's a Cold War [noise]\nWhat's what's that sound is that on your end I think we're hearing something on your end\nBut to\nGo ahead trust is on the Kaiser who\nYeah it's a hero question was if there is a Cold War or a Thursday civil war going on it is definitely going on and they said cold one [noise]\nThat ... for now you hope it doesn't get hot as we see within ... in groups like that maybe even black lives matter or any groups that don't let people speak just because they disagree with him and uh what was that the New York state Republican Party or the ... some\nGroup out there a had a sub smeared and a note left threatening them\nWhat's happening more and more frequently and uh\nYeah we have time calling in steals whereas in Alabama yeah and I say that wrong you yeah go ahead ...\nYeah there is still Alabama you know this killing island yeah listen to read I radio every morning all the way to address\n[laughter] that's great I or you got to make your point everybody only be listening OK\nOkay everybody that keeps talking about the blue wave age there's easy way to stop to believe way are you got to do is [noise] is required voter id nationwide and if it's a nationwide vote if it's for the house of representatives or the Senate\nWhich is for a nationwide vote it doesn't matter let the people in the states do whatever they want to put their counties or whatever 'cause we were required in Alabama have a voter id\nGives the vote rally he away

I. S. L. E. R. dot com where you can a female me to follow me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to on the show\nAnd make it easy for you I always kept us emails I said the first tower even though no one spoke of AOL anymore or admitted it's America KISS L. E. R. at AOL dot com that's how people know me all these years to sum up for those of you may be just joining us\nAnd the first hour suggests that we have a civil war going on now\nFor the fate of this country whether it's going to move far left\nAnd forget how we started what made us so special American exceptionalism with very little government people at a face tyranny\nAnd dictatorships and ruled by the kings are queens and they want to get away from that and they want the less government they want the liberty and they want the freedom to why we formed a republic\nThat's how the country was founded on in the declaration and the constitution making different than any other country before it was the first time we said\nThat ordinary average people could make decisions about what was best in their lives and they didn't need these dictators kings queens tyrants to make those decisions for them that battles against the left\nWhich thinks they should be more and more government and a individual rights are not uh not as big an issue as they once were\nAnd that in terms of of the world situation America is just as bad as everybody else that there was nothing special about worst in civilization and very little that we could learn from it so in the Kavanaugh hearings which I bought a brought up the next hour\nYou saw it on display there they're less things that they're right and that anything\nJust by an accusation and it didn't matter because they have right in truth on their side and you can destroy anybody is families reputation so what\nAnd you see more and more even in

to protest and the other side you know tons and maybe weapons and all kinds of stuff and of course you know in college campuses people don't get to speak if they're on the conservative side\nSo I threw out there that this is really a civil war and we now know that they may have been a soft coup type thing to make sure that the results of the election didn't hold that President Trump on the first place didn't win this was done by\nOr the power elite and they wanted to sit down and rules to say here are three branches of government\nStay within these branches of government will ah have

balances the founders knew they didn't want any part of the government to get too powerful soon and everything we do you're right you know how to make a lot of the house has to pass as soon as they agree the president can veto it or they can override it\nOr you have the court system to try to you know slow down too much power certainly to make sure and follow the constitution\nThese people were geniuses and created this country and it was all about what you said to make sure that the people have the power in the final analysis and not a king or queen not some dictated not some tyrants\nBut I

into the architects and lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys clearer conditions are bound today for a good portion of the west west of the Rockies\nAnd that includes mid Atlantic region as we begin the work week there's a look at your national forecast red or radio I'm meteorologist John drought\n\nNinety red eye taking your calls\n[noise]\n\nIn like to shake ...\nDitch attack you can get repeal attacks like they got rid of it is that that that's why it has gotten Robert me to act out of it in the margin unconstitutional where's the choice for that and why is Nick how can we get it out yes you do with that you helped me there\n... ... yeah I think I can I don't think they have courage or they're afraid you know\nThe poll numbers are actually I don't know if you can believe them but the poll numbers seem to show that the repeal is not as popular as was I don't know if that's accurate or not 'cause we've had problems with the polls but you make another great point jury which is what I said there's John Roberts appointed by a Republican president\nAnd all of a sudden he changed on Obamacare we're pretty sure we're going to win that\nYou can't even trust her own which is how about for Democrats they complain about them Kevin uh they voted in lock step you know the four votes they're going to be there every single time it doesn't matter the history you don't ever seen them deviate\nBut even on the Supreme Court is the Republicans who deviate from what you thought they believed him\nAgain you're not supposed to question them on every single issue now they don't even answer it but you couldn't even trust John Roberts ... good a Supreme Court justice who else then who's the awful one Souter that the H a Bush a point that I mean he wound up being a disaster so we we we have those\nIt was probably trying to get back and President Trump but you can't even trust trust you you don't have to worry when you vote for a Democrat when your vote for liberal when you vote for the left is that what you're going to get\nYour vote for our own I mean I I gotta tell ya I wasn't even sure that Susan Collins was going to come down on the side of Kevin I was worried when she was going to give her speech it I don't know if you remember a few hours before she gave a speech people weren't sure what she was going to do\nAnd they often you have people like Jeff Flake right to life dimension him\nOr he didn't even run again because it's so unpopular and hates another one that aids Trump so much and you could even be sure his role and what did he do uh a woman a cost him which looks like she may have been part of the ... gang but I don't want to see if if it's not accurate you know some of them were paid did you did you watch them by the way clawing if the Supreme Court\nWill try to stop his nomination of these people losing it or what\nAnd that's why for those are just joining us now I said in the very first our we have a civil war going on but we can't even trust the that's the answer to juries question\nThey run as Republicans conservatives whatever and then they get in there I don't know they want to be in favor at the parties or they want to get good press who knows what it is it gets them that's why I say this for years and it's a good time to say to the audience and now\nWe didn't first become Republicans and then the site on our principles we had a series of values and we said oh with those values then the Republican Party makes sense\nAnd if ever they deviate from that what is the point of being Republican what is the point if the party can stick to it what's the point of John McCain you know changes his mind or voted or what he said he would do\nOr Jeff Flake 'cause he's angry at President Trump and we can go down the list of others like that\nWhat you don't see the Democrats doing that and now you could say you got mentioned in there but ... didn't Trump in West Virginia by forty points or\nPart they never deviate and that's why I said in that and we'll take your calls\nIf the Republicans lose the house of representatives\nGood luck of the next two years they are going to have subpoenas they're gonna have hearings that go into a peach President Trump there's no doubt in my mind if they have a majority they'll be able to do that in the house representatives they'll have hearings they'll try to teach the judge Kavanaugh\nThis is going to be chaos and I am sure one of the color set up a number of color city you better go out there and vote you better get your neighbors to vote you better get your friends to vote this is serious stuff\nThis country will never be the same if these guys getting power and it doesn't matter if President Trump when's the next time if you have a house representatives that trying to destroy him and his people as Lindsey Graham pointed out they only care about power\nI mean I'm not going to say they don't have any principles any views but I'm just trying to say they think they're so right there so arrogant that anything goes and you saw it and you're watching it at the Kevin hearings they they didn't care about ruining his reputation and in fact as I pointed out before they didn't even care about the Ford they didn't care so much about her she was just the pollen\nAnd when the phone is like Cory Booker said ah do you think she's making this up you didn't even care she made it up\nA whole about winning your point of view or in your case running for president next time and the same they would Kamala Harris you can't trust these people\nWe we know what they're in for you know why they're in for this stuff to gain a power to win election to take over the presidency they never accepted his win and there's going to continue to tell me what you think

that's what they wanted their business\nIt's not like regular people having children because they will have no responsibilities whatsoever about the upkeep or their upbringing\nWell we'll have nannies they will have people that are with them twenty four seven they really don't have any of the responsibilities\nOf a twenty seven or twenty five year old couple\nSee and I and I think the two of them would definitely take it the ... century they I'm not saying they won't take it seriously right I'm not knocking them but it's a lot it's like being a grandfather instead of a father when you don't like the game anymore\nWell of course it does when you have help us us regular folk wouldn't know anything about that but uh you know I don't know it's just why Russian moon wander placed why does why things to see why why right\nBy the way if you don't like the rumor mill stay away from all the news today because all you're going to hear as the rumor mill\nWe're already hearing rumors about Russia being involved with this show gig we're hearing rumors about the Turkish embassy is going to open their doors\nTo us we're talking about Saudis are going to go see the Turkish council that we're talking about all these gases no body knows today or somebody would do something about it\nAs in the president and speaking of the president\nHe's spent some time this weekend in Richmond, Kentucky a beautiful place\nRolling hills and rolling hills yeah blue\nGrass and some of the most expensive horse farms in the world but it was his weekend to stumping Kentucky here's Mr President\nWe celebrated another tremendous victory\nFor the American people you know what I'm Talking [noise]\n\nLab and a lot of victories folks couldn't handle it [noise]\nThe White House\nOh pastor Andrew Brunson

together\nWas an easy was it is\nWe don't pay rent [noise]\nAnd then\nMake sure that America is extraordinary\nWe want to make sure continues full speed ahead we don't want Democrats\nAre coming from a different\nWe don't want them getting an office all they'll do is brought under Republican leadership America is booming and thrive\n[noise] America\nIs winning again because we are finally putting America First\nOkay that's all well and good but there's just a tad of irony involved that the Turkish would release a prisoner from the United states who was sentenced to thirty five years in prison\nWith this show be thing just happening at the same time and and their council of being involved mhm okay and already of course once again if you don't like rumors stay out of the news room today because now now I've seen on two of the three news network\nPictures of Mr Jared Kushner sitting next to the prince of Saudi Arabia\nOr we're going to get that too I mean the rumor mill is going to be working at full speed today and it is all rumor and speculation but\nThe past year and a half before there was a court date all of a sudden is released yes and ... it's great for him I've yes real that for a man of the of the law to do with thirty five years for trying to spread\nHis religion ended his knowledge in a foreign country I think that's wonderful and I'm so happy that he's home we really are\nAh I just like to know more about it right in the next half hour we will talk about the movie that we saw over the weekend called the first man and we saw in IMAX and we'll talk a little bit about the the ... of directing and I ... oh\nYes I imagine I guess they take the raw footage of this film and then work to fit the I'm the one that can or outweigh the after the shooting on max is that done simultaneously no it's done instead of going yes and so\nI don't know you are really worrying without a net and you're hungry when I was a very expensive process and I asked so we'll talk about that more but first a kind of they from what's happening in the walls of weather\nAnd there's a new word involved for cash and we'll talk about the ... all over the next right here on the free [noise]\nWasn't full IMAX resigning fall I max in Las Vegas at the dome of Caesar's Palace yes we're the screen continues all the way up to the\nTop of the building yeah and to the curvature of the building because it's in the dome and that sort of relief shot for for you to get the environmental thing but I think that if you went back\nAnd saw it on a flat screen\nYou know the town of vision Seventy you'd say well\nOkay in fact I think some of the scenes in the ... of you know one of those alerts coming out the spoiler alert I'm In the scene where they're actually on the moon and it's basically done in silence\nI think some of those long pans and zoom in and the facts and far away shots and stuff would almost become boring\nOh in a flat screen situation which I didn't find them boring no not at all but not at all at once again in regular film I think it might have\nLeans towards the boring site the story was good I didn't know that was as much tunnel in Neil Armstrong's life has there was losing a daughter very early to brain cancer\nShe was maybe what two years old at the time yeah and him never really being able to get over that get over that not only get over that but even share the emotion\nYes and I would estimate times were different but it made him seem as almost an emotional is kind of person and because all of those guys came from being test pilots as he was one of the original test pilots the ex Fifteen oh which was the original\nSemi spaceship that made it possible for us to go into space because prior to the ex Fifteen we did not know what happened\nWhen men broke the sound barrier there were actually like wives' tales and speculation mhm that you will disintegrate\nOr that you would go into a vacuum or is that you would compress and just disappear off the face of the earth\nA little I liked the way they brought you they took you from the Gemini program through the out including Apollo ... well actually from the original mercury program yes yeah that's right a\nGemini to the Apollo yeah I I was just surprised at how introverted and basically how\nCold blooded he seemed he was a well I think uh\nHe he lived breathed slapped ate his uh his occupation I think he was entirely dedicate\nWas a test pilot says as was Walter Shaw another guy from the mercury poke program Gus Grissom\nI'm John Glen for that matter um all ... coming from that ... where you were basically living life on the edge all the time yeah as you did not know if any of those things would fly\nThey were dreamers\nWith all that with all the mathematicians and attack and all came together and it was kind of out on the ledge lending there\nWas because you know all those guys with the pencils and stuff sending cement building about two miles away from the launch site and then they strap you and they'll walk away yes and then they applaud when you're successful yeah yeah so but interesting wars the trip yes\nAnd it really you were really able to feel the sense of getting into a the space craft and the sound of those doors and ... you and everything else and\nThat's it it was you and your partner or your other 'em up you know another pilots or two and it was just\nThe three of us I I didn't really I don't really\nI was there but I think it should have been noted because there was so forward lean place than the reality of

number has been creeping up slowly over the course of the summer as long as we've been doing these battleground trackers but\nIt is still very heavily dependent on at least two things for the Democrats I just I Can't emphasize this enough its dependence on turnout among people who don't typically about in terms and it's dependent on a few meaningful crossover voters coming from having voted for Donald Trump to voting Democrat now\nAll right at the monitor on face the nation is really good ... and just saying this is the way it stands right now however on the Senate side where Labor Day the Senate looked in jeopardy for a for Republicans now they're saying oh we got the Senate\nBut can we get the house and bought tradition and uh and history with me in Studio is John Sununu and Christian new they're both very ah they're both very young looking men\nAnd ah they're both very successful politicians in their own right first off that analysis what do you think uh governor's soon or John\nThey listen to what his assumptions were people that don't usually vote in in off year off president you your elections have to come out for the Democrats are they they have been in my opinion confusing noise\nWith enthusiasm and and the noise is on the fringe I'm not sure the noises all the way across I've been saying all along the Republicans will hold the house by a handful of seats\nThat would be as big a governor Senate and the current governor to get some money because you understand the tradition is is it's only happened two or three hundred and fifty years\nI mean is that it would be absolutely huge and again when you when you see strong candidates come out of all across the country I mean even in in New Hampshire we ever or two seats up there we have a Eddie Edwards have very strong candidate with a military background or running and CD one Steve Negron and see two seats that boat\nI mean I I think across the country you're gonna see a lot of races that just shocked people for the Republican and you just you and for me every two years you up to run for every two years I have to run critic great accountability I thought it was a great idea until I became governor then I realized it stunk [laughter] to raise money I got as people are helped but there\nMay live free or die I mean that's really what it's about that live free or die spirit in New Hampshire and I I'm for\nThat except for the money part and the way you guys always have to raise money the way the house members of the raise money I guess what do you want to do they have to raise money if they want to stay in their job and after a while it's exhausting what am I doing their job and guess\nWhat if I give you money I have I have an ear towards the issue and you should listen to me and then you wonder about how do I ... at the same time be true to my\nOwn and raising money stinks it's really hard and again I grew up you know we you didn't really ask people for help kind of took care of yourself but you have to remember when you ask someone to make an investment and that's what it is yes or a business\nLeader or a family to make an investment they're making an investment in themselves because they want that change they want to a more effectively for themselves more flexibility for their business whatever it might be so that's an investment for them to make an and when you walk through it it's it's wonderful to see people come out in in support you they're knocking on doors they're putting up signs all that I mean politics matters just\nKnew I Know you saw the

Bush work\nHard to get the president's selection of Kevin ... across the whole uncommon Hollywood three times ... it many times and and and he called lots of other senators so I Hope that that does catalyze or a return of or relationship between the two family\nThe little bit is principal or to waive these very critical of the Bush administration and I think it's unnecessary shots they takes on forty three I'm hoping that\nUp to a move 'em in the right direction has Christian or he's doing great that takes after his mother so he does very for\nThe governor of New Hampshire and they both let me know how they feel like you guys are great having in Studio ... thanks for having a coming up next time that that real clear politics ... Monday say they're\n\nInteresting challenge to talk of those points on TNT I find I'm going to teach me the gas station\nGet off the stumping stop campaigning actually hurting candidates on his terms uh I'm I don't really remember what Bush did on his but right now the president being a factor thirty five percent of voters said yes and and that's why I'm supporting and\nThose who oppose I'm thirty eight percent yeah I'm voting just to oppose them twenty seven percent said it's not about him\nYeah look Mitt turns a referendum on President whether you acknowledge it or not Trump's clearly acknowledging it but I don't think that's what that was always going to be the case what's happened in the last ten days two weeks since the Kevin I'm hearing is not about Donald Trump it's about Republicans in the Senate it's about Mitch McConnell now being seen as sort of a hero for having\nThe strength and courage to sort of push this through when you know look what are the reasons Trump was elected was because Republicans were dissatisfied with Republican leadership they didn't like Mitch McConnell he had a terrible favorable approval rating among Republicans that is completely flipped around now\nAnd it's unify the party so the energy coming not necessarily from from Trump but from Republicans in Washington\nYou know it's interesting too and you tell me if they shows up in the polls that we know there's a lotta never Trump there is on the right there was no I don't remember seeing any never Obama's very few ... Bill Clinton when they had the impeachment thing well some people seem to have gotten him back\nBut when when when you Brett Kavanaugh you really had a Bush favorite son and when things got trouble for Brett Kavanaugh George Bush was working as hard as Donald Trump they were on the same page does that allow a road in for the never Trump ...\nWell it certainly was the case and we saw anecdotally um that you know you had folks like Brad Stevens who was one of the lead never Trump has come out with a column saying thank God for Donald Trump Erick Erickson who was one of the original never Trump or saying\nI'm voting for Trump and twenty twenty because of this issue in particular so they're certainly anecdotal evidence to to suggest that the never Trump hers are now sort of have been have been welded due to Trump because of this issue but uh\nExactly cause they occupy spots in the media McCain exactly but but as far as how big they were as a percentage of the Republican base is it was never that big and so it's not it's not generating a big bump in the in the numbers for for Trump\nI been watching a lot of the rallies and they are even loud for rallies and especially when the capital things started heating up and they'll be in an uproar is So Peter Baker the New York times who I think it's fair and I also think he wrote a very ... bear book about Bush forty one uh Bush forty three cut twenty three I meet the press\nThat was the two of his rally this week in Iowa and in uh Pennsylvania and get a charge out of the crowd the crowd loves them there are thousands of people there there are people outside waiting to get in\nBut that can be ephemeral that can also be allusion Aretha any present as we know we're back at President Bush back at President Clinton and look back at president about they had big crowds during mid term elections they were not on the ballot they lost a big seats in those elections that doesn't necessarily meaning but it does pumped him up and he's no longer in that sort of\nA restrained kind of like things are going to go bad a mode and he's on the fence rather than the defense\n[noise] look I agree I mean ... crowd times to cross can be deceptive sometimes the girls can be deceptive you remember in twenty twelve Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan had their final rally in Ohio and they had twenty five thirty thousand people I mean it was a huge deal everyone thought oh my gosh this is that look at these crowds\nUm conversely a but obviously it turned out not to be true conversely Donald Trump had huge crowds in twenty sixteen and that was sort of indicative of the movement on now look a bit of work down in Texas you generating big crowds there there's no question about it he's got energy energy and the base\nBut does that translate into votes I'm not necessarily and certainly not enough votes that he's going to need to win that\nSite or if you can you stick around I have to run okay then I'm going to give you my last question now okay I'm right now the FiveThirtyEight group says eighty percent chance Republicans hold the house and he gives me hold the Senate and increase elite eighty percent chance that house loses a house\nDo average ... we do average and we don't put statistical probability is on it but what we do one of the things that we do do is if we have these new tossup maps so if the election were held today based on where the polls Dana right now\nAs I mentioned earlier in the house Democrats would pick up an average of twenty four and a half feet so they would win this they would when asked by one seat or Republicans would pick up two seats in the Senate based on what the polls stand right now so\nI live one more question Hispanics the big the big deception is that Hispanics gonna run from the president because of his rhetoric on the wall and his uh problems with the immigration and ... and catching releasing things to that nature but it's not coming out in the polls\nWhy it's not because again Hispanics are not a monolithic block monolithic voting bloc and what we're seeing in the data is that younger Hispanics are not as energize to vote but older Hispanics are an older Hispanics are more traditional more conservative um and and so\nThey typically vote more Republican which is why you're seeing Ted Cruz getting thirty percent tax is Dean Heller getting thirty percent of Hispanic vote in Nevada those numbers hold up\nUm it's going to be a bad night for Democrats I cannot give up that much of Hispanic to some of these states\nTom Devon thanks so much real clear politics dot com or that's where to go if you want to find out what's really happening and get away from the rhetoric into cheerleading ...

like\nYeah I mean that's one thing they got to say and also when you saw how crazy it was going after Brett Kavanaugh is high school drinking\nYeah look I I think the\n... the speaker there Brian is is generally right but but I think that there is the big hole here is what do the Democrats really stand for I mean I don't think they nationalize the issue of health care successfully\nI think they are they are and they have been portrayed accurately as a mob as as they're going to impeach Kavanaugh they're gonna teach Trump they're going to they want to raise taxes I mean they're going to come

the race comes down the stretch he fades so what is that what are they really stands\nFor I think that's why their voters are not as galvanized as Republicans because there is no real platform it's at the end of the day\nIt's very hard to elect people if you don't eat it too if you don't have a platform but they are running for something and I think right now the Democrats are just running against

know that that it's because of democratic obstruction that he hasn't done that and then you know in the ... the few rare instances where he has backtracked like you know he promised during the campaign to pull all our troops out of Afghanistan he actually studied the issue very carefully if you read the Woodward book it's actually very comforting the process by which he went through a\nReally tough question the ... and and he can he concluded that he was ...\nTerm if there was another attack coming from Afghanistan and you pull the troops out that's all anyone ever remember and that's where it hit home with him\nYeah absolutely and then you know if you look at it you know he goes off ... when I say that he ... he says\nUh our biggest tax cut in history what is worse to ... to claim that your tax cut is the biggest tax cut in history when it's really not the biggest tax cuts or to take your say or to sell your ... your main legislative achievement Obamacare on on the basis of a lie that you can keep your doctor in your health care plan\nA I Would say that it's a lot worse to tell people they can keep their doctors and health care plan and say whoops I guess that wasn't true ah you know he hasn't sold any any any policies on the basis of ally\nMark when did you go aboard the Bush administration ...\nI've been I was there for the whole eight years I started in the Pentagon and two thousand and one went to the White House in two thousand four and stay till two thousand a\nYear President Bush you watched his dad and Ronald Reagan up close and he was governor how much ramp up time did he need he didn't have much at nine months and nine eleven attack to really feel comfortable this is just more teased into ... looking at the president\nIt's hard to say because I by the time I joined him and we had a lot of face to face contact in two thousand four I was at the Pentagon for the first three years or so I didn't see him in those early years but by the time I ... I engage with him he was you know he was fully in charge and uh you know people who I work who said he was a he was he said he was comfortable from the very beginning\nSo here you're a man named Andrew I'm here as we saw said about when she questioned him last night about him being more comfortable as president cuts in\nI think so I mean I felt comfortable at the beginning other than it was a little surreal to say I'm the president of the United states but I think that's true with everybody\nHow to now I very much for like ... I Do I feel like president you know for a little while it's like Mr presidents or ... even my friends they call me that they don't call me dental and then they called me Mr President I say we please loosen up I've learned\nOver exaggerating since we're talking about over exaggerating the role he's been on\nYou know I Know I don't think we're over that during the ... have been on I think he's got a roll of an enormous accomplishment I mean if you just if you took the litany of accomplishment that this president had and went to every never Trump or\nA three years ago and said we're going to elect a Republican president who is going to pass historic tax reform huge regulatory rollback destroy the ISIS caliphate a you know down the line\nOr most people would sign up for it um it's it's it's a ... you know he's kept his promises of now you know the ... the difference between him and George George W. Bush or even you know to\nSome extent is that he's he's not he's the first\nPresident we've had has never held political office before uh so you know he came out of the world of business he's got a learning curve of how government works versus how business works in and just you know things on foreign policy he just didn't have a lot of experience and all this stuff but he's surrounded himself with really good people he's got a great\nForeign policy team now with the with a bolt in ...\nUh you know and in advising him and you know Gina Haspel at CIA [noise] so you know he's he's you know he's he's learning and he's growing in an office in in a good way\nSo I don't have any problem one thing about him he'll walk over to the cameras and let the press talk to them with a chopper going in the background he just did it in the rain I'll be very head out to Florida to talk about Saudi Arabia so he talked to us brought a duck to Shannon Thursday talked to sixty minutes over the weekend\nAnd I'm Wondering first off from a communication standpoint would you recommend did he do sixty minutes I think\nHe came off well you know from what I didn't want to do anything from beginning to end but\nYou know yeah why not I mean the the key thing you have to worry about where the presidency and a long long period of an eight years is over exposure right so eventually people started tuning presidents out but then they see too much of them it used to be you know Ronald Reagan's day\nSome kind of push in the in the Reagan Administration because you didn't have twenty four hour cable news and all the rest of it\nUh presidents were much less exposed and so when they went out and spoke a people paid much more attention because of the president's talking we better stop and you know pay attention\nAnd now you know and it's not just him mama the George W. Bush presidents are so overexposed and they're so out there all the time\nThat it's you know at some point after you know we're still early in his presidency but some people just get exhausted and and stopped paying attention so he's got to worry about if he's got an eight year term of that you don't want to be so over expose that people aren't listening anymore\nWhen you hear Leslie stall and sixty minutes over time about what went into the interview was a third cut fourteen\nWhy do you think President Trump\nDecided on an interview with you now at this particular time I think he's trying to win the midterm election so the Republicans and I think ... and I know his people believe some more he's out there publicly the stronger the chances are for the Republicans and\nThe better for him and I think the White House has come to believe it's a mistake to try to restrain him to keep them off television to keep them away from these rallies and he loves doing it who really who who gets a lot of energy from crowds and I think he gets a lot of energy wrestling the way he did with me\nYeah I don't think he minds it that's what people don't understand he takes your questions but he doesn't really get ... if you get a noxious gas noxious go nuts sit down but you you actually sit down as we still\nSo here's a here's the problem right is that there's exposure and there's exposure if you're ... if you're doing these interviews and you're a message discipline and your message a goal is to put out there and let people know what what you're accomplishing an office what's your agenda is that's all good\nIt's when the president goes out and completely distract from his successes with the rants about the Mueller investigation\nExhausted by by the by the seeming chaos you know the fact is if you look at his set of accomplishments and then you look at there's there I think we're there was a poll now that he was like at forty one percent which is like the highest he's had one of the highest got one of the highest poll numbers of his presidency but he's still in the low forties\nWith a guy with his level of accomplishment should be in the fifties or sixties and what so what you have to look at it and what's not happening with the Trump presidency is he's not building his base beyond his base right when you come in you got your core base\nAnd then you go out and you reach out and you try and accomplish certain things and you get to get a level of accomplishment that people should be looking at this economy that this is one of the best economies we've had in in in a generation\nAnd they should be saying you know what crops pretty good president maybe I should give him a second shot but he keeps doing all this stuff\nThat just makes people dislike him and ... not not as core base his core base loves everything he does but he's not persuading the persuadable\nBringing them along you know why they want you to see the president\nThat's one thing that you know he got a few of those questions from was we saw biggest surprise since you took over that's when you human on yourself\nWell the biggest surprise for me was when I ... you know you can just tell a story that makes you seen a humble or the magnitude of the office or the biggest you know just so he doesn't do that was we went over independence that's when people say I really like this guy\nAnd he said no I'm going to bull straight ahead not show any vulnerabilities we all make mistakes on my mistake was not blowing up NAFTA early\nBut that just the way he does think there's going to change but I think if someone talk to them and say he want independence human as yourself\nYou know talk about you want to uh you want to bear and game and he sat in the background and you're seeing how well he's playing with the Dc United academy which he is evidently is a great soccer player and just sit in the corner and know what he's sacrifice to come here and seemed fitting in so well with his teammates you realize how much it's so much\nI think he's Thirteen twelve or Thirteen but he's being you know he's like six one that's what those people off [laughter] but\nBut I mean those those are the moments when asked you don't ask him to cry but you just say give me that other side\nOr the end that would be fantastic but I'll I'll give you a perfect example okay so ... African American unemployment is the lowest on record right remember Donald Trump went to that that that African American church in Detroit during the campaign and he said to them whether you vote for me or not I'm going to fight for you and I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to we're going to\nCrack down on crime we're going to ... we're going to crack down on on on drugs were going to create the opportunity and unemployed didn't that people don't know this but like the tax overhaul that he did include something called the opportunities that a bill introduced by Senator Tim Scott that's going to ... that's going to attracted long term investment into inner city communities he ought to go to an African American church and said\nYou know something I promised you I Would fight for you I said what do you have to lose and I'm delivering for you and here's what I've done and again if you don't vote for me that's okay but I just want you to know that I'm president of all Americans I'm going to find out\nHe might not convince the African American community but those persuadable and independents would look at that and say wow the president he's fighting for people who didn't vote for him was I didn't know that African American unemployment was the lowest in recorded\nI'm Sherry in upper new theory on the disappearance of that reporter the Saudi constantly any stemmed bull from President Trump this morning after he says he spoke with the Saudi Arabian king\nI don't want to get his mind but\nIt sounded to me like maybe it is a big\nWe're going to get to the bottom of it\nRather than it also says the king's show me that turkey and Saudi Arabia all working hand in hand very\nOr getting the bottom of what happened\nMaybe the senior foreign correspondent in panel is at the consulate in Istanbul where ... was last seen\nAt some point today a team of Turkish investigators will finally be allowed into the culture that we don't know whether it's going to be a fool\nTrump spoke this morning at the White House just before leaving for Florida to view the aftermath of hurricane Michael ABC senior meteorologist Rob Marcy on I was in the Florida Panhandle\nMichael left thousands homeless\nNineteen thousand people registering for federal assistance FEMA telling residents who only return when they're told it's safe to expect extended power outages stars\nNow blame for at least Eighteen deaths dozens are still missing Harvard is facing a federal lawsuit today over the admissions Asian American students are suing the school saying it discriminates against them bankruptcy for Sears the company filing early this morning ABC's taught ants\nYours is expected to close at least a hundred and fifty stores immediately\nCurrently the company operates roughly seven hundred Sears and k-mart stores and employs about Seventy thousand people Sears began as a mail order catalogue company and began operating retail locations in Nineteen twenty five but it was the largest retailer in the U.S until Nineteen eighty nine when Wal Mart surprised at British prime minister Theresa May is just told parliament the u._k. and he was made quote real progress\nIn Brexit talks this is ABC News\nMine number two does not look like a number two I don't know what to call it is there a number three [noise]\nPeople for for fleas\nAnd close to the restroom\nMiddle seat with the stomach problems\nMy fear of flying [noise]\nSound like you if it does you could be one of the many people with the digestive condition called ... sufficiency or eat PI even if you don't know what he ... he is you might know the symptoms frequent diarrhea gas bloating stomach pain if you have even just one of these symptoms you could still heavy\nPI because not everybody experiences he pee on the same way which is why it's so important to open up to your doctor about oh your symptoms and the good news is\n... manageable so we don't keep a lid on it good why identify E.

with us in Phoenix Hi Jim how are you\nI'm great Dave how are you today that are than I deserve what's up [noise] [noise] well\nI'm excited that uh you know you and you of lead my wife and I on a on a clear path to a much better situation not that we were in a really rough spot but it feels a lot better be where we are now I'm In um [noise] we are very quickly approaching the end of baby step three in January will be\nSix months plus and so my ah my focus now is four or five and six and reading your book and going through the class was actually more than once and um\nWhen I'm really faced with is our house we moved in and two thousand six and a we pay two fifty to a according to the low and you know casual conversation we're not we're not at the two fifty two so after you know twelve plus years were not back to our original ... you know purchase price [noise] um\nThat's where your yeah it no you know Phoenix got hit really hard by the housing bubble and we ... really hard I'm Sorry I'm In a lot of people even across the street or\nWe're still not back there even or you know I guess maybe it's our neighborhood worse than others but [noise] um so we're not there yet\nAs we approach four or five and six steps four or five and six I'm you know I have two teenage sons were going to be faced with college here soon I'm very excited to get back into our a retirement planning which we put on hold back at the beginning and so now I'm just trying to figure out if we just\nForget the house and not put anything\nWent over there that are in order of priority for five six but done simultaneously so the way that might sound would be you start with Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement that's by ... period\nUnless you're in an emergency situation you do that now I'm ... and then you move on to kids college you've got college looking down you're looking down the barrel gun on college and so that's probably going to take everything above and beyond your Fifteen Percent going into retirement and your rights houses probably on hold for a little while\nWhen you've got two teenagers and no college funds you got some catching up to do right\nYes sir you know and so you're going to probably that's ... five is probably going to suck up all your extra money\nRight now because of the situation you're in the age of the kids um before you get to six so you're just gonna keep paying your house payment for now and get these kids through school and as quick as you get school quote unquote taken care of\nA meaning that you know you've got enough money for them to finish without that then you start reaching over and knocking extra home the house at that point\nAnd the value of the house or the ... are the ... the value of the house increasing or decreasing during that time I Would just dictate whether I keep that house but it wouldn't dictate whether Russia which the baby steps\nRight and is there an unconventional thinking that maybe we haven't thought of as far as the house I you know we're we did do ah\n[laughter] I Love it or did your immigration problem a United Kingdom United Kingdom okay and where did you grow up\nUm I was born in India I immigrated to the u._k. when I was Seventeen\n... there are no [laughter] well\nUh where did you live in the u._k. a city called ... off right pretty good size city it is it's it's a nice at a number legitimacy and you weren't a social outcasts there for being frugal now but um I was like oh what do you live in the United states um I live in San Diego\nOh there it is [laughter]\nYou might be a social outcasts there now I'm getting okay there are people and certainly in San Diego that have common sense as well\nSo um I don't know what crowd you're running with there but um it's different than the one you ran with an India or the one you ran with an ... for sure because they have been bitten by the bug of consumerism\nBut plenty of Americans um\nIn any city um will or not consider us social out cash for having good common sense values now or that's assuming you're you know you if your clothes are not necessarily expensive but they are at least clean mhm and your watch um I'm I'm I'm worth\nGo well over ten million dollars is buildings worth twenty million that you're standing in is paid for and that's my watch it pretty on assuming I'm like it costs about a hundred and fifty bucks\nA problem is I don't care what you think and if you think I feel like I'm cool because I have a watch I don't really think you're cool so um you know that's the thing you got to decide who you want to influence you\nUm and where you want to end up so what brought you to the United states why did you come here\nIt was um a childhood dream that I had ... um I read somewhere that um\nBecause this country guarantee freedom to all people the Supreme Court ruled that no one can be false to a re signed the pledge of allegiance and that just got hold of me I was about twelve years old mhm and I try to uh apply that in my school in India as I get a naive I was ... um\nYeah I did I listen to the principal and the fact of the principal one day when I make it to the United states you wouldn't be able to do that to me anymore\nSo freedom that is correct freedom okay and now people are\nTrying to take your freedom from you with ah forcing you to conform\nTo something using a social pressure but not all\nOkay and so I Would treat it exactly the same way as hard as you have fought through you know twenty nine years of your life to get to be standing here um I wouldn't surrender my freedom that have tried to stuff\nAre all in the name of someone being impressed generally speaking a here's a good rule of thumb people who are impressed by things that you have or aware or not impressive people\nWhen you get inside of their hearts and inside of their minds they're what we would call shallow and so um the very people you might attract by having some bling by having some jewelry or some watches or the proper\nClothing are the people that you really don't want influencing your future and your character in your life you've paid a huge\nPrice to get to be here and enjoy the freedom and so you're a man of character and um the uh ... and the show the people that are telling you that are probably not people I Would want\n'em to be influencing me I might want to influence them and try to help them but if I were in your your your shoes I Would say that doesn't need to be your inner circle that are teaching you how to live mentor and you decide billing you and so forth um and so\nYou know check out a folks that have a little more depth of character and aren't judging you based on what you drive now again it needs to be if you drive an old car\nYou don't take good care of it but um it doesn't it doesn't need to be dirty and doesn't need to be missing the same thing with your clothing or your hair or whatever else you take care of the things that you have been and managed them but most wealthy people or do not by\nA expensive things to impress other people\nAre a few do but most don't that's how they became wealthy now they do by some expensive things that I buy some expensive things but there for me\nAnd for my family and for my wife and that kind of thing and they're not for what someone thinks I'm I'm I've got a really nice home but I didn't buy it for somebody else a we live there you know in what you think about are good or bad doesn't really matter to me\nAnd so I I don't know is that helpful is that helpful part of this year is that what you were looking answer I think I needed to hear that that'll come what are you doing for a living I'm looking IT IT okay what do you do a developer you're developing okay All right well you probably need to come to nice when work rush\n[laughter] Saudis in order to meet you sir if you've got quite a story brother quite a story Weldon thanks for stopping by open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five ... this was the day Ramsey show D is with us in Atlanta Hi Dee how are you\n[noise] Hi I'm well thank you for asking sure what's up [noise] um\nI wanted to ask if I should say my tax come here and she reported off information um on our fending paying taxes and other without being being charged that ten thousand dollars\nYou're being charge ten thousand dollars in penalties yeah mhm not taxes\nI Want to pay their taxes and penalties yeah okay I mean it shows like a percentage on the information mhm well that\nFalse information she lied intentionally and you\nGroove that yeah\nIs that we don't own she claimed that we're paying for cars that we don't own the plane claims that we're paying 'em from mileage for their business again that we don't own\nThat's weird yeah I mean does your husband have something to do with this when he doesn't have heat that we should see what you know\nI mean they just randomly\nOut of thin air she'd dreamed up a business that you don't have cars you don't have an mileage that you don't have\nRight now we have a church but you know churches don't get tax so there was no there's nothing in the um the the documentation that mentioned anything about the church that they use our uh I mean number of either five but when the number ... ... this random\nAre you are you doing a work outside the five oh one C. three as of venture lists that you're being paid uh outside of the church no you're not you don't do speaking engagements shouldn't get paid for that on the side\nNo everything's through the church or a hundred percent\nYes and even for they charge me don't make any money for the church in his own entity we both work independently frail another company\nActually you have your by a vocational pastors okay yeah okay um well I\nI think if there are I I don't know you need to see an attorney is the answer the question 'cause I don't know whether you have grounds to sue someone or not this is a very bizarre thing as someone would do it is just out of the blue eye is not a mirror mistake I mean it's a complete fabrication\nAnd so um I mean this was ... it sounds like fraudulent activity on your behalf now you've signed the tax returns though didn't you\nKnow everything is David I'm you know but you had to see this\nHi aid you may have trouble I don't know you need to see an attorney and ask them\nA hot and my guess is the most you can help to get back will be the penalties the taxes you already ... and you're still owe the penalties are to them not being paid on time due to this um and I think that's the most you might get back I don't know have some attorney [noise]\n\nDid you know that if you combine that data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every American has had their\nPersonal info compromised her act over fifty percent of our listeners and viewers tell us that they or someone in their family has been a victim and Seventy percent of those folks have had it happen more than once she this is unbelievable wants the you get your info\nThe risk never goes away and they can use it whenever and however they choose it truly has become an issue of not if\nBut when that's why they only plan I've ever recommended is through Zander insurance I actually sat down with them and we put together a plan\nThat I felt provided the best protection but didn't waste dollars on things you could easily do yourself or we're just gimmicks the key is getting protected before you're a victim and it's too late ... dot com or call eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two we're all at risk\nAnd it doesn't make sense to wait numbers don't lie that's ... dot com or eight hundred three five six forty two eighty to\n'em for Christmas and allow us to you know do the program at home we kind of live in the middle of nowhere and then I told him that I Would ... the next day or to talk to him and I was a little nervous because the car with kind of pets and I didn't think he'd\nThat's driving the tractor\n[laughter]\nHe's like I'm not driving the minivan but yet but he I texted him and surprisingly he was like most\nWhat is ...\nAnd I think that you are you are ready to you are sick of this Oh absolutely yeah yeah and then you come home and you guys go to financial piece university\nBut we didn't end up going through the program at home the home study I Gotcha yeah our church an hour and a half away right right and I was\nNot now nowadays you can just watch it all on line but it's different than yeah very good you guys so what is the key to getting out of that you made already one thousand and Eighteen months what a dog so I can sell for\nGetting paid off as an hour and then we got about an eight thousand dollar cash settlement on top of that\nOkay so you got twenty five of the eighty one was that one most yeah All right and then what what is the key to getting out of debt than you did it in Eighteen months\n[noise] um I Would have to say for for me it was communication\nClose communication to where both of us know exactly what's going on with everything all the time rather than in the past where I had largely let her kind of control everything\nBeing ... which she she did a as good a job as I could possibly expect exactly why but she was by herself you know but she was by herself I didn't have a full understanding of what was going on right how it was being done exactly where we were I knew small numbers I did not have the big picture mhm\nAnd you know guys being visual creatures the spreadsheet gave me the big picture ... in a color coded clarity\nSo it's definitely a huge last summer the control when pat not involved but you gained um someone else's shoulders\nIs beyond flabbergasted to me because\nHe got so on board that what that and God on if we had a huge impact on this because he was told there'd be no more extensions and that was back like just a few months before we started and then I'm about to\nBe about a year into it\nHe gets a call he he was home during one of his trip and he gets a call from work saying they had just gotten back three weeks before but they want to needed him to come back a month early\nAnd he gets off the phone and he's like or do I do and I'm like I don't know do you want to go back and he's like what what what to do with our debt and so I\nWe were out of town and I don't even know how I got my spreadsheet their numbers if I just knew um but I sat down and he was sitting at my brother's house actually calculating\nAnd I'm like you know what if you do this we can be out of debt in June\nUm instead of you know another year and a half and it was like wow he jumped on board and he he actually told them that he extended for the the month you know if they would give them an extra two weeks on the end as well that would guarantee us to get it all paid off enough time\nAnd congratulations you guys ... you got a copy of ... returns for books for you that is the next chapter in

about this whole thing with the show gave the Saudis you like look here's the deal\nWe killed him but there's caviar when me do it was like oh no oh why oh we went through\nLike these guys are new bees and they weren't really like they didn't quite understand and they just went to like now it's up to Trump to figure out what what the deal is\nWe're working very close with Saudi Arabia with through and they were trying to figure out what happened they didn't want to know what happened to also so a lot of people are working on\nNow the question is pretty simple what do you do if you're

difference between a human being and a person of power I Know it sounds horrible they're all\nPeople but this person had influence like you and I don't have in a in a place in in the world that at times uh needs a voice and needs influence and seem to kind of be above the fray and it was\nIt's very interesting so what do you do if you're Trump\nRight if you're from the question is going to be by a lot of people because you're seeing tons of actors\nI said this today to to somebody it feels a lot like this is apartheid in South Africa you're seeing businesses you're seeing all kinds of of

at all so if you're Trump you have to ask\nYourself the question what do I do and it's tough it's tough\nYou don't want to lose all those you know billions of dollars that are floating into American companies you don't want to lose the potential growth in businesses and or people keeping their jobs but you do need to send a message and what does that message going to be and is that going to be

Benson shows your Twitter you can tweet at us\nFor all the talk of we're going to get into recession we're going to have these things this is going to happen I'm like you guys know that's how bad our recession will be I don't know but I Will tell you one thing\nWhat's coming in the future that isn't being talked about needs to be talked about you know twenty thirty forty years ago you come out of college you have very little if any debt whatsoever\nYou could store to get on with your life you could start making money and you could take that earnings that you had because of that college degree and you could put that back into the economy we live in a different world now kids are coming out with hundreds of thousands upon thousands of dollars of massive\nDebt that is turning into hundreds of thousands of potentially millions of dollars in debt over years and instead of putting that money back into the economy like buying homes and things that come with homes what they're going to be doing is essentially trying to survive and that it's going to put a huge dent in our future economy\nOn student loan debt I'm I think it's important that people will be able to borrow to make what maybe the most important lesson of their lives which is in their education\nA so overall I think for women to invest in yourself is this something we should we should foster subject to a couple of important Coffey as first it's very important that people understand\nInformed decisions informed decisions are huge and there's a reason that they need to make informed decisions because I've got friends who graduated college twenty plus years ago\nThey're still paying off their debts\nAnd their debts are nothing compared to their kids debts and there soon to be kids get to I mean these debts are massive\nAnd when you have the government stepping in saying we're going to guarantee all these loans you can't get rid of these laws all of a sudden you are making a house payment\nRight for your education\nWhich is going to strike it's going to put a huge dent in what we're doing as we try to grow\nOur economy your kids coming out with three hundred thousand dollars in debt\nAnd they're looking around and they're getting a job and they're making a thousand dollar a month payment or eight hundred dollar a month payment on some of these things and they're going to be paying these things off for years and years and years and money that should go into the economy because that they would become a a productive member of society it's going to be tough\nBecause that's going into education and when you get the government involved the way it is the kind of money that they're guaranteeing these kids they're taking it out willy nilly and on top of that they're taking out other debt to be able to live while they're trying to go through school and it is going to eventually explode\nThe second thing is um I think alone among all kinds of dead or we don't allow student loan debt to be discharged Yvette right or the um I'd be at a loss to\nExplain why that should be the case so it's something and it does is fiscal policy this is something for you and not something for the fed but we do see is instead research shows and other research shows you do start to see\nLonger term negative effects on people who can't pay off their student loans that hurts their credit rating it impacts the entire half of their economic life\nThat's something to think of it we may have a loss\nEven a fraction of the way that their parents live until their parents eventual he passed away and leave them stuff to get themselves out from underneath this giant enormous burden of that now granted they took it on themselves\nBut do you think about it\nIf an Eighteen year old comes due today and says give me a hundred and fifty thousand dollar loan you're going to be like\nShut up never going to happen\nIf an Eighteen year old comes you did say I need a hundred fifty thousand alone because I Want to go to school in a basket\nWeaving liberal arts degree from some college that's going to I'm going to come out with a degree after four or five years on top of that extra debt that I was you know taking credit cards to pay for these kinds of things of life that I wanted to lead just to survive you're going to be like oh that's fine\nBut what it does long term and when you think micro right now it doesn't affect it but think macro\nSo that's the that's the public policy argument for us to do something about student loan debt and the and the way we structure\nA higher education financing my question for you is do you see this as a macroeconomic risk it will over time it's not something you can pick up in the day that right now but as this goes on and a student loan continues to grow and become larger and larger than it absolutely could hold back gross\nYeah and I think it's going to and I think for all the talk of the new housing bubble that's coming in a lot of these other things over a trillion dollars in debt the kids and and young adults and even older adults boomers have a ton of it\nBut it's still sitting out there that is not going to be able to be discharged nor should it be because why would you let somebody do that but the fact that you're willing to go out and say you know what I Need this degree so bad\nThat I'm willing to spend three hundred thousand dollars and even if it's a hundred thousand dollar loan think about how long it's going to take you to pay that off he just massive and what it's going to do for us in the future I don't think we are talking enough about it but it's coming it is three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... she had mentioned shows your Twitter you can tweet us ...\nThis report is wrong

and I like would you you know you say there is we need to go to where the puck is going to be not where the puck is and I think they're they're in lies the\n... the issue because we're we're teaching kids right now to just kinda go where where things are and we're telling my son's eight I Want him to get a ... have an understanding that the world that he's living in today is going to be totally different in ten years as fast as technology goes when you look at education across the board not just higher education\nDo you think would make a huge impact on the future of education\nAre the ones that so I have small children my my daughter's three and a half my son is two and this is very top of mind for me when I think of um elementary and high school education especially but it applies\nYou know throughout a career I I think there are a lot of things that education I was doing wrong today but the the one that I think it's insurmountable is it trains people to look to someone else to set their priority\nRight if they're teaching the wrong things you know I can supplement that at home if they are not hiring people with the right skills you know you can you can get that in other places the information's wrong you can find it somewhere else but this idea that you know you're going to go to whatever the educational context is all metro school high school college whatever\nRight you're going to sit in the class do what you're told and and suddenly someone else is going to tell you how things are going to work someone else is going to tell you what is important someone else is going to tell you what is and isn't worth paying attention to\nThat causes all the most important parts of our of our brain of our faculties that we need to thrive in the modern world it atrophy\nRight 'cause you need to be the people in the driver's seat if we want to be able to figure things out in the future\nOh absolutely and I don't think that you know again it it it's very frustrating because we have this one size fits all education system but I don't think really works\nAnd I just it it's it's a very tough thing I look at this I have an eight year old\nAnd I see the world he's living in he's in the stem school does all these kinds of things that you know\nThat that that it did it looks great it sounds great but I often wonder one of the things you're talking about in here and you just talked about a bit of that but like the fortitude you notice how tough keep going when the going gets tough because I think that's one of the things that that is missing\nIn this day and age especially with the younger generation is you put stuff in front of them and it doesn't work it seems like they just collapsed under it and that is everything\nOne of the very best intentions you notes but the road to help pay for good intentions but in an effort to protect our kids from everything\nWe've taken away their ability to deal with things that are difficult to make hard decisions\nBreak the key to Fort Hood shooting a lot of ways it's not about not going through that diverse experiences there's always fascinating research ACTs at first childhood experiences like traumatic really horrible things that we don't want to happen to anybody child or adult\nAnd there is a huge correlation between the more of these adverse childhood experiences to have the less likely you are to be successful the more likely you are to be incarcerated\nLifetime earnings are lower all that kind of stuff but it doesn't always play out that way and it's not about the experience it's about the lack of support and reinforcement after him through that experience where I had thought about\nYou know this thing that I wanted to happen I certainly didn't and it sucks it's about\nThing didn't happen the way I wanted and the socks and nobody told me that I'm Still going to be okay\nRight so it's not about shielding people from those challenging experience it's about putting them an enabling them not putting them in in situations the enabling them to have those experiences and learn from them there's some fascinating research I was looking at the other day about risky play\nWriting about when you you look at children today um it's like their whole environment is basically bubble raft you look at as a child playground today and like everything on the ground is like super soft and there's nothing they can pull off of work bump into and so it's like the extreme of essentially\nHaving your kids the double route but the opposite of that it's risky play well we used to do when we were kids right you know jumping on rocks and climbing trees and you do those things and occasionally are going to fall down and scrape urine whatever [noise]\nHe used a drug consumption as a teenager a teen pregnancy all kinds of things because when as a child who are never given the opportunity to have to make decisions that are hard in the moment and\nYou don't have that muscle you're not able to make the importance and difficult decisions so it's a combination of empowering\nKids to to be in situations where they might screw up and the circumstances and outcomes may not be ideal you know with guard rail to keep them safe course as much as possible but you know let them have the opportunity to screw up to be there to help them not you know your perfect and everything's okay but\nLook you can get through this you have what it takes the lesson here is to try harder he'd do something differently the lesson is not to give up you can handle that and they're here we're here to support that stuff\nOut of the ... early ... you know and and I love that you know to me\nUh it's funny my son's a and he's always says you know mom always wants to bubble wrap me that's all she wants to ... save can she make me and you're just and I'm I'm you know I'm a seventies raised to it I'm like yeah you know what it's good to eat dirt because you know you won't get sick like that's how my mom or your kind of raises you're going to get hurt don't do that again\nAnd ... we've taken that away and I think we take away those obstacles for kids\nIt really hurts them I said the other day Danny that\nI look at it in in the world we live in now\nAnd kids nowadays it's play dates everything is controlled but then we we look on YouTube and all these things they tried to do crazy stuff because I feel like they're so sheltered that they will try to drink the you know I eat a pound of cinnamon or whatever they possibly can because I feel like that's the only freed them they're getting\n... and they're going into those like really crazy extreme challenges without any ... you know how you know we all we went to college we have time to to\nWith one or two beers you know three
