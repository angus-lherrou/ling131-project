and you know reverse the cursing all nine yards all analytics baseball football is becoming analytics basketball's becoming analytics everything is becoming analytics why shouldn't and politics has been heading there\nBut imagine building candidates specifically based on analytics\nAnd I think we're going to get more and more of that\nUh and I think the human side of politics is gonna is gonna be taken out and that's something that that people are going to I'm I'm telling you guys we're gonna have to start understanding of the way this is going and how big these companies are and when

and get the call\nYeah that all sounds great but you know the reality is is there's money in hate there's money and discord a politics the beauty of politics they never want to give up what they have which is power\nSomething now that in many ways I mean normally big business goes to court power where do they go\nThey go to Washington DC they bring their money with them and they say hey we want to court power you guys are the ... and the Dutch is is the royals of our time and for us to court favor with you we must then give you stuff\nWe must we must give you a tribute and that's what they do get some of that power given to them as well but now you're going to have something that is more powerful than even them which is the way to control information\nWhich will help them\nSo rather than going to them they could say hey we're you know we're able to control the flow of information and that control in itself is more powerful than what you guys do because we can disseminate information the way that we see fit we have thousands upon thousands hundreds of thousands of engineers that are doing these things\nSo much so that they don't even understand the analytics they're putting together this is a big thing\nThis is so while we human beings maybe go and we want this one that we look at social media and the way that things go and you see what it takes and social media it doesn't take millions it takes a few to to to create such a skirt\nAs to force changes in companies in all kinds of things that's scary\nI said it last week man I continue that I've talked to several politicians who've said that they fear not their entire constituent base but a few who have power and influence inside of social media that can be held for them\nAnd many of those people that may be helping them have very little to do if anything would their constituents and the basis where they are but that fear factor is real and I think this is going to be a bigger play and then when you've

... attack in Kandahar where did he come from does this look like an al ... trained outfit or not Taliban ... outfit and is there a difference good evening to\nEvening John yet to answer your second question there isn't much of a difference al ... and the Taliban operate hand in hand we believe they train together we know they fight together on the battlefield or the assassin who killed ... arguably the most powerful\nFigure in was argument for the most powerful figure in southern Afghanistan certainly in Kandahar Province a key provinces in the country in the face of the Taliban\nSo uh what the Taliban did was they infiltrated this assassin they notice ... to China and he became a bodyguard for the governor of Kandahar who was also seriously wounded in this attack\nAnd uh yeah they will treat him he ... the Taliban released a video of him speaking\nOf talking you know without fighting the Afghan government and within Aires first in this video is in training at Taliban training camp and as your listeners know we talk about these Taliban camps all the time they're often ridiculed by some saying\nYou know the training is Mickey Mouse or whatnot but when we you know when you have an attack of this level of sophistication that are almost killed general Miller that will do this\nYou know you we we can't dismiss would we would we see on these videotapes the Taliban are preparing for the U.S departure and they're going to go at the Afghan government full tilt when the U.S is because\nThe logic of this attack bill is that it could have gone forward and any moment and that they chose the Taliban chose to launch the attack when these senior American officer was present I guess at that point that guarantees that it makes it into a global news\nAbsolutely so yes I mean I I Would guess that the journalistic who's the chief of police in Kandahar he probably was one of the two prime targets but yeah this attack appears to be well planned for the visit of general

U.S has been bogged down in a combat that is very difficult to summarize since the attack on New York and Washington within a month but here we are asking ourselves how is the Taliban doing as it advances district after district\nBill you either a report that how the Afghan population lives in districts that are no longer in government control that he is\nA way of talking about how ineffective the central government is in ... are in alliance with the U.S and our allies are partners they're\nA articulate a little more what does that mean they're outside of government control what does it mean for their lives and for the future good evening again\nShot yeah the first to break down the numbers I mean we we estimate that nine percent\nOf the population lives in areas that are controlled by the Taliban and another forty one percent are living in an area that may mean a\nCertain percentage is controlled by the Taliban is controlled by the government these are typically the district that where most of the fighting is where the Taliban and the Afghan military are going up or would it be like for that we want to be or would it be\nUm again this is this this will be the most difficult probably even more difficult than in ... in areas under Taliban\nControl um areas under Taliban control you're going to get their ... you know whipping and you know they're all the craziness and they're Islamic law that we've seen over the last several decades\nI'm In the areas that are contested\nOf you know you could be living in a town that's in contested area that may be under government control or influence\nAnd the next town over a cell is Taliban control there is often a lot of fighting in between these areas you're ... if you were living in one of those areas that might be government controlled\nYou're fearful that the Taliban could be coming next the next day that the Taliban are coming to tax you that the Taliban to come to do all those horrible things with the Taliban does and you know what we're trying to to to show people here is\nLooked at the situation in Afghanistan is far more dire than the U.S military the U.S government is trying to tell us they're trying to paper over this situation so they can cut a peace deal with the Taliban but the numbers\nWhen we analyze the situation we can't come to any other any\n... underline that bill that President Trump made a speech I Believe it was the spring of Seventeen talking about his commitment to Afghanistan and\nThat time we believed they were going to extend their commit to extend the deployment of us troops and our allies in Afghanistan to to look that way given the retreat\nNo if it doesn't and what happened is you know the president said we're gonna we're gonna make the Taliban were in a beat

idea that we can cause a military defeat to the Taliban and just decided to do negotiations um by all the indication Trump once\nI just think if that's the U.S policy we need to be very clear about what is going to happen to Afghanistan when the U.S leaves\nYou have a map long war journal I recommend everybody go to the map you get it right away they break it down into government control contested Taliban control and unconfirmed mobile\nAnd it very much looks like they're surrounding the mountainous center of the country I see them particularly dominating the area around Capitol is that the way to read this man\nYeah that is I mean the Taliban control and test numerous districts\nIn the provinces just south and east and north of the capital and I said look if the if the if the U.S wants to cut a peace deal with the Taliban\nLet's say the Taliban you know decided hey we'll make some agreement should as U.S forces are gone the Taliban are going to turn on the Afghan government they said they will share power as like when you look at the geography and you look at this map or they see who holds the upper hand here in Afghanistan\nYes and it's not just around ... certainly dominated around Kandahar which is the main uh trade route and also smuggling room slum or Pakistan and the Baluch area\nAnd then all along the Iran border look at that bill along an around Iraq all contested by the Taliban has a lot\nOf effort in the west and even shocking is the north in the areas that you know really should be the former northern alliance struggled a lot of these

Afghanistan to take over that turf\nAnd part of what you've seen these ... these nations that came out last week we were talking about the first segment is that Iran is actually even given orders to top commanders in some of the in some instances according to the U.S Treasury Department this is very\nInteresting in an amazing development the you have already see that are ... with the Taliban in

the vote next week but the blow to the nation or the very hard blow on attack on a synagogue innocent people shot\nWe're told and the allegation is against a man who as\nAt this point appeared in court he used to be charged with hate crime I don't know what else is going ahead but their federal crimes here\nAre the puzzle David for me is that this has been a threat routinely against religious Jewish religious organizations in Europe the surprise was that it comes to America the the nation where the Jewish people\nGood evening to you David yeah get any\nJohn and look I think it was quite a shock because it's it's the type of attack that we feel like we hear of overseas weather in the middle east\nOr in Europe but you know my colleagues of suppliers the Washington Examiner a reporter this evening in a really great piece um anti Semitism in in violent some arms or warm trends meant to be violent has been a prevalent over the past Twenty years or so\nI think it's something we're paying a lot more attention to that obviously when something was horrific\nAs an anti Semitic massacre occurs like it in in the synagogue in Pittsburgh\nIt seems to magnify everything I also think is because I'm In part and heard a plane in American history where rhetoric and anxiety and general happens to be up\nAnd I think the people's nerves are afraid to look over the past couple of years the

border in\nVarious stages [noise]\nTexas Arizona New Mexico California\nThe news from Central America and from Mexico is that\nThere are there maybe two or more caravans marching\nYoung men we see video now that some of them are violent as you can understand in that heat with very little prospect of sticks test leaving their homes and marching north for unclear purposes [noise]\nAh ... the first caravan is now about four thousand according to the latest ... to reach the U.S border perhaps around the time of the election so\nGentleman the polls are moving about who can tell David I start with you is the caravan a story about the poll or is this split screen election\nWell I think it's a split screen election in part because we're I think kind of back to where we were at the beginning of summer which is\nA house that is poised to flip to the Democrats may not but I think it's it's it's sort of headed there and the Senate that is not going to and you have two different battleground cheer you up in\nA suburban and ... battleground where Indians of Trump or\nAre mixed at best a very poor and voters interested in and making changes for all sorts of reasons or and then in the Senate you have a very pro Trump Republican battleground bunch of red states where Republicans are poised to not only keep their majority but adds to it\nAnd so I think things like the caravan may be a helpful in the Senate races\nWhere we know the Kavanaugh episode woke up a complacent Republican electorate and got them energizing the caravan of certainly not going to be on helpful um and it may be helpful in some of these races although I don't know if Republicans need much more help\nHouse and I think part about it there are now so many competing issues a letter helpful to Democrats were helpful in terms of where they're going to steer independence and that I think they're going to overtake the care of an issue but in part it's just because we have two different battle\nA much fun the Trump voters in twenty sixteen were not routinely people that the Republican Party counted on for voting I'm being very diplomatic wondering around this story are they going to turn out is there an issue they care about or did they wait for twenty\nI spoke tonight with John McLaughlin a Republican pollster who says the most important issue next Tuesday will be does the Trump voter turnout\nAnd that's why Trump is so assiduously going to Trump centers in Fifteen twenty states are running six rallies between now and the election trying to get out the vote\nOr he's not going to any counties where he was close who lost to Hillary\nUm we will know that and I'm I suspect them the whole thing about the caravan is about driving up the Trump vote saying that you know I'm president but do no time for relaxation the country is still in danger\nAnd that's why Trump uses such Marshall language even the tone that would seem inappropriate after Pittsburgh he's trying to basically say we're still in a war footing which means we have to demand sacrifices from you go vote\nThat is to have a question\nA general we're talking you know obviously it's a mid term it's a base election both sides want to turn their supporters out are you seeing any single issue that is really swaying the independence one way or another David\nI don't know if we're seeing a single issue I think ultimately Trump is the factor and were Trump can be helpful and John mentioned where he's going to be traveling\nTrump is helping to turn out his base and what we're seeing unlike a year ago is very little separation between the\nBut Trump didn't always going along with but does at the moment\nI think in the house it's working against Republicans by and large you just have so much energy and money even where Republican enthusiasm is kicked up\nUm they're still fighting across such a big Plainfield it's become so why even today the Republican House campaign committee\nBought advertising in Charleston South Carolina in a district\nThat a lot to Tim Scott a few years ago and really shouldn't be a problem for the Republicans but it all say they're just so many house districts are competing for because of all his anger and a mixed that has been motivated by a a rejection of Trump that's what's making it very hard for for Republicans in terms of the house fight\nJohn you know the first billionaire president ever elected as apparently encourage lots of other billionaires to go take 'em down\nA Michael Bloomberg was obviously running for the Democratic nomination won some scallops of all he has dumped I think in the last day or two six million dollars in a single house race Dana Rohrabacher is in California\nWhich is now I think the most expensive house race in the country almost thirty six million dollars spent\nThe amount of money that is poured into this widened the playing field but David mentioned ... we have never seen a party control Congress and be so swamped in terms of resources by the opposition party which is a minority or it's almost as if K Street spiritual donors are irrelevant\nThese super PACs are by the way Democrats by the way no longer complaining about Citizens United you'll notice these super PACs and these billionaires are dominating the playing field financially in the selection of the Citizens United has not benefiting the Democrats not the Republicans\nAnd John six million dollars from Bloomberg I one district in one district because he wants to house that's it\nWants to credit for turning the house he wants to read it for carrying certain\nWell if the Democrats take the house you'll hear more rumblings about that or it may be a plausible but she just she she looks at Richard Nixon Richard Nixon was given up forgetting right

together to address this subject that once and for we have to make security a priority\nAnd while law enforcement everybody has its role and government has to help it's got to start with the community and help every community because the more we do\nThe more the police can do and and that we fill in the gaps that they don't have to do\nAnd this is it has to be a priority and the the you know it's expensive it's difficult\nWhen you have such a plethora of schools and synagogues and other institutions so much infrastructure here but we have to find a way to improve it and that means it has to be

recognition of Israel and to the Palestinian state was established it was an established because the Palestinians have an elaborate to establish having the gross shaded\nSo they're talking about cutting security tides and economic ties based on the thing to Ninety four Paris economic and political and if this goes back and get actually voted on as a binding measure that will be very dangerous

he was the foreign policy advisor for Marco Rubio none other than Marco Rubio the guy that had never heard of your site infowars and when he was holding hearings about ah what was happening on social media free speech he wanted to make\nYou to testify he didn't want anybody else that have been shadow band at that point and now they've done it for more than eight hundred sites and this guy was bragging about the fact that they had just shut it down he said that so they can just invent stories and get repeated and spread throughout different sites so we're just starting to push back\nJust this last week Facebook began starting to take down sites so this is just the beginning\nAnd as he's talking about it he's he's bemoaning the fact\nThat foreign powers can take advantage of our open political system so what's the solution about ... to close the political system or for this guy\nHe said oh you need us an email to set up a Facebook or Twitter account so let's shut that down as well let's make that difficult let's register everybody was some kind of biometric in order to get on the Internet this is where these people are going so the key Alex\nIs that we can try to fight them and there's there's plenty that has already been done to fight this we've already had a Supreme Court decision going back to Nineteen forty six of people wanting to pay any attention to it\nIt's a a a situation where the Supreme Court said you cannot even if you own the the public square 'cause privately owned it was a a town that was owned by one corporation and they had a lady who wanted to pass out some Jehovah's Witness literature\nShe bought 'em all the way the Supreme Court 'cause they threw out of the public square they said even if the public squares privately owned you can't censor it and we've had Jack Dorsey say over and over again one of the battle sure where the Twitter\nMe say well of course it's unconstitutional what at every level it's illegal to have a cartel of government\nUnelected bureau bureaucrats with international foundations and the un also the Rockefeller's and this whole crew a involve trying to destroy our borders trying to shut down our speech trying to take our guns and that was announced today\nFacebook and Twitter are saying we're not going to let you talk about guy\nHis so now they're moving that weren't firearm and just like in China they're removing a Taiwanese emoji is wanting to do whatever they want these people are flaming tyrants they All right\nAnd they had and all this other horrible stuff\nBut it is getting to the point where they are like Hitler\nAnd you know as they keep saying that we're getting violence and then you don't want us there clearly walking down the road we're all these New York times and all these leftist leaders are the core Evelyn of tell Joe and Hitler and ... and ... I mean I mean they really are\nInto that territory back in time and they are supporting authoritarian China and Google and apple are all helping them round up this and and kill them show an F. word slave factories apple does showing they do that here they could and you know what they're moving the needle that way ...\nOh yeah yeah they they don't care about the first amendment they don't care about the second amendment they don't care about the Supreme Court decisions they're going to go ahead with us so there's another aspect to this Alex I talked to adjust and tab earlier today on the program\nOr the morning program and he's got a um I found a new foundation a decentralized a computer for the Internet because it subscribe them or you can find them at subscribe them gotten that they're currently in beta testing\nBut what they're doing is they're setting up something that is a next generation to VPN and we're just four notes because BP and only gives you a window that doesn't give you an annuity are they and none of my assistant a number of ways but we just ... able to penetrate the firewall of China as well as Russia and Iran\nAnd I said well that's fine but what about you know you can get Facebook now when they're on Facebook is during the censorship here and so he says well the next stage\nIs it they're going to do their own hosting because that's what we've seen with gab and the third stages of going to provide modernization for this and one of the important things about this Alex is there an upfront about the funding they got funded with crowd sourcing\nUh funds and then once this thing is operating it's going to operate kind of like you have with crypto currency mining souls you use it you pay a little bit for it and then as you're providing your service as a note you're going to earn money back which is what\nThe real father he says they are and how they're organizing and there's just like wow this does a to counter and also if you take

how people who believe\nThat overheated political rhetoric causes mass murder compare their opponents to Nazis without hesitation oh expand on that it's amazing how people who believe that overheated political rhetoric causes mass murder compare their opponents to Nazis and ISIS without hesitation yeah\n\nAbout it that all the ones that are trying to make that point are the ones without the most out why in just accusations\nAgainst their opponents\nThe ultimate bean that an incoming president colluded with the Russians to hack the election mhm and they hounded that year in and year out\nYou know it uh when when you look at it and we just to you know talked about you know the whole lock her up thing with Hillary Clinton and how the Democrats have jumped on that same see how in civil he is this is how radical they are they're saying lock her up lock her ... and we'd just explain why\nBut we had right earlier that to\nHave the analysis of the Democrats running on health care increased wages and getting rid of government corruption ... wait a minute they only what's the what is the only government corruption that we know of what is the the the biggest el up into the living room\nOf government corruption many people believe it's that Hillary absolutely broke the law and was not prosecuted because of it\nIt's ... it's the entire Russian collusion as we're learning more it's the allegation from the Democrats over and over again that this president ... or you know a a as in their own words\nA committed treason because he colluded with the Russians to hack the election\nOpposite than it was the Democrats and the Hillary campaign\nThat actually paid money to a law firm that funneled that money to an opposition research firm which found all that money to a former British spy who got on verified information that he claims unverified still to this day on true I think it's safe now\nSince there's never been any evidence in uh over two and a half years of investigation\nOr ... of it false information from people close to the Kremlin that Donald Trump did all these heinous things that they used to try they wanted to destroy\nHis campaign when they couldn't do it they try to destroy the legitimacy of a presidential election in twenty sixteen\nThey also took that information and used it to get a secret warned against the opposition parties campaign you won corrupt possible corruption that's corruption yeah\nAs absolute that's how how do you debate something like that I think you debate those facts which documented for radio row dog here's your forecast\nPeriods of rain and high elevation snow will impact the Pacific northwest of Northern Rockies which could cause accumulating snow for many Portland set to receive a few inches overnight snow in Denver low thirty to\nSalt Lake City Utah could see some frozen precept going into Wednesday morning then ran through the end of the week there no for the north or New Mexico mountains dry conditions will persist across much of California and the great basin elevated fire concerns mainly along the Sierra front\nAnd Southern California a front develops and by tomorrow we'll start to the showers extend from Texas up to the great lakes and no doubt\nNortheast by Thursday and will finish out the week what's that system affecting the eastern seaboard your national forecasts an active weather map read I read it you know I'm just John trout thanks so much John eight six six\n\n\nOr looking here at some of the polling from Rasmussen which might affect the election next week more voters now commend President Trump for his economic leadership but are less impressed by his performance when it comes to foreign affairs that's good news for Republicans facing election with voters said Trump\nAnd the economy are the big issues the latest rash but some reports\nNational television and online survey finds at fifty one percent of likely us voters give the president good or excellent marks for handling the economy thirty three percent still rate has performance in this area as poor\nTrump's economic positives continue to rise from thirty nine percent in August of last year now to a a fifty one percent forty nine percent gave his economic ... gave his economic or a performance\nGood or excellent marks for months to go when it comes to foreign policy forty five percent of voters said Trump is doing a good or excellent job down slightly from forty seven percent in June forty four percent consider his performance poor bought\nThe cab you out here just six percent right national security as our top voting issue right so it's really not an issue that's a point that I was going to make our said as long as\nWe're not we're ... we're not in the ... you know new a new war people don't care right ah the B. C. or a survey this is what is is here the president's job approval rating\nHas been in the high forties uh for most days in recent months speaking at a high up fifty one percent two weeks ago\nEighty eight percent of Republicans think Trump is doing a good or excellent job handling the economy but only Nineteen percent of Democrats agree well eighty percent of the GOP voters give positive remarks the president and his handling of foreign policy Seventy seven percent of the Democrats say he is doing a poor job\nAmong voters not affiliated with either major party fifty one percent said Trump is doing a good or excellent job on the economy but only forty three percent feel that way on a foreign policy the older the voter the more strongly they approve\nOf the president's job performance when it comes to both the economy and foreign policy while black unemployment is at a historic low blacks are much more critical of the president's economic performance than whites and other minority voters blacks are similarly unimpressed by the handling of his foreign policy\nEconomic and consumer confidence already is at near record highs is moving up again in the latest Rasmussen consumer spending update now that's interesting to say that when it comes to economic things because I saw Rasmussen ah that ah he released a few hours ago the president's latest job approval rating\nAnd here's what he writes Trump approvals today back at fifty percent black voter approval at record high\nWell so we're talking about the economic and inform but overall they say Trump's black approval right now I'm at a record\nHigh yeah well and and I I think right now you're seeing again everyday people this this was the question as it is with every election what is what is one of the American people thinking right but\nBut but really we're not talking about real things we're not talking about I mean in part on the positive side as the last caller pointed out\nYou know he focuses on the winning which which I I Would assume we didn't get to ask them but I Would assume that would include the economy things that are going on the positive\nIf you think about it because\nThere were conservatives before Kavanaugh\nThere were conservatives that clearly recognized the positives and the economy but they're still never travelers they're still right now maybe going to sit on the sidelines for a while\nI ... a number of them can't quantify it but let's just I think it's safe to say there were a number of them right so there's that that part of the Republican Party that after Kavanaugh looked at it and said I'm OK\nThe game has changed\nNow it really is about building this wall around the constitution is I've been saying\nIt is about protecting the things that are very real and we can have our inhouse discussions on what to do here what to do their terrorists know terrorists by the way we're the original tariffs babies\nAll of that can be discussed internally no problem we can have those very real debates on very real issues\nWith no issues going forward because right now\nThe the the game has to be the end game must be\nThe constitution because the process is being what it was it was all but shrouded in terms of the confirmation process uh Brett Kavanaugh ah they were given way too much leeway but guess what ultimately it works\nI think to the benefit I don't know if it will actually show that in the house of if it will mean a win for the Republicans in the house but it showed enough to bring the Republican Party together\nLike I've never seen it in a one thing I just want to bring up here 'cause\nOf a local story here you heard that the Dallas Morning news endorsed a better or ... and they claim you know you hear other the conservative the conservative Dallas Morning news a conservative Dallas Morning news and the conservative Dallas Morning news yeah there's no way that you can be a conservative\nAnd support paid or not or Ted Cruz no you're not a conservative and I started thinking when I saw that story to begin with\nHow many think about this in the media\nThere seems to be what Jennifer Rubin for example I'm a Republican conservative no you're not she's not a Republican conservative she's she's a liberal or a Max Boot who is the the ... you could talk for a conservative\nColumnist to see the picture of him with Stormy Daniels and the other day yeah like it's like wait a minute [laughter]\nYeah nice conserve your Stormy Daniels and he posted a picture of a him with Stormy Daniels like proudly on on uh on on a a a Twitter ... which is like the most bizarre thing in the world and and you look at other\nYou know you look at a a a um a Bill Kristol ... ah who just has lost it you see John Case tick\nA who just you know completely have shown that they're not conservatives but you've got in the media you have a a lot of different people who are claiming that there are conservatives and they're speaking for the conservative movement but they're not conservatives anymore and I don't mean because they're not supporting Trump\nOr I'm Talking about there any allergy has actually change who they support actually changes ... you can sit there and say maybe I don't like Donald ... I don't like Donald Trump it out like the fact the cruise now is with Donald Trump and so I'm not going to vote to say you're voting for ... because\nBecause the ... the Ted Cruz and conservativism has failed you is the most bizarre thing on the planet you can possibly say it makes no critical thinking sense at all you're not a conservative why\nBecause as a conservative ... what is the most important thing and let's go to the late ...\nTwenty twelve mhm Supreme Court\nYou know if Trump Donald Trump was done today I'd be happy\nI was I said that to a friend over the weekend or because they were like okay but but but the ... not even he's not able to get work done because then I said no he's he's got a lot and I said but but imagine even the tax cuts didn't get done\nI'd like to imagine that 'cause now I'm paying more in taxes let me let me imagine that [laughter] I'm all what'd you please [laughter] um [laughter]\nBut imagine that the you know there were a number of things and and imagine even that the economy more work rolling as as fast\nA ... and they will be happy ... there are a number of things here and again we don't it's not the we never cheer the endgame you

eight six six Ninety right I [laughter] these are called me and I'm Mary McNamara thanks so much for being here this morning [noise] have you ever have just got to tell you one of the things that I find fascinating is that you know the the the the call for unity in the end of of divisiveness\nWhich of course you're never going to have in politics\nOr you know the the president has been criticized you know that a while he uh after you know the the uh mail bomb scare and the uh the temple mass murderers\nThat you know he went on to you know continue with you know what politicians do which is coming up to the terms you go after you know your your political opponents\nAnd you go after them and the call I just was laughing yesterday that the media was talking about the fact that you know the president still device if he goes after his political opponents or we need unity\nEvery president called for unity zero presidents presidents get unity do I have to go any further edge it never happens every president calls for unity every person called for unity and then they go out and they do what\nThey express what they believe and they're roughly half the people agree and half the people disagree as soon as you have an opinion you have created a divisive at ...\nHow stupid is the media\nRather not stupid there they believe that it gets to their advantage but every politician calls for unity and as soon as you open your mouth and say here's what I'm going to do a significant portion of the population disagrees with you it is impossible\nFor a politician to create unity in a country\nCan we move on now\nAre we going to are we going to continue to live in this\nFairy tale world well the president should promote pop policies done that bring everybody together let's stop that on social media we're not gonna bring everybody together it's not going to happen\nThat ... that's why the constitution was set up the way that it was set up because the founding fathers knew\n\nPeople would not be United on the issues the raising the freedom of speech exist to read um the reason\nThat the the ability and the right\nTo assemble they get a ... dress up your grievances exists the reason why people can pull their money together and joined groups that promote the particular issue and political ideology that they believe in and therefore they can spend money on their candidates didn't do so\n\nBecause the founding fathers knew we weren't going to agree on anything because they didn't agree on everything they disagreed on the major premise that we still debate today which is a\nLarge central and powerful federal government over a smaller and less powerful federal government and that still exist today the differences now the founding fathers\nThe color of your skin where you came from or anything else it's about what you can do every day when you show up and you actually produce not simply\nYou know reality for me and I think it was I've often said to my best learning experience back when I was\nYoung react when I was younger we had to crawl across the living room on the shed carpeting to change the television channel and then got shocked when we did it [laughter] uh\nEverybody didn't make the team in little league they cut in little league right and I was a real small wimpy and scrawny kid shut up but at least I was ... by somebody who was very athletic and and you know a lot of Shawn Michaels yeah I Would I yeah that's right I was I was I was so I was so short and so anyone I and\nI just I got cut from every little league team every junior high team\nEvery high school team finally I made one team or the coach said I don't cut right he said because everybody will leave because he worked so hard and I did a basketball team worked everybody to the point of\n... we started out with thirty two people on the practice for in in August practicing we'd seven left by October ... that's how hard he works He says I caught and I stuck with it because I just wouldn't quit right that's how I became a good basketball player but every other than that everything every other team I got cut from\nAnd I my parents said oh you would cry and then ten minutes later you get back up and you'd be doing it again but your crowd we felt so sorry for you and and I said best thing that ever happened to her yeah best thing that they only have to

Republican pledge on uh on on healthcare you when I talked about this a long time ago that the Republicans\nIf they lose and remember health care is one of the leading issues out there right underneath the economy if they lose part of it it's our fault for not oh yeah solving the problem with health care and not going in with the plan right and he talks about you know a a a pledge that you know that that they that they should take\nA and there's ten different points to the the pledge and then what would they do\nAnd they should have had this a long time ago I Believe you when I talk about this a long time ago when they you know they they get rid of the individual mandate pass a little bit but we said look the premiums and everything else is going to come back to haunt them right if they don't do something and this could cause them the house we had stayed in this over a year ago\nAnd he goes to all the different ah ah you know that you're talking about the accomplishments that they have done and they shouldn't talk about okay and here's what we plan to do the Republican promises\nFor additional improvements and they go through everything protect patients with preexisting conditions with again the state high risk pool ... reinsurance so everybody can do it but you know we talked about how you do that with state grants and things like that\nBut they didn't do it [noise] I remember is that they buy it and on their website as a candidate remember the whole block grant thing and we have and you said that night man that's out of a new ... book [noise] and they they had the plan but they didn't do what they should have focused on this six months ago when the housing unit and\n\nWe do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches like high risk pools and reinsurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it goes to the states\nThe states make a decision as to what they wish to do right and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring additional transparency and accountability across the entire prescription drugs supply chain\nA lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by eliminating the ...\nAnd Medicare by protecting Medicare part D patients from excessive out of pocket costs maximize medical innovation they go through that but basically go through all the things that they should they should actually do this has been a failure the Republican Party completely\nYeah something that probably Ryan should should have been talking about on a consistent basis there should have been a marketing plan for this with massive television ads\nLeading up to the election that if you will like this ... this is our plan this is our contract ... and Newt Gingrich bringing it out and this is two days ago it's too late oh yeah yeah it\nSounds like it's not going to work uh now we're inside of a week first of all it's because a Newt Gingrich is is only go to ... no one is going to uh pay attention to Newt except for the choir\nBecause that's who he's preaching to but you're right with a Paul Ryan at the beginning of this year\nWe talked about twenty sixteen all of the we're going to do away with with Obamacare we're going to do away with Obamacare we will do away with Obamacare and then by the time they got there the sentiment by the rank and file a changed and it was like okay well we'll do away with the\nSome of the Obama Care and then they finally got to\nThe individual mandate which of course then under the funding mechanism\nAnd then forced them eventually will force them to pay for it in another way premiums going up all of the ... which is exactly what we're saying and we we talked about that disconnect between twenty sixteen\nAnd the end of last year\nNow you have this this whole new cycle and and whole new opportunity to essentially launch the new plan based on what you know about the ...\nGive us if if if if we are in charge this is what we want to do and go at a point by point as Newt Gingrich did and and and it should have been it should've been Ryan and the president yeah this is what we're going to do look it isn't done yet and you promote the daylights out of it why\nBecause it's one of the top issues than Americans care of all because here's what I Would say too is that there's nothing wrong with saying look the the sentiment by the American people is is shifting on health care in this uh this is where the sentiment of the American people as right now\nThis is what they're telling this is what they want this is the plan we believe will work\nYou don't necessarily have to go back and apologize for not getting it done because the American people don't care that you didn't get it done but what you do have to do what you\nAre charged with now is because you know you break it you pay for it\nWhat you're going to have to do now is put together a plan a very realistic plan\nAnd put it in front of the American people but that's that's not happening I mean Newt Gingrich\nIs one thing the party didn't have well any desire to do the Newt Gingrich shorter because you saw this was a failure of the Republican and we said this by the way and we got criticism we got criticism we got criticism when we said\nThey're not repealing Obamacare I stopped saying it we ... we got criticism and guess what we were white they weren't repealing Obamacare but they were just they were what were they were doing was were pulling what\nThe mandate but the actual benefit state which means somebody has to pay for it which was taxpayer money through the back and an increase in premiums but you didn't solve any of the problems right and so you should have focused on solving the problems immediately that should've been the president\nAnd and and this is why we have said that we know that people loved the rhetoric but it's about the winning and it's about getting\nThe Medicare for all so we don't have a monopoly running our healthcare system of government monopoly running our healthcare system\nAnd this is what the Republicans were supposed to be fighting for\nAnd they did not do this they did not do it and we criticized President Trump from the very beginning for not taking a stand on repealing Obamacare but just saying well just suddenly whatever and I'll sign right because the president has shown that when he sticks by something\nLike the corporate and individual tax cuts and he keeps promoting it and he keeps fighting\nYou know a lot of people told us the last couple of weeks but what I like about the president that he's fight fight fight fight fight fight fight the fight has to be more than just rhetorical mhm you've got to take the hardy shoes\nAnd one of the hardest issues out there is health care\nIn in ... I I've heard the point made by pundits that well you know there are things that that that he clearly understands that are within his wheelhouse like taxes because he's a businessman but you can not that you want to oversimplify healthcare but one of the main concerns\nThe number one thing that this president did as a candidate was to what ... ... well acknowledged the problem right I mean overall yeah but I Do but\nThat's one of the problems deregulation a no Donald you what the problem is with health care regulations part of the ... well yes regulation is the is the problem you have the\nRight now the burden on employers and hospitals that's the problem you have I mean how many different items but you don't even have to get that involved\nThis president easily could point at it

I have a feeling Papadopoulos is going to write a book on this if it's true what he's dating\nAnd yesterday you had to leave a little early to go to a conference and and we talked about this the Papadopoulos\nYou know coming on the ... the the tweets saying by the way Congress knows who's a spy was in the campaign so do I can't can't tell you but he's also said that he made\nHe may reverse his plea from what he learned in the case for why do we are pushing them out on our about the whole Michael Flynn thing\nNow again we're talking about you know who those are separate charges but and and this this whole thing\nThe basis of all of it was about\nThe ah the spy on the campaign the uh the the\nIll gotten possibly Pfizer warrant and all of that if everything stemmed from that ... of what we're looking at with Papadopoulos\nA Michael Flynn if the if the if the fact of the matter is\nIs that they were on to Michael Flynn because of of that we don't know we have no idea but if that were the case which means that would be no basis for those investigators to be talking to Michael Flynn which means they shouldn't have been there and the charges would be dropped now we we have no idea\nBecause he's his hearing sentencing hearing is coming up here\nAnd I'm In a matter of weeks now what five or six weeks away\nWell but the question is why was delayed by special prosecutor why did why did Mohler agree tuned to lay not once but multiple times the sentencing hearing for Michael Flynn then you add to it\nPapadopoulos and then add to it at the White House\nHanded to the inspector general's office at the department of justice all of that from the Pfizer warrant a situation and turned it over to here's our which knowing and and we had been pointing there's nobody has been asking this question\n... outside of us that I Know of why would you send it to the inspector general because you believe something internally was was some kind of wrongdoing ... at the department of justice\nAnd here's and the way to find that out as a proper I'd Jay investigate noble\nWhat I'm what I'm thinking is Papadopoulos the reason he said that in any said first off that you know I I I may take away\nHow could it and he said not necessary to get it reversed but just to bring forth what happened\nAnd I started thinking okay and then you start talking about the spy the only thing I could think of is\nThe spy was somebody who actually was not an operative for the Democrats but somebody from law enforcement who was put there because\nIt all relates to the Carter page warrant right which was illegally gotten across the board and not only we could have possibly affect the Michael Flynn case because if\nThe warrant was illegally gotten than anything that comes from it mhm is tainted every ... every ... ... everything and that's what I'm thinking so they got the warned in part of the war was once they justify the warranted law enforcement put right somebody in law enforcement that kind of in\nA ... or an informant that were maybe not an FBI person but an informant that the FBI put in there\nYou know that just to to look at Papadopoulos and it was all based on the information that they had gotten from the ... and the war and and everything is connected with the buys the war and so everything around it as tainted and that's what\nHe feels can possibly get him off on that\nOr at least ... what was going on there where the prosecution eventually just says okay the the you know that you're guilty pleas is waived or whatever because it looks so bad for the FBI in the department of justice look something's going on here when when the president said\nWell a lot of the top secret and our allies would rather not released it so I'm going to give it to the inspector general to review you and I both said it doesn't make any sense that doesn't make any sense at all because you're not looking you that's not what you do you're not talking\nState you're talking about the I.

there were ride right on the radio you know once again we're talking about the letter of the law the intent of the law and here is in the case also [noise]\nWhere's the president is going to [noise]\nJust so amazing constitution [noise]\nBut the constitution expressly says in it\nThat we are not allowed to use troops to defend the borders of the country from people coming across the border okay that's in there but\nIt says in there that there can be exceptions during a time of war\nSo the president has come out and said that he is going to send five thousand troops to Mexico mhm okay and he is using that part of it that we are technically from his standpoint\nIn a war against Mexico for this purpose\nThe rules to make them fit what he wants to do former ice acting director Thomas Homan says we're very lucky to have this man is president right now\nFor things and they're gonna handle logistics for the border patrol on their own monitor central traffic intelligence they're going to be moving food water supplies for the border patrol what that does is that releases the force religious who are currently doing those types of jobs\nTo be on the front line as law enforcement officers defending our nation so I think it's a good move also thinking and see a lot more deal the U.S has deployed I was I was saying the president\nWas set up to five thousand troops down there and\nThen we'll see what happens but the board would have in the military on the border is a great idea this this invasion of our sovereignty is a it's we've got to stop it because if we get to the point we did the last time and and they actually get to the United states and then and then make their thoughts on the claims asylum then get released to bring back to catch and release\n... group is this is putting that same position to catch and release them this is going to be an ongoing situation constantly because other folks in charge of Merkel and growing says he gets the United states we're not going to detain very long\nAnd many will show up in court and most of them eighty percent of them will lose your case\nEven though they've been ordered by the immigration sweep 'cause you lost your case they won't leave so why would they stopped coming it's there's no consequences of bitterness or this illegal act\nYou go if they are and I just don't know why we cannot enforce the rules we have why does this have to be so difficult once again we don't have enough border patrol agents to do it second of all it's a three thousand miles piece of land mhm that border okay and once again I Will say this\nWhen the constitution was written we were in a land acquisition mode yes we were okay we wanted to take\nCalifornia and take it\nTo the choir Arizona New Mexico and many other states from the Indians and make that part of the United states well that's okay we want to take the state of Louisiana French\nAnd make it a United States\nThe Porter of New Orleans one of the most it probably one of the ... probably the most uh second most important port in the United states okay at the time\nThe United states every one well world leaders kind of thought or assumed that New Orleans was owned by the French\nWhen in reality the Spaniards on it but the Spaniards never paid the French for the ... for all we see in a way to do her aunt or it right so that's how we bought\nThe American ... well no no that was prior to that uh the French in fact received the money\nFor New Orleans so that way and then after that Thomas Jefferson worked the Louisiana Territory purchase but my point is we were in the lab acquisition building mold we were also in the land taking mode right at\nNow getting what gives overly Harris who want to know that I don't ... yes I understand my point is the reason that this wasn't in the constitution was because at that time we were trying to acquire a lab and this point we have no desire to take over the country Mexico\nWe don't want their land anymore that we wanted to take a takeover of Mario ... right when I don't even have gotten there yet to so so that's why this was an included in the constitution well now we have a serious problem here\nAnd who are in the military the army surfaces\nCan't do the defense of that border I think this is something that should be changed constitutionally too because I think we have two hundred thousand men and the military in the middle east\nWhen they come home they don't have jobs why don't we hire them and to tell you the truth the best that we could have on our border with Mexico is for two hundred thousand\nSoldiers how arms and say this is our border you can't go by and guess what we have the laws to would force that\nI find it fascinating that that is part of the constitution that is our own troops or or our own troops could not defend our borders and that was fine that's so amazing\nYou have another group of people that were delegated to do that everything was delegated him or some group to do but once again we were in Hawaii and acquisition moaning\nAnd we're not in that anymore right and so the time should change this is probably another part of the constitution that should be amended and many people wouldn't have a problem with that were rod and the bottom of the hour means it's time for\nMay be\nIs it oh is that good huh\nThe first three words are your secretly flabbergasted well I don't want to be flabbergasted I don't know what it is [noise] that could be a bad thing is flabbergasted I've used the word all my life I don't get me wrong but I owe to uh taken aback\nShocked a flabbergasted shocked Oh yes that that would be it OK gone smack you\nOkay\nWell there you go okay about much I guess that could be shock yeah\nMhm but that can be good or it can be not so good\nSo I'll pass on what a pass on being flabbergasted to me it almost sounds like a electrocution [laughter]\nI Know they're not synonymous in any way shape or form your but nevertheless mhm Mm uh last night in a whole ... battle the Buffalo Bills maybe the worst team in football loss to maybe one of the better teams and football\nThe New England patriots but I got to tell you what it did not it really looked to me watching the game and the games have been a lot better this year than last year and the NFL but it really looked last night like the New England patriots were just going through the motions\nThey knew they were going to win and so they just\nPlayed to the least of their capabilities to win and I think ... statement because that's how you get beat because these are not race cars you don't flip the switch and the engine starts\nThey are not machines they're human beings you have to be trained to be a winner\nOkay and this did not look like a team that was training to be a winner they just look like another team that's why I think they will be beaten soundly in the playoffs lanes and the Kansas City chiefs or the Houston Texans\nAnd then when they get to the super bowl hopefully the rams will take care of I Can't say I'm rooting for the rams I hate to say that\nWell it ... that uh the New England patriots I guess attitude or way of playing kinda hearkens back too\nBeat is it's hard to play at your most especially they keep changing the rules every year in football the rules are so different this year there's a different way you have to line up for the kickoff\nThey now flag guys for tackling the quarterback by his ankles and anything above the shoulders the shoulders above so you have about an eight inch window in which you can tackle a quarterback but if you let them get away\nHe can throw a touchdown and pizza and then you don't get to go to the Superbowl so you can't have it both ways by the way

death or go kind of turn a lieutenant colonel Allen West welcome back\nIs going to be with you Brian how are you\nSo colonel five thousand two hundred troops going to the border you you in the military for decades you can't really do much right you got to support the border guard\n[laughter] yeah that's the thing because the ... you cannot out if the federal troops are\nIn our military are not allowed to do any uh domestic law enforcement operation that's what this would end up being a you can see this as they are still a our military does not have that a jurisdiction and you have the border patrol to do this and that's why I think we need to make sure that our border\nPatrol or properly you know quipped to be able to handle these type of situations and the good thing I think the president has articulated this before and also a homeland security secretary Nielsen is that we want to bring these troops and so that they can be the backstop they could provide more the logistical support\nThat is necessary so that you can get more border patrol elite a ages into what I call the penetration so\nNow the thing that is so important to understand and realize Brian is that uh we need to be looking at the other avenues of approach that the drug cartels at other use along our border because if we you know send a lot of resources to this is Mike Allen sector\nOther things are going to happen elsewhere or drugs or probably try to flow through a more weapons and things of this nature so we need to make sure we do have a good coverage along the border and maybe that's another way that we can use the military to supplement with some of the intelligence gathering is\nSouth Americans are being favorite Mexican stay home they got the message only two percent of the people crossing the Mexican maybe the word is Donald Trump is serious there's five thousand troops we have no hope only a tent so they'll deterrent has to get down there\nWell I think one of the announcement

with a\nAnd and they have to be family unit or there or you know children that are you know by themselves below the age of Thirteen [noise] you\nKnow we will consider them but if you're a single

could land you in and are you ... you can figure it out\nAnd why you you were President Obama said any gestures outlines exactly why I think he's an ineffective out of touch president cut ten\nThey're trying to convince everybody to be afraid\nMalnourished refugees thousand miles away [noise]\nThat is the most important\nSo he's he mocked any mocked even to it a greater degree at a different appearance he thinks when we were afraid of malnourished or illegal immigrant yeah\nHe was the same person that mocked a President Trump with his plan to bring manufacturing jobs are production back to the United states should wear or restore our economy but now he said he wants to take credit for that so President Obama's out of touch him when you listen to that clip you just play it seems like a a delusional person that was staggering\nAnd could get his thoughts together this is a very serious thing where people want to breach your your border when people believe that they have a right to enter your country because they want a better job that's not the whole purpose of having a solver border that's not the purpose of having a nation like the United states of America\nWe want you to

not shown to be fair and balanced what kind of centered or would you be\nWell look I've shown that uh Brian when I went to the house the first thing I was disgusted look was all the backbiting between Republicans and Democrats and I literally on the first month started a bipartisan breakfast\nAt seven years later is still going forward so sure of brown joked about it every day in our debates and all anybody comes for breakfast but\nYou know we have almost thirty members for Republicans and Democrats talk about things we can work\nAmerican problems the problem that I've learned the violence in being being in business and then going to the house of representatives says it's politics gets in a way of everything and that's why we're so divided when we should be at least looking at ways we can get things\nDone right or that would be key maybe they're maybe it's going to come and vote to try to get things done after a while a congressman what do you plan to do to close I Know governor case it gets finally backing you\n[noise] yeah the the real issue here is just getting people to know me I mean we've spent seven months of getting around the state are trying to get as much a media attention I chuckle because uh I'm as the president calls or can fake news and much of the mainstream media\nHas been very vocal cord much in the local Ohio media has been very vocal toward shared because his wife was part of the media for so many years that\nWe've been breaking through that little by little but we're just going to continue to get that message out a business guy somebody who was created Fifteen hundred jobs versus somebody who's\nBeen in politics for his entire life and we're going to continue to work a travel this state and and get them get the message out that's the key when people get to know me they come my way\nAnd it's just been such a big state that I realized even in our last poll we only have about fifty five percent name id where Sherrod Brown has a Ninety two percent name id that's the difference we got to make up that difference and make sure\nPeople know who I Am as a six point deficit right now so let's let's look at it as a couple of issues out there and the plate or on your on we Congress going to have to take a look at the president's got an executive order working he's going to announce it officially Sunday\nThat he wants to get rid of birthright a ... birthright citizenship you have to illegal immigrants parents you born here you're a citizen Trump things were misinterpreted in the constitution where do you stand a lark\nI I Am a big believer that Congress needs to be immigration\nNo no border uh he he wants to eliminate ice like the rest of the Democrats and when it comes to sanctuary cities he supports them too that's what people don't like so they start there and then they started looking at an immigration system and saying spoken\nAnd then they look to those that are born in Ohio or in this country and say you know wait a minute we're we're land would come across the border or doing everything just to let go immigrants and\nThat's why I say it's just not one issue if the entire issue we need a strong border wall we need to make sure the Congress gets immigration some kind of immigration law passed and um\nThat's what I'm hearing you know in Ohio of course people are mad that anybody can walk in the state I'm but I'm not sure we can override the fourteenth amendment just yet I Do believe in the constitution and they and then so I think we need to support those as well but president bit of help\nOr has been a big help coming back to Cleveland on Monday next week the vice president in tomorrow to try and push the votes I mean this is about getting the voters out or let's face it we know the Democrats are going to be out we got to make sure the Republicans out and the independents are showing up and\nLook one when it comes to Calvin off and all these things we just got to get people making sure they're following\nA blessing in play you wouldn't have the vice president President coming ... best of luck [noise] thank you so much by a we come back we will cast and at the end with Barney and company I'll stand up\n\nTrusting challenge I talked to was from seven to ... station [noise]\nThere's been a debate over what it means\nSo for for many people the amendments suggests that we have unlimited birthright citizenship and the country while many including some of the draft or is indicated that they believe\nThat they that the amendment says that you have a birthright citizenship if you're subject to the jurisdiction you're either a citizen or a legal resident but not if\nBecause the Supreme Court really address this and the famous case in Eighteen Ninety eight\nWithout really resulting the ultimate question is a case called long Kim ark\nAnd involved Chinese parents who came to the country had a child here and the Supreme Court said that child is a citizen but the problem is that those Chinese parents were legal residence\nSo the case doesn't really answer the question on all of our minds about undocumented persons\nSo what was the president for that case [noise] well ...\nYeah the Supreme Court said that reading the fourteenth amendment these people are subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and therefore their child is a citizen\nAnd most people who adopt a more restrictive view of the fourteenth amendment have no problem with that they have no problem with saying that legal residents can can have their children recognize the citizens [noise]\nThe the issue is what to do with all the rest and that's a really tough tough question now part of the issue here is the means\nThat by using the executive order or the court may ultimately say look you can't do this alone you can't unilaterally just make this decision [noise]\nNow the funny thing about that is that I'm actually a critic of executive orders cause I think decisions as important as this really should be made by Congress but\nThe funny thing is all roads lead back to those six words\nBecause it's the amendment says that anyone born in the United states as a citizen that President Trump clearly cannot change that with an executive order if on the other hand the court decides that the amendment has a narrower meaning\nThen sure he can exercise that ...\nAnswer the ultimate question\nAnd then and then it'll go up to the highest court and is very conservative view of this any liberal view of this is the liberal view let everybody become a citizen is a conservative you know one\nWell it's sort of a mixed certainly a lot of liberal professors argue that the amendment is clear it's a constitutional right it can only be changed by the constitution [noise]\nUm I don't see how you can really say that I mean it really terrible thing about all this is and and you know I've talked about this in the past about the lack of civility or how we don't really talk about issues anymore in this country this is a good example there are really good faith arguments on both sides this is not\nSomething where you could say the other side is just entirely ignoring the law the constitution they're strong arguments on both sides we should be able to have this conversation without labeling each other\nAs you know racist or or destroying America and this is a legitimate question people really don't know what those six words mean\nI'm ... I'm looking at this and this so called anchor babies applies you are right\nWell yeah but a lot of people do game the system uh you know we have ah people who have these uh hotels these maternity hotels where you come in and have the child the United states and then you get that citizenship for the child\nAnd so there's obviously gaming that goes on is that the a serious motivation for immigration yeah probably not I mean most people are coming United States because they want a better life [noise] but I sure there are people that game it\nI dare say between Nineteen eighty two thousand six the number of birds to unauthorized immigrants would you er which opponents of birthright citizenship co anchor baby sky rocket to a peak of three hundred and Seventy thousand that according to ...\nThings get better will be attractive once again so the president's going to get people talking that's what that's what's happening today seems like you embrace the challenge how we always felt like this\nUp until what year did we view or do was has always been the case if you were born here or whether your parents were documented or not you're a citizen here\nNow you know what Brian this has been a Hong unresolved question but the irony is that the Democrats\nAre at one time supported the narrower ruling a view of the constitution Harry Reid actually put forward a bill\nTo confine citizenship to citizens and legal residents eyes so that actually gets to a third possibility in interpreting the constitution there is a third interpretation which is that by saying that it's if you're subject to the jurisdiction\nThe framers may have just wanted to leave this to Congress the Congress can change the jurisdiction can change the definition of citizenship under that interpretation President Trump still could not use an executive order so of the three interpretations\nOnly one of them would allow him to use the executive order and that's the one that says no they always intended this to be just for citizens and legal residents\nAnd it's hard to imagine a day when the midterms are over since it's so anticipated but one day they will be over some say a week from today a if everything gets done and then we'll going to be having hearing about the Mueller probe once again here's the president last night when asked by Laura if a shield he'll sit for mowers questions\nMentoring Nicholas that have to do anything because we didn't do anything but we will probably do something else will respond to some questions\nThat could be written and some ... probably said don't just pick and choose but from where you understand where's this probe at\nWell you know it's a fascinating question\nQuestions he actually did not say that he wanted answers in writing to obstruction now whether he would do that orally or he's insisting that must be oral is anyone's guess I still don't believe that there is a prosecutor bull or credible case of obstruction\nI you know what he has we can only guess at\nA bite if the president does sit down to answer questions I think that Mohler would move fairly quickly to get this report out a and it would go to Rosenstein and the assumption has been that Congress would get a copy but that's entirely up to the deputy attorney general he could not give Congress Acosta\nAnd if he still had the job after the election\n[laughter] yes all these things are up in the air but the good thing is that you know the the reign of political commentator as well and and legal commentators will once again come to the forge\nIs all about Jonathan Turley a witch fan for you as a career it's so so typical of the ego [laughter] so typical so John and a couple of things that I interviewed Papadopoulos twice once on radio for a half hour and ten minutes on Fox and friends which is like four hours in human time so\nThat you know how short those interviews or and basically he figuring out that in some way shape or form he was targeted\nAnd missed it worked for British Intelligence who was the one who initially talked to him and said he had Russian contacts and he didn't\nAnd the question was do you and ... were linked through the world cup investigation because he worked for the world cup committee and now they have the ambassador down or might have intelligence links with uh Austria Australia he will not answer the question Mr there's now disappeared\nAnd now the insurance policy tax back and forth a coincides with the arrival of Peter Struck a good friend of ...\nNow works might do to overturn his his plea deal\nSo what do you think's going on here I mean it's getting harder and harder to follow but for you and I who have been following it close it looks really diabolical\nWell it's a mess I'm I I think it'd be surprising if he could overturn the plea deal first of all he got very light sentence the judge is not going to feel particularly motivated or because he went into it as an adult with open eyes are now he says some things weren't disclosed to him but usually courts say you know it's\nA it's a buyer beware you know you take the deal if you face the wheel so I think he'll be have a tough time of that with regard to all of this late stuff\nYou know I'm most interested in people taking the fifth you know you have a not only the person at fusion taking the fifth but you also have or his

President Trump would start out with a mall or\nOne of the mall or a you know hasn't even try to make us look like a fair investigation as far as Iraq is are they caused by yet and asked the Hillary camp anything or are they didn't break into her a offices and uh take all our lawyer stuff I mean that'd be some interesting reading gotcha\nThings I think so yeah that would be some interesting reading Glen ... this is just Rudy kind of power in the fields just testing the waters he's in Bloomberg threw it out there that then the president said you know my my answer some questions but it's totally legitimate so I Know\nThe gaming searching but he read the last couple of chapters in the Woodward book I did you get a real tone of what mother was after from John Dowd John Dowd regrets cooperating they were going to work on it together and get this thing over with and find out what the Russians did Nixon you know it becomes clear that the mole or has the agenda for Trump\nAnd he's trying to set up a big perjury so find out something huge misstated or Mr remembered and get them on that it's a big perjury trap ready to get a ready to happen here he is\nLast night on this I'm forty one\nShould have never been a special counsel my opinion it's an illegal investigation totally a lot of people agree with me a lot of people on your show I don't know the shows are going there was no collusion there was never any collusion it shouldn't have ever happened but with all of that being said I Do get along\nAnd that's how he feels he says I make everything available he did but if you don't remember who you talk to in twenty sixteen twenty Seventeen and they will you know look at Mike Flynn look at bat but apple is a look at look at the uh the other people that got caught up in this Rick Gates\nOr nothing to do with throwing in election by the way\nAnd now Julian Assange might be exported from London where he said he held up in the Ecuadorian embassy they'll look at they got to get rid of him soon might be coming right over here and maybe he's going to a talk and maybe exonerate or implicate the president but we're credibility does he have\nWhich is a problem here is more on the president on the mall or question cut forty two\nMentoring to kill us for that to do anything because we didn't do anything but we will probably do something else will respond to some ...\n... oh can you do that\nIs the president get Fifteen questions the response to eight then everyone's going to focus on why he didn't answer those eight I I don't know how you do some of the questions but Democrats a theory is if Democrats get the house they will begin to pressure mother to either step aside or cut conclude this thing because they want to do their own investigation\nAnd so far it's been hands off Marlin Malone he's a professional he's got no agenda he's a Republican appointed by a Republican or retain by a Democrat leave him alone well now Democrats will change\nTheir tune because they are going to want to run a lot of these investigations because uh the report they want to a PIN number Republicans down [noise]\nFollow up on subpoenas that Devin Nunes want to know part of a that's why so much is at stake especially in ... county and in the state of California where there's still a lot of red areas that they want to flip a one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine our troops are heading to the board of what would they do Jennifer Griffin will tell us next\n\nTrust dark walls points in jeans and T I find jobs [noise]\nThousand miles plus journey paying a paying those uh those people who are preying on their misery charging them seven thousand dollars a person to make that journey those are what the the coyotes and the people who are involved in human trafficking charged to these poor migrants\nUm and so so yes I Believe a lot of what we're seeing right now is they're using the U.S military as a symbolic deterrent but they're not going to be standing guarding the border per se and I it's just important to keep a and understanding of what they are allowed to do and what they're not\nYeah I understand but I also do we there's all this money for defense and you know I was hollowed out you do this special about how you are how to take apart vehicles in order to be able to get on the goals of uh especially a strip them out because we're so out of money now we finally get money ... and they were putting it on a border\nWell that's the real concern is that remember when you have a defense budget even when it's his largest the Pentagon's budget and you know seven hundred and fifty or so billion dollars\nThat money is all allocated by Congress to very specific programs and to reprogram that money in the past when President Bush and President Obama sent a National Guard to the board are typically a DOD Pentagon would be reimbursed by da chess\nThis time I'm told they will not be reimbursed and it will come out of that large defense budget but that's not a slush fund that money has all been allocated so right now the controller here at the Pentagon is scrambling because they're going to be asked by Congress\nWhere this money is coming from they don't just keep a budget of I mean this can be up to one point two billion dollars that will be for sending these troops down on temporary assignment\nThe ... when President Bush sent six thousand troops down to the border it cost one point two billion dollars so that money is not just sitting around in the Pentagon budget\nThat were falling out of the sky that we described or being ... in the bone yards or two after Seventeen years of war to to improve the military readiness it was a not designated to send us troops to the border so now they're scrambling trying to figure out where to find that money in the in the defense budget\nSo and do things are true of defense Mattis said to be convinced to do this\nLook I'm not going to speculate on that I certainly know that a Secretary Mattis um had to consult with lawyers and and that's what they do anytime us troops are are sent anywhere and there have to be a they still have not determined the rules of engagement and exactly how\nA that has not been defined on paper I've read the order that mad assigned on friday and it is talking about support capabilities that the U.S military can provide to the border patrol but\nIt is a complicated legal dance whenever you send us troops and we have had a law in this country a tradition in this country since Eighteen Seventy eight that unless uh that that innocence us troops are not supposed to be armed on us soil and used in a law enforcement capacity\nI mean we still have we have border patrol we have um\nLocal law enforcement uh the it is very hard not to see how this is not time to to coincide\nWith the election next week the reason that they're using active duty troops as they can deploy a lot faster we're told than the national guard last night the president made some remarks in his interview with Laura Ingraham is getting some attention here at the Pentagon in which he was perceived to have a suggested that the national guard were not\nAble to be used in this circumstance and that that suggesting they don't move quickly enough\nOf the reason that you're seeing active duty troops used is because they can deploy quickly but it is an unusual\nWe've been dealing with the mad as Defense Department as compared to others were the pluses and minuses ... it's\nIt's complicated because certainly the biggest change is that we don't have very many a press briefings anymore we have to a ... there are not as many briefings and the briefing room there is a briefing taking place right now that to be fair\nFrom Baghdad with the um the public affairs officer of who is stationed out there tell updating us on the ISIS fight so we do get those weekly briefings or but\nHe used to be that every few weeks we would have\nUh the defense secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chief seated side by side taking our questions from the professional\nPentagon press corps which is about twenty to thirty people who are here every day in the briefing room that doesn't happen anymore the last time that the\nPentagon I think if I remember correctly that last time that the Pentagon had a press conference and the briefing room with a spokesman or an official from the Pentagon was in may so that's quite some time and so that's a real change from the past\nUm and you know what can I say that that is a change\nYou got it uh Jennifer

radicals\n[noise]\nLet's go back to the phones Wayne New Jersey Carlos welcome to the program how you doing I'm well thanks Carlos\n[noise] so I wanted to get to the point that you were asking before about how all these people are coming to this country and then how he's a President Trump is trying to stop the any kids that are born here that are from immigrant parents that they're not going to have citizenship\nI think that's actually a great idea because of the fact of how much money it costs to have a child in the United states and they have who's going to pay for that these people are not coming here with medical benefits they don't have any money whatsoever plus on top of that they just tracts thousands of miles to get to the United states right\nOld people are going to need medical attention once they get to the border and who's going to pay for it up\nNow Carlos ... these are very interesting and important questions you raise a because the mainstream media doesn't want us talking about that as a matter of fact there have been people on Fox News or that have been talking about the the health care situation\nAnd what those folks are bringing across the border in the way of illness and they've been attacked ... but but I Want to say something here because you are you're right on the money Carlos ...\nWas um [noise] this was back when we had that massive surge of children at the border\nAnd I was interviewing nurses and doctors who were ordered ordered not to disclose how sick some of the children were coming across the border the official word Carlos from the Obama administration at the time was oh these are healthy kids\nBut in fact we received a official government documentation\nThat dozens if not hundreds of these kids had ... ... and there was a ... of tuberculosis outbreak at one of the camps so to your point Carl is that what you had the last word here this is a dangerous situation as well\nOh one hundred percent and at the end of the day these people have been living outside\nThey haven't been inside of homes or they haven't been going through their parents'\nHouse or their cousin's house to to get up to the border they'd been outside in the dirt they're obviously going to be sick and some type of way then they're also talking about the radicalization of these people that\nAll these people are savages that are coming up to the border it only takes one person to have an radical idea which didn't hundreds of thousands of those people that are coming up here to change the minds of how many of them the only one personality took\nFour or five people to bring down the twin towers\n... if there's only one of them in their jets radical\nIt's gonna it's gonna change the minds of many of them\nNo doubt about it no doubt about it Carlos great information appreciate your call and thanks for listening [noise]\nThe same article I wrote back in two thousand Fifteen Dr Marc Siegel who's on our program on a regular basis he's taking a break for the election but he'll be back after the election Dr Marc Siegel said tuberculosis appeared to be spreading through several counties in southern Texas where the illegals had crossed\nAnd he said that some counties are reporting twice the usual average a number of obese a TB cases against us\nAbout the children I mean they can't help but if they if they come down with an illness but the problem is if if these young people are not treated what happens then I mean do you what do you want to tuberculosis outbreak nobody wants that\nNot at all a real quick oh let's go to Albany, Oregon Kelly you got about thirty seconds here\nI have about thirty seconds sir I was really questioning what he's about to do not really you know having a fax yet and the fact that the rest of the world at it and that's a clue that wonderful policy to help us out the president and twenty twenty four can do something else but\nRight now this is what we need and he's promised to help but\nYou know what Kelly Brock Obama did horrible horrible things with executive orders Donald Trump is ... is trying to do something good to hear by securing\nThe border Kelly great comment and you did it under thirty seconds well done Kelly All right good folks it's it's a lesson learned learned Kelly watch Kelly art both got to take a break your your calls are coming up do you think President Trump did the right thing here\nOn this birthright citizenship triple eight seven eight nine nine one zero that triple eight seven eight nine nine one zero we'll be right back stick around [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nPick up the bill for that it's all a scam it's been a scam for pretty much my whole lifetime I'm In my early twenties and pretty much my my parents and my grandparents their lifetime to and it's got to end it's costing the tax payer way too much money and it's just not fair\nNow now Victorian not caught or Victoria's on the line with you and and she said that that doing that would be unfair to to the to the child how to respond to ... to ... story\n[laughter] well I don't think it's unfair to the child Todd because it's the parents it's the parents who are causing this issue\nThey need to be taking care of that child in the country of their ordinance\nNot Victoria feel free to jump in here\nWell I agree with that a hundred percent as far as them they should be keeping their child in that country of origin I weigh with that but I Do think that there are other ways to ... to ... present deterrent\nTo make it impossible for them to come in here and do that without taking away birthright citizenship which I think every child was born on American Phyllis should have regardless of who their parents are\nI think you can do that with building the wall and even the chain migration wish they had before the ending the lottery making a merit based we have all kinds of ways to stop that from continuing to happen I don't think we need to take away birthright citizenship to I don't think that's right for the to the child I think it's unfair to the child\nBut then again like I said we have so many other measures to stop the problem with the illegal immigration I don't think we take it that far [noise]\nI I think in general Todd in Victoria I think immigration is probably one of the most significant issues of our lifetime and when it comes to birthright citizenship my ... the most accurate way I can bring the most fierce where I think it should should be interpreted\nHe's birthright citizenship is for um children born to us on the parents who are us citizens\nThat's the way I view it that's the way I think it should be I think bears um system which it out of the police or other than that it's like you're going to have a few years you're going to have the scam where they come on over like even in the Caribbean that's coming up right now I can guarantee you there are some in the Caribbean that are coming up\nI mean I see dropping anchors may be you know counter and Victoria ... when I see those crowds I mean it's overwhelmingly grown men I just don't you know I\nMean we have to keep out the caravan I agree with that I just said that we don't need to penalize children in the process you know there are people who come in here\nHere to ah Puerto Rico as well you know I Lived there for a while when I was younger but I mean I met a lot of folks who came in with nothing but the shirts on their backs to start over and freedom and it's hard for them\nAnd all I can say is you know when those people come in and they're given refugee status because they're fleeing a place that became intolerable because of communism we give them refuge because America has always been a great country that way\nAnd I don't think that should end now that's an exception needless to say that's not your average\nUm illegal and print that's a very exceptional case but uh but go penalized for children is all I'm saying the parents keep them out yes when they were illegal there's plenty of ways to do that without penalizing the children that's all I'm saying no no the\nTore I Want to ask you this um let's say for instance you knew for a full back\nThat a parent what's coming over into this country to have a child so it could get US citizenship and claim you know the benefits for your citizenship you as a taxpayer when we picking up the bill for that child's Eighteen years for that type of that type of scam would be something you'd be comfortable\nFace for well it's not something we want to continue to support but like I said I don't think you'll have so many illegals coming in plus the president makes all the other changes I mentioned before that are already in the process of being made\nI think once you stop chain migration you stopped at the lottery system and change it to merit base and you have a wall built you got somebody deterrents right there I don't think you're going to have to worry about the rest\nTour I fully agree with you on the wall like fully agree with you on a lot of your point you're making but one thing the walls not going to do is just not going to do anything about during um about people who overstay their visas or people who are pregnant when they were saying the pieces and have a child that's what it's not going to do that is why it's important we get to some place now\nWe get this taken care of so we can out we can just make our country\nYou know what it is gone or Victoria is a good hearted big\nI respect that I'm ... and so I think you know again we can agree to disagree but that but I I think I understand where you're where you're coming from all that and and counter you're awesome as well so you know one of our regulars guys got a call ... got a call it a day there thanks for calling in great debate\nAnd again I'm the courts are going to determine if the president has the right to do is\nUm he's checked with his attorneys and he certainly thinks he does but counters right about something\nThis is probably the most important issue of our of our lifetime\nAnd we really have to decide as as a people what kind of a nation we are are we a nation of laws are we a nation that has borders I mean we just came through eight years of ministry shouldn't that wanted to tear down the borders\nThat wanted to let anybody into this country that wanted to come into this country whether

well my wife and I were but except for our health uh-huh and we've got a what a happier\nThere was no frankly for our faith going to have a two year mission right and I know that probably doesn't apply to the the college savings plans mhm\n[noise] we've got a chunk of money right now about seven thousand dollars but we're willing to put somewhere but we're trying to decide whether we should put it down on their mortgage with one way or the other will be paid off before he goes yeah a couple of good a war or something that would be something um\nWho could build up that that we can listen in college fund\nGotcha okay and your debt free except your home correct\nIn addition to the seven thousand dollars do you have an emergency fund a rainy day fund up three to six months of expenses\n... yeah how much is in that about ... good\nOkay well you're out what we call baby step for five and six maybe step ones with thousands save two was dead free but tiles three is a fully funded emergency fund\nBaby steps for is putting Fifteen Percent of your household income into retirement which you should just start doing that as a part of your savings you're investing plan right now baby steps five is kids college and beyond that\nSix is pay extra on the house as you can as fast as you can\nShow what I Would do as many as I Would ever market for school and mission\nTrip 'cause you guys are obviously LDS right we are yeah\nOK cool so what what I'm going to do is say out of the seven thousand I'm probably going to drop five thousand of an indoor five twenty nine from my one and a half year old into a good growth stock mutual fund bats all for college has to be used for college\nTake the other two thousand and just said it in a mutual fund and your name\nNo big deal just regular\nTrip on the file\nBut it's just earmarked for that it's in your name your controlling the money and if everything goes as planned and he's going to do is to your mission trip and ... then that two thousand will grow into enough to help him do that the other five thousand you add to it periodically throughout his life\nSo that there's enough in there for him to go to college when he comes back from mission trip\nAll the weapons when I had not thought about that ended up like that\nYeah just a little bit here a little bit there and then you monitor it you look up and he's twelve years old and you go hey this is a two thousand dollars not grown to enough to take care of this or it's got way too much in it I might take some of that and throw it into his college are might take some out of it and throw it at my house\nUm [noise] do we sell our home\nOr do we keep it and continue to make a payment on it\nIt's not completed\nWell we're at the point it needs a paint and flooring\nAnd you're living in it\nNo no um well we were living in a mobile home um but then we got this offer to live in this house basically for free and he pays a live here and take care of\nI got there okay so that's so that's so you've never lived in the ... you know okay it's a little tough to show them the conditions than\nYeah like you can't get financing on it right so you're going to take a whipping a what will it take money wise to finish it\nUm\nWhat never had a professional answer on that but probably about eight thousand ten thousand dollar yeah and what is your household income um well my husband he worked forty hours a week whatever household income\n[laughter]\nOkay so your husband's the only one working well we have a business on that doesn't make it out and running but it doesn't make money\nHave been comments about twenty five dollars and then that makes about Fifteen thousand LA okay yang care taking shape or will be like in about forty eight hundred\nCash but we'll get housing free\nYeah I got that part until you get until he decides he doesn't want you to care take anymore and then you don't have housing for free anymore ... so I mean he could walk into more and fire you pretty much I changed my mind and then you you have a housing issue again well thanks so um\nYou have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring as it is\nA well we had a appraisal on it at work I'm cleaning it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand it's mark completed so probably a hundred and fifty hundred and twenty five no\nNot if it's not completed it won't know um\nBecause ... it's a further discounts and the cost it takes to complete it it's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer cannot buy this house\nOkay because they don't have any money and they're trying to get a mortgage and they can't get a mortgage on this house\nAnd so that limits your in but they didn't limit your selling pool to investors and they're going to discount that I'm a lot deeper than that if you get a hundred out of there should be flying I'm thinking\nSo um [noise]\nHow much will be borrowed against it so far\nAbout how the south we owe thirty thousand but they're from property attacks chit chat altogether it a hundred thousand\nSixty if it were fixed if you sold the property is well yes okay alright yeah I I Would look at trying to pick up the other ten thousand dollars in an additional loan and get this house finished and let's get it so as soon as possible\n...\nContinue fighting nine in Cali yeah\nYeah we all have you know you should have some equity in your pocket at that point I mean I'm not a ton but you're gonna get a little money out of it\nSo you know it it just hasn't worked out for you you realize that right yeah you've got way too many hours in this house\nAnd and really didn't get much out of it went all the smoke clears here well you'll get a little bit but it's not it is not worked out very good so you know you're going to have to reset that and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you guys need to look at your income\nBecause your household income as you I'm very very low income and ah so I I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term and I want to think about some part time jobs in the meantime\nBut um yeah I Would get that house finished up I'm saving scratching and clawing painting and [noise]\nYou know if you bought all three thousand bucks or something that's fine but let's let's try and get it sold as fast as possible now if the land is such that you can sell off a piece of the land without selling the house in order to have the money to finish the house that's what I Would do first\nCelebrate selling acre also corner use that money to finish the house then get the household and that way there's no more debt involved Olivia is with us in Lexington high Olivia how are you\nBoth have better than I deserve what's up I had a question and I left you amount of [noise]\nThat shows on and all of that is going to be fair [noise] um [noise] all lose your ... ... budget and\nPet therapy ... and it would actually get paid and how kind of a\nQuick way to pet her in the budget or habit when the priority but like how long you been clean and having good for you ... what is it [noise] um ... show on ... where are they\nOkay All right well no I'm not going to put therapy on hold right now this is something you need you need some accounts were to walk with you as you finish this life transformation in that that is essential to you having a life\nWould you agree with that statement [laughter] now what I Would do is is number one it's not a permanent situation\nUm the therapies not permanent is not going to be there the rest of your life\nFifty years from now you're not gonna still be going to the therapists okay hope um and then a lot of stuff is just not very good [laughter] but ah at some point you'll you'll pull back from that\nAnd the second thing will happen is is that as you continue to address your income and you're out go you're going to find ways to make more income and as you are more emotional healing\nYou're going to see more energized to make more income and so\nThis month you don't pay any extra on the debt ... therapy good\nIf next month the same thing happens okay\nBut by this time next year we ought to be making more money right let's do something let's kick our life in gear and let's start to clean up the debt ... to ... for today Seventy five whole day's you've been clean [laughter] that's a great start\nRight but it's not like you told me you've been clean for two years by the time you calling for two years we ought to be have different having a different conversation about them\nAnd ... and ... as you ... and it's not going to be suddenly like a switch flips and you go OK I'm OK not getting the money no it's not all or nothing it's going to be gradual it'll be incremental you'll\nFeel better you you know when you're Ninety Days or your ... feel different than you feel right now and you ought to be able to do more and make more and save more and more and you know you you all have more focus on the money 'cause you'll be more you'll\nHave to spend less of your emotional energy just coming through this right now your game on just getting tired of this is that right ... [laughter] okay well I Want you to finish turning the corner you turn the corner and what you're finished turned the corner and let's let's go on out and then\nYou make incremental progress\nThe best shot but for today\nI often do you look at your bank account and wonder where all your money went how often are you stressed about bill's afraid your paycheck last but once you shouldn't have to live like that you shouldn't feel powerless over your money and you don't have to you can take control of your money\nWith the attributes university membership you learn to manage your daily finance is pay off debts spend and save wisely and invest for your future\nThe average person pays off fifty three hundred dollars in debt and saved twenty seven hundred dollars but ... but this is so much more than a money course it's\nAbout changing the course of your life if you're tired of living paycheck to paycheck it's time to join the five million people who live without money stretch yet started with an attribution of our city today by visiting Dave Ramsey dot com that's Ramsey dot com\nSure uh originally kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs stress kind of the functions of the other boys have a college fund in baby steps five\nUm the uh and that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special conditions and special rules because of course\nAh you know his his features of a worry for too early to know what is your fully what his needs are we've been blessed that he's\nHe's healthy developing well you know there's this guy said women for him just like anyone here um and we don't have to uh [noise] uh you know it's hard to really didn't know if he ever have any limitations\nBut uh but now we're getting into it and we haven't found something quite yet those were coming down to the wire why things that I'm uncomfortable with is that you know if I start investigating money or find the trial I I lose control of that to to try speed we've named didn't Ronald while I trust the trustee inability both Irish or if that makes me uncomfortable\nNo you don't you don't need to trust and lost both of you die right the special needs trust does not need to be funded prior to your dad okay so that it it sounded from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth\nOkay\nIt's not ...

in savings wire you you know trying to track your student loans they're only federal loans that they're not proud of that\nI've even heard some of my friends say that you know first comes to worst you can move out of the country and not pay your debt or\nAre you a fringe multi millionaires\n\nNo core up what they think about money you're going to take to our Russian broke people\n[laughter] yeah no\nI Know I Know it's I it's crazy just some of the things that they said like moving out of the country ...\nThe pool\nYeah but I'm Wondering unless you actually that's like saying I'm overweight and I'm going to lose weight and I'm actually doing it and all more overweight fringe you're making fun of my plan\nThat's kinda dome yeah yeah\nI mean who cares what they think we're using I wouldn't even go see it with them like somebody's been married sixteen terms and we're going to he'll be we emerged problem\nRight they got the honeymoon down they get the marriage thing do\nIs poorly run they could break the pension plan it's happened before doesn't happen very much\nBut um no I think you need to be putting Fifteen Percent of your income away in\n... for one k.'s whatever you got to do along those lines\nAnd and that's the thing I Would tell you the the reason is that what you've got that money you choose where it invest it and if somebody mishandled something at work it doesn't mess up your four one K. it doesn't mess up your ... you are controlling your destiny you not waiting on someone else the people you work for it affects your life\nThat's a big deal Johns in Pittsburgh hey John welcome to the day Ramsey show how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nAnd that's great I'm reason I'm calling is here's my question or my wife is sixty five I'm sixty two thirds just now into getting on the on the snowball we have a ... a month she find saved up mhm\nBut we're looking for a new place to live the house when you rent right now is just way too big for us my wife and I both got bad knees bad backs\nThem up and down the stairs and pain and about all the time okay um my question is um\nThe rentals around this area now are skyrocketing because there's new cracker plant going in so people are coming in from out of state sucking all those up her [noise] but I've found a couple of houses blackened courteous\nAnd the pay my rent right now is eight Seventy five a month or my payment was dropped to about six hundred and thirty dollars a month mhm\nUm the other part of it is [noise] uh when I retired from the post office I rolled mine are throwing savings plan into an IRA and good that I can borrow and not from right now with that I already jak to be able to put towards ... percent down on the house so I wouldn't\nYou're not talking to your to broke to buy a house and decker you're in debt you get your borrowing against your retirement I mean you're straining at every corner to pull this off okay I'm I'm not that you if you're moving from an eight Seventy five rental to six hundred dollar payment you're moving down in house substantially\nSo we're going to move down and how substantially moved down to a different lentil and let me tell you if the rental market is squeezed because of a plant that has come in the buying market is squeezed as well\nSo what you're telling me is not logical you're using this as a rationalization by out of order\nI if I were you when you call me and I ask what you should do it\nI Would rent something else move out of that rental moved to a cheaper rental that'd be fine\nAh for a short period of time that while you clean up your debt your debt free you build your emergency phoned up three to six months of expenses then you have a good down payment and you can do all of that in a few years if you're careful watch what you're doing and then make your purchased\nBut ah when you buy a house and you're broke you're asking for trouble I mean a Murphy will move in your spare bedroom bringing his three cousins rope desperate and stupid owning a home when you're broke and be a financial curse\nRather than a blessing Steven is in Virginia Beach Hi Stephen how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI Want to know what would be smarter to be All right now I have a lot higher and my name and I know you can only put five thousand five hundred ... a year yesterday hypothetically at me and my wife only had\n... mouth that amount of money five thousand five hundred to go toward the investing whether it be smarter to all of it into my ... is or should I open up a lot for my in my wife's name and then flip the five thousand five hundred and quit two thousand seven hundred and fifty in each other and to watch it go that way\nRight so Fifteen Percent of that going in it baby step for into retirement is more like a ten thousand\nNo it would be more actually five hundred okay um\nOkay so you wouldn't fully fund to but you could put some it it doesn't matter\nWhich one you do mathematically let's say you chose the exact same mutual fund and you put three thousand and one and three thousand and another okay one not one drop Iranian name one or a fire and her name or a um you put six thousand in the same mutual fund it's going to grow exactly the same\nSo it doesn't matter\nA hill I even have like a thousand dollars I can I could open up ... ... ... am and five hundred her that exactly\nDoesn't it doesn't give you any mathematical advantage whatsoever [noise] the only advantage is just a relational in that if she feels like that you know you're fully funding yours and she's not get anything for retirement which is not true because if you ever got divorced or died or anything else\nShe's going to get half of that money even if it is and your name okay so it's not true but sometimes people just you know like she just want some and her name that's okay so you can do half and half if you want you need to get to the point you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement that's baby step for\nAnd that would be after you were out of debt and after you had your emergency fund in ... which may be why\nYou don't have the money right now\nThat's why we put baby step for after getting out of that and after have emergency if I tell folks temporarily not to save for retirement till you clear your dad's that way you have the money to put Fifteen Percent away and a Fifteen Percent is more than ...\nEach ah that'd be fun or if you did a devout hundred and two thousand and the other name that's fine if they're in the same mutual fund you're going to get the exact same results whether you spread it or not doesn't change a thing James is with us in Fort Smith Arkansas Hi James how are you\nGood thank you for taking my call sure what's up\nAll my wife and I are planning to buy homes next year and or had a little trouble with the fighting or for agreeing on the house would want to get off\nIran and towards getting a fixer upper there'll be a cheaper house with lower mortgage payment mhm and that gives me the opportunity to learn\nLearn how to do the polar bears myself mhm and she wants to get moving ... house\nMhm okay and uh be your first phone\nThat they are second only at a house for a while ago and then we moved in rent printing her little over a year now you know\nThe other home that you had was it a fixer upper\nIt was not it was ...\n... ... and um so what is her fear\nAre it's just more or less to cook it you know and all that kind of a hassle Random House mhm I don't want anything major just this some minor cosmetic type stuff\nBut what can you do it for you moved in\nA financially I think we'd be able to afford rent and a mortgage\nNo I'm saying oh yeah okay and see what you're saying that you use a fixer upper would take a few months maybe and you wouldn't have them to do I got ya\nI'm a part time state aid and hope I live in a house for two years and then turn around and sell it\nI can on tax free\nHe's shown that any more about him I go to a shelter for anyway\nI don't think there's a I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to this is just a question of what

whatsoever but remember we live in a world of legally\nRight ... the Supreme Court for they look at the constitution and the kind of go okay this site over here goes I interpreted as it was written\nSide over here is just it's a living breathing document on the left side of the aisle it's kind of like open to interpretation it should be progressing with the times Trump sat down with ... and they talked about this and that's when he left the\nPolling ration some legal scholars believe you can get rid of the citizenship without changing the constitution weight executive order ... ah have you thought about that is the only law it was always told me that you needed a constitutional member 'cause they want and you don't\nYou don't write you don't so I was told them you need a constitutional amendment he's saying you don't and there's a few things in there and it's about language but a lot of people say well wait a minute just trying to change the constitution\nOne of the fourteenth amendment to the U.S constitution that\nThe constitution by an executive order or even legislation\nYeah so you can't change and a constitutional amendment you can't just go willy nilly go

everybody's\nAsking what is it about number one you don't need that number to nothing to do as well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order why is that well it's about language remember we live in a world were words do matter and for all the craziness to get thrown around in the world of\nPolitics these kind of legal ease words and how they're interpreted really really matter\nCan at a very small minority of others are reading into the language in the constitution where it talks about all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there are\nA few folks not writing anything that that language subject to the jurisdiction there ah it's a limitation that means children have undocumented immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and therefore are not birthright citizens\nSo and the constitution has been this the fourteenth amendment is debated

people who vote for Trump who can't stand Trump wanted anybody but Hillary or a Bush we've talked about that but they like his actions but they can't stand him as a person\nSo even some people who are like what he does can't stand who he is and you know you you get people there today who are upset who are angry because of what happened and they're not directly blaming him for\nThis but they're just saying\nHow 'bout you come out\nNext week and he said look this is the only time right now during midterms that I have to to do this\nThis is it and [noise]\nDidn't damned if you do and damned if you

you for saying that and dated urban place so that our understanding that there was an urban word of the day we damn stress ...\nHe has certainly I think found those moments to bring our country together and certainly focus on some of the things that all of us can support and all of us are can condemn as well\nYeah yeah yes and at times it [noise] it it's never enough right he comes out and says White's the premise or even with an awful and let's be fair to ourselves\nNot so much a wink and a nod but you know just kind of you know I mean there there was a time when I go to I I Wish you would have done more when it comes to this\nAnd the shooting no\nBut people are saying this isn't about him this is about the people who have died I agree I absolutely agree this is about the people that are mourning the people who have been through this tragedy that took place in that neighborhood that is undeniable but you can't say you want the president there and then if the residents don't doesn't show up at the third time that you want\nThat it it it's a no win situation I get why you wouldn't want them there any time of president shows up anywhere whether they're loved or hated it is chaos\nHe just absolute chaos\nSo I can understand why you wouldn't want him there at this moment in time\nBut then the people on the left and everybody else who's a critic ... can't say he's not trying to unite the country because no matter what he does\nIt will never be enough for you you're just looking for your you're always looking for the gotcha moment 'cause that's what we were a gotcha

right like the uh you know they're gonna blow themselves up they're going to crash a plane or whatever they're going to do what are those people\nDisenfranchised a lotta times they're desperate or some of them have families to try to take their their in a situation where it's no when\nDoing this for whatever reason and it's going to be great to me major your family and you know what else is because it can be cheering it's going to remember who you are they going to remember your name\nThe loners the same thing disenfranchise not quite all they're angry pissed off at the world blaming everything 'cause they're massive losers you get somebody going that that that is just in the echo chamber same things over and over again and now and the difference is sometimes some people are trying to force you to doing things\nThat you would by the way never do you have to be a little course and then never going to do that\nWhere sometimes people are just in the echo chamber and saying things back and forth back and forth back and forth and that's not good but social media for all the great stuff it brings you\nFor all the fun right without\nRealizing it in many ways that the spread of hatred is out there because people on both sides of the aisle people on both sides of the love hate world they they use it and I think there's a lot more positivity out there the negativity but negativity like everything is that greasy we'll that squeaky squeak squeak so it's going to get the oil\nTerrorists groups like ISIS and al ... and domestic extremist groups whether they be neo Nazi groups are anti government militia groups have all learned that they can influence a much larger group of people when they use social media\nYeah yeah much looked much larger why would I Want to speak to the people down the street where I could get forty or fifty when I can have five thousand or ten thousand\n...\nIt's I can somewhat retain a remain anonymous\n\nIt's it's crazy it is and you've seen an uptick an anti Semitism and it's not just crazy white people I think a lot of people just only white people there there's been an uptick of anti Semitism for the last couple of years uh and I know Trump gets blamed for everything\nSold nothing like how did we get here how do we go about fixing this water or the the the tactics that we need to start taking and addressing without crushing people's free speech right without getting allowing corporations to dominate\nAnd and set up the you know as Google has a good sense or\nYou know we don't want that but what can we do to be fast acting and and first into this and police ourselves to a certain way because what ends up happening is that what we're not policing ourselves when we're not going out there and fighting the good fight of you know not being a holes what ends up happening is Google and everybody else thinks that they have to do it for us\nAnd we're not going to you don't care what you do you're not going to save everybody you're not going to stop every crazy person with a gun you're not going to stop every evil person with a gun no matter how many measures you take\nI think a lot of people think that and that's just not the way it does and the more that you disenfranchised and piss some of these people off\nThe further they go underground the more angry they get then you start to lose touch with them and that's when it becomes even scarier three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... who is your Twitter Paul question up today with the birthright citizenship\nKerfuffle that Trump has

kind of took it a and it's all their fault at Trump's in office\nWhile they're trying to make the point the point to me made me laugh is they don't show up\nHeard before right we're we're ... you see
