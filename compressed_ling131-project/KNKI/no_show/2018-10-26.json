telling me like people I don't know how many I get probably Fifteen to twenty people who I Am me something they saw today right so here's some thing look at this what do you think of this and I'll say look at the source\nIf you're really serious about it if you really want information it's not hard the beauty of of all of these things these tricks jurors and the technology is the other side of it is you can find out how real some of these things are I mean we talked yesterday about the whole George Soros thing I got that so many of these this is George ... knots\nJust want affirmation to their belief so it makes it easy to spread these things when nobody really cares if this story is true as long as it backs up their belief system and that's scary or to me and a lot of ways\nWe're going to have a world where you're going to have things like the Kavanaugh hearings where all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer's strategizing with Michael ... or video will appear it'll be fake but video will appear and it'll be having a party and hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake\nBut in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be a potentially much more divisive than what we know today\nAnd and for all of that stuff though like I say if\nYou're serious about finding the truth that about something you can do that\nBut in the world that we live in for all of these technology advancements that are great that people use to do bad things or to try to divide that's a good portion of people trying to divide us our own selves\nAnd the other side of it is we let them because we don't want to think anything other than the things that we want to think we want our affirmation not our information\nSo we will just go to that and say it has to be true I Want it to be true so if I go to look for it and I find out it's not true that is going against my own belief system I wouldn't want to go against my own belief system so part of it is\nOur fault again enough responsibility to go around not personal responsibility not blame to go around and enough hate to go around all of those things are unlimited in scope\nAnd uh but ... we have an abundance of we're growing them everywhere personal responsibility affirmation ... all of this stuff we can all go grab which which one do you want to put in your little shopping basket well take some personal responsibility you know take some of that\nBut not too much information I mean if something's really insane like George Soros is the vampire I won't buy it but George ... being a Nazi maybe I'll take a little bit more information affirmation they're rather that kind of information 'cause I Want to believe it\nThere's actually national security exposures for this country and how much we ate each other around politics we need communities of people that live in the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\nYeah and you know what I Want to say this year you know what else is the big issue\nGoogle huge issue\nGoogle's massive you know that there is what two hundred fifty thousand engineers working at Google they dwarf China and Russia put together and the amount of engineering that's going on\nSome of the things that they want to do some of the things that they want to try some of the things that they're able to do with speech in a way that they go about doing it\nIs scary to it is very interesting\nBut yeah these are security issues that we need to be aware of what part of that I also looked at the people and I say\nPart of this is your own personal responsibility just because somebody tells you something or shows you or me or you read it somewhere doesn't mean it's true if you are honest about trying to find to yourself\nAnd saying I I I'm honest about my belief system I Want to find out if this is true or not you'll do the footwork to find out it's true\nBut our personal responsibility for many of us out there it ends once we see something that that ... that we go oh well I I Believe that to be true so I'll take it at face value\nAnd part of that's on us\nAnd you wonder why the people worry about the nanny state

rushing to judgment and then they're saying if they're on the progressive side that\nI'm tough speech results or ... violent actions such as these but of course that's a passive aggressive attitude because for the last two years most of not all but most of the rhetoric\nOf kicking people and get in their face and punching them behind the gym a has led it's come from the progressive side and yet

[noise]\nI'm joined by my colleague and friend Malcolm home line conference a president's major American Jewish organizations because November fourth approach\nNovember fourth is not the election in November fourth\nIs the day I Believe unless Malcolm corrects me that the sanctions from a from the United states will visit\nThe Islamic republic of Iran these sanctions are severe enough\nSo that we're concerned with the whole region and the economy of the whole region because we're not certain how Iran can proceed its economy it trade with the world its oil sales to the world we're not certain however\nIn addition to the November for sanctions we must talk about the driver for the sanctions which is the suspect nuclear weapons program so we go immediately to our colleague Ali hunting and\nHe ... he ... he's a senior advisor on science and nonproliferation at the foundation for the defense of democracies as well as the senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of government bell for Center for science and international affairs Ali a very good evening to you I'm Glad you're back because it's November fourth and the whole point of the sanctions\nIs to reveal or at least deter\nThe rainy the Iranian nuclear weapons program I go to the site Parchin I Believe that the site where the prime minister of Israel identified an archive of the work that Iran has done over the years and Ken started again when an F\nIs that correct just Parchin the place that the inspectors need to look or at least to cure for runs plans good evening to you\nLet's see ... or ... thousand he conceded the beginning of the implementation of so called joint plan of apps and CIA you have to solve this military related issues and they had the very least keep access so they

detail for that law case and what really happened there in two thousand two two thousand and three and two two thousand seven\n... in your report\nUm would you reveal anything about the undeclared nuclear activities in the ... military base and\nIs what you're saying that the the mistake made by not insisting during the Obama administration negotiations on including the resolution of Parchin as a precondition for the deal that we are now paying the price for it\n... it looks like that and we have not really going to find out the whole baroque from the whole nuclear weapons program over here on how long it was how far he went and most people don't have any of these activities continue\nWhether they still have some relevance equipment if they have it it should be removed or destroyed and all of this document which is ... always did from to heroin in my view they need to be eliminated a peaceful nuclear program doesn't need this kind of documentation\nDo you believe that the ... will then be given access to the ... site can the United states and hopefully the Europeans get together to to bring this about\nI Hope so but this is going to fear to fight because of the ethic you do the

presidents Iran sanctions Iran sanctions November fourth November fourth what is it made it why is everybody died it why the ... start All right we welcome Catherine ... power\nThe limits on cats family fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East policy former treasury official Kate a very good evening to Malcolm in I've been arguing you know because we are getting in your presence between break\nIn the break about what we're going to start with I Want to start with the swift Malcolm go right ahead All right but but ... what is swift and why is it part of this\nUp sanctions on November fourth that everybody is pointing to good evening to\nA pleasure to be with you I'm so stressed that financial methods are um\nOther states the predominant way in which banks send financial messages and financial messaging services are one of the activities of the origin of financial messaging services to Iran it's one of the activities that will become ... at the end of this wind down period that we're in right now\nIt ends on November fourth so as of November fifth that would be thinks shovel activity\nSo ... are they turned it into the community venues outside of ... which swift which you can use to force the zero import policy been\nSo so I should take a step back and look at the last round of sanctions I'm under the last round of sanctions swift um did cut off a number of rainy and banks and so that's what the U.S is seeking to see again um at least in part\nA what we saw then was that there are other ways to send messages and in fact a without the underlying relationships between banks the messaging services don't mean very much so if you think of the email analogy\nI could send you an email um but if you don't know me or don't want to have a relationship with me or not necessarily going to respond to it so it's not the way in which funds are moved its just the way in which messages are sent\n'em if you look at when the sanctions relief was put in place is another good way to consider it\nSo a lot of of of people thought that when Iran was given access again to the swift platform that it would be like turning on a switch and all of a sudden Iranian banks if he reconnected to the international financial system but of course that we didn't see that\nA lot of things were were wary to reconnect with her on a variety of reasons that were uh in some way it's related to sanctions overhang but it related to all kinds of other concerns in dealing dealing with Iran\nAnd so those underlying relationships didn't necessarily materialize what we've seen since the u._s.\nHave since withdrawn those relationships are so it doesn't it doesn't necessarily matter as much it's not a silver bullet\nUm if the banks won't uh aren't willing to do that the business anyway and I think that that actually the announcement that this special purpose vehicle that Europeans have have said they're going to put in place um to try to maintain a financial linkage with Iran when the sanctions that reimpose\nIs kind of an individual indication and acknowledgement um that those banks with or without swift aren't going to do it and they're trying to find an alternative even though it's essentially a barter system that they're proposing\nAnd not likely be very effective given the ... records but I wanted to ask you a two things one we know that Iran will look for ways to evade any kind of restrictions\nSo we see it now on the world where they're they're turning to disable do tracking system owned a sweet so you don't see the destinations volumes and it was a swift also means for us to track\nThe money flowing unit in Iran so those who raised the concern that we're going to lose that information you know valuable information for tracking the Iranians ... isn't real turned it as a means to do so\nSo uh first I think that that some of the the the conversation around living access to to to tracking Iranian activity it's it's a little bit of it as a Garbo and there's there's two things that are apples and oranges there is a program called the Tara finance tracking um\nI'm Sorry to hear that the terrified of tracking program that uh that the Treasury Department and ministers and has since uh shortly after nine eleven um through which they receive a information from swift under subpoena that can be searched to look for care financing activity\nUm and that's that's a separate kind of program ah this this with and that can\nTo ... issues that are getting mixed but but on the issue of Iranian beige and of course first of all there's other ways that they can send these messages and that they did last time whether it's by facts or email or any way just to to signal that they want to move funds from here to their\nBanks that are willing to take the sanctions risk of dealing with Iran um you know after November tests are probably going to do so regardless of whether or not Iran is on the program I'm just as you go ahead\nDon't know I I I don't want us to run out of time and we did not ask you about the efficacy of the sanctions so far\n... she was she did address that in your opening about the first round I mean we we try to keep track of the companies that have pulled out we tried to report because people don't know would you judge Jeffrey ... the first round of sanctions is successful and really impacting the target you ...\nWell I think that's a really important question as we approach November of it because I I think one of the thing to remember is that there were these two Ninety Days and a hundred and eighty day wind down periods or what that meant is that businesses had that period to to to lead any business that had been allowable and if they were doing\nAnd that a lot of of firms acted very quickly after the announcement and end with strip and so I'm In terms of of assessing the ethic as yet but I think you've already seen a lot of pressure um that that's going to be brought to bear through both the first\nYou know the sanctions that went back in place um August ... well before then just as you're going you know we've probably seen a lot of the impact\nUm that we're going to see a as of November fifth ah because this activity should have a already stopped and in fact\nBecause this idea of sanctions snap back within which was written into the Jaycee pure way perhaps not for a scene in

going to get to that 'cause you know she really is amazing ah and\nHere's the thing she made the point that if it's Halloween I mean like Tropic Thunder you know you've got a white guy plan a black guy\nOr or vice versa the idea that you're being racist it's all the intention actually agree with her on that statement but here's the point\nThey use that to get rid of her just like they use sexual harassment they'd covered up forever to get rid of all those other people in basic\nAnd they're going to people at CBS show it's just funny to see her destroyed and the jaws of her own political

and more people are seeing this as the looney left\nGoing further and further out towards you know crazy ...

losing membership and we might see that reflected in the midterms but as far as what we're going to see next I I think that the uh the bomb hoax who's going to be a fizzle especially if it turns out to be a liberal doing a false flag\nNo rain here and they're going to go from fake term real\nBut but what about my point they don't have command and control anymore that's why they're doing with ...\nThat that's all they've got now at a at a much bigger level we've seen Soros or you know over a decade willing to crash the economy's you know trash currencies to um you know to destabilize

bring every successful nation down to the media in which will be incompetent or Balkan knives tribal low I show\nUnsuccessful search and then they'll be the the elite masters of all\nAre they ... they have to get rid of the good examples that is why Sweden Germany America or the our primary target to this but you know I think that people are seeing it for what it is and and that's I think a lot

homeless veteran and he shot by the SWAT Team so he can't you know defend himself\nThe clues raw left in his trailer you know he he didn't do the shooting but he set up to be the shooter so it could possibly be that when they find the bomber it's at the end of a of a chastened a shootout in a fiery crash\nAnd inside of the car you know will be some right wing or can't rule it out just want to put it out\nTo exactly and everybody knows that I think it's like the shooter with Mark Wahlberg isn't very real type scenario\nRight yeah point of impact by Stephen Hunter was the novel the novels a lot better than the movie I'm actually ah but yeah ... ... they'll they would like to do that but I don't think it's really possible I just put it out as a hypothesis in case that does happen if if the guy is killed in a shootout in this body is burned a well except that he really was the\nRight well I'm not saying that she may have just been low level anti forgetting what the false flag narrative out of New York and doing it even a shirt and professor I think we're not going to show him and I would just I mean you're saying it's kind of him out of these people and and then now the global can't help but jump on it to use it but then and it turns out to be a Patsy false flag\nWhoever did this I think is in danger not for much but but but from the global issue now it's gone with the narrative and they're going to try to find out who it is and one of the FBI can get to him kill him\nDefinitely and play it more right wing material on them and and don't and don't let's not forget about the Caribbean and the caravans only on the back burner but as they more and more of them get put on in buses and on a flatbed truck\nTheir goal is to get to the border before the midterms ... no mistake about that then it will take all fourteen or twenty thousand just a couple of thousand mostly you know as many women and children as possible storming\nAnd then add if either start burning building

whether those are what are you really worried about now cornered rats I agree with you what are they going to pull maxed\nI've got a few more things about the bomb that are just occurred to me uh by by showing the the address is the big labels the font\nThey've made it very easy for copycat\nThey've basically provided something that will look like it came from this bomber that anybody can generate at home and send promotes\nThat picture I think gave away too much information um it just helps copycats that that actual hoax bomb there with the wires at each end and the fact that it was PC and had no black powder tells me that it's not a somebody even capable of making a real bomb like you suggested you know to show that they're serious\nI don't think that the person that made that could make a real bomb or they would have pack black powder in it even with no initiation method just so that it would be reported that they had black powder explosive and explosive or potential\nThe way they are they are no no explosive potential if uh if somebody was really trying to make effective folks they would've put black powder into them\nEven with no ability to to detonate them so I I think that um that they're they are encouraging copycat and we could potentially see a real bond but it won't be from this bomb or not this time\nThis bombers done and I think there'll be arrested\nAnd show it was somebody responding like you said in the political pheromones to do this to fall flat Republicans how embarrassing last means the Democrats\nThere'll be devastating if it turns out to be a a a a left wing or but on the other hand you know if if um\nIf it's more elaborate plot than we know and and they've got some uh some Patsy stashed away to a you know dying dying

latest on the suspicious packages of questions still out there where they live bombs or not it's really\nAmazing going through the different news stories yesterday right from yeah you know you can go

explosive devices and dangerous devices\nAre Cheryl Atkinson formally uh you know CBS News she's been following it and her latest one is look nobody had said these were actually lied bombs that could have gone off a officially earlier she had a a written this goes back about seven hours ago she had written\nOr the fact that you know law enforcement has not said that any of them are and then she uh uh clarified it a couple of hours ago and said now they're you know they're still calling them suspicious packages and write potentially suspicious packages and\nI think it's important and I you know you just you just wonder I mean now we and we'll get into this year and a little bit now you know we know the trail they're down in Florida but I think another play you know looking at the New Jersey whatever you're getting all these leaks\nRight but nobody has leaked really one of the most important things which would it would give would give or you would think the media would want the opportunity to go down different paths like Frank and so my first question would be where they live bombs or not mhm where they were potentially explosive devices that doesn't tell me anything\nAnd and what I don't see here is this a ... is is this an over abundance of\nOf of caution in a warning when we go back a several months to the Austin bombings you saw ... of the authorities in that area\nYou know because they didn't know what they were dealing with right they were talking about how people in the Austin area shouldn't approach a any kind of package on their porch or even their own porch especially something they didn't order or anything else they had to be very careful about\nNow there have been some you know a alerts out there but for something like what's going on right now if we were looking I think if you're looking at life bombs especially the fact that\nRight now you've got them all over you know it's not just in ...\nCarriers and you have a a number of people who might be handling such packages and also the unpredictable nature of someone who might be responsible for this that if these are live then or that can be very dangerous to the public and what I'm not seeing as this\nUh this this great calling for you know the public to be extremely aware of this while they have been the media's been putting it out there\nYou know saying this is this is kind of what they look like\nIt's more about the discussion on the investigation itself\nAnd and and less of a public warning and and again it doesn't say one one way or the other we're not coming to we're not trying to get to a conclusion here we're just talking about what we know and don't know and what we're seeing and what we're not seeing out of this whole thing\nYou know you have people um at the

few years under Obama to from the middle of last year or two right now up two point nine percent half\nAlmost half of that growth just under half ... uh is because of government increased government spending defense spending federal spending increased state and local spending you and I talked about the flaws of the GDP\nRight you know and it's the only thing that you can go by so you go buy it and not that there wasn't government spending before but they looked at the acceleration of the increase in spending\nAll over the last year and said that is cause for half of it and the reason that it's important as you know we look at you know everything in an economy and what my\nTo me the the terrorists the increased because of that the increase in cost of of timber and steel and materials or the you know the the housing or a slow down over the the the last a month\nA government at times believes that they can and people believe the government can help the economy and\nAt the same time manipulated into success ... by picking winners and losers and they can't look\nNot that there's anything wrong with increasing defense in ... there um but what we want to do is set that aside and look at where the growth is and isn't in the private sector\nBecause the the the what creates wealth what really moves the economy is the new goods and services that are produced by the private sector

this was the last several months ago but you're talking about when you call someone\nHitler what the threat is\nThen we were talking about civility then that was the setting yes and the media was you know talking about well civility and civility we'll wait a minute when you compare to someone to a arguably one of the\nMass murderers in history pure evil you're saying that threat to someone is that guy is capable this person is just like Adolf Hitler and his capable of doing the same heinous thing\nAnd when you do that that becomes a threat\nThat that you're saying that this person in this case the president is the same kind of threat that Hitler was and that's the ultimate threat\nSo the call for civility and the media pretending like this is all on the president you got to give me a break rhetoric is\nPeople ever exist on earth that's very different [noise]\nUh not only Hitler but when they combine Hitler with fascist and the or Terry in mindset yeah Donald Trump which has to be a dictator as we've said nothing indicates set in anything that he has done in any of his executive orders anything that he has fought from the court's everything\nHas in in my opinion about let me All right let me say that Ninety nine point nine percent of what he has has of what he was promoted maybe somebody can find one percent and make an argument that that will be willing to listen to so I don't want to say one hundred percent ... so Ninety nine point nine percent of what Donald Trump is has promoted\nOr his rhetoric may offend you mhm or his provocative nature may uh uh offend you but what is he actually does\nDoes he deserved is it fair to relate him to one of the worst mass murderers\nGenocidal mass murderers in the history of the world right is that even close to any type of accurate portrayal\nNo it just pure demonization an inflammatory rhetoric and what is it designed to do it is designed to create range in the people that will believe you fear and right it is not an attempt\nTo have a discussion on the policies of the president well let's look at this and\nIs that too much government intervention no it's Hitler it's the same\nAs the guy who are committed a genocide UBS six million human beings in concentration camps that's what Donald Trump is\nHe's a fascist let's do remote selenium there too wild what you know ... let's combine Hitler was Mussolini and let's combine the worst\nTrump well of course that's just the most bizarre and inflammatory things that you could possibly say and\nThe other point that we made over the last couple of days is after\nThe Steve Scully shooting a going after the the I Can't think of his name right now but the man who was a\nA you know a supporter of of a Bernie Sanders who attempted to assassinate members of Congress if it wasn't for the Capitol police you probably would have quite a few dead Republican Congress people right now mhm\nAh they came to the defense and we're we're able to stop that that situation Steve skull east representing ...\nSeriously injured did that change the rhetorical nature the inflammatory rhetorical nature of Democrats at all or have they asked it up\nTo the point of as we saw with Kavanaugh auditor insanity over the last couple of months\nThe reality is it's not going to stop why we live in a nation of free speech and people are are going to go to the limit of their of of of free speech and they're going to go to the ... that's just what happens\nIn our society we may not like it people may view it as an simple but it's the reality\nOf where we live and what is the thing that will temper that what will temper that is if they continue to lose elections Americans must reject\nMust reject that and it gets to the it gets to that point and so\nYou know we we have talked about you know also the morality of the media and and this is we think extremely important when you look at Donald Trump being accused of treason mhm the Russian collusion\nAnd they sit there you know when Sarah Sanders defense and said look it's it's been the the largest against this president coming from the media had been never ending\nRight the source stories that have been inaccurate that you hide behind your sources say well this is what our sources told us well if you can't if it's not true and you can't prove it's true you don't always believe your sources well\nIt you know you have or the remember the indictments came down with Papadopoulos and Manafort and the president tweeted a that day you know no collusion and then the New York times article that said he was tweeting that as they were proven collusion something to that\nEffect nope nope no ...\nAnd last fall that that is a blatant lie or complete incompetence either you don't belong at any you don't belong on Twitter if you're if you're putting that kind of if you're a reporter putting that kind of be at\nOut much less a major newspaper because there was no proof none still is done to this day\nNothing and you have what a false narrative that has gone on and still goes on and no one knows what more has in front of them know that may change but what hasn't changed I'll tell you right now is the false narrative well\nThink about this was just a couple of months ago in front of the White House remember they were there for days ...\nBecause of Russian collusion right and trees and and the president now we have the midterms it's not even a topic of discussion right it's like okay we can't go anywhere with the lie that we have perpetuated for the last two years so let's move on to something something else\nAnd then they they attempt to walk away it's\nFly matory rhetoric that exist today were completely innocent were just reporting\nWhen we're just we really don't think it's a bunch of crap right the only thing we're doing is telling you that uh he got there illegally he came to power illegally\nAnd with the help of another major nation that is the ah that that in terms of new is the only match really for the United states on the planet in terms of a threat\nAnd ah he is he worked for the Russians he's friendly with the Russians he's the fascist and he's capable of killing at Hitler was\nRemember it was just a couple of months ago we had followed the survey for the last ... over a year and that showed that the majority of Democrats still believe that the Russians hacked into the election machines and twenty sixteen\nYeah and we have a um an election coming up and what eleven days yeah and ah and where are they screaming about that it's gone silent now why is

hundred troops down to the border\nWasn't as big as the stories I thought it would be and I wonder that over the past week at the media has looked at this and said this isn't going to benefit us let's bring it up after the the midterms fight we believe this is actually helping Trump right and so since this isn't really going to since it's only gonna hurt as before the midterm\nLet's sort of berry

Fifteen\nWhen you know it was the night we were getting barrage with phone calls you guys just don't understand you don't understand where we know we know we know and that's always the argument from the conspiracy theorists oh you know something that you don't know there are more I feel special because somebody else has told me in and and I know\nAnd this was when they were talking about how top secret was and we had to bring out\nOf the uh a press release that was done from the local chamber of commerce in one of the counties that you know you were going to have the special forces in that had already figured out the economic benefit to their county right by [laughter]\nYeah somebody that was going to be spent on those things are going to be be spent that's how secreted was right that the chamber of commerce had done it I mean they've spent over two million on the tunnels under Walmart alone [laughter] you know we we dealt with it we we've dealt with it after the nine eleven conspiracy thrives remember we had to go to\nWe actually had to go on the show to Popular Mechanics and these are people that listen to our show yes\nShe theories that people were a buying into I remember we had to re portions of Popular Mechanics number Popular Mechanics said look\nI'm we do mechanics ... and so we weren't getting get involved in this and we realized wait a minute that's what we're here for\nThese things these theories about mechanics and physics are being put out there that's what we do let's see whether they're actually possible or not uh what was the other way we uh we dealt with it um\nWe dealt with it the night of the ... brothers oh man so we\nGo on we had been getting a information coming in about what was going on and we're in Watertown I'm about thirty minutes before we went on for about eleven thirty central that night and we started coverage route twelve thirty when we started getting confirmation of the of those reports 'cause there there was breaking news\nAnd we we continue that coverage or through the end of the show\nSomewhere in the middle of the show we started getting emails this the Boston bombing the other bothering bombing suspects and when they essentially went through water town and\nAnd uh that night that uh you know one of them died and the other one uh eventually was captured the later but when you look at the\nThe the ... about I don't know halfway through the show when we looked at our email that was coming in and it was about well it's it and they gave us the name these are the people that they're chasing these are the people that there why are\nYou saying that asking nuts and they were and by the way they were to Middle Eastern names\nRight and look we're not going to be\nDon't have any a desire to go out and be first I only have a desire and I believe responsibility to be accurate\nWant to be I don't want to put something out there I don't want to be a Brian Ross at ABC\nI don't\nBecause here's what's different about specific names if we get the details do change on on breaking news stories we know that better than most people because we recovered and we've covered some big stories over the years\nThe details do change but we're talking about like numbers or maybe okay it was over on this block or it was in this town not this town where that is they said the name if those names belong to people who are innocent Brian Ross\nOr anyone else that might be reporting something\nThen you start saying that because Brian Ross that ABC after the Aurora shooting well right there's information that there is a man with that name that belongs to the Tea Party well how do you know it's the same one you just put that on ABC TV and they got burned and and he got burned big time\nI Believe the goal and it is our goal to be accurate but the thing is is that there were people just they just kept pounding as\nFor the last half of our show because we weren't putting the name out in fact you and I it wasn't until about thirty minutes after the show was done when authorities announced who they were chased phone and that always the sunny and we set it on\nThe air we set it on the air that look there's a couple of names out there we just can't verify many legit source that we believe that we have confidence in that it is uh that that is true and and as you mentioned thirty minutes after our show\nIt wasn't the people right\nAnd so again we recalled every name in the book we're you know you name it we were called it for hiding the truth from the people\nSee that's the implication hiding something from the people were not looking to hide anything we're just looking to be accurate\nFocusing on is for the Republicans and the conservatives just focus on the truth\nBut so you can you can passionately attack the other side but don't play their game\nI've set up before they need to do it they don't have the substance of the issues they can't back up their points of view they need it it's out of desperation that they do it\nI don't feel desperate and whether whether\nWhether the side that I favor more wins an election or loses an election right I have never felt the need to use inflammatory rhetoric because I feel I have lost the substance of my argument two thousand two thousand they denied of election night\nAh you know are they all the power goes to the\nDemocrats and we

[laughter] [laughter] oh yeah\nWe'll we'll appoint you secretary of making pies yeah\nOr is this a out yesterday Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley announced that he is referring Julie sweat Nick and her loyal lawyer excuse me\nMichael ... to the Justice Department for potential criminal investigation as to whether they made false statements to Congress about Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and\n... said that in addition to making false statements he is asking the Justice Department to look into whether the Tucson to obstruct his panels investigation\nOf the allegations of Kavanaugh quote the law prohibits such false statements to Congress\nAnd obstruction of congressional committee investigations for the law to work we can't just brushed aside potential violations I don't take lightly making a referral of this nature but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future Grassley set in a statement and\nHaving any quickly fired back in a tweet saying it was ironic that Senator Grassley has now interested in investigations\n\n... that would be interesting to see where it tastes like that would go right\n\nYeah um you know you have a number of things there that honestly at that\nThat warrants an investigation I think\n... here's here's the question\nControl does it does an investigation like this go anywhere I guess\n\nBecause no reasonable prosecutor [laughter] what would pursue a\nA a a refer I I Would have to look at everything that Grassley has but here's the rights here in light of Mr sweat Nixon Mr ... own statements to the media\nInformation obtained from Kim in interviews of her associates and publicly reported information about her and Mr ...\nIt has become a parent that the statements Mr ... submitted to the committee likely contain material false claims rationally wrote him a letter grasses across does not guarantee the Justice Department will open\nAn investigation is the last part of that and well send he sent a letter to attorney general Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray\nRight because if the if the committee were to do I mean if they do an investigation then what would happen to them if they found that there was wrongdoing you essentially send the Senate you send a\nA referral to the Justice Department at that point I mean good for prosecutorial means if you found that there was a wrong doing if you through the investigation your own investigation from I don't know everything\nGrassley has yeah so I can so and I I ... I can only speculate that if it's you know she claimed the gang rape mhm right right right\nAnd then but here's the thing\nYou the investigation doesn't go doesn't have to go too far because of the fact that she went on TV on a national television show on the today show and started to walk back some of the things in that sworn statement\nSo it's\nWhere you're looking at you know it's like pulling teeth and getting some of the evidence or documents\nYou have things in a sworn statement that are countered in a nationally televised interview\nThat are different by the same person and the question is\nYou know what do you do with that I mean does the political climate change if ah if the Democrats take the house or you know and does that kind of soften I guess the or or or steal from the the the desire\nTo pursue justice here oh that this will be the Senate's\nI Know I Know but it doesn't change anything about the sentiment because there has to be that while I was again it goes back to that political will I think again no one is above the law and if you go through the process and this this really focuses on\nThe the if the uh the\nTearing down and the shredding of the actual process itself by the Democrats especially Ron that committee during that process we know that that was the you know the the hearings what we're about Dr Ford but this war was ... at ...\nThis was adding to a an intended to influence the the outcome of the vote on Kavanaugh the confirmation vote on Kavanaugh it was part of that entire you know process well it was ... separate from Dr Ford part of the camp a confirmation process so\nWhen you talk about doing it doing away or trying to do away or or completely dilute\nOr shred the process\nIn this day well just then then I don't know why you wouldn't at least pursue an event well when we had the lead come out and say look this isn't a trial just isn't a trial we said well no it is a political trial then and there are things that are similar to a criminal trial which is\nYour under oh mhm if you commit perjury mhm in you know if it is and that's what he believes you know making false state\nRight as we said it's different than a criminal trial but this is a political trial that has similarities you are put under oath\nAnd so the circus that we saw going on and I understand we're Grassley is going from if they if he believes and I don't know what evidence she has I don't know if anybody came forward\nAfter it I don't know who didn't testify or what information was not brought out the crash had that might you know that he might have now so I really don't know but if he believes that he can make that case\nFor making false statements base based on what she said based on the TV interview and based on\nWhat other people that might have come forward have come forward and a might have come forward since then have said to him absolutely he should go forward with that because it is a it is a legal process or if somebody commits perjury or makes false statements\nThey shouldn't be prosecuted we see what happens when we see what happens when somebody makes a false statement to an ... an FBI agent they go to jail Martha Stewart went to jail\nSo should we said that when a political trial happens because that's what it was\nThat none of the law should be followed at all that people should be able to go in and make a circus of it\nIf you can prove they know you know that they lied and their lawyer lied and their lawyer put them up to line should go after it I think the majority of Americans if you ask them that generic question\nAnd kept the you know kept the case out of it the vast majority of Americans would say yes well because it is it was an attempt\nI think you can they would probably be able to prove through this investigation that the attempt the the the uh the the motive or what they were trying to do was disrupt the process and if you do that through false means\nAh well giving false testimony\nPart of the process and if you if you can show that this was the the the clear intent here was to disrupt that process and you knowingly said things in that statement that sworn statements that were falls I don't know why\nYou wouldn't move Fort well what\nWhat did they take the house or not this is now in the department of justice which is under the president so I don't see it stopping if they believe they actually have a castle ... because it does it this really isn't at this\nPoint isn't about political will because frankly the left doesn't care about what no or apathetic no so you know my question on the on the house thing is that suffer from the political will it's not about political will really\nEight six six Ninety red eye\nBooks were sold for ... must be read or

not always [noise] it's not in an urban area\n\n\nYes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector not that we don't support an increase in defense spending no we're ... we're just talking about how we analyze how it applies to the economy is doing so without the increased in government spending\nOr you would have had a a a\nA growth rate of of two point five six percent up from the two point two percent from the Obama administration the point is hot\nFuels which drives the majority of\nThe private sector increase in GDP that's still what driving the majority increase in GDP in the private sector it's still not as much as government spending\nRight since April of of twenty Seventeen that's how much you know we have increased government spending over the last roughly year and a half\nWhen that government spending goes away so does the GDP increase that's why we have been so concerned and we've taken a great deal of criticism from people who used to agree with us but now disagree with us\nOn the increase of increasing the cost of goods by terrorist and as we've said it doesn't matter who you are it doesn't matter whether you call yourself a Republican or conservative or liberal a socialist a capitalist if you believe\nThat an increased cost in good in the marketplace benefits the economy then you don't know what you're talking about it's that simple\nAnd so that's why we have always been so concerned about trade\nAnd about artificially increasing the cost of goods and services when we've talked about the president and the new NAFTA the president's number one accomplishment on the new NAFTA has been what what he believes he has done to the car industry\nWhich will increase the cost of buying a car in the United states in Canada in Mexico and we'll make it harder to sell that product made in the United states\nOverseas which was what the president claimed he\nAll over the place on a particular issue one has to ask do you have any idea what you're talking about well\nAnd as we uh break down the GDP Growth and you look at it right now and the way that there's this long lead and they point this out on his Wall Street journal article for items like aircraft carriers and things like this so we're likely to see as this money goes through the ... a Pentagon and then his actually spent and\nAnd and at through the contractors were likely to see some of this growth continue in terms of the defense spending growth\nA leading the way into twenty ... twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty so what's important here is that you kind of separate that from what the private sector is doing we're the growth is in the private sector\nOr where the lack of growth is\nIn the ... in the end of that you do yes you you do have to\nSeparate the two because government spending even for\nA quip mend even though there is a benefit for those companies doing it that's not why you do it right it's not why it's not why you do it and but also that is the majority of that money mhm of increased and that money is coming from borrowed money is coming from money that the that we are putting on future generations\nSo the economic impact overall may help now but down the line the burden of the debt is going to hurt one works against the other one the other thing is the multiplier effect\nIs not the same as in the private sector because the multiplier effect in the private sector is if you build something\nThat makes somebody else else's life more efficient or make their business more efficient they use it and it's the combination of building that good in service and the increased productivity along that private sector in line that really boost it really is the true economic engine that\nThat that great demand a because it's that ... because it's\nCreate that efficiency and society and in and productivity increased productivity and that's where you see again that multiplier ah the create that huge expansion in wealth and and ripple out you're not going to you're not going to see that with defense spending\nOn defense spending you will build the initial product ... but the initial product is used for what that's the cost of doing business\nMhm what your ... and so yeah we understand how that helps the GDP but you're creating something\nYou're using debt down the road it's where yes in the ... the funding ... write long term debt to to pay for it but then that actual good service is not used in the private sector to improve the efficiency\nAnd productivity of other businesses down the line it stays there and it becomes a a burden of the cost of doing business on an entire economy\nYes man that I made a difference you could make a a very indirect a link to it and say that it preserves capitalism in general yeah in his role right but it but that does not have the same immediate effect that the private sector multiples are do\nAnd that and that and that's why when you look and that's why when we bring up the tariffs and the cost of home building now when the cost of of timber because those terrorists from what I Know ... until the deal is signed are still on with ah with with Canada the increase you you talk about the two biggest drivers\nOf of when you talk about what ... what the consumer marketplace of drive the economy it's housing and cars\nBoth have been targeted by terrorists ... we haven't even talked about food yet and what a drag that might be down around the road and the big terrorists haven't even hit yet and that's why we are we are so concerned with the direction\nHas the ... Congress talked about and uh about what they're going to do with the new NAFTA there's been ... I've well zero talk on what happens if you because they want to get this done\nSoon and what happens when the house if the house goes to the Democrats\nYou know can they get this thing done by the end of December can they get this through the end it because we're talking about what to the Republicans have they feel about it right we're not we're not just your young even forget about what we talk about the the house turning blue\nWe have to talk about it at ... the the Republicans right now and given or assuming that they might try and vote on it by the end of the year and so you have to ask what are the plans because the steel and aluminum tariffs still stay in place right\n\nAnd cheerios does in ... you're you're seeing some of the earnings reports coming out from major companies\nUm a number of them uh that that was\nA certain ... or or that came out a and yet for that you had a with their with their foreign sales as a result of brutality retaliatory tariffs a caterpillar and others\nThat are talking about business losses as a result of the terrorist situation but material costs I mean what about all the smaller companies\nAnd we talk about the contractors you know a Lockheed Martin is a given right but there are many smaller companies that that are included in that entire process hundreds if not England metropolitan hundreds of companies and the same with

apparently having the same kind of mindset that that we are we're finding all these this these things out about it at the FBI won't be specific were these lie bombs and were they active\nRight because there's a difference than sending a message\nUm and and you know I mean they're the it could be that at first I guess the speculation is a and you have to include the idea of it being all of the above in terms of it being a threat in in terms of being a sending a political message or and and you know or a broader message I guess\nAnd when you start looking at the terminology that the authorities are using what the I guess I look for first in some kind of public warning if you're talking about a very sensitive package and a number of packages now that have been all over the country are not just to\nThe threat is still active knowing that it's happened now for a period of date or repeatedly and you would warn the public as to what to look for and we haven't seen that that huge warning in

Democrats crazy that sticking\nIt the fact that even if they don't hear Republicans saying those crazy Democrats\nThe appearance of Democrats in the media is giving them this opinion for a Democrat to in a political ads for the Senate of the United states [noise]\nCall her own party and I know people will say well she was imported it was the actor no that's her doing it that's her ad she approved to cheer for him to a trip she was saying they were crazy true that actor\nFor a senator and then cut in senator to say that\nMeans that ... that is a worry right now right with Democrats not just in the mid term just because it's not going away anytime soon but even if they get the house they still don't have the power\nI'm not sure that I Would even here I guess it depends on if the race were different with Joe mansion if his race were different in terms of the numbers that were neck and neck if he would use that I don't know that he would use that\nBut we've heard the the idea of before you know over in the house side Tim right you know trying to challenge a Nancy Pelosi ah you know back in the day but the fact that what were they saying the identity politics\nBut it's it's that's that's gone from that that it's not about you know trying to ... it's interesting because identity politics almost sounds like an old phrase right [laughter] it full on ... that's [noise] that's so\nOur own language that the different systems what the people are clearly telling the McCaskill campaign and the feedback their internal are seeing that praise used repeatedly\nAnd that's why it was used in the ad\nAnd that's why it was our audio cut\nOf the the week and I burst out laughing when I saw the Claire McCaskill yesterday called for civility in the debate we need civility stability what do you mean you're calling your own party crazy [laughter] much do you really mean it\nIf we had a lot we can understand we understand in politics you call in the opposition party crazy drier calling your own party crazy yeah\nWow\nJust a crazy rate than it [laughter] and and she really is who you talk about being in the middle well she's a middle of a rock and a hard place that's where she's in the middle because\nYou've ... she had to vote on the Kavanaugh thank right I mean that action is there and it's lasting it's reason enough at least and will be up through the election to make an impact\nAnd the behavior there\nIt's remember they weren't referring to crazy Democrats the protestors on the street no no this was the party they were talking about the party and we pointed that out\nDuring the Kavanaugh's confirmation process you're not talking about fringe up protestors on the street you're talking about people that were sitting on the committee these are these are the leaders of the party\n... and we were talking in reference to due process and present from the innocence this wasn't the radical protestors out there screaming you must always believe the woman this was coming from the mainstream of the Democrats and as we said most people look at that and we gave some of the credit to all the lawyer shows that have been ...\nAnd and and they do know the whole concept of due process because everybody has watch law and order or or ... one of the other many thousands of of of a different TV episodes dealing with what goes on in court or in this country and they looked at that and they went this is crazy\nHirono white men need to shut up ... you look at that and you say that's crazy mhm and it stuck mhm and so Claire McCaskill was forced\nIn desperation

just heard today or I think the American people would would side with George Papadopoulos uh uh regardless of party and when you hear it and and yet I don't I don't see a public hearing happening just to be Frank\nWho you are basically and that is Mark Meadows and you said you George Papadopoulos here in Studio you said I Want to go public and they should with who you do better behind closed doors in retrospect was he right\nUm I don't know about doing better or not but maybe the things I was talking about we're very sensitive and perhaps that's why it was better to do it behind the scenes you have three\nCountries coming at you Britain Australia and the U.S said in the United states FBI\n[noise] that's right and to this day I don't understand why I had this particular ... target on me\nConsidering the we have the most sophisticated intelligence agencies in the world working here at home and what the UK and Australia they of course knew I had no rush of contacts I mean you could just simply do background checks\nSo obviously I wasn't targeted for that I was targeted for some other reason and it's not my job to figure it out of the jobs of you and the other reporters and probably Congress to figure out why Papadopoulos was the target\nAnd George of saw a lawmaker they read the transcript of your conversation with him Basset or down or said my biggest mystery is why would George ever take a plea admitting guilt from lying to the FBI\nAfter reading this is what am I meant he asked me what am I missing I don't know what why did you take a plea I'm ...\n[noise] well there's a reason I have a new council now and I'm looking at all options to fight this and the really as I said on a ...\nThere's it's not just for myself it's for any American citizen who might be targeted lawfully Ron lawfully by armed got ... government so you're looking to possibly overturned that play ... absolutely a that's a risk with that\nThere's a risk but you know what it's a it's a it's a worthy of risk because um my reputations on the line I think the integrity of his entire investigations on the line and sometimes you have to think of the greater good and not just yourself who's your interaction with the Mueller probe like um I really can't get into too many details about my exact interactions with them but um ... as I said I'm looking to fight this right now so\nUh they've demoted probes going to come out with a whole bunch of indictments evidently after the midterm elections if it's based on George Papadopoulos and they build from there what's your message to the Mueller probe\nUm I have absolutely no idea who they are looking at or what they might be doing all I can do speak for myself and the um if ... as I stated earlier I was targeted by western intelligence there was absolutely no reason I should have been prosecuted here is a Mark Meadows cut thirty for\nWhat's troubling for me is there a today a there is even a greater confirmation in my mind a that was inappropriate behavior on behalf\nOf the FBI and the OJ as they initiated this investigation is they continued with the investigation and as they continue to not give information to [noise] uh whether it's Mr Papadopoulos is counsel for the American people are Congress\nBecause you have to put this together and you're you're not giving you information about you a ... look if it wasn't for the great work of a certain reporters I to this day I don't think anyone in this country let alone me or any council of mine would have known that there was this exculpatory evidence and use it very interesting that\nThis myth said at the helper or down or that one thing in common they don't like President Trump and from ... mix it worked it seems with Christopher Steele to on earth the corruption with the world cup and that's how ...\nIt's insane I mean it's absolutely crazy how what I wandered into and I'm just surprised you know I wasn't looking at a lot worse charges because probably my\nMy I got was right on about a lot of these meetings George I really love that you came in here sorry you had to go through that will talk to you again soon though much doctors are stepping up next we'll have you back thanks so much [noise]\n\n[noise] I talk to those points a G n K I find that [noise]\nSo the GDP and when it was it four point to last quarter and a half three point five to two very good numbers\nBut now you have the tax cuts and the original premise was hey are Republicans running the tax cut and the new one is who did this caravan and immigration and this is what we're talking about and it's not a ... it's not a what if it is it's happening\nThe Republicans running on the right thing\n[noise] well look this election is all about Donald Trump just like a Michael Steele was suggesting\nMaybe not the way he was interpreting it but Trump has placed himself at the center of this election he was going to be the center anyway Democrats would've made in the center of it if he had made in the center of it\nAnd most votes are going to be cast in reference to him that's not to say that issues don't play a big part they do for Republicans\nOr immigration has been at the top of the list for three years\nAnd that's why the caravan you know what I hear people say the Democrats funded the care of it I have to laugh it should be Republicans funded the care of that 'cause it's helping candidates it's putting immigration front and center right at the critical moment of the campaign the final days of a campaign\nSo Kavanaugh the caravan\nA and Trump himself that is that's what's driving the Republican side and to some degree the Democratic side\nWhich drew down on this is what Democrats have been saying some current trouble exist in the majority of non white districts were Democrats worry about turning out the Hispanic vote they have largely given up hope of an seeding will hurt you know who goes against the president on the wall and the other things in these uh CIA guy remarkably competent and diverse\nBut and and and another uh now\nThere's great concern I Know on the Democratic side about getting a good turnout because they didn't get it and twenty six team I mean it was Hispanics African Americans\nIn millennials who did not turn out anywhere\nClose to the rate they were expected to and of course that made the difference so they've detected relatively low interest among Hispanics in the mid term election and and normally frankly\nUh minorities in millennials don't participate in the mid term so that's kind of a built in structural advantages for the Republicans [noise] ah so you know you've always got access as you mentioned will heard what parties need to do and they have done to a certain degree is to allow the district to dictate the nominee\nAnd in the case of will hurt that's a moderate district relatively speaking up close competitive modern district and will hurt has played that correctly he's he has used the issues that help him in avoided the issues that hurt him and that's why he's the favorite\nDoes that make sense and by the way we need people like this who are going to have the lucrative security careers and got a chance to norm little bit when they go back in the service worried they pay okay but you're going to places on a regular basis\nYou're not you it's truly service and for Republicans to criticize will her and I'm thinking to myself what do you want in a candidate they all can't be speaking from the same him she then you're not serving the country do you agree Dr ... well\nYeah and also you can actually get a majority if you insist on that you have everybody looking and sounding exactly alike this is a very diverse country and so you have to adjust the nominee to the district and and really vice versa during gerrymandering but and you're right\nLook people think that Congress Miller very well off and so and it's all of them are some of them are very wealthy before they come in but for relatively average people of modest means and they're quite a few of them in Congress it's a struggle to run a house\nExactly except not even close not even close friends you know how did he gets goes up it gets ... yeah well\nWe're not he's probably doing just a little bit better so he owes you\nRight now yes and put it this way my helicopter is not a new when he gets a new helicopter ... mine I ... I bought an old during an refurbish\n... for me I insist on a new job every year to my contract\nAll right so having said that when we leave transportation for just a second and again I blame you for getting us off track and add to that I'm a hundred percent correct yes Peter\nPromised means go cut that part of who it was ever have a record of who is Peter I got to meet him he's yeah he's he's one of your of hundreds of assistance exact I they're running some machine Tom\n... runs the DNC tell me if he's playing a game or is he really worried\nWe will look at their election it was going to be close I I don't use the term ... I always talk about the need for blocking and tackling\nI Know a lot of people talk about this blue wave and all that so I don't believe I happen to think\nThat on a lecture night you're going to find a very very close situation in a maybe a handful of votes determining what the Democrats\nAre getting control of the house\nAnd so they just plain down expectations Bernie Sanders ... just a pushing aside the blue wave trying to motivate people\nIn a while it's both really I mean basically they're saying ah I'm having flashbacks twenty sixteen I'm afraid\nThe other half of it is a they have to insist that the election is very very close to get there are people out because many Democrats aren't used to participating in midterms so it's it's a bit of both are in the middle of the night they were having the twenty sixteen flashbacks\nDuring the day they're trying to motivate the Democratic party constituencies\nIt's hard to comment on\nThe show walking upstairs they found they looked like another package was heading to Cory Booker\nDo hear that they're close to an arrest but so far that hasn't stopped the packages that were seemed to have been put in a put in place some point this week when you look at this and we hope no one's heard and they seem to be a bomb making material but no there is no at night are there and know blasting cap thankfully\nOr having said that who does this play more for the the the Democrats who say that the president's language is causing this or the Republicans are who are security a party\nI Want to see who it is and maybe it's a person maybe as persons that you gave me some good news I hadn't realized they were close to an arrest I'm thrilled to hear that\nBecause this is intolerable it God Knows I Hope that one hundred percent or maybe Ninety nine percent knowing knowing our country as we do [noise] Ninety nine percent would agree this is absolutely unacceptable this goes way beyond the bounds of of anybody's definition of a discourse in politics\nSo let's find out who did it let's find out what the motives were then we can assess\nThe damage if there is any maybe there won't be any effect at all politically but we have to know who it is and what the motives were\nHow can a president and I asked this question yesterday without creating a great answer so all the pressures on you a president who's had three uh three hit books on it from ... to Michael Wolff to Bob Woodward he had an anonymous staffer write an editorial talking about how we incompetent tea is\nHe's had multiple people like Tillerson and reportedly Kelly basically comb an idiot\nBut yet he is now at forty seven percent of the wall Street Journal NBC and forty four percent of going to CNN approval that just about just above President Obama how did and now he's ... and now he's trying to nationalize this election and making about himself\n[noise] sure he made that connection with his people the people the forty six percent who voted for him that has endured of course you also have to say he made a connection with the people who didn't vote for and that is also endured\nPeople made up their minds about Donald Trump a long time ago this additional information you just mentioned the up much of it it makes no difference if you're a forum you're really for him if you're against him you're really against him I've yet to meet anybody in the middle\nWho you meet him you polled them I mean independents are undecided you'd motor there say\nNo but they're they've already made up their minds about Donald Trump they may not have made up their minds about who they're going to vote for\nIn this midterm election because after all while Donald Trump is is center stage\nThere are other people on the stage I mean the candidates matter their issues matter the ah the states in districts matter so ah you once again you're over generalizing Brian and I guess this is leading back to another discussion another plug for your book\nNo I think that you are becoming more belligerent than Chris Wallace on this show and I didn't think that was possible\nThis is ... ...\nWell I tell you I really didn't give me a run for the money they hitch a damn getting and really hurting my self esteem I don't know I've had the confidence to have a good weekend we'll\nGive it over to your staff let them have a turn at the Mike I'd like to see how they do well\nYou know I I don't if I knew who they were it would definitely right now if you look at your crystal ball a well how many seats are sure how many are up for grabs in the house well\nWe don't have either party over to Eighteen we've been very very cautious and that means the remaining tossup so I think twenty twenty two remaining toss ups that's where the election will be decided I don't see a suit me I don't see a big blue wave I said that for a long time I've been very consistent\nIt's already found have been discovered today details from ABC ...\nThe NYPD was go to

finish up this half hour one eight six six eight seven six six nine when al up to twelve packages said dad to various Trump critics across the country are well known that latest being James Clapper and Cory Booker so they're all defying and they got to stand up and we don't know who this person is\nAnd I hear and I've got a pretty good source that are they're very close to to get at least one of the guys so let's hope this happens within our show as you know we're streaming as well as on local stations\nAnd I hope to see everybody in St Louis tonight it's probably one of our most successful station certainly the greatest people\nBig live some part a during uh during Fox and friends so a lot of people comment on that Alice maybe you can get some comments up but let's go out to Scott and listening on Facebook or watching it on Facebook case got\nHey Brian how you doing sir good what's your name on\nSorry we I Am a a Desert Storm warmth that I'm Glad I Am a conservative and I am a national is just like President Trump gr up leaving America Americans first and I don't understand why the Democrats don't think the same way\nThey're there to serve the public that there are served this country\nBut yet they create chaos confusion in the fight they fight general manager ... President Trump could have done if he had their support or anything\nI I agree I mean all this I'm going to I'm just going to\nJust to push back a little bit I Love doing the president brought those cameras in and negotiate it on camera especially when it came to guns and we came to immigration\nAnd I would not have minded and a lot of people going to be mad at me but I Would not have minded if the president got his twenty five billion for the wall and exchange for giving the DACA or the DACA kids now young adults a ten year path to citizenship\nI Would not have minded that because then you go back and you realize that chain and lottery or something even Democrats aren't very ... they aren't necessarily against ... when the beginning of possibly a cascade of deals now I'm being optimistic\nBut they said the Democrats they feared he was going to start with infrastructure why\nBecause that would have made them play ball instead it was his fourth or fifth thing and they said well you know I we we just we don't like what he's doing you know with this tax plan and everything else so we're not going to participate Scott if he could hold the house and Senate I think they're going to get stuff done\nAnd I think so too I mean just the first time since I guess since\nReagan that I've been optimistic about America and the benefits of marriage is that like a week you know I feel that President Trump is doing these amazing that that in there were just ... to do right and he made a lot\nWhen I say he is ... ... ... if you do this and what people being able to cope with their own special interest heat and you're only ... ... ... ... how do we built this world\nIn so many different ways and I agree we should not still a sovereign to anyone because you're ... your book about Andrew jak yeah even though I might not agree with a lot of ... was about when it came to personal life but I Love the way he attacked the bank\nI Love to write this ... thing is he was about America and there's no question about that he was not for his fame and acclaim back in a moment thanks great call\n\nTrusting challenge [noise] I talk to the point seven million K I find I'm going to be the station [noise]\nThey know almost immediately whether something is a viable device or not much in the authorities in New York have said these are not hoaxes these are potentially viable devices um but not one has gone\nOff and apparently none of the packaging the way that normally they would expect something like this to be done if they actually want to hurt or killed people is it the packages booby trapped to go off when you open it they said that wasn't part of it either so\nHe's adjust to strictly in the work quote terrorizing me to instill terror and people to frighten people or\nIs it actually about harming people I mean these are two very very different objectives and I think they know a lot more about that then they're saying at this point\nHey I'm honored stance are free don't you feel bad uh charging as a notary I don't I don't know like anger that I Need that four dollars and it makes a difference for me so if you want your document I'm going to need the four dollar that's fun\nSo a lot of people are saying the president should have taken a more conciliatory tone a stump speech when he said he's fighting back and he's saying listen maybe if you weren't ripping mean Ninety two percent of the time going just at CNN and MSNBC you wouldn't create so much heat usual Rush Limbaugh said cooked Fifteen\nBecause they're not they are trying to pass responsibility and there's lots of Donald Trump and trying to get us to shut up\nIn response and in opposition to we're supposed to sit here and said oh no no no until we know the facts we can't comment while they comment left and right and start ragged on Trump or his supporters or what have your while we're supposed to sit here and be polite and have good manners and not say anything about it\nAnd the that for the most part I Am stunned I thought on the Sunday show to get a lot of opinion and talking about President Trump's tone and Maxine Waters and the horrible comments Eric Holder said we're going to kick 'em and ... this was happening hours after the packages were found Shannon\nMhm so you're going to get worse until we find the guy\nInteresting because guide Benson a wrote a piece in town hall yesterday and he pointed to some um [noise] video of Nancy Pelosi after the shooting that nearly killed these ... and she was in a press conference and it it must have been within a day or two after\nThis had happened the shooting it happened and she asked about those who are trying to link is to potentially someone on the left or somebody who was upset by the Democrats which we now know exactly\nHow that played out and her comments where this is outrageous how dare dare you go there this is disgusting this was a terrible event how dare you make any links between political ideology or try to blame this on anyone but for the president for the ...\nUh of the DNC or vice chair and Michael I'm Blake and he started immediately saying with the president bear some responsibility to this and I said wait a minute what exactly are you saying then the person who put these devices together and mailed them and put them into the stream to try it frightened people or wherever the objective was\nThat's the person who's responsible for this and he wanted to have it both ways that they don't put words in my mouth I'm not saying the president actually did this and I said well what you're saying is the president's bears some responsibility for this and you have to be very clear about that because you know and those conversations in the weeks a after steep squeezed was almost killed\nThere were a lot of folks who are objecting and saying it's not fair to tie that to a particular party and the truth as it is the individual who pulled the trigger or makes device that is ultimately the person that is very troubled and has a problem and they're the ones\nAre left or right or center or if they're just disturbed in some way they're the ones who's made who have made this decision to um put these things in a place\nHe ... the a ... that's a big topic or the other topic of course the midterms\nAnd the care of and but I Want to bring into the robber mode of education because on radio and TV we had George Papadopoulos remembers the twenty eight now thirty one year old who was a unpaid foreign policy advisor who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI\nNow he's starting to put his whole the series of events together and he believes the D. O. J. and the FBI along with three separate countries combined to set him up\nBecause they didn't want to be president only did become president they wanted to hurt him and he uses evidence of actor John ... of his original contact those original contact in England it was a multi professor and now we find out a working for British Intelligence\nAnd then we find out to the ambassador down are avid says Clinton ties also supposed to be linked to Australian and British Intelligence\nAnd now we also find out this stuff and how for an American who worked for the FBI all time\nNow over a overturn a overturned his conviction in his plea he was with Mark Meadows said after going after hearing what he had to say behind closed doors yesterday and the committee hearing cut thirty two\nI can tell you that I Am very trouble that his Fourth Amendment rights may have been violated in it the way that this was conducted was certainly inappropriate and not what we were believed to be standard protocol for the FBI\nDidn't like it and he went on cut thirty three\nYou know listen I if if he testifies publicly based on what we just heard today uh I think the American people would Woodside with George Papadopoulos uh uh regardless of party or when you hear it and and yet I don't I don't see a public hearing happening just to be Frank\nNot happening but because he was pretty move by what he heard behind closed doors what are you hearing 'cause he's starting to realize that all these people were setting them up\nI think it's really interesting your interview this morning I'm which of course I was on a wait to see it but I read the transcripts or he lays out a very interesting set of events and circumstances in people and timing that raises a lot of questions I think for anybody who had a real desire to know exactly what was happening with the\n... and how it got started\nUm who the players were what the aim was I mean what he lays out he makes a good case for himself and for the you know his theory that he was being set up in an effort to then be able to go after the Trump campaign in some way or the president himself said he when\nI'm I think people should listen to what he has to say and and make a judgment about it but\nYou know he's drawing some links and connecting the dots a in a way that I think raise a lot of very very serious question\nAnd I'll paraphrase Shannon and he said that one of the tweets that Peter Struck had a was a that he is we are beginning to what our source or or or Ross\nDay that in Basset or downer a it was the day after he met with the ... down and he ended up being a tape conversation to somehow Peter ... get that he does not believe that was a coincidence if I'm the Russians source original source I Know rushing connections lifted came up to me and approached me and asked me\nIf I if they told me that Hillary Clinton's emails were about to be released\nSo then he gets an information unsolicited and then these asked that by downer who turns out he's a British asset who gave millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation and Australian of more than just an ambassador\nSo he's challenging that and he says will data was even nice she goes he was he was very aggressive towards me told me as you walk away from Trump these horrible person that we've never going to get elected so\nI'm listening to all this they're all connected together and all that something else to this cruise to re steel made his name by investigating the world cup and exposing corruption right guess who was a member of the world cup committee\n... percent\nYes who do not get charged mix it and he's one of the few not to get charged so there's a relationship there before Donald Trump was even running for president so that yeah it's a it's a drama that you can't believe that that actually probably took place\nRight and if it was scripted as a movie [laughter] I keep all might say like this is just too fantastical I mean it's just all of the different links and all of the different connection and you think about this guy twenty eight years old at the time I mean thought he was doing a good thing by\nUm you know helping out at a campaign and the candidate that he's very much ... than it sounds like he's still very much does still believe in\nUm the feeling that now that he was a pawn in this situation and that's that's highly possible and then when you think about the level of sophistication of the people that he was interacting with and their connection to each other um it just raises so many questions along the way I'm sure you've thought as many Americans\nAnd it's only can be that they just assumed like most people did there was no way that Hillary Clinton wouldn't become president because some of these things are so sloppy and questionable you think they could not have ever thought they were going to have to answer for some of these things right\nHe's the insurance plan he believes anyway so here he is when he realized just a couple of weeks ago that according to his lawyers myth city is a British uh works for British Intelligence listen\nSuicide infamous professor Joseph ... professor that are just a couple of days ago a multi\n... we're living in London and as a professor exactly\nI'm living in London tied to all these western intelligence groups but then you know he starts to present himself as a Russian insider and basically a couple of days ago his own lawyer one public and said that he was working for the FBI not Russia so it's very confusing I don't understand why his own lawyer would make such a statement if it is false I don't believe it's faulty\n... I mean his his his head is spinning mhm so because\nI'm hearing in more suspicious packages are now in the hands of investigators to more discovered\nThis morning they look a lot like the suspect that explosive devices found this week one in Florida was addressed to senator Cory Booker ABC's turkey has more on the second device found in New York\nPolice were called to the post office on west fifty second street here in Manhattan where employees found a package similar to the one cent earlier this week it was addressed a former director of national intelligence James Clapper at CNN he spoke on the channel\nIs definitely a domestic terrorists last month the\nNYPD bomb squad put the package into a containment vehicle and we'll send it to the FBI lab where analysts had been exploding and detonated suspected explosive devices for clues\nAnd ABC News chief justice correspondent Pierre Thomas has details on that part of the investigation also\nTell us agents are searching for fingerprints on the uh well we're told them both sides of the tape even the sticky side have the potential for fingerprints something that bomb maker\nLeft or right handed another important job figuring out if the bombs were actually capable of detonating if they were not the oldest will have to determine if it was because of the sons law or intentional\nPresident Trump this morning tweeting quote Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now this bomb which he puts in quote stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows the president went on to say very unfortunate\nThe Trump Administration now says Russian President Vladimir potent as being invited to visit Washington next year national security adviser John Bolton says they're still working on a date at the national cathedral this morning [noise]\nTwenty years\nWas killed attack for being gay his remains or being in turn their today\nCommerce Department saying the economists still growing GDP up three and a half percent you're listening to ABC News\n... stories from CDW solutions company was setting the pace and expanding service for their customers unfortunately there's like a C infrastructure couldn't keep up to me just CDW orchestrated a new ... enterprise clubs Lucian that integrating surfer storage virtual addiction and networking into a single hyper converge platform that skills to their changing needs\nSimplified skill ability by ... by CDW learn more CDW dot com slash new tanning\nCDW people who get\nIndeed knows it's hard to find qualified candidates when you're hiring it's like finding a unicorn when you post your job on indeed it's easy to find people with skills you need a nurse practitioner for ... plus years experience acute care certification indeed has a huge pool of amazing candidates and screen the tools that help you find\nYour most qualified applicants and entire shortlist of unicorns feeling more than three million companies worldwide using the higher post your job and do dot com slash higher\nIndeed the world's number one job site source costs more to visit\nWith thousands of migrants still marching slowly for Macs\nApproaching caravan to turn around immigrant advocates say that's unlikely to happen quote an inscription on the statue of liberty\nSending your tired your ... the wretched refuse of your teeming shores\n... minutes of Holy Cross retreat center loss cruises Mexico\nIt doesn't say but only until Montana has full and they'll have to have faith\nHe's now scrambling to find food clothing and shelter for the anticipated surge of new arrivals ...

the nation's premier\nStory engine decorated a military veteran boroughs are going to be joined by a generally is who's standing by but we do have some breaking news Alison right\n... the law enforcement source confirms the fact that a person has been arrested in Florida in connection with the suspicious package and explicit license\nSo we got twelve packages total and they already have an arrest in connection they didn't necessarily say that's the guy but I had heard last night that they have a guy and cops I did not get it during boxer friends with the first I was a big show but now with H\nStop the New York would be right now is I'm a generally Jenna what's your reaction to his what's it like in Texas now\nWell I mean this has been a big story for everyone for so many different reasons as I'm sure you've just got spray and of course it scary to think about any suspicious packages showing up anywhere but there's been so many layers to this story a needed instant blame rhetoric and politics and not having a lot of facts in something that\nAll these people are talking about in this neck of the way you know we we really have no information about the suspect or the motivation we\nOnly know what the targets and so here and that's how my is really promising to me as a journalist because I really want more information who is this person and one of the things that we really looked at it smarter news if they've gone back and looked at well who else has\nSent suspicious packages over the last year and I'm sure you're aware of that person back in March that show that ... about a dozen packages out you know one of them to to the White House into different political figures and it\nTurns out you know without without having a more details on the investigation I Believe there is an ongoing court case about it you know it turns out that the likelihood is this person's mentally ill not necessarily a political operative\nAnd so I'm really curious about finding out more information you still rightly pointed out we don't know if this is the person or semi connected to it but what the deal here I think we really need a lot of information to quiet some of the extra conversation that's happening without a lot of facts\nRight now it's more news is as limit your a site um and you can get at smarter news so you also are put together on the news sources in a new guys ... news items or or a bowl of old couldn't breaking news\nFrom around the country but as we look at this in particular these are this bomb making material these look like bones but there's new detonation in any of these packages so you're not looking at Thirteen people hurt or the you know or multiple people hurting were multiple\nBelow with bubble wrap in the inside is all the same and one thing is as clear these are all the targets are all enemies of President Trump and President Trump feels as though he's been unjustly blamed because of his tone in tenure because of something like this\nRight I think that's an that's an interesting detail\nThat comes to word that's been reported about the packages themselves I mean I think that we always want to look at it in the news you know how sophisticated are these packages who who could influence the packages are these these us you know so called bonds at this point I'm going to be really curious and we find out even more information about what was inside the packages to get there\nYou know it wasn't a detonator if there wasn't this certain you know the certain components that you need to to build a bomb you know God Forbid that anyone would open that package what does that tell us about this this aspect does it tell us that you know this is just to scare people does this tell us that this person was you know an\nTime how's

was plastered with stickers of Trump the presidential seal and other ... political signage\nAnd authorities have now taken into custody I'm sure they're going to go over that would a fine tooth comb\nAnd Trump talks about you know unifying and you know I'm just not feeling it out there\nDo Americans really want to unify I I don't think so I I don't think so there's something something about the negativity here that people are using as fuel which I find very sad\nAnd I also find it very unsettling and and um what I said when I say that is not what's going on in the news and so on and you'll see I'm In my humble opinion\nThe CNN is not going to learn from this they're going to run with the fact of the stickers and and what they represent on the side of this guy's van because they think it could hurt Trump\nOr so but what I see is more on the human level forget CNN forget MSNBC [noise] we've\nCome to a place where people don't want to be tolerant they're not accepting especially on the left\nOf people whose views are different than theirs we see it on the right as well we see families not talking to each other because of political differences we see friendships that have gone on decades goal way\nOver a political email\nTo me this sends a message that people don't really want to be tolerant people don't really want to unify it's one way or it's the other way it's it's it's really interesting you know they used to be if you look they're still there\nIt's coming you know heart left or hard right\nAnd both parties seem to be going in the heart or direction harder right and harder left\nCasey on the left yeah a lot of socialist candidates who are probably going many are going to be elected\nComes election day and then you see a lot of the media supporting these people even though people like a Ocasio Cortez just you know is dumber than a box of rocks can't make you can't make a rational statement it makes a fool of herself but yet people are just going to vote for her\nBecause she's a Democrat even though what she says is going to cost them money in the long run she'll never get any of it implemented but this is what we're seeing\nLike a media darling who does not make any sense when she talks obviously does not know her history but then his welcome on coal Baron Kimball as if she's the greatest thing since Albert Einstein it's truly an amazing phenomenon because it's all based in politics\nIt's not based on logic it's not based in reasoning is not based in okay ... what can we do to move the country forward alright I disagree with this person\nBut you know we thought the days of whipping out guns and bombs was long behind us I thought that was the the old days and modern area would be the sixties into the seventies even when a George Wallace was running for president he was a gun down you know killed his campaign didn't die but he's crippled\nSo that ended his political career lucky you didn't end his life I thought those days wrong behind a squeaky from going after a President Ford and of course the assassination attempt\nIn March of Nineteen eighty one against Ronald Reagan with ...\nBut now we're into two thousand and Eighteen and a lot of people are brave on line a lot of people are shooting off their mouths but ah I thought these days were behind us I really did and then enters the era of Trump [noise] and\nAnd they have been bending over backwards trying to create a situation that would end it and you you know you know you go on CNN you go on MSNBC and they make stuff up constantly and it is truly sad everybody everybody\nEverybody has to check themselves [noise]\n[noise]\nNot anybody who is normal who writes threatening letters to judges and politicians and then escalates into bombs known as normal not not on my block in the Bronx I'll tell you that not where I grew up and certainly not the people I associate with today\nSo are you going to allow the media to paint this guy as every Republican because as you know what they do when a cop shoots someone they say every cop is is gunning for you every cop is racist when a Republican does something they painted as this is all Republicans\nWhen a Bernie supporter shoots a Republican congressmen and three others they they they downplay when rice and so a arrives that Susan Collins residents her home residents not even her office they downplay that\nSo you got to step up you've got to say yeah this this guy was one of ours I'm calling you out on it now because this is not the time to crawl into your whole and say oops we hope there was a Democrat but it wasn't\nAnd now it's a guy Native American descent obviously has a screw loose from the what we are learning more to be learned here on the tides darn show when we're a special\nI'm a news broadcast when the a press conference excuse me when we have a press conference and just roll fifty minutes or so to bring you the latest\nYou can't let the media paint this guy as all Republicans because they already lie about due to begin with the right wing militia the all white the racists the biggest\nThe media's gonna present that as you and if you go silent now\nThat that's what's going to happen so what it wasn't the Democratic conspiracy and you were wrong the good news is no one got killed no one last night are no one wants to face\nI mean this guy's got to be delusional to think that you know Bill Clinton up there and ... going to go walking out to his mailbox and say gee I Wonder if McDonald's coupons came today I Want to go and get a free Big Mac\nI doubt they think that that was going to happen I mean just common sense even someone who's half paying attention does that this stuff for our leaders and former leaders and high profile uh personalities well both actors and actresses and media people it it goes through channels\nJust to avoid anybody getting hurt and the people who are going through that are professionals so it's one of those things I Know that there's probably a lot of disappointment out there right now I\nDon't understand that but I'm feeling it I get a vibe for these things I really do it's like everybody's like not happy he's caught but happy he's caught but the reason they're not happy is because it's not a Democrat and then on the Democratic side they're like\nOh we're happy 'cause he's a Republican that's what's going on in the nation right now and there's something wrong with that\nPeople should just say wait how did this happen how did this get here how did we get here and more importantly where do we go from here so instead of the left wing media\nAnd instead of um Democrats you know picking this up and it is a gift to them don't get me wrong it's a huge gift to them and running with it in order to sway the election and for Republicans to try to just play the shrinking violet and be like oh he's one of us know\nThink they liked the negativity I think the negativity is their fuel so I ask you again do you want to unify or has that ship sailed what will it take is it going to take another nine eleven come on did you have to make me say that\nLet's get to the phones Tom in Chicago you are on the ... with Lou paid how are you\nI'm good how 'bout so\nI'm doing okay thanks for calling what's up\n[noise] I honestly everybody's in a very low level or the police and the feds don't even know what's going on yet you know and my opinion is is let's say let's say the Democrats did do it I it's\nStruggling around now that I'm Tom tom let's not waste their time not let's not waste your valuable time\nWe know that it's not a Democratic Party have used we we they got the guy and we see his we see his his his history which we're going to learn a lot more about in the two thirty press conference so forget this conspiracy theories stuff the the game is over it it is not a George Soros funded cool\n[noise] I don't know the police just caught and let them do their job to find out soon wait\nWait Tom tom Tom I'm Sorry are you still grasping onto the dream that this might be some Democrats conspiracy the make Republicans look bad do you think\nThey'll let the police do their job now I'm asking you a question [noise] based on where I Know they start based on what we know so far what are you thinking\nOf that\nDid you that is nice but I question do you still think this is a Democrat conspiracy of course he's\nNo no no no no I'm not saying that at all you employ not\nSaying it's a Democrat or Republican conspiracy I'm just saying everybody needs to let the police do their job and stop by so many things everybody's playing Glen and Glenda [noise]\nAll right Tom but that's not what you implied earlier but thank you for your call do appreciated that would let the police do their job to find out blah blah\nGoing will well here's the question is the media going to be irresponsible and say that you know there are many guys out there like this this guy is born out of Trump's rhetoric that that's what I'm expecting I Hope I'm wrong I truly hope I am wrong\nBut we'll have to wait and see I'm John his Chris Reddy their\n\nMarket will take a break eight eight eight seven eight nine nine nope sorry we'll we'll Chris in Phoenix you're on with your on with blue paid on the ... sorry about that I Know if you were there\nThat's OK I'm here I'm I don't have a whole lot to say other than you know when I was listening and you know you mentioned a you know that this guy is is is one of ours uh meaning you know a Republican I thought to myself you know if the Democratic party and the media needs to say that you know\nBecause it that's just what they need to say that's fine I guess I'll go and they are from that perspective but I you know I really wanted to say was any Republican in their right mind who you know\nWho wants to stand for what Republicans want to stand for right down in what the president wants to stand for stand for right now I mean we absolutely you know we don't accept this person\nAs a Republican is that you know if I can say that\nYou can say that of course you can see can say whatever you want because I I don't think he doesn't represent me Chris it doesn't sound like you represent you in Phoenix either I mean I've never seen anybody driving around the you know that's that that man had more stickers on it then the mist is off the ice cream truck I used to see when I was a kid\nYeah yeah so it's just you know I and I know I Know what you're saying like I Know the media's gonna run with that um and again I guess that's

up for it\nOr my mother and my mother's I actually don't know how much it is\nOkay so to borrow money to go to school and she signed for it you didn't sign for it you weren't the student\nOkay is that what you're saying is that what you are\nOkay if that's the case you are not liable for it now when ... when she dies if she has that the debt will be paid by the sale of the items that she owns before airs receive anything\nShow when you die what you own is sold to pay off your debts and if there's anything left that shift\nShe has three hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt the student loan debt people getting\nNothing no one will pay them no one is liable to pay them okay\nBut if she has a three hundred thousand dollar paid for how much it would be sold and we would pay off the student loan debt before you guys got anything in that example if there was a three hundred thousand learned that through our house they would you would get nothing they would get paid\nOkay 'cause she's also um refinanced our parents' home I'm trying to get into the tests what houses and I'm On top of the student loan debt\nYou know ... I had her basically saying she's doing stupid on brood\nYeah my father is um kind of given up trying to teach her and he he gets kind of keeping their finances a separate it off and both from what I understand yeah\nWhich my brother is still living at home and is not getting his act together\nNow though I mean that's a lot of bad news for all of those but it won't affect you okay unless you choose to write checks into this madness which I Would not do\nNo I'm attempting to get my affairs in order as fast as possible 'cause I plan on 'em I plan on retiring a millionaire so I didn't\nGo to rod direct appeal but yeah you're not going to be able to you you do not inherit death when someone dies what they own ... good for what they owe\nPayments um I don't know why that is um but we have four ... I'm not exactly sure what the best thing to do if I'm not the beneficiary of that it or how to handle it\nA good show he took the shot when your husband was a trial yeah this is not a term policy it's a whole life like\nOh I have is our whole life life insurance policy of a half million dollars is a very expensive\nRight yeah yeah and like oh my I Know that they found out that I ... I got out I mean if the guy I Know about you know that they found like ...\nGuy doesn't matter if that's a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there is a very ... and like right now on you know wild blind but\nIt's strange how long have you been married for how long you been married five years yeah and then five years they've not address this issue that's drink\nAnd drive you know it really I mean they should you should address the issue that they should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on a half a million dollar policy on there's a whole lot of policy because it's ... times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a poor right of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo that whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\nAnd so if you just call me up and you just owned by half a million dollars a whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and say dad or I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now\nI Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's right I don't mind paying back on the phone now not all that\nNow changed yep 'cause you know made a decision as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nYeah I'm a question uh regarding up part of my retirement savings comes as a thing called a pension from my company [laughter] and that overall is a bad guy eight percent of my total as sad or\n... or ...\n... oh well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be ... percent of my total as pets you know and\nAnd my question is whether the gap has a lump sum yes or ... okay\nHere's why okay if you die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all gonna die or get when you die or that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch of you and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefits the money's gone it's gone\nAnd if you live are as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it says if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we've got an account for you over here two hundred Ninety five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you could think that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform\nRight\nYeah I just [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but uh\nIt's still love you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you out of the same concept ... so the ... the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die makes this a bad deal and\nSo you always take pension lumps on are almost always take Bijan lumps arms enroll them die of race and invest them and good roast like mutual fund so it sounds like your network didn't exist from a million\nA yeah it's a closer to close that and that's probably about four oh well they're total total network to assets house and so forth\nYou know well non ... congratulations [laughter] how old are ya I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my ah my family and my wife's family\nWhere are you a millionaire for that but ... before that happened\nA a millionaire before my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents five relatively young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nAre sightings patterns or because of the amount you and your heritage is is maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nHis home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it\nPerson who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell about twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below your means when they are a modest lifestyle which we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I listen to you people do stupid things I've done the stupid things I think if you can eliminate\nStupid thing that that should do along the way that's good I like that\nBecause because every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do stupid things\nBut then you can minimize those things along the way and live a modest lifestyle live below you mean I'm no void\nSo do you think there'll be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nIs probably a probably even higher if they if they minimize the stupid yeah maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and it's that simple math on that works to your benefit a at a bottle live if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short

with us from Greensboro North Carolina Hi Trevor how are you\nI'm doing great Dave thank you for taking my call sure what's up oh well me and my wife were working on the debt snowball\nAnd making less money but a lot less stress and so what is your input on a plan that we had to sell our house who to pay off all of our debt and and kick start us going in and be kind of start over\nHow much debt do you have not counting your house or fifty three thousand [laughter] and so on your home will clear that yes and then somebody with a much more would you put in your pocket passion that\nAre probably about twenty five plus thousand math or you know we'll prefer using everything\nOkay and so um what's your household income today about eighty thousand okay so you just don't like the house\n[noise] we're not in love with it or we bought it for and a half years ago um 'cause we wanted to chase somebody else's dream and then we're realizing it's not our dream dream one tracing\nJust deciding oh a liberal listening you know I'm so we we don't we're not ... uh and we have different goals in our priorities have changed so\n\nOkay so where are you going to live\nA well that was kind of in the plan with we could basically jumpstart through a baby step three and take the money put uh some of the other money put it in as our emergency fund and then either rent for a short period of time what we built up more of a down payment or use the money and buy a smaller property\nI'm and smaller house um that uh that we can you know they will enjoy\nMhm so I [noise] um\nThere's nothing\nI'm hearing something else that in order to be happy you have to make less money\nThat is not a script I Want to join in on\nOr you can be happy and make more money\nAnd this idea that in order for your life to be good you have to take a dumbed down job and you're not living to your potential and I'm not suggesting you go back into a high stress situation but uh doing something you love you could make double what you're making now and it feels a little bit like your surrendering settling\nDropping down into something I don't know if I'm hearing that but I'm afraid I'm hearing that\nWell actually long term goal I Do want to own my own business um ... to get me back working and to have an income um we we were already planning you know long term things and we knew that getting out of debt which are way to get\nOn my issue is idea of a chronic illness and I still work fulltime I I'm not letting it take over my life is good and my question is is how do I buy check 'em for my deductible\nAhmed ... recently I recently switched ... started again I'm not a chronic illness you're going to hit the adoptable every year\nRight um\nIt's a thing got it from happening on the go at it it's not they don't see it and it's not life threatening are you going to do it while every year\nNow okay so ... what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail is that it's a nerve pain condition and the doctors are unsure of what it comes time okay\nUm so so what's your what I Do is I'm sure because it's relatively new guy that I yeah well what I Would\nIs just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year and the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing what it's going to cost you in a year right\nAnd you're going to run through your six thousand over the duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know\nA a whatever a line in your budget\nFor medical expands ongoing chronic medical and just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside for that so that every 'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up\nAnd leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and new you know it's not a lifetime of this or something broke not yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is is that I'm literally on\nLike penny pinching I don't like seeing where I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you really I think you're right now on what I I'm I'm hoping overtime on the opposite you know pay out more\nSo why are we got an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem where you\nTo identify with that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand I and that I make I don't think a lot on the license social worker and because of my condition actually switched to a job I had more flexibility\nOn Sundays fee for service division as opposed to a salaried position mhm and I make anywhere from Thirteen hundred to Fifteen hundred ... a paycheck\nAnd I knew he had to ...\nI pay nine Seventy five around you get by with a lot um and I think that somehow from ...\n... and what is the nature of the debt student loan\nThey cry it as a credit card I often because they can actually announced trying live horrific thing I'm not at all and then it went on to that if I got it out there that have like a total of six figure out\nOK show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things and that food pantry not eating\nNot eating out friday and you're paying your life from your lights and water and your rent and your transportation so food shoulders loading and transportation and utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the sense of the necessities only the debt you've got is not necessities\nYou take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you work this out into the debt as you can and here's the thing you're either going in preparing for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming\n[laughter] you're told me that that's why you called yeah yeah yeah\nMean it's not me declaring it I'm saying ... actually I've got ... how do I prepare for it you save uncover it so\nNow that's our short term long term okay we got to get your income up and you're out go down and knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get to take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you show that you\nCan you know be prepared to take\nHis career really hard chop up those credit cards is time for a plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you\n[laughter] I'm doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell me and my wife I'm going through baby step to right now I'm In fact we just paid off our second credit card today though we are done with credit cards and moved on the student loans so\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're working to babysit too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about tithing and we know we want to ... percent and um I realized that\nWere not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay all that we can give later\nOn but what I'm saying what the economy model that I'm kind of ... of all I Want to get your input on here we\nHave our ten percent plug it but we want to tie and so I was thinking about Clinton bought out and given back to the church and then having that extra five percent and kind of giving it to um other\nCharitable organizations that we believe in that are better at doing that the uh you know ... when the crisis mission and so we're trying to looking at trying to give what we can to people who need it\nUm but and she's on the other hand wants to give straight ten percent to church and then you are or what we don't what we can't give you know we're not um ... and she wants to give ... percent charts and we had a big argument about either yesterday so it was\nI was as long as you know the the definition of dies the definition of the time is when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term and Jesus reaffirmed given the New Testament\nIs tense it literally means chant the word means to him it doesn't mean sphere that doesn't mean twenty is it means to him\nTo walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do I'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says and so what ... opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker ... Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you I Love you and um you can give are not given all still love you but the best way to live your life is to to give\nAn all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament is a ties a tenth of your income evangelicals have taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years that that five is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top before you do anything else and it goes to your local church [noise]\nSo if you want to biblical answer\nYour wife wins the argument [noise]\nThat's the biblical not your wife and his argument but she was correct biblical [laughter]\nActually both are probably true [laughter]\nGood luck with that brother [laughter]\nIn order to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nThey actually managed to make something that was already difficult to understand even more confusing\nIt's never been more vital to your business should consult with attacks professional to determine how the new tax law will affect your business employees and quarterly filings I'm Talking about consulting where they tax endorsed local provider\nAny meals drinks or ball games for clients is on you there is now I one million dollar adoption for equipment which means you can ride off the full cost rather than just a portion of it those are just a few things\nMaximize the new tax law benefits consulting with the tax endorsed local provider near you and Dave Ramsey dot com slash E. L. P.\nYeah that that's what I was making before a yes before okay um what do you make now why\nNow I'm In real estate I'm actually I got my license in March and June ... June was my first day in real estate ... I've got to choose a house is sold ... ending closing into uh the second week of November So what is your projected income\nAnd by the end of the year and now what does your why didn't make of the one oh phone makes\nFifty a she made a fifty one down the\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you use to make\nYes okay good good news right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out I'm only selling to houses that between that long the span 'em and her thing is she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [laughter]\n[noise] okay that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nYou get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for poor and sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows sad\nAnd so it you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape if you want to be married\nWe are doing this together in other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just you can handle that cancer thing there by yourself and those trips that came out you get to do that by yourself you're not going to do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one\nWhen we're married and and it's in sickness and health and right now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a princess and be selfish and that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her that we need my my truck is for sale already I have it on the market good home as soon as I as soon as I Do some of these calls means of course we'll have\nIf I can get what I was asking for what you what it what I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good um what these clothing and that's what I was trying to tell her to as I'll get a car cash and then she sells her car and then what have at least one car right now [noise]\nMm well I don't know I ... I don't agree with that I Would\nIt seems and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay off or the firing until now but here's the money that you've got piled the the business that you have coming should create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYeah and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are any or clothing by then the second week of November everything should be closed do stay close\nTo three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would do I would not sell her car today\nI Would show your trial today and I but I Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous\nPhilosophy that she has all the ... I'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that outlined make money I can keep ... well that's if your roommates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that so uh\nBut uh but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through a budget that has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth of debt making about a little over a hundred but instead has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven thousand dollars for the ... a year for two years we can keep her car but if you're not willing to do that as a household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble then\nYou're not willing to join armed with you and fight and outside enemy that has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her toys you have a marriage problem [noise]\nOkay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit\nYou run around started selling mama's cars not way good way to get mom on board\nHello so let's try that other approach 'cause I think it's reasonable\nThan you might be looking at different Greer and she's going to be looking at us on our car too and you get hurricanes car to drive you drive a cheap car while we get this mess going into\nThis today Ramsey show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if their reason you

keeping my home will affect my will building capabilities in the future and how I should attack upcoming student loan debt I'm thirty one years old right now um [noise] what do you want to know\nYou already know what is coming student loan debt\nAlright so four years ago to get a promotion at work I decided to go back to school and it did pay off I landed the promotional two years ago and now the loans are kicking and then if I would've got a hold of your show earlier I Would have been paying off sooner but\nI I Am get free or two years ago we had our first child and we use\nNo you're not you're a student loan debt you well yeah [laughter] okay so I'm I'm not debt free now I Am a student loan debt the fifty grand\nSo what's your household income\nUh it went from only twenty five when we were both working to Seventy five now my full income\nAnd how much of a promotion did you get in return for going into debt fifty grand\n[noise] well I was getting a lotta overtime in the past so it was kind of a lateral move but it was it showed on paper thirty percent increase my base pay\nIt didn't show on the paper called your check\nNot yet not yet\nWell are you I mean so so far you've got nothing for your fifty grand\nTrue true and I bought I've always felt pretty smart with money so I I have a positive net worth right now of four hundred thousand between my four oh one big assets and I'm home equity so I'm not I'm not terrible but I just want to know I\nWas waiting kind of way gas that's do you have that are not home equity or for one\nI have a hundred thousand and vehicles fifth wheel toys like larger items worth more than ten Fifteen thousand dollar home\nThat are all going down in value okay yeah okay and you have ... dollars a year\nYeah yeah but I I'm thirty one I I ... yeah I'm scared about what you're going to say about my house but\nYeah so what is your a house payment\nMouth payments Thirteen fifty it's got a a balance of two thirty and then we're going to have a tickle pays about thirty four hundred a month\nThat must be after four O. one K. contributions or something yeah yeah okay ... what's your take home pay if we don't count a four O. one K. contributions\nOh I Would say I could get it up to thirty eight fifty\nRelocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp for officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with your family what we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential life\nThe the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... own all and we'll be rented or own we currently own that property currently on that property and living on at a\nTime and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of a\nYou know you need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I'd be concerned about or that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the tenant they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit or how I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do so let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land you know you got mess on your hand\nCan only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying it's a treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of interests people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay\nAnd so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it in my but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you you instead you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you how that how the liability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash wrote what happened in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means in insurance where they find somebody that I write you a policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs this much and this cover company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it costs this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can\nYou know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for\nNo ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\nAre no agreements that keep someone from you cannot contract away liability\nOkay so let's say that a floor was right and then one of the cabins\nOkay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless you you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building\nIf you slip and fall and uh and because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a hall Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called that's those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk I but I hold harmless is\nIt what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps on his people honest right it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his on or you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case they're not after writing a check\nBut you need the backup in case you were to lose that uh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you ...\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you it doesn't say thanks for the call and you're ... you're joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five at two to five you're jumping we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll talk AAA eight to five five two to five All right Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a question and I my new listener so I Apologize if this is something that you've touched on our why\nI'm so I'm new to the baby steps and I know that number one is saying the thousand dollar a emergency fine [laughter] my question in the you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nUm and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing happen mhm I'm at I stay at home with a kid mhm but I'm just wondering how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get back to baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an honest stable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off\nHow much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years and they're never happened to us we really lucky we never\nFor weeks to do something and he was going to work on something when he comes home if they did get laid off so uh [noise]\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed paws on hold hold on one of the makeup of every step thing and just pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run\nTo help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program that functions like a membership club think of it like Costco\nYou join for a small yearly fee and you say big every time you use it I'm Talking discounts on all procedures from routine cleaning to root canals in fact two of my team members of saved over a thousand dollars with the one dental plan\nAnd this is not just for you and your family\nThere are group rates for your business church or association available fulltime part time and contract employees volunteers and members joined the Fifteen million people across the country who are already saving with these plans to get a special discount for my listeners go to one dental dot com slash day\nStart saving today at one dental dot com slash Dave\nThe un is worth about I Would say or thirty Philip has four fifty but I if I'm at a little bit less\nOkay so I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right\n[noise] right\nAnd so on you know if we state taking say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental for probably go ahead and pay off the rental\nUm might pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know when you start doing more forty fifty grand a year and that stuff let's see here we got three four uh four twenty\nSo you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the year of paying off your car\nI'm ordering sell the rental now and be done\nRight I mean that's what I really had a question whether to to do that and and pay off most pretty much tell the rent on pay off pretty much all my that on it but I also have in mind as far as that like I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in three years she's going to go to college\nI don't have a house payment you can catch them right okay you know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore\nRight now my credit card check pat up there next time you get right by a car you\nPay cash for it I'm All right you never Morrow money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that that's the plan is to get on track\nYou can't sort or ride this out a dead horse it doesn't work you can't shorter ride him you've got to ride him or not and so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and\nOut there into the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have and go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff but you got to stop it\nYou got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle then yeah dumped the rental on pay off the cars and pay off the house um\nAnd it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a slap build your emergency fund and then start building George junior college fund and then once you've got junior college covered um by just don't want it to start in a savings account to junior college junior soldiers still within their\nBuild it up build it up build it up build it up and work your way right through it and then um\nThen once that's done then you just start saving up and paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're working the baby steps here are the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the sale that rental I Would I Love rental property but I Love being debt free more\nAnd so I don't borrow money in life is good when I don't have any payments any where life is good it's awesome\nI thanks for the call man or appreciate your joining U.S Open phones this hour as we talk about your life and your money it's a free call

I Would not want to pick up the premiums on the half a million dollar policy that's a whole lot policy because it's ... times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a poor right of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo that whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\nAnd so what if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars a whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you've got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and my dad's a I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now\nI Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's right I don't want anything to pay that kind of thing you know not only that but you have fallen\nAnd it's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yep 'cause you don't need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nI'm a question regarding out part of my retirement savings said comes as a thing called a pension from my company and that overall is a bad guy eight percent of my total ... or\n... or ...\nOh well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be by the gate\nAs a lump sum yes or ... okay\nYes here's why okay if you'd die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all gonna die [laughter] okay when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it might it might go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there is a survivor benefit the money's gone it's gone\nAnd if you live I or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five\nPercent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we got an account for you over here two hundred Ninety five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you could think that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family\nWell that'd be a better deal right\nYeah I did [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint in survivor annuity but ... a\n... it's still out of your diet and you know you got survivorship on it but when both of you down the same concept ... so the ... the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die makes this a bad deal\nAnd so you always take pension lumps on are almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good roast duck mutual fund so it sounds like your network didn't exist from a million\nA yeah it's a closer to close that and that probably about four\nIt's our congratulations how old are ya I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my ah my family and my wife's family where are you a millionaire or that was before that happened\nA millionaire before my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents were eligible young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern or because of the amount of heritage is is maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nInside it's home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now it's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell about twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below your means when they are a modest lifestyle which uh we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I listen you people do stupid things I've done the stupid things I think if you can eliminate\nStupid thing to do along the way that's good I like that [laughter] big\nBecause every every everybody listening right now I Believe has done or will do stupid things\nAnd we have a modest lifestyle with below you mean um yeah Lloyd\nSo do you think there'll be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\n[noise] Ah yes probably probably even higher if they stay minimize stupid yeah maybe I get minimize that as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir menu done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and it's that simple math on that works to your benefit a at a wall of live if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand ahead\nA thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me interview you for a minute there\nIt's always good for people here how to be a real millionaire [noise]\nOh I Love

time I get the Sunday service on this and ride around thirty five miles maybe a little bit longer\nThey're going to walk eleven hundred miles from where they are now\nAnd you've got kids got all kinds of people man you're committed you're absolutely a hundred percent committed committed committed in something like this and this is going to continue the weekend where\nThe bomber will be front and center the rhetoric will be front and center the arguing will be front and center the blame game will be front and center Monday it'll be a little bit more in that kind of that will be the tail end up putting it to bed and then it'll here's the little things here and there are about it but\nWhat will start to happen is come Monday afternoon Tuesday the ... weeks till midterms this I Believe will start to become something big and this is very interesting\nI Want you guys to listen to this right 'cause this this right here I find this to be absolutely\nSome of the most racist horrific things

of gone on to do some things in politics or Hillary Clinton she went on to a annoy us and never go away but she was secretary of state and think of ...\nA senator as well first lady ah the last gentleman a was a senator at the time when he said that and he went on to do something else I I think he wrote a book but then he was president for eight years so there was that and then the first guy of course is chunky from the rocky movies and he's done several sequels\nThat it's the only change your seats to the game I mean that's that that is the game we ... how is the wind blowing quick oh yeah it's going that direction so I Need to be in this direction\nMarriage equality or traditional marriage right now I'm all traditional I could grow in a few years and depending on which way the wind's blowing or I could be on the marriage equality it's the game that people play and it's that's how it's being used and it's frustrating\nIt is absolutely frustrating or we need to figure out what we're going to do with this and my frustration comes from the sense that we know what's coming\nAnd this is a small thing\nThe caravan compared to the overall but the optics of it or bank\nAnd as they are coming here what we're going to have is two groups of people Republicans and Democrats who are going to argue it's two people reaching for a glass of milk milk falls over\nThe glass falls to the ground one of them says you did that you need to clean it up the other one says no you did that you need to ...\nAnd the milk itself lays on the floor and it doesn't go anywhere and they argue over it and eventually the people arrive and what has been happening will continue to happen and that is the frustration\nThat so many of us feel out there that is that and the Democrats there they play the game they play the game remember what they said and this is what Tucker Carlson that because\nIf you're talking about a wall if you talk about immigration reform in the way that they don't like you get called certain things\nIn Asia laws it must be ignored disagree with any of that by the way you think nations mean borders in order to be nations the cable news geniuses have a message for you shut up racist\nThat gets crushed native is based very very excited every day\nAnd they look at these people are less than human they believe that those folks are are less than humans and they believe that they don't deserve asylum they believe that you know which is in cages was a net benefit for this country Donald Trump wants you to know that he have the same pay people do have if you have Muslims\nIf you have black people if you hate anyone who live south of the Rio Grande\nNow\nBut we heard what the others have said right like you know they shouldn't come here and they just can't\nIt's it's a game it's it's an absolute game and depending on which way the weather and the wind is blowing it's the way that they're going to go uh I don't have any of these people\nI in fact empathize with these people\nIn many ways I can look at it and and think to myself my God we have people who have been stuck in the mid west in in in in the rust belt for years who can't get off their asses at times to go hey maybe I Need to go somewhere else where there's actual a work and potential and they'll stay there and I and I can\nBe honest and say you know what I'm not a big fan of maybe you should do somewhere right if it not work\nSome of these people probably do need asylum I'm not some idiot that they'll take some of these people are some of these people are all just here no some of these people probably are\nAnd potential danger because of the corruption because of a lot of stuff that's going on down there the the gang warfare the drugs all that stuff yes all of them\nBut it's a game and nobody is going to do anything about it and come December first ... give or take a few days\nThey will arrive some in Mexico some in Arizona Southern California and then there'll be
