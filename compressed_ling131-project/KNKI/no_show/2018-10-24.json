families\nThat sounds great right but here's the funny thing so we talk about stuff we need more parental leave we need this that and the other we all of these things it'd be great here when you hear Bernie and a lot of these other people what is it they want the government to be\nThe government the government the government the government let's let the government be the end all the be all how about the government being the end all the be all it's always turn to the government the government needs to take more control the government needs more of this the government in more of that does the what's great about everything is a government government government swing\nHaving the government manage all of these things didn't work so we had to manage and another they privatized we realized in Sweden that with the government monopolies we don't get the innovation that we get when we have competitions\nAnd this is particularly true for the school system Sweden switched to a school voucher system that lets parents pick their kids' school and for some schools to compete\nYeah how good is that this is what's interesting about that private schools have gotten better schools around private schools have gotten better\nCould you imagine because we've screaming unions and we have all of these kinds of things that are going on all of this stuff is happening and we can't have school vouchers and we don't want competition we can't take money away from your ... this that and the other and the reality is is the place that were screaming about futile Bernie Bernie they've gone to a voucher system\nI don't want to do that of course you don't want to do that\nYou want to pick and choose the hubris of it all is that we can do it better because what you really are advocating for instance to you what kind of what they have but you also want a bit of what the the Venezuelans having said that you want to make everything\nGoes through the government when the Swedes or saying first we're free market there's nothing about us to socialized at all I mean we have socialized medicine but we're not a socialist nation and you're always saying that we're always having to correct you Denmark is correct you everybody's correcting you and then we're privatizing the Social Security which I found to be rather interesting\nPrivatize the pension system that terrifies me and obviously that scares people but when they realized that the alternative was that the whole pension system would collapse\nIn life is good you get more if the market takes a bit of a hit you're going to get a little bit less\nBut the alternative was you can have a hundred percent of nothing or at times a hundred percent of good\nAnd sometimes fifty percent of not so good hearts jeeze\nWell chat then it's really all about taxes\nRight we've got to tax the wealthy wealthy wealthy something I've been screaming back over and over who people don't understand the way that the vet system works in the entire system over there where they don't understand it it's all about taxing the wealthy here that's always the one percent the five percent six percent and they need to go go look and you could see how much money\nThe lung present pays enough five percent pay and the multi millionaires and blah blah blah\nIt's still not enough it's about the redistribution of wealth but here's the dirty little secret children\nWas tweeting does may surprise you despite the fact is leading looks like sort of a socialist country which taxes rich exorbitant behind\nThe truth is the only\nPeople who weren't below average income pay up to sixty percent in taxes this is the the little secret about this we just talk to them [noise] we don't take from the rich and give to the poor we squeeze the poor because they are loyal taxpayers\nYeah\nThey're loyal taxpayers because people have a lot of money are going to figure out a way to get around it they're gonna figure out a way to leave because people with a lot of money or what their mobile they can go elsewhere so what is it it's the vat\nValue added tax everybody\nParticipates in that but the people who are at the bottom end of the income world disproportionately get hurt by that we don't want that here right we don't we\nAll of the goodies what all the trappings we just want a certain group to pay it I Would argue with somebody\nThe people who scream trickle down economics doesn't work out at the same people who say we want trickle down economics but we want to be able to do it from the government standpoint\n\nSweden has a lot of good stuff you're has a lot of good stuff we should learn some of the things they have I understand that so when you hear the burning of the world come out here and scream and yell about this that and the other\nUnderstand what they're really saying is we want more control from the government side of things we want more regulation from the government side of things we want the government to be the end all be all to your world that's what we want\nHow we're going to get there\nIs by floating all of these magical programs in saying that we're going to be the Robin Hood of the world by taking from the rich and giving to the poor just like Europe does then you find out the reality is that that's not the way it's done\nEssentially the middle class and the and the and the lower incomes\nRob each other and pay each other that's the Ponzi scheme that goes on over there disproportionally it affects them far more\nThan everywhere else in the income stratosphere in Europe they don't get that they don't understand that and even if they did get it they don't want to it's like everything else you can hit them in the face with the facts they don't care\nBecause they want it to be something else\nHaving been in Sweden for several months it's beautiful it's great everybody kind of lives that same almost like a cartoonish village at times like him I noticed that in a movie\nIt was wonderful I see a lot of innovating not like here\nThey're going to push it in a way that makes you think you're going to get all of these wonderful things if only these people would do it and they would pay their fair share and even if you

all freaking out the Trump says he's nationalist sub leaving America exist and that's what a dirty word that's got to be bad Don Lemon as Tatiana as anti Semitic that's coming up\nBut then you've got a problem the leftist that they brainwashed and if you went to camp out of Central America are burning American flags saying we're going to militarily conquer America shame or on a mission debris and communism to America Shane with Trump is the anti Christ\nAnd people are sitting there\nAnd they're saying this crazy echo chamber\nAnd I think this could be even a bigger game changer in this election the problem is every body I Know\nAnd many of them are\nFilled out in Spanish and it is a big big problem\nSo what are we going to do and and and you know Trump has been pointing all of this out\nAnd he's been doing the best job\nBut what do we do if they still how what do we do if they are able\nThe Senate that's a question that we have to ask ourselves\nFourteen days out right now but I

name it men and women old young\nWas crazy\nAnd it blew in my heart to know that we did launch\nThe restoration of America but now we're under a massive attack and and I don't announce how important we are and how important are work's been they will destroy harsh and then we won't be there to fight in the future\nI Want nothing better to bring balanced back to back to ... off and destabilize the country will still have problems but to not be in this war and I would retire right now man I've been doing this twenty three years and I'm Still obsessed with that that you are either totally

is just it was all super vivid ship or a judge and I'd just as I say I can't\nIt's just everything\nAnd so we get censored and band on Eighteenth ... on Twitter yesterday and all the lives in the central out there in the media doesn't make me think oh I'm being defeated I make attack it makes me think my God when does America wake up when does Congress do something\nYou know we talked yesterday off record to the head of the Trump campaign\nIf you can't say something nice don't say anything at all for grandma always said\nBut we can't sit there and get pissed off about there being people around the president\nOr just enjoy being part of the power structure\nWe asked to be the people that move the ball down the field and the president's on fire and that's why he center attack you know here's the thing\nI've got all these news articles\nAnd all these things I should be covered on air right now\nBut for me it it it it it it really just goes back to\nScrewed up it is that we have people actively that want to get rid of our nation get rid of our borders get rid of our country and who literally hate our success\nAnd who are just really bad people and it should be much easier to say I don't want to be communist China or Soviet Russia or\nA control freak pedophile Berkeley\nI mean the left really are\nA bunch of damons\nAnd at the end of the day\nMore and more I don't even think the things are a political solution\nIt really is a spiritual solution and we really are just dealing with a bunch of\nDamon possessed garbage\nWho we have been so nice to and put up with an appeased and peas in a piece that now they say we can't say nationalist we can't say mother and father\nCapitalism is bad you know people are scum\nI don't care what you say about me I don't care what you do to me anymore\nI Will not bow down to you\nAnd when I have that spirit I feel closer to God the idea of them one and the idea of giving in to them is orchard for me\nAnd I'm just frustrated up here wondering what do I do how do I take action\nI mean we should all the proof of Democrats having illegal aliens and others vote the names of dead people and all the rest of that are happening and then Van Jones is on CNN saying there is no voter fraud it does not exist when we have all the hidden camera videos of his group\nAnd other people's groups engage in all sorts of horrible activity and all the Democrat groups saying we send people to vote ten times the pace we bring in homeless people and the illegal aliens and it's had Democrats in New Jersey and New York and in Illinois all\nCommitted a crime that none of them got their bad actors thrown at present and that's why all of this\nBecause they had been getting away with things forever so I'm under control myself because I Want it over the phone so I had a special guest star\nBut I wanted to have you respond to what's happening\nIt's just no\nDecision that there's not even ... why would anyone be with these people why would anyone want to be associated with it why would anyone you got a Democrat event\nI don't feel powerful that they looked like mental patients\nSo that was the director to making a

benefits of the lottery ... about half of Americans play the lottery according to the most recent survey compared to almost Seventy percent of people in the Nineteen eighties\nYou know that doesn't make sense though because I often told the story in the Nineteen eighties I remember I was going to a party ... and\nI stopped by this liquor store to pick up a bottle of which were Christmas Party and there was apparently some lottery going on but I didn't even know about it because right ... that's not\nTo to use a cliche the lotteries never even on my radar really is right I'll pass by it as I'm doing show prep for the show but it's something that's never been on my radar and all ...\nSo there I was in the liquor store and I just immediately I as I got it for about a second I stood in the real long line of about twenty five people\nBut as soon as I got on the line I didn't even look to see what if they were holding bottles or whatever I just saw the long line mhm twenty five people there and I just did it in the ... no no no you appear why am I going to cut goes no no no you're buying alcohol nobody in line for alcohol the liquor store\nEverybody is in line for the lottery\n[laughter] well it's not going to happen in the second I have an eventually in the pot stores\n[noise] um [laughter]\nI'm Sorry [laughter] exactly and\nEverybody's vinyl nobody's buying pot anymore they're only mind that the lottery tickets which at that point I said well right now at this moment in time gambling seems to be a worst vice and drinking when I was the only one by liquor it\nWell they said Seventy percent played in the eighties but I don't think our state had it in the eighties okay so I don't know about Seventy percent of those that have the lottery I guess right Seventy percent of the uh uh\nThat means a lot of needs to extract more money from fewer people specifically from the lowest income households would spend an average of four hundred and twelve dollars

coverage and everything that's going on and and I think it's important because we talk about the polls but I think it's more important to talk about the issues\nThat may be affecting what's going on in the stock market yesterday in the ... of the stock market you know caterpillar not worried why because they're building their parts more expensive why the terrorists we look at issues that could possibly affect\nAnd hurt the Republicans one of the things that we didn't talk about yesterday was the farmers yeah farmers aren't happy because of the terrorists you may you may have destroyed family farms that have existed for a long time\nA big because you have taken away because of the terrorist taking away their supply chain yeah and\nRight because that doesn't that doesn't make up for the last is that right ... and the fact that we're not we're going to be shut out of the supply chain that for\n... and we don't know for how long I mean uh they could lose their livelihood with farmers I mean this is for them it's it is their livelihood so that that towers over Kavanaugh and the caravan and and and anything else that might influence vote\nAnd this is they could lose their lives and you've had a ton of small businesses out there that have been affected by the tariffs on steel and aluminum tariffs you think about that if I'm going to hit them in any industry in any region right and in our region its its oil and gas but a farming ah eh in the mid west\nThere are every ... every other business is essentially related to that economy the farming economy so it's not just the farmers but at the other yep uh businesses in that area that are supported by the\nEnd and that's an unknown quantity right I don't know how you figure I don't know how a lot of these things

poll the Democrats had ten point lead over the Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nTied to hurricane ... in the Eastern Pacific will shift some of those reins into western Texas today we have a marginal risk of flash flooding and severe weather in place for the region another whether maker will be a surface low near the southern tip of Texas\nSo a couple of systems moving in rain and thunderstorms certainly possible along the Gulf Coast today with marginal risks of flash flooding in effect and the below normal temperatures will continue for the southern plains Fifteen to twenty five degrees below average\nA surface slow moving through the great lakes region into New England will bring snow showers for portions of northern Ohio up in ...\nMore likely though as you get into northern New England where six to ten inches of snow is forecast for northern Maine a reminder winters on its way your national forecaster him right on the radio a meteorologist John trial thanks so much John eight six six Ninety\n\nAnd they're getting hit and they don't like it and what's their only recourse right now there's still a supporter of Trump but what's their records to send the message\nMy Republican congressman mhm\nAnd we've always we worried about that from the very beginning I don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to then paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and\nEven though won't change everybody's vote it has the potential of changing\nFive percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing\nI'm just the insanity that has come a out of the uh the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan\nAnd this is the one thing that may ... that is they're coming out bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes so many of them are coming out now I'm going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes not we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax going to we need to\nRight and they were in the Republican Party that's one I'm\nYesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears that along expected decline is here now the economy overall may not ... and and and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\nBut it will change the small business people that are being affected and a caterpillar a worse at the the the caterpillar story then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are killing us write the steel in an auto ... the the steel and aluminum tariffs\nBy the way that this isn't the China thing right it's the United states and Europe and and and Mexico that there are still in effect mhm and it's killing them it's raising their price as we said\nWhen the president came out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] All right\nAnd and uh the his you know and the only suggest that that he claimed the the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's an unbelievable\nBut he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost a binding automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing was a story last week about forward grumbling\nGoing to be losing a billion dollars and they believe the tariffs are going to ... that are hurting them remember every supplier and every small business that deals with Ford in the United states knows that that's coming\nOr or or a feeling it already and every dealership and every member the steel tariffs really been affects that we're from China which has increased the cost from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel\nAutomobiles are going to go up in price because of steel costs and now because of terror costs and because of the new NAFTA\nAh and then the farmers as we mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about your your talk if you're talking about a\nManufacturing people would manufacturing jobs at a technical skills\nTon of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump country and you're talking about farmers that are [noise] dream Lee upset because it's not only their current profits\nBut it's a fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our ... and you said I Wonder if that's why he went to you know even though was wishy washy ethanol plan\nI Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because by the internal polls are saying you're getting killed with the farmers right\nAs a couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt it it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa\nIt's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry the farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry uh you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers\nUh and and you know in this region in this area in the state\nAnd I don't know what you do in terms of of ah of reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about or they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico\nA set up a port trade with with Canada\nOr any nation that they're selling too\nWent into place or or any of that if they have to make arrangements a lot of time a lot of the time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this is why the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said\nLook thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar a handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nRight it's still not making up for what our last his All right and we're ... we're we're ... we're out of the loop and the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in right took us deck I think one of the ... was it took a decade to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty as the killer this is what we saw after the recession\nThe problem with bailing out all the banks are are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government or during the recession or in two thousand eight to ... end of two thousand eight and ... and into a two thousand nine\nThey there were three apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a possible high risk\nBut they didn't want to run on those banks do they put money in all of the coffers well then it made all the banks look risky and that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade\nTrade deals between nations that are set up um you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up or bridge and believing you can rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that's going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty\nAnywhere in that\nYour former customers are going to stick with someone else a another nation in this case and they're going to get their supply chain\nTakes of what is going to be affecting this this uh election we talked a lot yesterday about\nHow the Republicans in so many ways were set up in a way that you don't see a political party in a midterm election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are and a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now for the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is the ... you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very were wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good and for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking\nA you know the their particular economy and what's gonna happen to their livelihoods so we think it's very important\nTo bring up all the issues that may be affecting the selection both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans just to give you a more realistic uh I think uh analysis of of\nThe issues affecting this mid term for eight six

we've got a bad reception there I I don't know about that I you know that\nThat that's anecdotal evidence and we're talking about influencing votes really we're talking about likely voters or the Eighteen year olds aren't in the likely voter category right now for this particular mid term they're certainly not\nSo there may be something they're on social media ah that's one thing but the the problem with it is again for people that you know we're looking at at certain issues and concerns\nUh they've got to know that uh you know and and they're undecided during the center they've got to know that they can you know that they can safely you know cast that vote and that's what you're trying to do it you know you don't want to you don't want to jump into something where again it's [noise]\nIt's unnecessary it's it's not a positive\nI've always uh yeah I've I've always been about getting every when you possibly can and once you have the when a accentuate the positive about when which would have been and go after ...\nRight yes because I ... I mean we've seen that he's a liar um he's a he's ... and and by the way these lawyers that have lined up against Trump you know he can go after them as a group and include having that he in that end\nI I mean that that's something that's an effective tactic that you know does work\nBecause it's true he doesn't have to make anything not I mean he he doesn't have to call anybody name you call Evan Eddie a liar well that's just that's just true or that the guy brought a nothing lawsuit against you it was baseless then you've got a guess you've got something\nLike if you go you go to if you go to the baseless lawsuit you go to the ... or ... you go to a a cabin on them and you say these are the people that are against me right and to me I like people say well what do you mean that's a well no that's a positive way what came out ... of the news stories that\nHave and then he lost a lawsuit against you know what you're saying is it was a privilege lawsuit and he's been doing this and look what he tried to do to destroy cabin awesome and at that point you get the political when mhm\nRight there is no social media when for young people is that what you're looking for you're talking about again likely voter group and those who were right now on the fence it if it's not a positive don't don't do it don't stay and there are plenty of positives that he can say you're wasting your\nTime [noise] now with anything else I mean [noise] jobs the economy [noise] out of those things would resonate with young people whether it's going to get them to vote or not that's [noise] that's a you know we don't know but it certainly is a positive [noise]\n\nClarify you know we criticized the former President Obama speaking in Nevada alone on yesterday's show a winning you know because he said don't forget who started this and I think he's right we shouldn't Donald Trump started this current economy we shouldn't forget who started this all your writing\nMr Obama or so the the the whole thing is again you you you have those positives stay on them because what is your rally what is the ...\nOf euphoric people that are ready to take action you know that's that's where if you think about it every day on social media should be that rally between now and November I mean it's not that you have to have positive as you can go after Chuck Schumer writing buddy ...\nBecause I I think it's very important to understand that in the real political world I mean you'll have the purest out there saying I'm against the negative advertising when that's ridiculous right of course you have to point out one out so now you've got you've got to point out the negatives of your uh you know of your candidate you have to point out the negatives that\nThe government can't give you all the Iran right that somebody is lying to you when they tell you that they can make it a beautiful like the frustration that our last caller ab I'll solve crime not related right well so that that that it then that's why I started ... ... I started laughing because\n... you know that has been going to happen you have to point out and and I believe at times you have to give blood is we've gotten London passionate about it during the cabinet and hearing that it's unacceptable to us and we've been blunt that you're not an American\nIf you if you don't believe in the mindset of due process even for Kavanaugh\nYou know they were both Democrats were trying to we used a lot of that in every well [laughter] it's it's not a quarter law it was a political court where people were put under oath and people were put under old under threat of perjury if they lied and it was not a criminal court it was not a civil court but it was a political court that had much\nOf the same enforcement mechanisms that a criminal court has when you testify right and and so a a a a person's reputation\nIs at stake it was a political court and yes Americans expect fairness and they expect due process Democrats said we don't believe in due process we believe it's very important to bring up the fact that they don't believe in the first amendment they don't believe in the second amendment\nYou're not on their side the American civil liberties union has just shocked away\nAny print tense up carrying about Americans and our civil liberties and they just made it clear during the cabinet hearings we don't care we point out in a very passionate waves you can see I get passionate about this because I think it's very important to point out\nThat people say well you know it's it's offensive if you tell somebody but not a patriot because they believe there are a patriot but there are some standards\nOf why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American I mean what makes you an American it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you reject the basic tenants of the constitution if you reject free speech if you were jak freedom of religion if you if you reject\nThe second amendment if you reject\nA due process under the law if you were jak the electoral college if you reject the it\nAnd and you wish to change all of it\nThen you don't believe in America I mean I don't know what else to say right it's it's not and people said well it's a shocking thing that you're saying no it's not they're the ones that are shocking by claiming where do you believe in America we're just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well that's what America is\nYes that's that's it bomb you and\nWhat they're trying to say is a well it's like when they said no we believe in free speech ... no you don't it's your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately of going to jail\nThat free speech oh no no no see your free speech as bigoted your freedom of religion as bigoted\nAnd so no we believe me we believe in negative you know this isn't about the facts\nManner [laughter] what the opposition is for and what they really stand for\nAnd the fact that you you know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them\nAnd you can probably say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing is negative to this country mhm because they don't believe in the basic tenants of this country and so yeah nobody's saying that you have to be nice to them all the time no no our point you know when you have\nThe when the move onto the next when well again I think we're getting a win\nFor calling out a O'Rourke or a Schumer or any of them to me those those are positives when you're calling out what they're promoting and saying look what I've done look at look at what we've been able to do in such a short time\nAnd what we're doing right now with the economy and look what they want to do with it and then back to\nAnd and the other end by the way and sometimes the name calling the the slogan aim calling or the nickname calling is very effective [laughter] liar Lanny I now I

work with me it was a brilliant political moment yes\nBecause it's it really is it's it's brilliant and its simplicity that you're showing your demonstrating that you've invited them and they're they're not showing up that's what that represented keep in mind the former president didn't invite members of his own party from Capitol Hill\nTo come in and that that's not from us\nThat's from

different issues of what you know might possibly of of affect somebody's votes you know going out for the mid term I started looking at the just just the big picture overall you know what\nThe uh the the excitable turn out that you know that's what they talk about the excited voter out there on both sides right who's the motivated excited voter who wants to go out and vote not just I mean it's a positive excitement it could be it\nNow could they hate him any more\nThan they did or the\nDay before election day in twenty sixteen my answer would be yes because they did afterwards everything that went on for the you know the next year and a half\nDo they today is the is the\nAnger still there to motivate\nThe Democrats\nTo get out because remember there really is you know we talked about this this president is up I every president has unique and every Republican president we forget because people will say nobody has ever been attacked like Donald Trump before\nWe forget that Bush was called not see the only thing is the difference between a Bush and Donald Trump is pushing never fought back\nSo if you fight back then the rhetoric coming back and she was going to increase ... but the rhetoric was still there was just as bad if you're ... remember the protests started his ranch in Texas yeah in central Texas and it was everything they were hanging I'm an effigy everything he was ... he was\nA ... and as Bill Maher said well yeah uh we called Bush and the and Romney and all those you know yeah we called them Hitler but they really weren't but Trump is some and they just move on and then there will be the next Republican president that gets in and whether they decide to fight back whenever that is\nEither that or what if what if a Republican actually named Hitler runs one day ... like I did I [laughter]\nI I'm trying to think\nNamed you you might want to change it and most have but I'm ... but this is that he's a tactic and yes from the left that's the tactic and if you engage they're going to engage even further and we see that that that's very evident now I'm with this\nCurrent price but as we've said with with Trump Trump is in the ... with what he's actually done and it's interesting because I had a discussion last week with a friend that I've known for Thirty years now\nAnd she\nClaims that she's a liberal whenever I talk to her I find that she agrees much more with me that that it surprises me and when we ... we only see each other once every couple of years we sat down we had to talk\nAnd when I actually you know talk to her she's much more conservative yet she loves she embraces the\nOr you know as to the unity of the Republican Party at a you know at that time\nI Know it was greatly United but over an issue I in my lifetime I just don't remember the Republican Party being as you and I did when they were more fractured than I'd seen in a while and become this cohesive United group of people over Kavanaugh\nThat to me that to me still is the biggest unknown\nAs to how much it will drive Republicans to the polls if it is what I think it is or what I suspect it couldn't be if it actually is that\nI think the Republicans could hold the house if it's not their own ... right right yeah um and and again\nAll the things that we've talked about the factors of you know what's going on in the Midwest and and what's going on with

[noise]\nI'm trying to I'm gonna I'm gonna have on this ... and all that often you if\nYou don't get anywhere right back them into a corner ... honestly forget about Jorge Ramos ... nobody cares about him go to Nancy Pelosi go to Chuck Schumer challenged the Democrats mhm make this an issue the last two weeks what do you want\nWhat's your what did you ever try what if you if if the house gets control and you're able to say uh what kind of a of a funding will go to border control um what would you support given the type of border control do support right what's the border\nControl that you support and be specific and if they just say we're for comprehensive now that's not an answer challenge them getting their fate what this comprehensive mean do you get get get it get it and I mean get in their face rhetorical and get the first thing what is the first thing\nOne thing and that comprehensive plan right what does that look like the American people by and large want border control do you want ... Ramos does not want boredom\nForget about him he works for Univision go right to the Democrats in and say the Democrats keep talking about this or what would you do what you keep talking about comprehensive immigration reform look the thing that this has been going on for the last ... you know really since two thousand eight rubber the protests that that happened\nAnd still ten years have gone by and still the Republicans have not challenged the Democrats\nTo back him into a corner to tell America what they actually want we know what they want do because all of the activists Jorge Ramos who was attempting to influence and is a major influence on the Democratic party he wants to open borders ship so they want to open borders\nLet the American make them be forced them into a corner where they even have to admit it or you've taken every argument away with the American public can clearly see that they want open borders\nSince it's brought up again and the caravan is coming towards the United states and it's the opportunity to have the discussion stopped talking about everything else mhm stop talking about things that don't matter\nYou can bring this back right after Kevin ought to be the number one issue again find out where the Democrats stand on an issue Mr President where the ... where the country stands behind you in a huge majority yeah used it to your advantage\nYep because at the end of it what you're going to see is that we need to have an open borders or this is what they want this is what they would promote if they were talking honestly if they were going to be Robert rice speaking to Berkeley [laughter] I'm not on health care but on border control they would say\nNo people should be able to come and go as they please\nBecause if I'm wrong well then the left needs to call me out on it and this was the other thing I\nThey're in and say that every route\nThey want they're promoting people being able to come and go as they please in and out of this country as they please\nStay that over and over again and have the media fact check it for you because then you're going to need in order to fact check it you're going to need statements by people who are running for office or already in office on the left\nYeah yeah and and and this is the advice I'm going to the president as Mr President people already know what you think ... forget about what have you with you ... writes everybody's asking you about the reporters continue to ask you what you think\nYou've got to turn it around yes what America needs to know is not what you think on a legal immigration or American things down a legal immigration you need to get an answer out of Democrats as to what they things do win or lose it's still going to be an issue or ... I mean winter lose the house into I think it's still going to be an issue take it to the Democrats\nMhm they force you to come clean about what you think should be done about illegal immigration\nYou better come clean you've talked about and how many hundreds of times and the press is that you asked you questions over and over again or ten years really into the major discussion on really since I'm a\nKennedy McCain yeah yeah since ... when was that was that two thousand eight two thousand no no no it was before ... it was two thousand\nGosh to know that was ...\nIt was before you came on board now while we're doing the show became Kennedy was yeah we were in Arlington studios\nOkay yeah I'll look it up [laughter] yeah I kept calling it scam misty um yes it was because it was two thousand eight it was two\nDollars was it was introduced in two thousand in May of two thousand five right before I started here okay is one of our first well and\nHad to go to the um uh the uh he was at the conservative a convention and and had to essentially they said he apologized or he had his mayor culpa but he didn't really you just said that uh he realized that the rest of America was not on board with\n\nYeah uh and it fell short or a ... eleven days after I started working with you so it's one of the first topics that you and I\nGather together on the air and that's why I say because I ... I was out here I was so low I remember going in weeks on that and uh and I was so low and I was and so the the but this has been going on for a long long time if you think about and I almost did this yesterday and talking about this\nMcCain Kennedy to day\nMight have a better chance than it did back then oh yeah given the makeup on on Capitol Hill that we have right now\nIf you introduce that now I don't know if that's the case with this current president because I don't know that you would have the uh\nUh the the somebody on the left that would jump on board but I I think there was a much better chance that you would have support for it not from conservatives so much but I think because of the makeup on Capitol Hill and there are fewer conservatives at least ... [laughter]\nAnd then you you might have a more support for it but the problem is is that no one's asking them what they what they're trying to promote\nBut but it's been over Thirteen Years that this has been a huge issue mhm huge issue because that's really what kick started this whole thing over and so it's been Thirteen Years and still the Democrats the Republicans have not or the media have not been able to get the Democrats to admit this is the Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit\nThat they want open borders and that's what they want and if they don't want it\nWill you passed as a piece of legislation and promised the American public you will uphold right that's a fair question to ask are you for open borders right just bluntly asked that question\nAnd if the answer is well no then what level of enforcement\nBut think about Thirteen Years and you haven't been able to back a Democrat a major Democrat into the corner to make them either sweat or answer that question and then keep pounding them on that question as the opposition party over and over and over again\nBecause we need to know do they actually want comprehensive immigration reform of border enforcement or do they want open borders we can come to any type of compromise if we don't know what they want right and do it and get it on eight six six Ninety ride I

eight six six Ninety right I just reading here from CBS News now now this this is fake money here fake news yeah there's been this this this is what's wrong with the media today\nGo ahead [laughter] they've got a headline right but the first paragraph one winning ticket was apparently sold for the world record one point six million\nMega millions jacket and a nod million and no ... and they had it right in the headline that headline was right mega millions will record one point six billion dollar jackpot one apparently winning tickets in South Carolina Lindsey Graham has resigned apparently started after winning I Would just [laughter]\nThat would be so funny if it were if it were him yeah uh well congratulations what does that person going or group of people going through\nRight now if they know talk about freak out mode\nThere's someone wrote the story again you know because they they did this series on a on cable rubble stories of people winning the lottery\nIf you don't win and they pointed out those cases that was a that were in those specials or you know people just I just well first of all do you can't tell anyone you tell even your family word gets out even if you don't go public\nAt that when you claim the prize the word gets out when people know that you're you're rich but even more so that you won the money this way you didn't earn it then people come at you believing you didn't earn it so it's\nIt'll be fine for them that you have any side and that and that was like oh gee behind wait a minute if everybody has a right to my earn their money Mm well then they have a double rights to my non earned wacky money especially in the house that prize constituted\nBy me buying a ticket and you won the prize [laughter]\nI still have it a sense of entitlement that I'm gonna live rabbit to the Supreme Court but that's a lot of money that's now yeah exactly you know [noise] it it is\nBut um you know that's that's the dynamic especially you know people who are famously wealthy but forget about that people who win something [noise] and do people get jealous very easily\n\n\nIf you fulfilled every request there would've been\nMuch more time and when I was younger me winning the lottery in these days to be like\nWhat a hassle [laughter] well I wouldn't say it'll it'll take a lot of thought about it would change my life too much I I thought about that kind of money\nBecause after taxes uh it's gonna be somewhere around what five if you want it the one time payout it's somewhere around the third or thirty five percent you know of the overall prices at one point six billion so pair that down\nRichard than Mitt Romney already you went to bed poorer than than a Joe Biden and you woke up richer [laughter]\n\nYou know the story always goes name was one of the least rich guys and the Senate um and and you woke up richer than a middle and end the whole thing is is that\nYou you ... what do you do\nI've always said like those really expensive cars really expensive sports cars\nYou know if if I were you know the billionaire and I had that kind of money but still knowing myself\nWhere in the world would I drive that car I wouldn't be able to stop and park it anywhere\nYou know what I mean I mean where are you going to take that I wouldn't mind taking it out and he got to just plays the Texas anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time\nWith sticks on I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank\nIt would it would be a bit disturbed there's yeah there's nothing I'm I'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] an eye out to be clear it would it would be a huge hassle mhm I like my life mhm I don't want to change mhm\nAnd I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your\nLife I have a a a friend who a friend or family member who are back at one time was working for a a multibillion um\nAnd it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day mhm and my family member told me that this person was the exact same way\n[laughter] not a multi billionaire although ... at least one listener thinks we are um but but the point was is there's so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't\nWin their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth\nIs more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes ah you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else to to know I couldn't have lost\nAnyone else to do that that would be the thing because you know people that what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation mhm you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kinda money you're not going to be able to keep your name private so this\n... it would be it would be hard to manage you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\n... exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money mhm 'cause I said you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of follow what I Do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you got to run the foundation so this jobs gone well I don't want to run my in laws there are laws about\nRiding the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you've got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nWell my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if you're going to give it all away that's what I mean you know going to be a full time job is going to be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh this life I have is gone well I liked his life\nHave a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older like when like when I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life well yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life I I I don't do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things and I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so\nI'm I'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be greatly excited about that mhm oh yeah no I don't know what I Would love to you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I Want them to go through a mind but it's still a thought\nOh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion\nMhm because every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't you and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other low we've we've ever done ... really I mean it's not I never think that\nOutside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up on Google today a little shocked we work in an older warehouse for those that don't know where you're I mean we really ... it's almost like we come to work in a warehouse where the end of the show we grab our lunch pills and go home [laughter] do it that's what the\nFeeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nOutside of being a machinist mhm so the mentality store to the same for it so I but the the the thought and and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and\nYou know a a just and financial decisions and everything else that become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business and personal life well you've one point six billion all that goes away and I always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my way because I bought him one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter]\nRight but I got all these other things that I can think about [laughter]\nI don't get all this money death [laughter]\nI was a you know I talked to one time about this uh there was a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed the game and he sold it ah I I I don't know I'll I'll have to look it up but anyway the guys told his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game\nFor two billion dollars and his take of that was a you know roughly\nLike one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then\nHe talked about one night he went on it wasn't a rent just a series of tweets and he was talking about it was that this party and it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires and I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know worked you know for a living had a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd he goes what I'm not trying to cry I'm just you know I'm not I'm just saying it's a weird odd place to be in because I'm ... you know I'm not from money\nI'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's here's the problem with being famously wealth or like the the the person that my family member works for\nYou've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the other you're famously wealthy so you have security detail we talked about this with the president the president has\nYou know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean and so you're going to have to be very careful because there are people there are threats against you all the Thai is one of\nThe that story that I read that you read that you mentioned earlier talking about the guy who won the big lottery ran was actually what the uh kidnapped or some of his family was kidnapped or whatever right right right right when the money yeah you know so you need at that point when you when that kind of money you probably need security so your whole life was destroyed once you have security\nOnce ... once you have a possibly while not I'm not a policy per se what are we learning Irish people are security why couldn't ... yeah you know I it it would be a very different way of life I I don't know how you make it work eight six six Ninety read a\nWith literally radio toll free

this is the way that he should use Twitter already because it's simply putting words that words in their own words from their own mountain yup yup and it simply says I agree with President Obama one hundred percent\nAnd simply this bit of audio and video but this audio for you since you're listening on radio from President Obama\nGenerous and welcoming people here in the United states but those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law\nOr and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected fun\nDocumented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or the become immigrants in this country\nThere you go that has it that I agree with President Obama one hundred percent\nUh you know we talked about this earlier with the caravan are slowly moving across Mexico won't be here and time for the uh for for the election if if they ever ah you know get to the border in any type of organized fashion at all if that ever happens\nThey're stopping at ... in Mexico city that's going to take a few minutes\nUm but as we've said this is the time a couple of weeks before the election to take it to the Democrats to say this is the Democrats now to the Democrats still believe this this is the time to challenge\nThe Democrat leadership and say you keep talking comprehensive immigration reform but you never tell us what you want I Believe\nTable and tell me specifically mhm what type of enforcement you will put on the border if you want to plant\nAnd we've talked about the various plans everything from citizenship to amnesty which would be citizenship to legal status without being able to vote right\nIf you got bad than what level of border enforcement would you guarantee the American public please be public and tell me we are willing\nTo keep the door open are you willing to talk or is it\nLike we all believe that your party is the party of open borders\nAnd if you are the party of open borders have the guts\nTo sell that to the American people or attempt to sell that to the American people and that's what I think the president should say the man he's already halfway there with this\nYeah you're now and and by the way you can you can get him you can get Feinstein how many do yeah hello see right but I found some really over the last Twenty years in San ... exactly like Donald Trump does on illegal immigration right exactly play those make the comparison\nHit them hard you've got the bully pulpit as you know the press pays attention to everything that you say hey\nIs depressed fact checking to make sure that Obama really said that or are they just laying low challenge depressed go after the media right so this is what they why aren't you questioned them about why they think what they think down what they thought then why don't\nWhy why don't you ask them if they want to open border it's the same kind of positioning by the way I I Would do this during a debate of course the president's not going to be debating only rent for a couple of years but I Would do this because I'm a candidate I Would do this on a debate stage with my opponent if I'm a Republican candidate I Would be doing this with ah with with any of them I Would be I Would think\nWhat they believe the level of enforcement of the borders should be telling me what level of enforcement do you believe in closing the borders altogether stealing the borders\nAnd only letting a limited number of people and that's basically what we have now I mean it's not sealed we have porous borders but do you believe we should enforce the borders or not because there is no\nHalf measure in my opinion there's no half measure so either you believe in open borders or you know enforce right\nAnd it's about time after Thirteen Years Thirteen Years we were talking about a McCain Kennedy when that went down to defeat

by nine thirty ten we um we we we kind of have a it depends on you know again if it's a weekend or not\nMy granddaughters\nNow my oldest granddaughter's Thirteen so you know I'm I'm not even sure she's going to want to go trick or treating I have no idea they love dressing up though I mean they're they have a lot of fun doing it well it ... but then we come home and then you know it's it's like whatever time it is if it's not too late\nAnd then we hand out candy so changes when you have grandkids\nWell you know it's like when when we talked about this before when well you know seven or eight year olds and defining their sexuality and we're like excuse me when I was eight years old the only thing I cared about was candy I did hear the Seinfeld bid on candy just a couple of weeks ago again\nAnd that was my life my life revolved around candy ... and I didn't even care about the Halloween costume\nRight would go out and even when we got to be ten eleven twelve Thirteen we go we go up to uh we we we'd had Fifteen blocks I'd come home with grocery bags of candy and even at that age and all I cared about was the candy costume could care less yeah socializing could care less mhm get me they can be\nYeah right\nSo of course that's my that's that's my penance now we used to take a ... now is you know the high blood sugar idea how to stay away from candy penance for being evil as we would use pillow cases\n[laughter] and I met when we were poor because they were bigger [laughter] they were stronger yeah [laughter] that's right yeah I never ...\nI still do I don't have those on my bed I had a hello can build with candy it's much much better if that if ... if I didn't have that blood sugar sensitivity I'd be going out today I'd be going out yeah every Halloween [laughter] and they have a bag huge back I'd that pillow thing that's a good idea yeah it\nIt it's I remember one time when my son but it was right at the age where it was probably one of his last years so he was like twelve or Thirteen and he and his buddies\nBecause they were it was warm is really warm\nAs it often is on Halloween Night\nAnd they wanted to go in and get something to drink and said yeah yeah yeah and so they set their pillow case was pillow cases\nDown in the driveway we're only about halfway through and we came out and they were gone I mean we weren't in there really sixty seconds at the most we went in to get a bottle of water and we came out and they were gone\nAnd the boys were just so disappointed so it was my son and two buddies I said All right enough of the games they said what I went in I got king sized pillow cases and we didn't walk we drove I said we're taking a car we're going to hit every porch light that is on until you guys\nTell me [laughter] and I felt the at the location that night and it was one of the greatest nights ever and that's why we had a very much like mine's didn't we yes well I I I was just you know of wondering now can you where\nIs it is it okay to where Trump mask\nBecause remember the bottom masks are outnumbered the the the George W masks route during that time will ever on President ... I mean you're probably still the Nixon mask yeah but I mean I've not seen a trend mess you know with the one mask I I don't think I ever saw a Gerald Ford mask [noise]\nI don't think I ever one has ever Reagan mess you know it was Reagan ... there was Carter you know because of the big tea right remember that\n[laughter] I don't think it was a general matter\nThat's discrimination or\nWhy are we discriminating against ... of every Monday and all that long time ago now I Do remember the next ... everybody remembers the Nixon ... oh yeah ... Johnson [laughter] ... yeah I bet not have to go watch point break and we didn't mention [laughter] we didn't wait a minute\nThere was a Hillary mask not ... not that she was president but you know of course being first lady I have seen the Trump can a T shirts or it's a pumpkin with\nOh yeah yeah yeah right Erica right yeah which is actually that's pretty funny which is pretty funny but then again would you where were you aware of that out or when people get ticked off yeah or people that sensitive and okay\n... okay that I live out of the humor where somebody would actually get beat up for wearing that it'll be interesting to see if you hear stories of that where people refused to give candy to a kid dressed as Trump\nBecause by the way I could go either way right yeah I mean a baby dressed as Trump Baby Trump would be kind of funny cute\nMhm uh but also could be kind of you know making fun of the president but\nWe'll see if people refused candy we're we'll wait for the story last week [laughter] it's red I write\nThis engine report is brought to you by Detroit\n...

main jak [noise]\nI have no idea where that ... and why not belong lanterns is\nRight in front of lantern sure why at all and I don't know brought a lantern [laughter] Rachel winter and yeah let us not be sexist there you go but no jak just plain jak do not know like my nephew\nOr how low income wolf will move furniture that with a lot more\nThan twenty five years ago re I went on the radio and I haven't been doing sports talk and somebody said you need to move on from sports do straight talk\nAnd some did and\nI learned some stuff and I didn't learn some stuff\nAnd I learned is that by nature a I was a libertarian and B I was a nationalist now my definition of being a nationalist was that we should build a fifty foot wall around the country all\nThe way around the heck with the Canadians and the heck with all Mexicans\nJust build a wall fifty foot high all the way around the country and then put a plastic dome on it if you can do it first am you can do it for the country may get high enough the jet planes comply underneath the do okay\nAnd then\nFinished my concept of being a true nationalist my theory was plain and simple if we can't grow it if we can't manufacture it and if we can't invented\nNationalist yes okay I get that that is your concept and I remember when you went into your yes diatribe about that and I and I and\nI almost got suspended forward because it was so crowded Landis yes um do you still feel that way probably not as much as I did but nevertheless when you're young you tend to be gung ho ho you know you are less myopic\nAs you get older you get more tunnel vision and that's why when you're young young people open up your arms your brains\nAnd allow yourself to soak everything in because as you get older\nYour field of vision narrows okay and if people wonder why horses and jump up in the air and jump over jumps in steeplechase races and everything it's their myopic when a human being stands in front of a horse\nThe horse thinks the human being is almost fifty feet tall the\nI've heard that I don't know how they figure fifty feet yeah maybe they took a horse to a movie and that's how they were related and I don't know\nYeah I mean has something to do with their eyes being on the side of their head\nThey're all they also work individually their eyes do not work as a tandem they work separately\nMaybe that has something to do may be but nonetheless so is it do you you don't feel strongly about that now no\nBecause I Know that it's stupid we can't do the ball all the way around the country and we can't put a lid on it but I still do believe that anything we need can be grown in America including oil\nAnd pineapple and ... and everything else I Believe that we can manufacture everything here cars buses airplanes rocket ships and the little ... that go into my ties okay we can make long hair okay and we ...\nTremendous advances in the medical profession okay so I still believe in the basic premise of that well yesterday out of the clear blue sky a Donald J Trump stopped reading the art of the deal\nAnd started reading the articles of rod oh dear because he came out and said that yes the president said yesterday he too is a nationalist\nWhen I say a nationalist I don't like it when Germany Spain one percent of GDP\nFor NATO and we're paying for point three percent I don't like that that's not fair I don't like it wasn't as an example we're protecting a hero\nAnd we're paying for almost the entire cost of day that we're paying for say very very substantial portion foreign later than what it should be a we have great respect\nFor those countries but on top of that I don't like it when they put up barriers to our farmers were farmers cannot sell into Europe they have a trade barriers that make you guys know better than anybody say I'm trade barriers that or as severe\nAs China's trade barriers which we coming down they want to make a deal very badly they'll be coming down\nBut I Am very proud of our country and we cannot continue to allow what's happened to our country should continue apple can't let it happen so I'm proud I'm proud of our country and I am a nationalist is a word that hasn't been used too much some people use it\nBut I'm very proud I think it should be brought back time somebody that wants to help other countries of the world\nBut I also have to take a limit to take care of our country we cannot continue to allow ourselves to be duped or military and also jumped on trade\nWith the European Union as an example last year on trade when it was one hundred and fifty one million\nOnce again\nI don't know exactly from\nI'm not a\nBad\nFor your\nSuperpower mantra and made it important to the smaller countries so now when we go to discuss\nThe fair share well okay we'll be the superpower will be the world's policeman but you know what you're gonna have to pay some of the freight\nFor us being your policemen we are going to be like an armed guard none of police officer we're going to be now an armed guard you need to pay us for that service or we can render it anymore and then they started using it as a trade tool\nWell it's not your oh it's easier for us to grow lettuce in Mexico than it is to grow lettuce in Minnesota\nSo we will so you are lettuce and we will mark up the prices for you I don't think anyone's against profit no but a breed as a whole rather you know first of all the state New Jersey has a very bold thing\nThe New Jersey you throw away the parkway mhm is owned by will now its own basically by prudential insurance uh okay they bought there was it was a stock\nAnd they were sold and they bought a majority so I guess technically they own it okay and there would be ... and there would be restaurants in those mediums\nThe most common were arby's yes borrows the Italian as a McDonald's and a couple of others that free\nCounting the length of New Jersey mhm okay well the state of New Jersey did something very bold and brave they went to those fast food chains\nAnd said we love\nSettling you this base we love the fact that while you're on the New Jersey part way you can drive and get a Mickey D's you can drive and get we got the reach you drive and get a slap a pizza and beyond your way but we're not going to allow you\nTo charge different rates than you sell that piece of pizza for at the eating town hall or the McDonald's on route thirty three and and parameters you're gonna have to have the same price set up\nThat you have everywhere else in your ... and I think that's fair and you know how they reacted to it will clothes and go they'll close up\nOf childish and yet that's exactly and you know what I guess they don't want to make them learn something because many years ago Howard Johnson's\nWas in all of those low key I remember Howard on ... from the Ohio Turnpike and with the orange roof twin flavors of ice cream and everything else and\nThey tried to offset it by charging you a dollar for a plate if you wanted to share your meal was a child do remote ... yeah and they said wait a minute and they said this first a New Jersey get outta here\nGet outta here we don't want that kind of business\nThese are families that are taking a trip wire you abusing them and that was the end of that that's one McDonalds and our bees and borrows and Taco Bell and every other chain imaginable and they said you're going to charge the same price on that\nThere is so unfair about well they claimed that they were being overcharged\nFor this base and that they had to stay open they were\nObligated to stay open twenty four hours a day\nTo services travelers are and I ... that then and and see that's that's what makes that he had called her middle donation exactly what we haven't ended in earnest effort to actually be fair and something\nWe don't deal that way anymore and so they just ... and go home\nAnd ... and Connecticut tried to do it\nNow to do the same thing was that they sell the same price and they were successful than Connecticut did something real stupid instead\nThey took all those restaurants and stuff like that and they have state liquor stores so they made all those

they've lost all credibility as it relates\nHave I Know we haven't received them yet but uh I don't think anybody believes that story I can understand the president wanting to keep open channels um but I think those of us who who want to speak directly to this know that there's just not credible\nWhile again a jacket there you know everybody can say what they wish but it's just not a credible

to do you know mhm yeah um yeah I could see that I think would be a real good idea if this president had handlers like other presidents had in the past\n... a confidant that they would go to and say how do you think I should have handled this it would be great if the president would put out a statement that said\nTo the world to the world\nTrump you shouldn't any kind of delays any kind of

that are\nIn North Korea or in a communist country in the Ukraine or in Syria and they're risking their life every day and just by being in the areas but you know somewhere in the back of your mind there's that thought\nThat when you go to the border oh yeah and I said you you can't go home\nI Would be terrified right now to be a reporter in North Korea I and I know they stay over on the south Korean side right that there is only like\nFive four or five there aren't many but from what I understand they travel across that uh the militarized zone do their reports or gather information into Seoul you imagine\nTrying to come back over into South Korea I get nervous when I crossed the border into Mexico\nYeah I've been stopped a lot coming over the years I even before you needed a passport to do that even before all of this border stuff had had happened in the eighties\nI Would get stopped more often than not and have to you know they'd hold me up and then look at my driver's license and have questions and go through my stuff\nUm and because I was always tan in Arizona and I have dark hair and I I don't want to say I'm labeling anyone but I mean\nLook like you could be ... and the country yeah ... ... you know I I every time that you go through security at an airport\nAbout your citizenship or something like that I it's just got to be in the back of your mind\nAnd these people yeah heartbreaks these people that work to front lines of work of wars at work or the devastation of an earthquake or floods or earthquake or a volcano or something like that are under enough stress as it is\nOh the ad that political stress because really what do you think about it and we talked about Mr is on the other day\nWell these people have less protection\nThat Mr or saw there's yeah well and not just that but the minute he steps out of that embassy write to us is going to try to extradite him thinking if either you that's why he stays in countries that don't have\nExtradition treaty

there\nWhy it and we're kind of Mars things\nMore and more and more backwards on this for just a second now the fact that some banks are federally licensed and some are state licensed is a bank ... license able to make a transaction within speed where marijuana is legal\nWell even banks that are state license have FDIC insured fine meant less you're a credit union and interesting late so they are regulated\nUm I have a new friend I've met through this industry who was president and CEO of a privately held credit union in Denver and gee has implemented for that product credit union a banking system\nFor people and the candidates industry and it's called the safe harbor program\n... uh it's it really is you know she was a banker for over Thirty years her name is Sunday the bride

his problem speak your mind Mr President breaking protocol wakes up an old term nationalist to describe get this America First that's what he's always said and leans on the fed to stop hurting his recovery wire so I'm Still surprised when this president acts unconventional\nNumbers we ran into people that were party that Thirteen it appeared that there were other people as well all I never heard a very different group or there was enormous amount at now\n[noise] a sour recorded do and humans work was on with Sean Hannity last night cheese in Guatemala trying to find out who makes up this caravan who paid for the care of and you got thousands of people with in thousand a thousand miles of our border determined\nTo break their way into America the caravan there won't be stopped or a cat it hey dams wake up the country not just Donald Trump wants to stop and there was a time when you agreed with the ... the United states did our borders mattered and that illegal aliens it's not okay for them to enter the country illegally\n[noise] number one\nIt is clear particularly in most swing states that Trump is an unemployed benefit for Republican Senate candidates because it brings out rural voters people not in these can testable congressional districts in ways that sort of put them over the top you know plus the backlash up in the cabin off at\nHey experts admit you have no idea what's going to happen on election day first cabinet through a monkey wrench into the calculus now the caravan perhaps could show gates\nDo is watch weight invoked and Jonah Goldberg who calls balls and strikes has had to have noticed like most of us\nAnd by the way we just got some good news we just got word that majority leader Kevin McCarthy will be joining us in ten minutes so I'll be quick in a block and then we'll take your calls right after uh nine thirty and then run to Sanders said nine forty five men if there's if there's a more comprehensive our consequential our in radio I don't know what it is\nJonah Goldberg weighed in on what he's seen so far the president his party\nWas down I mean history the Democrats the president's unconventional ways had them thinking they're going to have a shot at the Senate and they've locked up the house neither thing is correct Jonah Goldberg cut one\nIt is clear particularly in those swing states that Trump is an unemployed benefit for Republican Senate candidates because it brings out rural voters people not in these can testable coming from rational districts in ways that sort of put them over the top you know plus the backlash up under the cap it off and\nFor by ... for Senate in\nMusic is a bridge between the material and spiritual\nMy name is Harvey lower and\nAs a blind person you have to be aware that nobody can tell you what you can or can't do you really have to try\nMy folks got me a little over ... radio in Nineteen forty and\nThat was the best Christmas present\nWas eleven years old when I started to

unchecked and circumventing\nThe line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully\nDoes become immigrants in this country\nTwo thousand five Brock Obama says exactly what President Trump is saying now what happened Kevin McCarthy was air through all of it\nHe sees the shifting tied with illegal immigration we have the same problem why of Democrats looking for different answers and their answers are what's the big deal reinforcing the border or allowing those illegally to stay income\nOr Kevin McCarthy a leader of the majority in the house who wants to stay that way and the speaker what happened to that rock Obama\nWhat happened to that whole Democratic Party could remember it wasn't just Brock Obama yet Hillary Clinton they voted for security along the border uh that'll gang of eight put more within the border security dollar wise and we're asking for to help build the wall\nWhat happened there there are no longer stand there therefore open borders and my biggest fear that happens November seventh if the Democrats were\nAble to win the house take the majority you know how big a caravan with start on that day and that movement coming across because it wouldn't just be open borders that they say what they want to eliminate the ice and he goes home town of who would then be speaker Nancy Pelosi sellout illegals to vote\nWould or would I also don't understand is we wanted to get a deal the country when I say we the country want to get a deal on immigration to the president said I'll talk about DACA but I Want to get rid of chain migration and I want to build the wall\nAnd that was a big deal to Democrats he didn't want to give in on chain migration but what happened here Senator Harry Reid in Nineteen Ninety three cut twenty two because of relative based\nThe demands of people\nWho don't have relatives here\nCan be any wonder that the American people think our immigration policies are Joe\nWhen we used to like forty thousand new am I going to say here\nBy lottery yet that's the lottery and he went on to hit on chain why I don't understand why they why they did the political calculus and think that's something to back off off\nYou know President Trump has been right all law and he's been here with trying to put up an immigration plan that would be fair to all secure our borders have an immigration system it actually works and would not be in this problem that we are today in the future what changed here is the Democrats just\nWant to do everything we remember not one of them voted for\nThat tax bill not in the house or the Senate and now we're the most competitive country in\nThe world we haven't been here more than a decade you had to go past any time of the Obama because he could never get us to this point but they just want to resist everything we do so even though that President Trump went even further about DACA than others have gone in the past to try to bring everybody together\nWhen we put those two immigration bills on the floor\nAnd it takes two hundred and Eighteen votes to pass one\nWell there's two hundred and twenty three Republicans who voted for one or the other just not on one not one Democrat would\nVote for those bills and that you would not have this caravan you'd have a secure border but you'd have an immigration system that actually works\nYou might remember this but evidently Dianne Feinstein of two thousand they passed in two thousand nine there really told the Mexicans are you are the problem and sent a message to Central Americans in South Americans will favor you\nThat is why we're having these surges at the border what was that bill what is the effect been and how do you think we can out we can undo it\nWill this is a problem we have what it's called ... other than Mexican so if somebody from Mexico comes across the\nCatch and release in our country that's why that care of and just keeps going and it's I think one moment isn't that a group of people that inside your own country was American but decided I just want to live in your house look we are a rule of ... of land that believes in the rule of\nLaw you will break society down if you break the rule of law and they're just going to come up here and then they're just going to scurry and try to come across the border and all different places that's why the president has a right of why we need the wall and that's why I have to build\nBuild the wall enforce the law and the other elements of just building that wall sanctuary cities to in that because that's an incentive to come the ability\nTo remove gang members capes law what we found numerous times that people have been deported three four times it's still coming back around but it also supports ice and it condemns any idea of allowing illegals\nTo vote I think that's a common sense bill that we can vote impact\nNo one can down to how hard the prison's been working in you have been working to try to save the house would you realistic you said there there's too many retirements to be optimistic even though you're not giving up and you also say there's a lot of rich people throwing money around especially former New York mayor\nMichael Bloomberg I Know he's been giving out money I did not know to what extent what does he done\nMichael Bloomberg if you if you watch just about a week and a half ago he read registered Democrat and he put he put it out on the press he has now given a hundred million dollars eighty million to the Democrats in the house and twenty million the humor and then it he's trying to buy the nomination\nBecause he wants to run against Donald Trump he's kind of by Congress but it's not just him come dire\nMore than a hundred and twenty million and rubber\nWhole goal is to impeach the president he brags that his impeachment list is bigger than the list\nDollars trying to win the house and that's what's creating some of the difficulty look I'm On the road tried to help conservatives everywhere we can't [noise] yesterday I was with ... in Florida than I was with Brian Mast remember remember who Brian masses congressmen today served on military served in Afghanistan\nAnd you lose both his legs lost both his life\nBut you know when the biggest challenges in Florida is this algae he's been the leader on that\nHe's the one that that got it in the lead the fight this today I'll be up in Jacksonville for Michael Waltz he could become the first Green Beret to go to Congress this is Ron defenses his old\nSeat we're in a fight there and then I'll be in uh Atlanta handle remember she won the special election for Tom Price to see\nMichael Bloomberg just put two million dollars into her race against her she's one of the most effective members we have been Rob Woodall and then at lunch I'm going to be with Maria Elvira Salazar this is a Florida is twenty seven she's running against Donna Shalala remember Donna Shalala in the Clinton Administration\nWho also ran the Clinton Foundation destroyed or the college down here as well\nWe're up in that race because marine Elvira she's been a part of this community she's she's been she was in the news with Telemundo Univision and others she's been a part of this community here it's just a fundamental difference if you have great candidates resources are against it\nBut the end of the day I Believe we keep the house\nUh and then of course you would run for speaker\n[laughter] well my number one goal is make sure we have a Republican who could be speaker that's the battle between now and November fix we can decide what happens after\nTwenty seconds what happened you a Boulder went through the window and you're one of your headquarters\n[laughter] well it's my congressional ... that older I don't know that one\nIn the car and depart who knows why they did it what motivated to do it or somebody wanted them to\nThe video on his Facebook page of you know these people help 'em out Republican or Democrat this has got to stop majority leader Kevin McCarthy can't thank you enough effect you ride and all the hard work you do it\nYou got it uh coming back here next one eight six six eight seven six six nine\nInch [noise] I talk to those points of an K n K I find I'm going to teach me the gas station [noise]\nThis year has been really hard for me I had to swallow a lot you know it started with Maria throwing paper towels at my people um and then you know like you know the senators saying you know don't monkey that's out now yesterday ... president comes out is that he's a nationalist as if\nWe don't know what that means you guys are pushing us away led to do this for the weekend where history shows that we're really says\nSo tell me tell me if this level and let me tell me a for example there are things that you could say to me that might insult me as an Irish Italian New Yorker you might not know it\nUh there are things that I could say to you or they might insult you depending on your nationality race or religion and I might not know it so Donald Trump saw that there were some problems with them using the word nationalist and expanded on it he cut thirty seven\nAll I Want our country is to be treated well to be treated with respect for many years other countries that are allies of ours so ... they had not treated our country fairly so in that sense I Am absolutely a nationalist I'm proud of it\nDo you understand that this president is a lot of things but he's not a dog whistle guy there's nothing subtle about it which is why I Know we didn't have a metal the Russian didn't work with the Russians to win an election does that further explained it to you\nBrian I'm definitely you know I totally get what he's trying to see why not come out of say I'm a ... this is my country we're going to put this\nNobody who say my country first ... America First that's why I voted for him\nBut when you come out and you say something like that Brian I may not take it like that but my people are not stupid and we know that that was the same word Nazis years so why use it\nUm ... you know the definition a person who advocates Political Independence for a country\nA person who's drunk patriotic feelings especially one who believes in superiority of their country over others that's how Donald Trump is using the word here's the care about the history he knows what he's using it for now\nThe media's twisting it though this is what I'm trying to save I understand I don't think Donald Trump or racing I really don't you understand that but my people the people that I Want to come out and vote to get us to cross the finish what are you guys are pushing them away\nYeah I Do so you guys are nobody and don't think the president has a consultant on that he doesn't I\nDon't think that he bounce it off Kellyanne Conway or bill shine he didn't never does you don't you know he doesn't they don't deserve credit for the success he's had a and maybe on the platform and they don't take credit or discredit for some of those sayings\nHe's challenging again he's like I don't care about the past I'm telling you how I mean it but I hear you Jerry you know that's a good point ah both for the most part they got to listen to him and just said he said what does he mean by that and also even if if he is nothing else he knows how to when\nThere's no way that the president's successful nor his party is winning if they just have one sect they need a lot\nHispanics blacks women and men when we come back we're going to be joined by a guy whose campaign was struggling he seems to be getting it on track\nSome different when we return to the brain kill me show\nChallenging conventional thoughts and wisdom\nYou with Brian kill made [noise]\n\nYou know what's not smart job sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes but you know what is smart zip recruited dot com slash Brian ... dot com slash B.

admission to America hey dams wake up the country not Donald Trump wants this stopped and there was a time when you agreed with ... explain\nNumber one it is clear particularly in those swing states that Trump is an unemployed benefit for Republican Senate candidates because it brings out rural voters people not amused can testable congressional districts in ways that sort of put them over the

is Jody killing of ...\nLast ones where he walked in gotten a fist fight with twelve people and died\nAnd now we have a whole either now or to one leader of oppressive turkey who was jailed some estimate a two hundred journalists for writing things he didn't like\nNow being sanctimonious over Saudi Arabia there are no winners here joining us now is congressman and Kinzinger who who fights wars also a Adam is a retired air force pilot flew in Iraq and he's on the foreign affairs committee a congressman\nThe president's remarks yesterday I I think he was waiting for the investigation of play up as he waited he answered directly do you want to counter it\n[laughter] no listen I uh first off your book was awesome I just have to say it I I finished in a couple of weeks\nAgo and Nike is fantastic um but let me just say on the ... the president's correct here he's saying you know look we this is terrible what was done this is absolutely wrong this violates all kinds of things he's right on the\nPath theories he was also a correct to be cautious at the beginning we need to make sure I mean there's there's people that want to jump to these foreign policy conclusions all the time and just assume that whatever's reported on some news thing or from some\nFor an agency is the truth when when it comes to international politics we have to be cautious and judicious but you know what really does kind of get under my skin and all of this as\nA as you mentioned earlier on now who is the this holier than thou defender of you know the the Turkish version of the first amendment and uh and then you see even people in our own party and then the other party\nWho are calling for this like excommunication of Saudi Arabia you Rand Paul for instance has said let's just cut off everything with Saudi Arabia and at the same time yesterday\nHe called for a story and relationships and lifting sanctions against Russia who killed two people in the u._k. and killed journalists all the time so there's gotta be some consistency here and foreign policy and the fact is we oppose the killing of journal\nActor over there trying to get some answers because we basically given up on the Saudis but how rich you said sarcastically is it for her to want to act outraged about the Saudis what do you think he's playing he's looking to get maximum leverage from Saudi Arabia\nHis economy's terrible he sees jealous of the relationship that we've got rekindled with Saudi Arabia who do you think about his comments\nWell I think you you never know where are the wind comes down I mean it's kind of had an unholy alliance with Russia and other non oil alliance with Iran and then he says he's against Russia and Iran he shoots down a Russian airplane this guy's allegiances change every day for whatever is going to give them a moment of power and\nLook Saudi Arabia and Iran are the two polar is right now\nIn the Muslim world in the middle east and that bothers or the one he wants to lead the middle east and and uh and so I think he sees this as an opportunity in my estimation that take Saudi Arabia down a peg to probably get some concessions from um including\nSome economic concessions and re assert themselves as kind of the dominant power in the middle east the reality as though\nHe has no moral ground to stand on sure he doesn't murder journalists in the fashion of\nSaudi Arabia dead and again we need to be very clear and condemning this evil back but he's not he's not you know some you know St Mary himself either me a\nCouple of hundred journalists in jail and we had a pastor in jail for goodness sakes off a sham trial\nA congressman ... you know with a lotta times Congress takes the lead you guys did neuron during the Obama years what is going what is going to be the the backlash from this apparent killing a brutal killing of cars Yogi what do you what do you guys talking about proposing\nWell this is where you get into the internal politics and I think it's important\nTo talk about this you know some of these people that are calling for cutting off arms sales to Saudi Arabia you know basically the strategic realignment away from Saudi Arabia\nMentioned Rand Paul he's always wanted to excommunicated Saudi Arabia and frankly get us out of the world it's fine he believed that but I think it's important to know so\nYeah you're going to have these groups in Congress that have always been this kind of anti Saudi more pro rainy and they you know they love the Iran deal\nThat are going to try to take advantage of the situation I think it's important for us to say things like travel bans on anybody associated with this certain sanctions against you know the regime but at the same time we can't completely re aligned ourselves in the middle east away from Saudi Arabia because of this\nI Know I was just struck by Lindsey Graham and Bob Corker to defenders of ah retailing that relationship feel personally taken a personal front because this happened and you just wonder as brutal citizen it's nonsensical and you don't want to think about it why the Saudi Arabia I think they can get away with it that's what I find it following\nYeah yeah and that's where that's where I'm blown away is is you know this idea and this is why he don't\nSuppressed journalists right it's because ultimately if you\nTry it's going to backfire on you know the idea that the Saudis thought they could murder you know their own citizen but a resident in the United states in in Turkey is ridiculous and it's going to backfire on him and I hope\nAnd this is why I'm for pretty intense punishments on this because I Hope it prevents us kind of behavior in the future but again I think before you know everybody's six bag and says gee we need to just you know cut Saudi Arabia off the map and become best friends with Russia and Iran and everything in Turkey let's look at what some of these countries do them before we you know bill sanctimonious\nYour reaction to the suspicious device as it were a route to Obama or Obama camp to Clinton house and now CNN\nYeah we don't you know we don't know who sent 'em awful if no matter what the situation as a I Wish we could just get back to having good spirited debate instead of confronting Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz in a restaurant\nHave a huge mess that is not good for our institution democracy\nCongressman or how concerned are you what changes if you're in the minority\n[laughter] oh man everything I'm you know sometimes you sit back and yet you imagine how Nancy Pelosi it would be a speaker I mean imagine every Trump official in front of every committee every day\nUh being attacked and asked for everything and and some pinata knew where he is the Trump Administration and Maxine Waters and the chairman and Jerry Adler is a chairman I mean I really just it gives me chills or because you know and I think you know what is it due to the confidence of the economy people\nRead the economy has grown ups because people feel free to take a deep breath and invest a if you got this Nancy Pelosi regime on the horizon a I think people are going to hold back so guys get out and vote even if you're a Republican Congress men\nGet out and vote for him or her because ah it's you're voting for Nancy Pelosi or somebody else\nParent a congressman thanks so much Adam Kinzinger are joining us and I follow these through suspicious packages as well as ah some of the investigation over the middle east\nUh Adam thanks when we come back we're going to be joined by Jason ... spent years is border patrol years in the army and now is a whistle blower he knows the reality on the border and knows what we can and can't do to stop the seven thousand [noise] care of any this way\n[noise] first dog we can find a job I'm going to be the state [noise]\nI mean how many of them have ill intent how many of them have a background I'm In that same violence that they're fleeing\nI mean that's where the the problem with the borders going to happen is we're going to have to fat out close to ten thousand people now you mentioned I was a whistle blower my biggest thing was about the whole vetting of these adults with children harrowing and are we going to\nI mean it's just it's just going to be a complete mess\nAbsolutely use our quarter she's actually in Guatemala and this is what she saw cut Eighteen\nWe ran into people that were part of that and a Thirteen it appeared shy it there were other people as well as a lever for very different group there would be normal amount and now we were there to greet basically the way people crossing from Honduras and a lot of my lab is right on the border\nI can tell you what I saw were very few women and children and any normal for ballot man\nThat's what you see and that's what's going to be at our doorstep how hard is it going to be to get that next the next nine hundred miles with a with a you know basically with sandals on\n[noise] it they they can do it I mean who leave me they can do it and I'm sure they're going to um there's trains that they're going to be running into soon ... um there's other transit\nCourt orders I mean are they going to be linking up smugglers there's ways to make it to the border it just depends on how much time do we have to repair I mean if they're a thousand miles away we need the Ford deploy\nAssets down to them account area that we have Fort Sam Houston is right there which is great big military base um oh we need to really start moving assets in place the border patrol will get overrun by ten thousand people\nAnd they're helpless I mean they're almost victims in this because ... politicians can't get out of the way and also I saw you know we have Tom Homan who used to run I said the for the most part twenty percent of everybody that crosses has a criminal record\nSo you got to deal with some form of the people who are trying to mix in the Washington Post talked to two people that have been through five or six times and they using the caravan as cover to try to get back again here\nWhy wouldn't they Brian I mean when I was in a border patrol um and when I was with ice you know one thing is like when I was let's say it was in a border patrol and I caught a group of\nI mean vetting is great people love talking about vetting but\nIf you've never if you're a criminal you've never been encountered by law enforcement then you're not going to have a criminal history so we don't know if you're in the area so I mean this is just it's mind boggling\nYeah here's a Mollie Hemingway I think she reflects the sentiment in this country Katrina and\nI think there's a lot of room for disagreement on the integration debate and you have people who\nYou know who covered the spectrum there but the idea that there aren't national security concerns with immigration policy or economic concerns with immigration policy\nI think it's actually just something that a lot of Americans agree on and when they see something like that and I can't imagine a better visual for Donald Trump's argument that we need to have secure borders and orderly immigration policies and understanding of national sovereignty that that does not allow just literally the flooding of people over the borders\nAnd it used to be unanimous I mean we have Harry Reid yeah Brock Obama Chuck Schumer all saying we have to border security jeez in this you must have seen this what happened why it was only one party convicted on this\nI don't understand I mean that's I Believe both parties can agree\nThat there are legitimate or refugees and a legitimate asylum claims within that group it's the other part of the group that we need to be concerned about and it's not a it's a calling out I'm like hey you know calling fire this is there's actually legitimate bad people within a group I guarantee it\nUm but I you know Ninety six is when it's all really started fluctuating fry and think about the border of San Diego you still get inundated with hundreds and hundreds of Alan just running up the highway and Clinton passed a law back then and that's from the ... of the border patrol began that's when the the mass hiring started\nAnd also you guys got a wall at a huge fence to the war and that\nYeah that was fourteen miles long but what happens when you get to him a gallon where the fence only goes a certain point and I've been to the I was deployed\nAnybody so let's say they meant let's say they are going to vote count at this point we don't know exactly where they go and that's just the closest water but what happens if they get to that other areas and then you also have the crisis of what happens if they start crossing a river how many of them are going to die\nI mean there's so much to do with this and you got to remember one thing I brought this up the other day was\nThat a communicable diseases we have to not just only vet for criminal history we need to deploy a Center for Disease Control people down there a and FEMA tend to ensure that uh we're not bringing anybody across it has like a high fluctuation of tuberculosis or any other disease\nAnd Leslie Jaycee that if you talk to anybody used to work with at the border is there any color you can bring to what their jobs like now\n[noise] their job is tough it's always optics optics optics I'm back\nIn the day there was no cell phones are nowadays you're going to see when that when the ten thousand seven thousand hits the border there's gonna be cameras hundreds and hundreds of cameras not just news but cameras from everybody in the world and they're only going to take the good clips or both sides are\nAll right uh Jason Gluck thanks so much appreciate it thanks for any\nOne eight six

that we have\nProcedures in place to prevent it from happening again\nA that is a deal as you bury crown princes spokesperson the foreign minister now used to be in a batch that are geared that bred talked to Sunday and they're talking about the plot to kill\nAddress the world and there's outrage about how something like this could ever happen bill ... year bill how do you think the president's handled this will look it's been very confusing\nBut that's because the facts have been confusing uh\nThe problem the Saudis have is that the Turks clearly have a lot of evidence and the evidence they have seems to contradict the lines that the Saudis keep putting out we we did feel is right this fight right amount of ... double you carry bones saw to a fist fight 'em\nSo I think that's one of the problems is um the Saudis are trying to put out these stories\nAnd they don't know what what ages are gone home in Turkey I mean they have an investigation they found out some things clearly they may be exaggerating I mean they have an interests they they don't like Saudis they would like to be the Sunni leaders\nIn the region um but it's a big problem for the Saudis and I think even President Trump who was criticized for being too\nAccepting of the Saudis early said it's the worst cover up ever\nGet that a good job I Do a terrible job of in a brutal killing so where do you think is the practical way forward send that message more realistically but breaking off with Saudi Arabia is that in our interest\nNo uh look I think it's a it's a it's a hard line to walk\nThat the Saudis I'm sure a lot of interests with us their key in the region their relations have been warming up with Israel more quietly but kind of what we want 'em there are a lot of people trying to capitalize on this poor man's body I'm primarily the Turks and the Iranians I mean\nA lot of the outrage against the Saudis look I get it but where is that outrage against the Iranians who killed one of our FBI agents right we have an FBI do not taken out of jail to jail so so let's let's be careful about this look what I what I think the president needs to do\nIn ministry and I don't know if you remember we had a lot of interests with China and they didn't want those to\nGo to go down the drain because of this a horrible massacre\nBut there was the main square there was that horrible photo I think of um Eagleburger clanking champagne glasses with one of the training with his Chinese counterpart saying you know we're we're we're against our common enemies who was it was terrible imagery but one thing that was done is Nixon went to China\nIn eight nine ... after the massacre and basically he was he had established himself as a friend of China\nAnd he went there to tell them you guys have screwed up big time you ... you know you you have to face up to that it's going to be a long road back\nAnd hear some things you have to do and he wrote a letter to dump shopping in Nineteen Ninety that you can Google and find that the Nixon foundation and ... I I Would think that would be a good idea for a President Trump to dispatch someone not and his government\nSomeone the Saudis trust I mean ideally would have been George W. Bush someone like that but he's too old maybe Bush senior maybe a former ambassador someone they trust but to give them the no nonsense message you guys got to clean up your act and um and and and complete lastly a cut thirty six President Trump\nIs sort of became a nationalist\nAnd really we're not supposed to work you know what I Am I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nHis critics say that's code white day giants he says no it's America first I Want to put my country first right\nIs a does anyone think that President Trump speaks so subtly in code you sleep they they are attacking flipping bluntly right on the book\nI I think patriot is a better word a it is parallel to the America First debate I mean I think the President Trump uses the word America First and the literal sense that most Americans hearing it means we're putting America\nThe same thing out of the any clue and when he realizes that people are misinterpreting it what does he do double downright drives everybody not

explosive packages heading for a for a president of the United states [noise]\n\nTrust challenge talk show host this point seven million K I find I'm going to teach me the gas station [noise]\nWell Andrew Gillum the Democratic candidate who don't want it very difficult primary and he has a showed himself now that will lead in almost every poll that's come out and today a new revelation\nYeah yeah I I think that I think it's gonna be closer than it is I mean the Santa's isn't Iraq veteran it's got to really like well I'm good looking family I my understanding is that I'm the president likes him on and and you know the president\nWe had a very uh ingrained politician in our state and that and putting them\nAdam did not come out for the president during two thousand sixteen early Enron did and present remembers that stuff so back right or wrong worst presidents loyalist I think that's what's going on here I Do think to Santa's going to win and again Gillum can't get out of his own way this this ticket thing is something that seems small\nBut voters again and I for a quarter I think about\nText message emerge that show what he said on Sunday in a debate did he got him from his brother is just not true when an FBI agent posing as an influence or a text message Andrew Gillum and says I have you I've gotten you uh Hamilton tickets and he says great\nSo those are the tickets worth hundreds of dollars you can't get that as a politician you can't get favors like that as a politician he seemed to have not told the truth about it and accepted it and it shows that the FBI agent is bathing him to do this what does it say about the investigation that might be taking place on the Tallahassee mayor\nYeah um well let me say this\nWas it a Broadway play yeah yeah well no it's a Broadway musical it's common so I'm putting Elizabeth ... he's going to end the orange show I my understanding was it was a tornado but the long and short of it is is that for somebody like Gillum and Tallahassee having the reputation is I mean take it out of politics we talk football at\nFlorida State said its own problems with with a bunch of stuff there Tallahassee has become one part of Florida is looked at as\nOur swamp our microcosm on a swamp what I'd like to see and other people who support Republicans in the state would be to Santa's coming out stronger against the state swamp than the D.C swamp I think he's trying to hide in rather than the ground game which is important in Florida\nWell I don't think he's really outlined what he would do more he just points out that a Gilman reality once Medicare for all\nGilman reality once upstate taxes give them a reality is not that a good job as mayor of Tallahassee what he has his great charisma great presidents and African American candidate who ran a crowded poll because he was backed by Thomas dire and he was backed by George Soros so now you have a charismatic guy and you have another guy a veteran\nWho is a made a difference in Congress and he's been unable to separate himself because he can't believe he's running against somebody who seems so anti Florida\nYeah ... and Brian look at going because when you say Medicare for all the same Florida\nI mean you know we we have the economy on folks over age sixty five in the country we still do you start talking about Medicare for people that are under sixty five yeah that scares a lot of voters and to your point the Santos has not explaining that piece to health care if you gave Medicare to all\nThe folks that are living over sixty five in Florida right now they're Medicare their Medicare Advantage plans I work with health care businesses all the time are going to get diluted\nThat should be a major major talking point and you're right it's not being discussed in part of it is nobody really just gotten understands healthcare\nNumber one we're in between the Obamacare plan which is a disaster the Democrats are running from and it being taken apart by Republicans who don't have a plan\nYeah and and look I mean it's in the news today with what the president's doing with the Recovery Act that is a major band aid on the biggest piece of legislative malpractice and presidential ... malpractice I'll probably ever see in my lifetime and that was Obamacare why\nReally simple Obamacare for people that I didn't understand it expanded Medicaid that was three quarters of Obamacare was expanding Medicaid Medicaid was supposed to be for folks that were disabled had Down syndrome like my sister in law passed a couple of years ago [noise]\nSupposed to be for the elderly poor Obamacare opened it up to single able bodied mostly not working men\nUnder the age of thirty five\nWhat did they start taking if you go to a clinic that takes medicate in Florida and it's a pain management clinic in the last ten years tons of opiates so now they're hooked on over the edge they're addicted on opiates and what's the president been locked within thank God it was a byproduct person piece of legislation\nThe Recovery Act where you try to now get Medicaid coverage that's what this does to help these folks on Medicaid get off the opiates we got 'em out\nRight or if you would have been numbers like if we had Medicaid for all for a country\nBecause that's what Bernie Sanders is asking for a free education and medicated for all I mean do you have any idea how cautiously impractical that would be or impractical\nOur country right now it's almost twenty percent of our gross domestic product everybody knows as it is health care\nIf you were to shift healthcare to Medicaid for all anyone in the audience who is a Medicaid patient would be able to tell you the experience they get into the doctor it would be completely different than the experience that all of our listeners who do not have medicate today have\nIs a different type of medicine that's practiced and it's scary and nobody talks about the actual care compared to the numbers and the cover of\nThe uh good pretty on it was a Brian row tell it they're not going to ...\nSense in this country right away for them to try to get a health care program on a bipartisan way because if you don't have bipartisan as soon as you lose power that other the other party's gonna take it apart\nAbsolutely and the and look one thing that I can tell you that a lot of people really like right now are two things one direct Madison used to having an Amazon Prime subscription there's an ability to get that now in the country and get it a low rates in going to see a doctor when you want to it's a free market private enterprise\nThe other thing that people really really like they like when their employers are doing wellness programs and giving them back money for staying healthy and staying in the workforce you don't hear about those things should be bipartisan\nYeah a health clubs are eating right things like that a lot of times a day revolutionize the workplace to make sure if you want to stay we weren't you stick around and we're going to give you an idea what would be good for you\nYou know number one employer is doing it nobody is talking about this apples actually got its own if you work for Apple in California they have open up their own health practice you go to Capitol doctors while I work for Apple employees in California it's part of the benefit of working for Apple\nAnd I'm sure you book those appointments on an iPhone app on your watch Dr phil your on your watch hey Brian great to see you or it was great to see Brian Tampa we had to you through a great

same time when this caravan\nIs moving at an on humanly rapid pace across South America towards the United states we don't know who that is funded by either or who is actually given and transportation food\nOutside the box with all that being said ah I think what we're seeing here is I I was looking at a picture of the device\nOn the Drudge Report I've I've been a a emailing and texting a man that I work with the silk teams waiting to see what they think about that picture\nI I think it's it's a safe to say that ah these things were coordinated and such a fashion that they were able to get them in proximity to a target\nWhich is not typically something that we see when multiple devices are used or or even white powder letters or when they are male to to various entities\nYeah it's I look I I mean we don't know who did it who or what the motive was but I got to be honest with you Jonathan I mean I that was the thought that crossed my mind when I first heard about this because again I mean up until this point the violence has been coming from the left\n[noise] yeah well they ... this is a problem um in in a free speech community as if you go out\nAnd you verbally advocate for violence and then violent starts happening you're going to be the first person that somebody looks at it's no different than if you constantly going around talking about how much you hate somebody and you wish they were dead\nAnd then they ended up dead the police are going to turn and look to you first so the same thing is happening here is it is it justified or do you do people have evidence to show that the left is stuff that\nThey don't really but they do have the fact that a over a period of a significant period of time they've been advocating violence and that violence is is has gotten\nA extremely more violence\nOr over the past two years\nNo no doubt about that um so so how how likely is it the the FBI is going to be able to figure out who did this who's behind\nPotential with our investigators and the way that they systematically and methodically look at these explosives because especially if they were made by the same individual I'm rather than a group ah probably what you're going to see is that\nThese are devices were made in a similar fashion if somebody has made explosives in the past the ... the thing about when you make explosives\nIs that you do what you're taught or you do what you learn and and it's better to be taught them to learn when it comes to explosives because the learning process um were like when I went through the SEAL Team ... and I was trained and explosives and how to\nMake them how to utilize them in a conventional manner somebody had done the experimentation with that years before I came along so I didn't have to worry as much about getting my hands blown off are dying although it's dangerous nonetheless so if somebody has learned a they're lucky to be alive before they deploy these things but if they've been taught\nThere's going to be a pattern as to how they make a these explosives and how they deploy them\nSo if they've done it in the past um than the law enforcement is already going to have a footprint to look at um whether or not they have that at this point I don't know but uh they definitely from what they're reporting\nOr the way that these explosives were made or similar whether or not they have a previous understanding of or who may have made them I don't know but they're pretty good at putting together where the compounds that are made up could come from\nA sometimes the pipes that are using these pipe bombs have serial numbers and they can track back where they were bought a so there's all kinds of ways that they can reverse engineer these things to investigate\nAnd I guess the fact that none of them exploded is going to be very helpful to the investigators\n... that's the other thing that will lead people to suspicion is that fact that\nAnd secondly that none of them went off\nA because we look at bill heirs and the people from the weather underground and people will have to realize this isn't just a you know people and conservative talk radio\nTrying to make noise the fact is the left has a record in this country of using explosives and actually killing cops and other people are throughout history bill airs is a close friend with Brock Obama he's not in prison\nHe's out in his own and so a bigger to see if they're looking at the explosives they use back then versus now that the interesting thing but\nI'm the potential is the potential is there are to link these things and I think that the fact that they didn't go walk could be interpreted as something that the left me or whoever is doing this may have Warren that if you put an explosive close to somebody but it doesn't go walk you're still sending a huge\nSignal interest and if the case you know whether or not if somebody is angry at these individuals or if it's somebody who's planting them to try to uh make it look like that the right as crazy\nJonathan got to leave it there as always appreciate your great insight here and this is a head scratcher but um we'll see how things develop Jonathan Gilliam ladies and gentlemen sheep no more his incredible book got attacked that we've got to take a break more with your calls coming up than sitting around every body [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd uh people are

lot more things to do but we can't let people a mob from a series of countries from Central America an upward now that this things it's growing it's metastasized saying we have to stand with the president on this we have to stand with the rule of law\nCongressmen of course we're following breaking news with the um the suspicious packages are sent to um to President Obama and the Clintons and

try and turn the tide they've got this map coming up from Mexico and that's making them look back and they're thirst for power they will do anything and there's no doubt in my mind it the whole personal for a call\nNow this is an interesting thought because it is true that the the the devices were all mailed to places where something like this would have been spotted in the screening process and that's exactly what happened fortunately that's exactly what happened\nAnd I think if we find out the device will I don't think these devices would have even ... they were probably had safety laws

may have to do that after the up at the bottom of the hour news\nOr I Want I Want you to listen to fill up arrange a he was on MSNBC and he was asked\nHow much that this was the basic question how much is President Trump responsible again we don't know who did this or why and I buy suspicions but we're not I'm not going to speculate I'll let you speculate but this is what he's\nWith Debbie Wasserman Schultz not everyone has that kind of security and you have to be really concerned that while everything to so far has\nNot heard anyone that might not hold until a Donald Trump tweeted a few moments ago he's been mom and the other part of Sarah Sanders statement as those who are responsible will be held accountable and I think you have to ask how much Donald Trump is responsible for the climate that we're in\nFor things like this happen\nSo that that's look you know what here's the question who is responsible for the current climate in America who do you think is responsible\nTriple light seven eight nine nine one zero that's triple eight seven eight nine nine zero let's go to Gallup New Mexico Jake up listening to us on K and K.

Jacob what's on your mind today\nI I kinda feel like the Democrats are to blame 'em because of this escalation and rhetoric\nHave it you know some people they are open to being violent on either side of the political spectrum so you see this kind of escalation of rhetoric it could cause people who might not be mentally sound to do something like this\nAnd and and again we're we're talking about top Democrat leaders advocating violence against Trump supporters from Maxine Waters Eric Holder you have Hillary Clinton out there I mean it's just it's ugly out there and there is a ... or ... violence\nFeedback loop say that again Jake it's a rhetorical violence feedback loop\nWell there you go I mean that that's a great way to describe it but again we really ... and Jacob we don't know we don't know who was responsible for for sending these devices I'm I'm fairly confident the FBI is going to find out and we'll see we'll ... we'll see who was behind it all but whoever it is Jay\nJust about ... I'm suspicious about it you know\nJacob a year or not the only one you're not the only one Jake appreciate your comments are great observations let's go down to Jacksonville North Carolina Jim what's going on Jim\nI'm doing All right so how about yourself I'm fine thank you\nSo I just I'm I'm I I I think I'm with everybody else uh I don't think there's just something not quite right I'm about these devices [noise] um I I'm a retired\nFederal law enforcement officer so I mean right off the bat whenever I heard that first story this morning about a ... this resources house I'm One of his employees handle walked one of the packages into the woods if I'm not mistaken correct\nThat's right yeah it's like okay ... who who does that I I don't I don't know anybody that would do it I mean most civilians that I've been around since since I've been around whatever's in season suspicious package um I I mean they quite literally run the other direction\nUm [laughter] I've never been going on to pick up a package and move it to a safe distance\nUm that doesn't seem unusual\nSo and and then second of all the I mean this would be breaking news all over the media they would have doubts they would have suspicion they would they wouldn't a immediately go to claiming Trump for one thing um\nI think it seems more like a blame game to the media versus I'm trying to figure out what's happening to making sure everybody safe which which you would think would be the normal\nCourse of action um and then the third thing I'm noticing is I mean just like the Congress and the previous congressman that was on a mentioned than being sent through the mail\nI don't think we've had a a an explosive package slip through the United states mail service in the open at least a decade and I'm assuming\nI'm ... ... you you had to go and send them to to politicians would would be caught a relatively quickly um so I I just\nBears repeating something here doesn't pass the smell that I I'm I'm not willing to go there just yet but\nBut something is that right triple seven eight nine nine zero our telephone number triple like seven eight nine nine zero we're taking your call for the rest of the show ladies and gentlemen I'm Crazy stuff stick around [noise]\nI I Can't imagine anybody that committed to a cause\nThat that would do something like ... maybe but maybe the maybe there are people like that or let's go to Brooklyn New York ray what's on your mind ray\nHi I Am a let me start by saying I did vote for Donald Trump and I support many of his policies the left is clearly flaming the fuels of hate to win back the\nParty reach across the aisles and with the Republicans in power my party they have not at all reached across the aisle especially with a great deal maker as a president companies in serious or countries in Syria shape right now and what happened today should scare all of us\nAll right well let me let me back up here and and ask you a couple of questions um what do you mean the Republicans have not reached across the aisle because I'm thinking that they\nHave tried to do that in a number of times but they've been rebuffed by the Democrats are I'm they they still don't recognize that Donald Trump is the legitimate winner of the twenty sixteen presidency\nMost important issue of the campaign healthcare do we have a health care policy from our Republican friends have been\nTrying they've been trying but the Democrats the Democrats will not work with the Republicans\nI challenge you and anyone to give me one point on the core of the Republican health care party\nRole let me challenge you re or go back to Obamacare who was it that push through Obamacare there were Republicans on that was that was that was reaching across the aisle I'm just telling you the Democrats are not willing to budge one bit to help Donald Trump here\nWe have a president who wrote the book the art of the deal and I voted for him he needs to find common ground our country can't continue along the way it's going is it a single payer sit aren't\nWhat is the president need to do right what does the ... I mean he's trying I mean he I mean what does it what does he do\nHe needs to publicly come out with a health care plan and he needs to invite the Democrats to be part of that plan and it needs to be a public invitation and then let's see pillow see reject and Schumer rejects that type of collaborative effort\nRight haven't seen that well ... well bill good luck with that I I just don't think that's going to happen right appreciate the telephone call I mean look demand from day one he is\nThey don't want to have anything to do with this guy they don't want to have anything to do with Donald Trump that would that would possibly be good for America they they just don't [noise] All right let's go to Louis in Idaho Nicholas you are on the air\n[noise] yeah how are you I'm well thank you\nUm yeah and it's hard to say you know it's that nobody got hurt but I kind of want to find out how a slower mail system works that they can say that many packages at one time and they all show up\nThe same morning and none of them were late none of them got misplaced I mean last time I mailed a letter to my grandma had chicken extra four days 'cause I went to the wrong place so I mean ... to the U.S postal service but it seems kind of fishy that they all showed up the same the same time [noise]\nWell that that is interesting and and and again we don't know for certain when all of these packages were delivered but it it is rather interesting that they all seem to show up right about the same time\nI'm so Nicolas you're saying that's not normally the case when it comes to mailing packages with the United States Postal service\nI mean I I have yet to see it works out well but I mean that's a good point\nYeah good ... well maybe they yeah maybe who knows who knows\nWell Nicholas um it is it is one of the the more curious questions about all of this and and I think the good news and we heard this from Jonathan Gilliam before FBI agent and we heard it from congressman Rick Crawford the bomb disposal to a bomb disposal technician\nThat they're they are the chances are really good they are going to catch whoever did this because the bombs did not explode so they have all this great evidence\nAnd let me be clear here so I'm a Nicholas things for the telephone call let me be clear here I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican y'all got to knock this crap out at ... this has got to stop\nI have seen the protestors out there and I ... and what we have condemned all of that on this radio program [noise] but you don't go out they're acting acting the fool and you don't go out they're blowing people up that's not who we are as Americans\nAnd whoever these people are they need to be publicly shamed and they need to be held to the highest and I again whatever the penalty is under the law that's what they ought to get let's go to Newport Beach California beautiful country Shaun welcome to the show\n[noise] they taught thanks for having me um I think\nYou know you look at it this um\nYou can't just look but let me just quickly say something these protests are kicking people out to restaurants harassing people like Mitch McConnell I don't support that but there's a big difference between that and Donald Trump calling the media the enemy of the people and coming out and saying that these people they hate America\nAll right let me stop you there head on and I'll let you finish your thought there for a second but that's not what the president said he called the fake news people the enemy of of America and they are because they're doing a disservice to the country go at\nThe surface of the country by providing the facts and evidence about everything that's going on what I'm saying is that everybody has everybody has partisan divide everything that she didn't this country right now but when Donald Trump goes to a rally and says these inflammatory devices these humanizing things\nWhat does he have to ... and what does he said this dehumanizing Sean ...\nThese people all Democrats or media to hate you they hate America you know this is you live and\nWhen did he say that I mean you're you're you're speaking in general terms or ... I mean give me specifics here\nOver the last rally he can go look at the transcript he said that Democrats hate America okay he said that word Democrat ...\nMedia and this is what this is the seat and you can't deny that his words might have encouraged is it's absolutely possible so\nI think that we all need to take a step back but it's almost certain to take a step back is he going to do the Raleigh or is he should do you think he's a canceled their hours tonight and make a speech in the oval office and say you know what let's unite this is wrong he shouldn't have a relative is your sense that go to the oval office to make his biggest speech that President\nWhat do you want and what do you mean what are you what are you wanted to say\nI Want him to say the ex president so for once and try to say unifying message from a script and just say something that's something that's going to unite everybody instead of going tonight and they use the enemy of the people\nBut the thing is the enemy of the people Sean I but I think we can all agree with that can we all agree with what's\nWhat's taking things that he doesn't like come on\nNo fake news or the people that are intentionally to lying about the president's policies Sean I mean come on here I mean all you gotta do is turn on and look keep in mind that the people over at CNN and MSNBC and the New York times still don't believe he's the legitimate president of the United states\nAfter Bob Mueller's investigation was done vote\nOn their way do you see I was waiting for that to happen Sean so again you don't believe that Donald Trump is the legitimate president\nI don't know I Do we have to wait for Bob Mueller's investigation is unless\nYou know what I you know what forget about Bob Mueller's investigation I'm going to tell you right here now Sean you could take those to bank Donald J Trump is the duly elected president of these great United States should have a good day for ... that [noise]\nYeah I looked

I don't think I've got like a day and like three or four years about just thinking about it and how great it would be but so what's the dream car\nIt's a a BMW and three and a forty six one so\nOkay and how you're going to maintain that puppy because your maintenance on that's pretty serious\nYeah a K continuing to work you know what I hear from other owners is that costs about on average Fifteen hundred to two thousand a year to just keep it in good shape and maintain it\nAnd you know I'm a non thankful that my job right now\nI'm can pay me enough to to you know continue to fund mhm [noise] um\nWell you pick out a very cool car no question about the way career for sixteen years old no question so [laughter] ... automobile it really is a it typically is going to be a car though by someone who is has a um a really really good income and the Fifteen hundred dollars\nTo keep it running every year is a minor part of their world instead of like a hundred percent of your income you know it's interesting I was a big part of your world a year it's not a hundred percent of your income but I mean it's a big part of your world is sixteen years old and a you know I'm more concerned about that owned going maintenance cost of this thing that I Am an actual purchase\nOn while I\nOther than the uh it doesn't change and I mean a Fifteen hundred dollar maintenance fee for you know to keep a car running and that's if everything goes pretty good you can drop five grand and it pretty quick on the beamer\nAnd again the car you're talking about a beast of a car it's a wonderful lower on my car guy I get why you'd want it the and and if you don't spend Fifteen dollars on car and you worked and saved up Fifteen thousand dollars and you do it I\nYou know I might say well might spend tan and keep five in the bank that kind of runs through my head but uh but aside from that that doesn't bother me near as much as you're signing up for\nA problem child as far as maintenance go I mean that's what you're signing up for that bothers me so as long as you know what you're getting into and you're willing to take it on a but you may look up one day and go I Wish I had known this car and which time you sell the car\nOkay and um [noise] show or what do you make\nRight now I Am not working I recently moved back ah with family\nSo you're separated yeah OK and family is in Los Angeles yeah okay and um you have children now\nSo I'm I'm guessing based on that separation that the divorce was going ahead or not\nSay it will be okay right well whether\nYou agree on filing for bankruptcy or not is irrelevant um he decides what he's going to do and you decide what you're going to do if you're not married\nAnd even if you are married technically because you don't file bankruptcy as a married couple um in other words when I filed I could have filed insurance not filed accepted she'd sons from the researchers you got to file too but um and we had to follow him all the different corporations mellow season that we had at the time that was Thirty years ago\nUm show or in this case he could file and you not file that's possible\nThat's your student loan either way whose name of the credit cards in Baltimore evenly are all our you're both on all of them were both on all of them okay\nWere he to file and you not to file you would be left last man standing and get to pay them\nOkay okay that's how that would work whose name was the car in Baltimore who's got the car\nThey're two different cars and we're both on them and he has run an ad in the air\nOh it's so twenty five is cars and waste the breakdown of the twenty five break it out for me\nAh Fifteen and can you know ... OK okay the rule on\nA an asset that has um that that has a lien against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt and keep the asset okay\nSo you could you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt double it's not going away you got your student loan back that's done okay the cars then you cannot keep the car unless you keep the debt\nYou can ... from the debt okay you've found on me but the only way you keep the car and so sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of the debt an ad in the ... the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they would lean on the car\nOkay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is or was a I'm\nA ... or in the event of a bankruptcy you resign for the whole debt and you keep the guard show which of the cars is yours the Fifteen of the ten\nFifteen okay and\nAs a student loan that you're going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card debt you understand if he files and you don't you've got that\nAnd then you got the other car now in the event of a divorce what I Would demand is that if he's going to keep a car that he refinancing and get your name off of it\nOr if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car that he's driving is it worth at least once wrote on it\nAnd say about that okay so you could just sell that car and break even but I'm a you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess is what it is and you already knew that okay Sam so the scenarios are\nThat um you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll land into\nUm I'm a veterinarian and so I Would say about Thirteen an hour and working fulltime\nAre you a D. V. him\nNo oh no I'm attack your attack okay\nAll right and so I'm In that's in the Los Angeles area or you're going to be somewhere else okay All right so you're going to land on that and then you're going to clean up your student loan debt and the credit card debt and the card that if he walks on all of it\nYeah okay now if he chooses not to file and fight through it than the two of you got to work through this together and you're going to be what does he make\n[noise] ah last year he made about a twenty five okay be coming out of the military now his tail and his share in the military [laughter] yeah\nNo I have no security clearance you understand that he understands and I'm sure you file bankruptcy\nHarry are are are harmed pretty dramatically if he finds a bankruptcy but he didn't make any money should be and and you just came home of a deployment and he's lost his mind it sounds like oh my goodness\nYeah [laughter] ... I'm so sorry I didn't care\nYou know he's just trying to start over and it's not going to be as easy for him as he wants it to be how old is he\nTrying to seven yeah okay\nWell um I I think you sit down with your pastor and if you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine um\nI I think if he files and you don't you've got to force him\nA to sell the car that is in his name and probably we're going to say oh yours too okay I'm In and get you get you a five thousand dollar loan for the difference and then you work your way out of the credit card debt the little bit of a car loan driving a beat her and the student loan debt is going to take you a little while with your income\nBut you can do that it doesn't mean you have to file just because he files mathematically or legally\nOkay this is just making sense to you [laughter]\nSo I'm Sorry your face and all this what a mess listen if you get in the middle of and you're going to that question you call me back I'll help you okay\nThank you\nThank you Chris is with us in Minneapolis Hi Chris how are you\nGood Dave how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nThen a question about life insurance or I'm not very uh ... uh I spoke with your guys Vander and uh [noise]\nYou know they had them kinda borderline whether or not to get a term life insurance [noise] I've got a wife to kids at home and I'm the premium it'd be pretty expensive uh [noise]\nIf I Do get approved so I guess my question is two parts do I still go for it even if it's you know three four hundred dollar a month premium um\nThree or four hundred a month for how much coverage\nAh [laughter] I mean basically that would be to do okay you know how to get you okay are you are you overweight\nYeah okra and that'll give me too [laughter] yeah okay\nYeah that they can help you more with the diabetes if you get the way down which also by the way up to the doctor already told you that you knew that right\nOh yeah I'm On a good good for you so hard struggle um\nShow what I might do is make sure my family's lot left with nothing and my smaller policy\nUntil we can do those two things and let let's get the weight off and get the diabetes more under control at that point and see if we can get a better rate two years from now or something\nAnd um you start to see the ... the actual economic value of taking care of yourself in those situations in addition to just oh I get to live longer hello you know so [laughter] you already knew these things right right well um yeah\nBut but I I mean what if you took half\nAnd that at least you know she's are or how much you own your home [noise]\nUh two eighty what does she does she work outside the home now she works out she which are known\nNow so if

better and I'm On my way and no one can argue with you about your story and your feelings\nRight but don't Wagner finger at her and say now you need to do this to instead of just just keep talking

you did for you are or not for her\nJust enabling like with your alcoholic fan obviously you wouldn't know out and drink\nAnd John Barr knowing what I Would I make money\nThe day for all that is and and my dad gets read tired and they only have one income that are living on to it and kind of you know\nAnd and sell one way that they don't live in our in our state and the legal visit them and my dad he wants to take us out to the fancy dinner to show that he loved that and we love handles fell nuts but I just want to scream absolutely not not for kids and that I don't want to train our relationship\nIt just said that you know what we're learning in our story as we're learning that we can't do that and so it makes us very uncomfortable to do that with you so let's find another way to celebrate our time at home because we don't want to go out to eat it won't be fun for us\nBut don't go bad you only take us out to eat or to broke that stupid if you want to say that that's what's your thinking and I'm thinking yeah right I agree with you but if you say that kind of stuff so you got to direct it all back to you back to you back to you back\nTo you talk about how you feel about this not about how you feel about them or their behaviors but you're just back and talk about you used to feel the way and you turn it loose you used to feel and now I feel good I used to be freaked out now I'm not in you know of course that only to be the truth by the way and you know tell the truth and\nYou know but I used to I I felt that way too personally I mean I went broke Shannon I went broke we killed each other I Know how it feels to fight\nAbout money and um we'll fight about money anymore and have it in years\nUh and so how do you how do you fix that what do you do and you're just share your story talk about your story and they will start chasing you eventually to get that and go if if they ever reach out and say well look at it that hey I could show you how if you want me to tell you what we're doing\nBut don't ever return and go deep one step deeper and go because you're stupid\nBecause you're doing this wrong you go out to eat all the time he got to stop that\n... my my pay for it 'cause it changed my life not because you're so stupid you need it\nYou see the difference and you just keep directing it back through you through your story that your only shot and just talk about what it's done for you not what it'll do for them and then pay for it for for them to go through and I'm\nLike mom someday when you're rich you can pay for the rest of the kids to go through or something if you want but right now under this is my gift just because of what it's done for me and you know might not work for you but it was worked for me you know I just kind of keep playing it off and making them chase it a little bits of begging them to be smart [noise]\nHope that helps you [noise] open phones a AAA eight to five\nFive to to buy\nYour job and we'll talk about your life and your money this is the day Ramsey shot [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real

I'm Sorry I ran into oh I Know it's an eerie dating and one one of the things I just I just want to\nI kind of want to walk them and throw it away and\nI'm One of the things we've been looking to be a Christian health share ministries and I think for a while you guys might have been your doors and one for a while I Can't remember but we have any ways we're we've got some other families in our class single income just paying thousand dollars a month for\nPretty for health insurance but yeah and you know we can do a family on the healthcare mystery strike forfeit your mind about ...\nI just I wanted to get your cake and see if it you know something especially in baby steps here you know where\nMy wife and I talked about it were a little more comfortable you know when we have a fully funded emergency fired by now I don't know we're just trying to navigate that and I want to get your take\nOn the uh we do indoors a Christian healthcare ministries is one of our ah sponsors for the live events and for some other things over the years I'm full disclosure I have a group health care plan at our company here\nThis Blue Cross Blue Shield that is my personal healthcare\nSo on and I'm real careful on the show as you know or even through financial ... not to recommend to people to do something I don't do\nThat kind of a thing but I'm In a little different situation I've got a decent program a available to me um and so a Christian healthcare ministries um the the\nYou know the bottom line was the thing is it's technically not insurance as you know it it all sharing and it is based on the book of acts we're Christians band together and share each other's burdens or in a sense becomes cooperatives Dan is what it's doing\n'em and uh the the\nYou know I Would never suggest going into something like that that did not have a law\nA single claim\nYou have to read and you should read very carefully to what it covers and what it does not cover\nAnd know that and they've got a couple of plans you can buy the upgrade plan that covers different things and that kind of a thing\nFamily plan their singles plan all that they've got a normal you know an array of products so to speak to learn what's covered in what is not covered learn how it works um because it is technically not insurance you're technically if someone else in the program chose not to share\nThen war would you be you know technically but they've never failed to make a claim so it's worked for forty years you know I mean or whatever number of years but decades right so I'm comfortable with its credibility in that regard\nIt is different than insurance and we get our brains get dolled into how health insurance works and this has got some nuances some differences to it so learn what those are\nNumber one number to know that I don't personally do it even though I Do believe in it and number three and the only way I Do it as if they had a long long long track record which these guys do and it is a Christian\nHealthcare ministries and so a ... and the ... that their definition of that is is that if you use tobacco or ... or alcohol then you don't qualify\nAnd so there are a hardcore in that regard um and so you need to you know be aware that that's there and that's a limiting factor as well and they ... you know they want you to affirm your faith as part of the process you're Christian faith\nAs a part of the process and so that's what it's for and how it's laid out but all of that and once you know all those nuances and you know those differences and you can see them um we would not have endorsed that if we didn't think it had credibility\nRight and that way and and I guess if I could ask one follow up question how we were to go through that even babysat for you and all that kind of one of it\nA recall the requirement for you know we're we're evangelical Christians all that kind of stuff and we're and we're normally pretty healthy it seemed like a good fit for our family but like one of 'em you know you pay out of pocket kind of like an eight to pay for Fifteen hundred bucks and stuff so if you're a baby sat here would you recommend it when they go that route\nTo set aside their dollars to insulate you a gun\nOr a you've got to remember to you've already got a thousand and baby sit around and so you're close enough\nAnd if you run up over just budget your other five hundred into your budget slow or you might have to slow down your debt snowball a little bit in baby steps who covers some bills if you had an event right Brian or it's just like carrying large the duck double as you said in and they just say or something I'm but I'm going to take that part of the risk gone for sure\nAnd I'm so forth but but yeah Christian healthcare

[laughter] like I I Would go to jail for\nThat anyway right at a mentally not be able to ... apparently they are not very opinionated\nPeople know but that's absurd ready for this this is this takes the cake three point five million Americans Rachel cruise would go to jail\nThey would give up all freedom not just speech they would put all along they would put on the orange jumpsuit and go to jail you they know it does it's not that detailed doesn't matter how ludicrous are we talking\nStyle [laughter]\nNow not have the freedom fighters you not different for for a family work and pay off debts you know you're just using that you're just like you lose all freedom you're ... jail food\nYou know let's let's break this down for a minute we're having fun with this\nBut but I I I Want you to jumping on this so these are people there's there's three point five million Americans were going I don't want to sacrifice cable t._v. I don't want to sacrifice going out on it as a vice you sports I don't want to sacrifice my rent a couch I don't want to sacrifice my effort to fifty it's costing me seven hundred bucks a month\nOr I don't want to sacrifice that\nTo get out of debt through Dave Ramsey spaceships and so when I Want to go to jail\nI'll go to jail before that ... or ... are it's three point five million dollars who have not heard of the baby sat there that nobody they just truly have locked all hope\nThat they will never ever ever ever got out of it\nYou just hit the point they walked out so they think I'll go to jail and then when I get out of jail I don't have any data that\nBecause they may I I Want to believe in my the glass as half full cup if there is one and glass as half full cup that's not right yeah well I have full I get asked George again without opinion what do you think about that in the lobby\nHe's like this he literally put his hands up and looked at this guy I said I Want to believe in my optimistic view yes that three point five million Americans isn't optimistic but that they just don't know that they can sacrifice lifestyle\nYou can make different choices you can live on a budget you can take out an extra job for a short period of time\nAnd pay off that data is but the sad thing is that they I've read like that they've just off the hope\nThey don't think you're ... you're exactly right I Hope that someone now I don't think I mean doesn't\nSay I would rather not I'd rather not give up cable and go to jail because in jail didn't have cable in jail [noise] no I don't think I mean I Know\nThink is limited and it's like murder she wrote from Thirty years ago so here's the foreign Dave Ramsey has a plan so we're having fun with this crazy stuff but the reality is if you're joining the show today and you feel that loss\nDave baby steps total money make over walks me through it joined the show the conversation on a daily basis take inspiration from the men and women better showcased every day on the show do their ...\nYeah well and on this show and the rights of Chris shall we always have a couple of come in and share their story and when I left in it and it's ... all of you listening to what you it's it's everyday\nAverage American is people don't make crazy and ... they don't have like a super being taped like no these are everyday people choosing something different in this room and at that you have to choose something different for a different outcome and said that that's the power in it but again anyone out there you can do\nDrinks doable AAA eight to five five two to five is the phone numbers that is how it started to take the step today triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Eric who's on the line and Kansas City Eric how can we help\n[noise] hey how's it going good how are you sir\nGood um so I have two options I'm a registered nurse and I'm not going to grad school either nurse practitioner school or see aren't a school [noise]\nWe owe a hundred K. on her house or get free otherwise um we have a four month old and we're looking at having a second baby and the next year\nI'm In the school I could cash flow and worked fulltime through the school would be a little bit longer it's about a five year program and totality of what just prerequisites and and I could not work for the three years\nAnd the debt of that would be Ninety thousand dollars at the end of it\nAnd so I mean the payouts are different obviously in ... make a hundred K. give or take a ... make it to the one Seventy five\nWhich do you really want if all those money things weren't an issue and you had the responsibility of a wife and the children in the house and all that which one would you want if you could snap your fingers\n[noise] that's it it's hard for me to personally answered is because there was a vantage isn't disadvantages to um\nSo the question becomes a can you take that next step or what do you call it the ... is that right\nYeah nurse practitioner\nOkay ill okay in ... and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\nNot without going back to that tree or program enjoy fame prerequisite\nFlight but my point is let's say you're in ... for five to seven years and you've got a no debt you may even pay your house off in that time and so you cash flow your way through that as you move up the ladder\nHow old are you twenty nine yeah I just wonder can you do it just logistically can you do if you go into the into the situation you're going to cash 'em all that so no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to cash for your way through that ultimate role\n\nI really know what are you making now sixty\nOkay you'd have a forty grand bump basically ... a year with that and how much does that cost again you said that you the cash flow\nOr that one would be forty K\nTotal and the other one is nine thousand yeah correct\nSo you could do it just started bumped his salary honestly and go and do that it's forty can invest that but you're gonna make forty came back in a year to yeah Ken's right if you do that I Know from the point is that many years have at that and then go back to ... you may not be able to do then the other school right now like you said 'cause you don't the cash for it so now I don't go into student loan debt for that\nBut go ahead and go through the school get an upgraded job upgrade by early and you enjoy the warning offense that's an increase in income at least and yeah and then move into the school\nAnd a few years and cash for that yeah that ... I just want you to have that idea in your head I think well you pause you're sitting there trying to run the numbers and I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there's a ladder to that ultimate goal might it take you seven or eight years yes but guess what\nOr what you want to do also for something good\nBy folks more of your calls about your life your career your money here on the Daily Show don't go anywhere [noise]\nAre you one of the millions of empty nesters are look around their house and just see unused space it might be time to downsize but when you raised a family and I have a lot of emotions tied to your home it can be tough to separate the facts from the feelings\nAnd that's where an experts advise comes in handy Anna in Portland, Oregon knew she needed a real estate agents help when she decided to sell I had lived in my own for twenty five years and it was overwhelming to think where to begin\nYour E. L. P. helped me determine everything that needed to be done and was patient and put things into perspective with this help we at twenty kids in three days folks there is no simple formula for determining when to sell your house\nBut partnering with the pro you can trust to provide honest advice will help you do what's best for you and your budget our real estate EL peas are great agents who can guide you in the direction that is right for you\nAnd at twenty eight you have plenty of time to get there are but in the meantime while you're pursuing a plan I Can't say this enough\nYou're not being dishonest you're not being a ... in the current job so let go of some of that guilt um and and I think you're going to be fine I just would not let that way on you\nTriple eight to five five two to five is the number two in Komen Rachel crew sitting in for Dave Ramsey\nHi Ken I'm I Am fifty five years old I had been teaching in public school and the health care for 'em Thirty years\nOn and I just found in the last few years that on\n... it's time for me to look for something else um I live in the back of last year really then I'm drawn to real estate I looked into it um yeah I can collect my a retirement um if I retire with a little bit of a penalty\nOn as opposed to going up all thirty five years of my only on a challenge or block is convincing my husband that's a good idea because it would be a bit of a difference and they are but\nThere is about twenty five thousand dollars in salary but I Know that I can make that um I I really get excited thinking about on helping people find I'm saying thirty and found I find that really interesting okay not what I Love my teaching but it's just time for it\nI get it I got good news I got good news for you and your husband okay\nSo for you to become a realtor a successful realtor it's going to take you a little bit of time and I think the fact that you just reveal to us and our audience that you still enjoy teaching there is no big hurry you're not calling in a completely burned out\nAnd so I Would not take the penalty either I how many more years just for fun real quick how many more years would you have to stay in the role of teacher before he retired without penalty\nI just want to throw scenario of what is over the next five years you've built your real estate business showing homes at night and on the weekends I think that's extremely doable anybody who's ever been successful in real real estate knows you got to build a pipeline your husband's only real concern sounds like to me Rachel is that he doesn't want you to lose that twenty five\nThe penalty but I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business\nOver five year period is going to be here before you know it you step into retirement full benefits and by that time you should have usually replaced if not\nMaybe another extra you know twenty five thirty percent above and beyond what you make you I think you can just absolutely double your income while still being a teacher I think that's the thing that I'd want you to consider Rachel\nBob and it's a it's a great situation to be an because real estate usually agents show how those when people aren't working so that means it is night than it is we can look up what the busy at the time and so\nTo say hey I'm going to commit for maybe when you and your husband can decide that a year two years three years old can even go to five years if you can whatever it is and say okay we're in commit the amount of time and if you start to see yourself like well I'm really good at it because you sound very enthusiastic about it you sound like a people person which means you're gonna be a great residents of the major 'cause most people do great when they\nHave great people skills but it sounds like you can really so\nEven though you're enthusiastic you still may not be great at it you can kind of get some things on your belt while you're learning for again a year or two\nMaybe three years whatever your husband's aside a and then kind of step into it yeah I wouldn't go cold turkey by any means but I think that this could be excellent because having a great wrote that agent ... and the thing about it is it still commission base that you get to decide what you make basically like how much you work how many how you sell\nSuper fun versus going from where we're at the salary as a teacher\nTo do something like that can be very incredible for you personally and you may find that you're really good at it and maybe in a year inside the\nUs and I think once you show the

OK okay the rule on\nA an asset that has um that that has a lien against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt and keep the asset\nOkay so you could you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt double it's not going away you've got your student loan back that's done okay the cars then you cannot keep the car unless you keep the debt\nYou can ... from the debt\nOkay you've found on me but the only way you keep the car and so sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of the debt in the in the ... the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they would lean on the car\nOkay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is or was a I'm\nA ... or in the event of a bankruptcy you resign for the whole debt and you keep the guard show which of the cars is yours the Fifteen of the town\nOkay All right and so you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan debt you're going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card debt you understand if he files and you don't you've got that\nAnd then you got the other car now in the event of a divorced what I Would demand is that if he's going to keep a car that he refinancing and get your name off of it\nOr if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car that he's driving is it worth at least once wrote on it\nAnd say about that okay so you could just sell that car and break even but I'm a you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess is what it is and you already knew that okay Sam so the scenarios are\nThat um you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll end into\nUm I'm a veterinarian and so I Would say about Thirteen an hour and working full time\nAre you a D. V. him\nNo oh no I'm a ... [laughter]\nYour attack okay All right and so I'm In that's in the Los Angeles area or are you going to be somewhere else okay All right so you're going to land on that and then you're going to clean

person but an officer a school or any number of possibilities we don't know that at this point and and and frankly we may never know ah depending on how the winter or winners decided to claim this\nIn

leader all of the\nIt was carried out a poorly\nAnd the cover up was one of the worst in the history of cover ups for some bad deal should've never even thought of somebody really messed up and they had the worst cover up ever and where should have stopped is at the deal stand what when they thought about it because whoever thought of that idea I think is in big trouble\nAnd they shouldn't be in big trouble\nTrump like look I Know BS right like I I I Am a showman I Know how to work it exists didn't even pass my smell test this was awful\nNothing that they've done has has done well it certainly has not been spoken of properly victims of all things even thinking about the ideas they certainly did advantage of of execution and they certainly did a bad job of talking about it or covering it up and you'd like to say that but I Would say it was a total fiasco\nAnd I'll say it because you guys all thought of it I think they did a good job in the execution not just that give us the story that was bad and now the crop up till then I got a new one the crown prince spoke today and apparently look a showcase kids was there and gave him as you so eloquently put a British to fill the sting guy\nI spoke with the crown prince yesterday and he strongly said that he had nothing to do with this this was a lower level\nYeah that's the new thing it's at a lower level it's and he's come out today it's awful it's horrible it's file it's disgusting it is we're going to find out who did this who did this General McChrystal\nDo you believe that an operation like this could be carried out by rogue elements without the crown prince of Saudi Arabia having knowledge of it or approval of it I think maybe in some states occurred in Saudi Arabia I don't find that credible it that's not how Saudi Arabia where yeah I mean the crime\nIf I don't find that convincing now now I don't either\nThe guy knows everything that's going on there period case closed and his story he

Copa they have to dig out the swords and they have to put 'em everywhere and then you fall down on the store depending on how many times that you want the audio by the way this controversy with this and we'll get to that and say it's so she comes out today\nI'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry you may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it has ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another a black person making their faith later\nPart of a Halloween costume and wound okay well I was wrong and I am sorry\nSo she starts out with that and I look if you want to go as Diana Ross and you're doing it out of respect\nI I I've never had it like I I'm just sitting here in in the fact that we've been talking about this but there there's a bigger thing at play here it's the fact that so many people are allowed to can somebody and and it's not a lot it's it's a few people are allowed to control the conversation where we go because everybody's worried about I better be on the right side of this so people are going to be\nMad at me I'm a member of\nGod I I was a kid watching this thing and there was a guy who I don't know if you remember the show producer filled there used to be this lip sinking show on it was on up to like solid gold or American Bandstand and one of these things and this guy dressed up half is Diana Ross and I think the other half as ah the did mindless love was that the one uh Richie\nAnyhow and a half and a half and it was amazing today could you do that you can't kick\nI'm Wondering when people just out of the you know you can be a drag queen because you're in your your your culturally appropriating females which is happening by the way but she wasn't finished here\nOne of the great parts of sitting in this chair each day and getting to discuss different points of view sometimes I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned I learned that given the history of blackface being used in awful ways by race it in this country\nIt is not okay for that to be part of any ... in Halloween or otherwise I have never been a ... kind of person but I Do understand the value in being sensitive to our history particularly on race and ethnicity this past year has been so painful\nFor many people of color the country fails so divided and I have\nNo wish to add to that pain\nOkay All right I mean look I I understand that but\nRaces out did you think a racist or listening to you're going oh my God guys you know before we go burn this cross I really need to get my facts of Megan Kelly 'cause no they're not they're not paying any attention to their idiots out that there will always be it\nBut\nI'm going to throw them out there and British civilian eye of the same age we grew up watching many of the same shows did you ever once in your life with your friends play cowboys and Indians\nAll the time cultural appropriation\nGo to the Halloween store looking all the stuff he gets fun is it meant if it's meant it here in the way I've always looked at stuff people\nWho want it to mean at a certain way particularly if they want to be awful\nWhere they began message\nGoing to do that anyways they are\nI think the fact that NBC and everybody is destroying her shows you though that more people are

sensitive\nWas it meant that he made it in a racist way now he didn't he didn't mean it in a racist way but it's\nLonger how it's meant in life it's how it's perceived I don't think she did anything wrong but I Do do that this time next week it's Halloween and we will talking about the horrible costumes that people were oh my God this person did that er\nWasn't a a a one of the stars on the young kids it's got dreadlocks and they're like oh it's cultural appropriation I'm like really cause the Greeks had dreadlocks and then people get into an argument about whether or not that's real and like
