we welcome Rick Fisher of the international assessment of strategy\nGood evening you does China the pie LA does did have intermediate missiles that are comparable to the U.S has plenty of the twentieth century good evening to you wreck\nGood evening John indeed China does have intermediate range ballistic missiles and two thousand fourteen it revealed its dong facing the F twenty six a four thousand kilometer range or intermediate range ballistic missile comparable\nTo the old Soviet ss twenty I R B um that was the subject and was destroyed because of the IMF treaty\nChina does have this missile and both are armed with nuclear warheads and with the new verbal anti ship ballistic missile warheads Gordon\nRick there a couple of problems with the IMF treaty right now I'm principal among them is that the Russians have been violating it since at least two thousand eight\nAnd the United states despite what has been doing has not been able to bring the Russians into compliance that would seem to me to be a good reason to get out of the treaty because we just have a one sided agreement right now but the other reason is what you've just been talking about and that the Chinese are not a part of the treaty the question is\nDo you think it's possible that Beijing could be persuaded to join a new uh I N F treaty which should include Russia and the United states\nGordon uh it's my opinion that are both the Russians and the Americans at various times have tried have implored the Chinese to consider some kind of relationship with the IMF treaty the problem with China\nOr since we started a outreach since really since the Nineteen eighties when we began to try to have these conversations with the Chinese as it is\nAre they ... their goal is dominance and if your goal is to dominate well then you conceal you hide\nYou refuse any kind of transparency so that your enemy or can prepare to defend themselves against the Chinese understand this and so they reject arms control as we have practice it even with\nOur dire enemy the former Soviet Union\nGuy does Russia have a dialogue with China about intermediate range missiles they the same concern could be imagined Russia had with Europe Russia and could have with China there's no warning here\nOr John I it's my opinion a based on conversations that\nThere is a wide swath of the Russian national security elite that has long been concerned with China's military buildup especially their buildup of ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles unfortunately for them however ... has decided that he\nNeeds China's economic support in order for his regime has dictatorship to survive so he is going to downplay and ignore\nThe strategic challenge from China for now but\nI also believe that ... in his national security advisers understand that after this period of ... with China that the Chinese are going to come after them and so they ... they were buying time to prepare for an eventual Chinese tilt against the Russians\nSo Rick with these short and intermediate range missiles that the Chinese have them all of them are appear to be mobile even the ones that are supposedly hidden underground the U.S doesn't have road mobile a ballistic missiles we've got ones that are in silos they're really vulnerable\nThe Russians and the Chinese have which are these are a ballistic missiles sitting on big trucks that can just go wherever they want or are we going to stay with a silos or in the future\nGordon the army has a program to build a modern short range ballistic missiles and there have been suggestions from army officials that they would like medium range ballistic missiles as well\nOr the Chinese have been building medium range ballistic missile solid fuel mobile medium range ballistic missiles ah since the early Nineteen nineties\nUh twenty seconds right the American military watch them as well and as we do build them and we should we should also consider offering this technology to our allies in Asia\nWreck Fisher the international assessment of strategies to enter the INS treaty at this point\nNo more in six months Gordon Chang the Daily Beast I'm John bachelor\nSeven days a week I

sixteen our transit completed Monday This past week\nThis is an illustration of the ongoing dispute between the P L A navy and the LA army and B L A air force\nAs to its ability to project power into the south China Sea and to dominate\nEast Asia coastline and the western Pacific my colleague cause Gordon Chang of the Daily Beast joins Gordon these demonstrations by the U.S navy and the\nConduct of the pie LA navy in particular I'm thinking of the Decatur incidents some weeks past when there was a dangerous maneuver by the Chinese captain it did not happen this time are these connected or disconnected from the trade dispute with the United states\nOr John I think they're disconnected in the sense that um we've had of the trade dispute with China for very long time uh and only now is coming to a head but also um as the navy statement indicated you know\nAnd we do this not only in Asia but around the world to make sure that the global commons remains open the problem I guess in the sense is that we have a number of issues with China that are are sort of coming to a head at the same time and of course one of them as trade and the other is a China's trying to close off the global commons\nI remind you all that we have frequent elections and we're coming to one here in the midterms China does not have elections that is part of the difficulty of reading the Chinese intentions it's non transparent it's a dictatorship\nAnd completely in the control of one man one that the president for life Xi Jinping\nThe other part of this episode in the Taiwan Strait is how Taiwan regards

we're looking at China China is in conflict\nWith the Trump Administration with our European allies the conflict has to do with the Chinese business plan which is piracy and China has not at this point acknowledged that it has another way piracy or else does the Chinese position well you cannot lie to your own data\nAnd I'm looking at an article published recently by Jeffrey Snyder all ... investment partners and every child I'm looking at China GDP China dollar correlations China China nominal GDP China industrial production\nChina or retail sales China fixed asset investment\nIt that it's that chart that only goes down\nDown now either this is a recession or China doesn't have recessions it has retreats I don't know what the polite word as we go to Charles or tell of Sunday's with our tell\nHe's also an investment counselor Charles the question Gordon I have for you and your crystal ball where is China in six to nine months because that's the projection our markets like that's what the stock market reflects does China have in our flag to these declines good evening to\nYou both ah thanks so much I think not unfortunately I think if you look in excellent dated it's produced by you and the tea\nOr just investment bubble ever created in history\nAnd then on top of which there was a lot of leverage nobody really knows how much that there is on the Chinese economy when you cut through it and the demand inside the country hasn't gotten to the place yet worth support all this test so I think there's only one painful way through this and that is death destruction Gordon\nCharles or you know the number of countries have tried to manage their way out of crises tried to outgrow um problems and and China certainly falls into that category and it seems as the article that John referred to in the beginning of the segment\nEssentially um you don't have very much upside potential for China really what it is is at best a straight line flat line gross ... ... it just seems to me that it would have been much better for them to accept some medicine and have a crisis and then get over why aren't they doing that\nWell I I don't think that China really has that the long a period of a experimentation in history that we have in the west village just having lived through the many booms and busts and we can trace our modern economy back to the mid Eighteen hundreds we've had many painful depressions we've learned from some of them\nThere's just too much productive capacity in China as soon as they can sell their products and services\nAnd dumped them around the world and places like the U. S. where that's not going to happen anymore so there's a simple way through this you have to cut your capacity you have to encourage people to consume more times your country and you've got a deal you've got to be forthcoming with how much debt you truly have and if it's too much to discuss the guy off the mark downs and\nHas to be a redo of the Chinese financial structure\nI garden I reading these charts I find I knew highlighted this to me China's retail sales don't look as bad as everything else does that make sense or they are they telling domestically\nI I don't think they are John Doe their numbers tell you that they are\nSeptember the same month a sales of automobiles sell a Levin point six percent\nUm vehicle sales were down the three months of all three months of the quarter and yet they're saying that the consumption is increase\nThat just doesn't make sense John especially when you start looking at the sales of other items which were also flat or down so I think that China has a real data problem in terms of what they're reporting to people but I think they've got to do that in a sense because if people really knew the truth\nThere wouldn't be panic if there'll be panic it would be the end of the economy so what they're doing is they're just trying to lie and basically get their way through a very difficult patch I don't think they can do at this time um and then we'll just have to say\nAll right they're buying the Brooklyn Bridge every thirty five minutes a child or what what is it what's in it for us does this indication of failure I mean it's a it's a big two thousand Eighteen we're looking at does this come our way we got defenses for their equity collapse\nWell I think fortunately yes we do I mean one very good thing that chairman Jay Powell to the Federal Reserve has managed to get interest rates up above three percent on the tenure\nWhich means that in awe of China collapsed or China\nDowndraft we have room to lower interest rates in cushion the blow compared to other economies I think we're all in much better position than any other large economy it'll hurt is trying to go through this painful\nProcess economically I fear that a distraction might be suggested by the leadership there that some military adventure or whatever to distract the population that messed it closes an order is certainly a very dangerous set of months here um but in the end I think the United states\nEven if the Republicans do not maintain control the house and Senate will survive the coming retrenchment far better than any other major country and and\nThat cures this there they they they they've missed price their economy can they take a hit I\nThink that they believe that they can't and that's the reason why they have been fighting the economy with too much cash you know as you talked about just a few seconds ago\nChina did not go through it's two thousand they everybody else did\nAnd eventually they got to go through that and right now we're in a pretty good position because as Charles points out our interest rates have gone up we have room to move them down again and we're very icing robust Korea and so um you know whether China goes up or down and you know we'll be able to get through this and we'll do very well\nEarlier today Charles Gordon and I were corresponding and there was a report in the Financial Times that businesses have borrowed up to one hundred percent against their stock\nOr that they they borrowed it they give it to the bank and they borrow against it but the stock market collapsed their assets have collapsed in the central government is looking to subsidize that collapsed as long as they can ... I Believe that that is not a sustainable model that Fannie Mae times a million correct that ... that does not work\nIt certainly does not work and we really do unfortunately throughout China and the Asian in parts of Asia\nPeople do like the gambling levers and do it with ... money is very dangerous [noise] um I Hope that our European banks which were also highly leveraged are not overly exposed to the China tried to best we're America effects I think we're pretty good shape\nBut in China collapse I think that it's like what your bank and other European banks have lent heavily into emerging markets and things in China [noise] wow are they in trouble\nAnd Gordon have you heard talk about had banks putting in defense is here so that we don't go through a weight as bad as the wave washes are way\nI Wish they did um but I don't think that they really are thinking in that direction John but you know clearly there is going to be some sort of adjustment in China probably will\nJust done

and a half emergency report showing all the proof histories will fall flags Democrats caught doing it\nMike I cannot express on listeners\nRadio station ... however you're listening every one must hit their whole email list with infowars dot com forced last show\nThey must go to enforce dot com they must get the archive of this last show want you to posted in a few hours and send it to everyone help stop the deep state false flag was meant to throw the election we know it it's so obvious when you know the history you know who the players are you see the pre programming and now it's it's happening as an exact script and I agree with you though\nThis is extreme desperation like you're a smart cookie what do you think\nAnd one of the former ah\nTells you folks that I Know you work closely with uh what are they thinking right now what are they saying\nMy my greatest concern right now this caravan that's headed for the U.S border I've I've wondered from day one what's the point of this caravan or the Democrats so stupid that they think that having a hordes of people are at the gates you know at the border of America would somehow help them win elections because I think the American people\nReject that the American people want to protect their border\nSo it it it it occurred to me this morning\nThat their plan maybe and again I pray for these people I pray for their safety I don't want to see any kind of violence happen\nAgain when you're texting me two days ago and you said you're going to pull a false flag on the camera man and and kill a bunch of them and ...\nThat's that's exactly right it's just it's just reinforce this morning but I I think that if they bomb if the global is the same people who are sending any bombs on CNN if they bombed the caravan or if they shoot up the caravan then and they have CNN cameras there just like they had to CNN camera in an elevator with Jeff Flake or they will have the cameras there they'll have the blood remember that\nNeed they need blood on camera I mean let's be honest that's what they look for that's what they plan and this is how they could pull it off and it saddens me so much to even\nHave to bring up that this this could be a possibility you know Alex I mean the whole reason why you want to warn people it it's not to get people afraid but rather to prevent these kinds of attacks\nAnd we do want to get afraid I'm One of the global is pull this off that's a big win not kind of scary with Daesh ladies and gentlemen they fun of the Arab Spring they funded everything these law blisters cold blooded they've been losing in every level and they're desperate\nAnd how obvious doesn't happen again when it's coming out the cirrhosis funding to carry managed in the news it's coming out on it and then and then now he can smell the bomb and his son is blaming Trump\nThat can be directing the this caravan into a kill zone\nAnd the kill zone could be it could be a them being shot from helicopters in a nighttime helicopter raid that can't get any nobody has any video footage so they just blame it on America or it could be a global is the plant a bomb inside the caravan who knows what it could be\nBut I think they're paying these people leading them into a trap so they can steal the mid term election they they don't care how many people they killed this is the sad thing\nIs global us they they'd just so desperately seek power they will commit violence they will commit terrorism they will blame innocent people they will murder innocent people\nWe've seen this throughout throughout American history how desperate they are for power they'll do anything and so we must spread the the alarm because the the bigger pushback that we have the more people stand up and say we know this was a false flag than\nThe greater the safety of all those people will be because maybe the global is will back off back off if they think it won't work so our voices right now can help save lives against these false like terrorists think about that\nI agree in fact when I update and and take videos from his live feed\nThe Clintons ... it it it goes to hire ... ...\nThe Clintons\nA then it goes to Obama\nUh then it goes to the former attorney general then it goes uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nThen it goes on down Chris Cuomo that supposedly sent a bomb and show all the little darling who'd been under attack Cuomo saying America was never that great America isn't great it's not going to be great all this anti American crap showing their global showing they're not Americans they hate Americans all of the people that are on the ropes\nAre getting the the bombs in the mail so they can move victims and what a ... son and now runs his empire say\nYou're rhetoric Trump hurt me stop your speech is bad you're hurting me when he finds anti for that little monster\nWell the the Democrats are of course experts in victim hood\nThis is what they teach young students in college today how to be a victim rather than how to be\nA someone who contribute to society or how how to think like a victim instead of thinking like a winner and this is why they hate Trump so much because Trump has a winter and his policies are winning policies and he's helping America when again the Democrats want to tear down America\nThey want to destroy the economy they want to destroy the free market system\nThey want to release prisoners and shut down the prisons\nAre destroyed any border protection and just literally invaded the country you know all this\nBut the thing is they are willing to bomb and murder and mayhem and people in order to accomplish their political goals is the very definition of domestic terrorism and we see it clearly we've seen it for months I mean maybe more than a year we've seen it but I think more and more of the American people\nSee it as well and I think that right now this early voting surge that we are seeing across America as being reported everywhere the early voting ... I think is more of a red wave surge\nOtherwise I'd gotten major studies ...\nIt's now hitting the panic button army vet lawyer Curt Flood work as a scam Shapiro says anyone suggesting why is the way you know it's always funny that I see\nStuff like Google Facebook Twitter and every once every where he's the one the never Trump or an albatross were all about\n\nBringing back one of the biggest in

is that they can staged an event and then they can by silencing you advance you won't be able to defend yourself against the false narrative that will be rolled out as a false narrative\nAlways saying you see the nationwide deal that Facebook force fed to older people as they took me off saying killing bully poor Native American there's these paid like races lady things wind through subhuman where monkeys my parents are brother and sister\nAnd then they added that out and have me yelling back at them I'm mad you in the criminal activity of Facebook\nHe tweets out there that are racist against white people there there are destroying\nWhy'd you grow up Asians are billing holes in the ground they are subhuman exterminate them and it's like\n... censorship of yeah of course is selective application of their rules that they really can't even defined basically it all comes down to they don't like Alex Jones and they want to cut you off but\nI think it's we're not they blame you for what's coming and then they want to use that to cement the silencing of conservative and pro America voices all across the\nCountry oh I totally agree 'cause I I'm not that important they picked me to build me up to me destroyed\nBecause they knew we were populist movement\nAnd then once people don't stand up for me when it happens that everyone loses everything\nI were to go to the rank and I want

said before and I keep forgetting we always get new listeners but but uh I made the comment as we've made before that corporate taxes hurt the poor the most\nAnd this person just wrote me just completely baffled by what do you mean those are the corporations I had to explain to them no or\nYou pay everything that a corporation is when you see it is financed by the consumer yes everything right or their their their profits are financed by you\nEverything's financed by by ... money to pay their taxes right the the taxes to corporate taxes are paid by you the consumer your the consumer pay for their expenses because if you if you if that's not the case they're gone right so a corporate tax is they dealt tax on the consumer you don't see it directly\nAnd therefore who does it hurt

restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do\nAnd this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can't get their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get that out and they could they could gain more seats\nInstead of losing seats and this was back then not right now we're talking about getting a message across to people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced we've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you're not part of that group\nThe the Republicans but more importantly the president\nRight now are capable together of getting real things done and they need to\nGet that message out there that there is just an and we continue to have to fight this all the time when we get people to call well you guys think that you can convince everybody\nThat we don't know ... that's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that look\nDe ... uh teachers politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that have called the show and I said you know I used to think this way and then I started ... you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realized I changed my mind completely ... people change their minds you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind though you're trying to get that that person in the middle\nAnd we were talking about specifically yesterday undecided it's

I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there that is the goal the goal is to win\nThe goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate you used a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that and that's what I Love when people right if you guys don't understand the frustration out there you're kidding me in terms of if you liked\nHe's it's always complete peace and quiet here yet right [laughter] that's what it is being a conservative radio talk show hosts for the last Thirty years yeah\nIt's really a calm [laughter] it's always a very high scenario it's like doing constant yoga all the time at a table in oh it's like putting on a beach\nSo like that just sitting there and say I I got friends in St Thomas sending their version island saint Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is day after day here as\nPure than and so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that anger out every day at the other side that you disagree but then you believe is unfair\nIn some cases evil\nNo that's not our goal look go after them on the issues go after them with with uh you know with everything you've got on the issues and spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric is doesn't need to be the ... the point is is that you feel like there's this limited window and that the ... the window is closing and it just might\nHere within two weeks and so the point being is that because we've been doing good so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean many of doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person can be communicating ... you can set the messages are\nAhead of time to automatically go out while you're sleeping you can you can communicate right now\nSome more of those economic wins and you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already what\nFrustrates me is understanding that the left uses the heat of heated rhetoric that they that they use\nThey do that out of desperation ... they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand that on you know the other side on on the the side that I'm most closely relate to\nThat it gets frustrating because they're all we just so angry and they're spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack back\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell and we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need it that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that they work\nWell well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party there former leader was in Nevada and the other night and we've gone over the years from that speech at the DNC in two thousand six or two thousand for\nA to him becoming president in two thousand eight on hope and change to just the other night and Nevada begging who vote ... almost big was it because it became ... if you think about it it's not even a political tactic\nWhat would you what I Would have expected to hear from you know the great or ... or ...\nThey're going to win but yeah ... okay thanks kept an obvious we already know that don't boo vote okay\nCan you can you can ... and ... you know and as we said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issue that's the difference look at you know we talked about how we don't like the political ideology on either side but I Do understand\nThat because of political ideology on on the left is based purely on personality and on the right it's not I still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I dollar tree we worship a candidate and it's still always bothered me but the fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas\nRight that are that are specific\nAnd work and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it but as you said you saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging the other day for what you saw was the shell of the Democrat Party which is the other night which is no ideas just imagery and simple it's yeah\nWell except for free stuff\nYeah yeah for every ... or they take six Ninety ...

Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline had that the powder that was sent along with the ... you know a along with the\nSuspicious package was harmless and and so the the point being is that that\nNarrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not pass\nFalse information now people are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible look at the time I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm that's what I told us an earth are saying the bomb was harmless but this is in our personal meaning not on the air\nAnd then realized oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence in Associated Press separate the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb now again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ...\nWhether they were active bombs that could have gone off and could have gone up and would have gone off and a ... you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever\nOr were they set to go off and what they've gone off or were they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point you would look at it and the questions that you would ask is an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm or they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent for a political statement would be the next question that you would ask right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we are when\nTalked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused that\nThis must stop but yet they create the maximum divisive this by blaming somebody for an incident where they don't add the fact they don't know\nWe have no idea that the motivation behind the the the uh the person or persons\nNobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against the advice of this and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on the left doing that it's like [laughter] we're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nYeah right well and like especially without knowing all the facts here\n\nYou know the trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces that we've got to it in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know the motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective work\nAnd I know sources of said they believe it's the same you know right people are worse than or group of people based on the material which again that that the number of the number of of\nAh devices that you sent out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm yeah\nIf you look at the nature of or how this was sent a the the packaging the if you look at the um the the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN\nOr it you know the multiple stamps it went through us ts bomb each of these by the way depending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know he doesn't open his own\nSecurity um but but of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service or actually has their own sorting that they do so the male doesn't doesn't it's not delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time and place but but the point being is that they have a a great deal of resources that the secret service has a great deal\nOf resources into in in finding out\nYou know and and putting together the puzzle there's a\nThere's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days\nThat they know it may be where the facility or facilities were\nAt these were sent from oh and I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now what did these rely bombs or not they know right having said that we haven't\nHeard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go winds and could have been triggered by\nAn eye out phone or whatever I that would be the next question why not write well because in in in ...

Ninety ... is Aaron hardly and I'm Jerry ... thanks so much for being here this morning [noise]\nUm we're happy that you made\nTwelve days yeah we're all those out there all day so I guess you could write\nA twelve days are away from uh the the mid term elections I went out and early voted yesterday uh went to the local community college was one of the early voting sites for me right it was pouring rain or just more money mhm\nSo I really just never been and never drove through this community college right or drove through what the signs were out front on them you know that that you you could tell me okay this is early voting the political signs all over the place\nAnd so I started driving around trying to find the building saying I've no idea what building that's going to be in but when I but I Will know it when I see it because I had a political science will be all over the place right right yeah and they were\nThe only thing is they\nDidn't have any parking if you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college ah yeah yeah which and I just thought to myself because ... that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a courthouse fright or were you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little farther couple of more miles\nAnd I was going to go there and I said that I Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been out of before so I had about a thousand foot walk through pouring rain\nBut when I uh got in there everybody friendly ... no matter what the ... is ... outside the anger the range that we see in the media every day\nEvery time I Walk into a polling place tell you how you doing everybody's laugh and joke in what's going on all you're doing and they had the the the new don't didn't have to actually sign\nYou know how you're supposed you sign you know that okay is this your ... you don't sign any more you sign on a tablet ignoring the tablet around you signed right on the tablet mhm you know with the little pencil where I could guess I could have signed with my finger I said this is new they said yet makes it real easy\nAh probably because there was nobody behind me in line uh just had to just general conversation\nYou know as I've been busy think the reins affecting that they said yeah the rains have backed into today 'cause it's been pretty crowded and then just you know one right up there were three or four machines that were open and went in and voted and it was done\nThat's right that's right we're voting yet that they came in and it was right middle of the campus so I mean it was ... ... ... students are walking right by you couldn't miss the fact that this was the place to vote\nMhm right yeah\nSo but it was a relatively relatively easy our last a\nNational election in our state to vote straight ticket unless the court overturns that\nYes\nYou do you're right as of September first of twenty twenty or there will be no the because of the law was passed by a by our state no straight ticket voting after September ... first twenty twenty which includes of course the twenty twenty election\nAnd the reasoning behind that [noise] um because we want to we want to hide something\nIs the fact that there are busy doing their jobs they've got their jobs they've got their families\nAnd our job any of them were heading right now right and and and and our job is the fact that we have\nWe have time to pay attention to everything so we can articulate what's going on to them so in a in a condensed sense they can get an idea of what's going on every single day and what's going on in the issues in a different form that they get from anything else and and I would say that's about it now\nAnd I'm so glad that I can do that because I think that's a great thing to be able to do well that makes me feel useful [laughter] yeah exactly I\nMean that's that's what we are I mean the the the uh think of it as a concierge service of

they're they're probably looking at this going okay as we go and get what are you know again twelve days out from the mid term they need to build some momentum so they need to I guess return uh some

do you support we know what you don't want what do you want [noise]\nHe said again I have argued elsewhere the party should have been raised an immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat any form a democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we have said that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this is a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president\nTo back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that but you can't we have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last\nYou can look at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a was a a a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm which was the amnesty that was two thousand and five just if they they made the decisions a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years the Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do what with their plan be\nThinking about this and that by the way that the Republican failure\nMhm because of Republican should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it shouldn't be the Democrats\n... ... it should be as we said you make the accusation Democrats won open borders and when they cry you are a line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done issue them the challenge\nAnd that's what Doug was shown as saying here that again they haven't had to answer\nThey haven't had to they don't ... they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice you don't get rid of border enforcement in this country\nThat's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats one border security they may have compassion for people that are here\n\nWant to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we have brought it to your attention\nThe demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country are blacks and Hispanics ... when you look at the polling as to the number of when you go\nMinorities in this country who want\nThe lowest level of illegal\nImmigration that even Trump has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat mhm\nNo the American people stand with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically but the other side of it is is that\nThe Democrats have not been forced to choose say what they want at all you do with the president wants\nYou know what the Republicans won and and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd you have to you have to force them in back them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the care of and saying well poll well we're going to pull aid from you mhm but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people from\nYep but you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something yes by the way he's also we when we talked about the imagery you know the the\nCome here to become citizens or is it just to work and then\nYou know go back and then we have had that discussion\nAs to well what do we want from people who come over here as citizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can you have a discussion when only one side\nHas said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't go after they're part of the party than endorses open borders and just keep quiet on it well silence is your consent yes\nSilences your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states so why are you preaching that\nNow That's Douglas shown who looks like to me as the longtime Democrat who are about to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage or isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person votes Democrat and they want border control sure in fact the constituency the votes most Democrat most the time\nActually to get out of illegal immigration and illegal immigration is a demographic that once the least legal immigration into this country look\nYou have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats who have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice\nProtest they they're saying it but they're not forced to stay the words open borders they should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're promoting\nAnd if they're not where's the pushback\nAnd I mean the ... from the party that is actually saying that in promoting it is Chuck Schumer promoting\nThat Nancy Pelosi or they promoting that\nMay be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe clear [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats but where's the party saying this is what\nWe want\nBecause that's the official political battle how can we have ... how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would want what they want right except for those in the party that promote open borders\nThe elimination advice they won't even have the debate why right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans we Republicans have a Thirteen Years the pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that in that role of doing so right they have another opportunity to do it right now with the caravan coming will be is the question eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nReally buck for red are ready

it's where they get into the two people talking and this is her campaign at by the way this is not\nSome pack running the ad some other outside group\nThis is her commercial\nAnd they say well you know she's not like those crazy Democrat right so for a Democrat to actually put that in a senator mhm put that in an ad is just\nUnbelievable and we'll have that coming up\nAre probably the bottom of the hour plus your calls and comments if you'd like to get in line soap and eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\n\n\n\nTo help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad\nIt was terrorists twice\nHere's the interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person on the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government dar\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the present\nStage it even if you're not a farmer um ... yeah right now you know like you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they were in very vocal about it if you're in that state even if you're not a former ah you know again depending on the impacts they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point of\nWhich you know we'll see if if that point works or if any of this works er here within two weeks\n[laughter] it's\nA I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was\nI'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her you heard her say she approved this message this is her campaign that she's not saying\nThe people that are protesters\nShe's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks they used to the mainstream high ranking members of the party\nThat she's referring to here in terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree you know ... or you know with my my party in it knows approach or are you writing again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation\nThe term as you brought up and so rightly it was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and then she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put in to that ad right\nWhere the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they're looking to sway one way and it's [noise] it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric has what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats\nRight yeah because I think what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that they're there they're looking at holy because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats my not part of the crazy Democrats ... but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not\nA you know not radical ... extreme cause extreme as something is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right\nAh but this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing is that it doesn't matter that you're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter that\nYou're not a ... a lizard with Warren or just you know a pick a number of them that are in the Senate\nOr that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times it because their actions and\nIn terms of the race right they will uh taint the races and other states but especially of course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's or maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest\nAccording to the polls right now the latest polls we so that's the effect is that come out one Harris or or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them they whatever they do is going to affect those races\nThose other races and\nThose people in the ... the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with\nAt some point a Kamala Harris or you know and it's tied with as young crazy Democrats she'd as she just did as ... [laughter] and which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote up and where does she go on this well she made a choice to go\nBecause she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but it's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats\nThan it doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats whip that no vote she can dome that behavioral letting we saw it during the cop Kavanaugh process and and that's\nWhy I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been\nWe're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy but talking about the undecided independents right you're undecided independent\nWho is looked at the cabinet thing instead they're crazy I mean they're they're really crazy and I can't vote for her\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the ... coming back that ad may be received by these people just say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats what you're willing to call your entire party crazy\nThat you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right but you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the way that we will go you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office\nAnd you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with that vote on Kavanaugh that was also condoning their behavior or not you know all of that that's you know that's the evidence to back up their opinion yup coming to that conclusion yes\nHaven't I'll just prove that eight six six Ninety right I\nWas very much and

greatest audio part of the day coming up following the by the hour yeah we do with whether it's ... it's a political ad that if you haven't heard if you want to hear Claire McCaskill's add the radio ad that she started running the misery ...\nThe Democrats and the Democrats calling\nWelcome you're on the Radio Welcome to the show high Albert\nHey good morning Eric uh Gary first time caller I was calling to let you know that the FBI is doing a very thorough investigation air and so it won't become a ... a political issue they'll let us know till after the November election\n[laughter] we're real or not [laughter] yeah [laughter] and I said good oversight committee and get your message that won't happen so [laughter] yeah we'll have to declassify it uh yeah well they now have you know that the the things that I ... and and yeah thanks that's because\nWe we saw what you're going to say we we knew where you were ... we were going with it a ... it's a it is fascinating though because it is something look it isn't that the number one question that you would want to ask is a reporter mhm that report them I'm sure they're gonna have a press conference yesterday some part is going to ask 'cause the was art where the bombs libre\nNot right where they you know we're bored could they have been a detonated by opening the package because the concern is not just a you know about you know the message being sent or the intent of the person or persons responsible\nBut also about the threat that it's still or might still be out there in in the system because let's say that they were going or are going through stages where they're reaching out to these individuals' first and then there are others on their list\nWell the concern would be by you know the the package handlers and people that might even be walking on a ... up to a porch\nAnd and they see something worth these devices ready to go off could they have been detonated a rapidly either remotely or by opening a package I think that's information that needs to be made\nIf possible [noise] ah\nJust we got to bring this up quickly I I haven't checked the overnight markets you know I haven't I haven't checked was six hundred down down yesterday and the the doubt as some ... down I think was it four point four percent yesterday and yeah yeah uh the\nUh the Dow down over six hundred and and a lot of that had to do with earnings and and we're hearing more and more ah companies come out and say that their earnings are suffering as a result of what's going on uh the terrorists in retaliatory tariffs by trade partners is having an impact on on business so out overnight\nAs it is up and which I which you might expect mhm uh all the Asian markets are down one percent three the three percent right the Japanese market down three percent a Shanghai up a little bit ... about ... percent yeah uh Europe a mixture of over in Europe ... so we'll see\nWhether it's just a correction whether there's really worry\nWe know there is in the housing market and we know for example about you know foreign coming down and and saying look thanks for all that thanks for all the help with the tax cuts but the tariffs are killing us\nAnd and it's something like what happened yesterday in the news playing out makes a lotta people nervous and and of course than the markets because one possibility up to consider is that it was a foreign enemy or that was that was involved are responsible\nFor these suspicious packages and and the the concern that it might not be over or something else might happen we it was a lot of uncertainty yesterday so some of that is built in to that drop I mean you often see that if there is something that that is happening\nOr as as big of a news story as as you saw yesterday or that does make the the market's very nervous\nSo uh we'll see where it well and that's something that was you know was was brought up a yesterday by you know some of the experts say look you know there's there's three things that could be it could be somebody and they ride in could be somebody and they left it could also be a foreign entity right yeah\nYeah who have decided to do it again which that's that's why we find it surprising that are still late into this because it's been three days ...\nA bomb initially that nobody has stated whether these were active lie bombs that would have gone off right if the if somebody would have touched it in a different way right apparently they were handled and then go off\nWell because I Would think that if there was a threat of these devices going off whether they could be set off a remotely or by the handling the package itself\nThat we would see that warning come out by authorities would we not yeah because if we learned that that was the case and they didn't warn the public\nAnd there are still a possibility of such devices being in the mail system or being out there in in the public and it still being a threat to the public beyond that the intended recipient recipients over the past few days\nThat they would want to get that message out and and we would be hearing that I Would think that and if we hear that that you know that they were armed in and they didn't say it will someone's going to have to answer them for on attracts usual forecast\nHeavy showers in southern Texas will continue to slowly move

[noise]\n[noise]\n\nOr you know we said this when when the way before that we've had this one the Republicans passed the health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but as used against you in in the mid term elections and it has been\nSo you've got bad and you've got the terrorists that you believe you mentioned at the white in there because you believe that there's a significant number of people who might be attractive to that anti terror of message that Trump has been so louder mhm\nWhy are you throwing in and wasting any valuable time in a commercial about when he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym anybody knows that when you're an attorney general here ... you don't work hourly\nYou know you're you're you're you're really you're on your ever on the work you're ... right so if you're sitting there and say oh okay I'm going wrong or the stop by and get a bottle of wine or something like that or I go to the gym during the day because that's a lot of people to go to the during the day when\nThat time to go or you know but but that's it they didn't ... there was no real focus honestly they would have been better to leave that out completely and joke goes straight onto the crazy Democrat well maybe they maybe they shouldn't mentioned the crazy\nDemocrat twice and by the way I was just thinking the law and order ... uh uh you know didn't didn't\nJack ran for ... he was he became ... now did did the opposition ever used the fact that they they bring the wrong in their office [laughter]\nWe've always talked to weight loss named them on TV [laughter] they drank all dive after every case win or lose fighter and they're drinking at the end of the day and they're often not wine like I ... it was hard liquor they're always drinking [laughter] we thought\nAnd so when I heard that I went to come on come on their\nTheir prosecutors they all drink either [laughter] well ... when we and getting back to the ad and you said there certainly are on the show that because we focused and I'm using the term crazy Democrat instead of using the term\nExtremists Democrat yes for leadership of the Democrat right\nRight and there's the verbiage is clearly some kind of response that they got verbatim they were hearing that repeatedly that phrase crazy Democrats by people in their cola the in their internal were showing that this was a they you know this was a way a hot button\nThat they could connect to some of those undecideds right now those independents who were leaning right at that moment and the concern they had was the crazy Democrats the ... that that's why that was used it was used\nAnd directly came from a likely from that that kind of call out research response that you get the because there's there's no other way there's no other reason\nTo put that in and that that becomes what the Hail Mary in this really neck and neck dead heat race in Missouri it is I mean it out of all of them I think it's probably a if it's not the closest it's pretty ... pretty close to the closest Senate race right now are so\nRight that her independence that are winning right might otherwise vote for McCaskill the problem in that is her her actions as specifically with with capital\nBecause in siding with her party in Kavanaugh you were condoning that kind of behavior right and you can come out and say no I just wasn't sure and I need to be sure when we see that doesn't sorry perception is reality especially\nIn in in this kind of situation that is that it's going to and could well that issue this side and many of these races the uh the outcome of the the Kavanaugh situation\nAnd and when you look at the polling there in in Missouri to begin with the uh if you look at these September of polling a you know as the CNN a McCaskill was up by by by three ... with a with likely voters and you get to the Fox news poll which was up until I was nine twenty nine to tend to and it was a tie\nAnd then you know through that whole time the cabin all thing in ... Missouri scout a huge sample of a over twelve hundred likely voters\nAnd holy up one still margin of error is to point seven right uh and still nobody has said the fifty percent mark so there's still a ton of undecided\nThere the using that term crazy Democrats a Democrat using that in an ad by the way apparently ticked off other Democrats in Missouri I was reading an article on that earlier up but using that term means that the undecideds are talking about it the undecided that's part of their mindset\nYou know the Democrats are crazy these are crazy Democrats now that had to come directly from cabinet yeah because for that to be to do it for that to go to the level of uh from fringe to extremists too I just read my leadership to Craig\nPortion of undecided independents in Missouri that she's trying to get aboard I'm not part of the Democrats I'm not part of the crazy Democrats I I I I think for myself I'll go to the middle I Will compromise which means muck you'll compromise with Republicans and\nYeah\nYou know it if they ... this is why you have this race that you have here it's not because her opponent is is is this big great strong opponent it's because there's weakness across the board and [laughter] it is bipartisan week in nature I mean she's getting\nShe's get of course they're they're Republicans in that state that would never vote for a McCaskill which you know that that that's a given\nBut those people in the middle and this is what we've been talking about for a long long time those are the ones that may vote one way or the other insurance for one party or the other\nAnd they're the ones you have to convince\nThey're the ones that get you over the top and right now she has too many weaknesses that that are that really don't serve her well with either side and I think that comes directly or certainly her vote on Kavanaugh was an indication of\nThat weakness if if it didn't help create it well you know there's it's it's one thing you know you you can uh the the uh\nThe ah the accusations against Donald Trump being crazy being not you know everything that you remember the whole mental health things that has sort of disappeared hasn't it now that he's mentally ill and all that but you know you can look at the end you say okay that's that's an attack that's always thrown at at one person the president always get to that\nBut we're talking about a political party as a whole\nWe've been talking about that the Democrats from twenty sixteen where they said look we've got to go and figure out what the people the heartland is are going and we said ...\nCompassion for everybody but if you think you're a ... if you think you're a man and you're a woman doesn't make you a man and it doesn't make a man and shouldn't make you want man legally and you shouldn't as a man be able to compete against a woman ... the vast majority of Americans believe that\nThe trans racial thing that they started adopting President Obama before he left office talking about the fact that he's come to know that race is a social construct no it's not right and and so we talked about that craziness well it's gotten to the point\nIf it's no longer the Democrats in order for Claire McCaskill of put that in the concern is no longer the Democrats aren't relating to the average person it's at the average person is now the Democrats as crazy ... and the cabinet thing I Believe is what put them over the top yeah\nAnd and and that behavior by the way as we pointed out not from protesters from from the high ranking officials and and and members of the party on those committees Claire McCaskill's now as a Democrat believe she's fighting against the crazy Democrats ... eight six six Ninety ride I\nWhat's the difference between standard number two

resources are expense in this effort\nIn these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nWe have seen one thing that is consistent in crime\nOnce again the good old adage for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction\nThese bombs one to predominantly people on the left of the trial that means we're going to see some bomb somewhere\nAt people's houses or to the rise of the trial that is the natural ebb and flow of the human animal and that is why it's very important from the president to come out very strongly on this issue because once again\nIf somebody wants to do it to the Democrats\nThan somebody wants to do it to the Republicans somebody else wants to do it to the independence\nSomebody wants to do it the Californians and somebody wants to do it to New Yorkers\n\nThe saddest part about this and this is what I say that probably makes me sad or that\nSay that this story that this chapter of this very very intriguing yet disgusting book ends\nIs that somebody gets killed now who would be yes yeah first of all most of the people who receive these bombs yesterday are now toothless dogs let's face it\nHillary Clinton will never run for president and again forget about it okay Bill Clinton's already

normal American citizen living with his family\nAnd there's some crazy person who's out there saying that really looks like fun I like the jump on that bandwagon just like any time\nThat you see the people sitting in the movies or watching Freddie Krueger over you know that there may be five million people seeing them\n\nBut we begin fun like get tried that for myself\nAnd maybe they'll be more

but I heard the movie it was good and I heard it was about sports so I went to see it well those days you gotten a little dressed up to go to the movies\nAnd a good pair of shoes and I went to the Bruins theater and I bought my popcorn and my soda\nAnd I sat down and I've watched the film that I realized was unique it was well written it was well acted it was dramatic was involving sports it was called rocky I didn't know was going to become a franchise\nAnd I'm forty two years later they'd still be making rocky movies or something like them\nWell in that movie that night I learned something I heard it before but I had never witnessed it before and that is that violence breeds violence\nA couple of years ago there was just saying that the kids used to say a lot and that was haters hate and I thought that's pretty dumb and then I thought about it I said it's true people who liked to have everything they just paid everything just arbitrarily\nDon't give it any thought you just say oh that hamburger place I hate that place\nAnd this American that's your prerogative\nYou have the right in this country of all those an alien ... rights that we have as Americans you have the right to be an complete total idiots\nIf you really believe something that's that tried that simple haters ate it sounds like the bad the lyrics to her song doesn't it well in the middle of this movie rocky two men got other squared\nCircle\nParticipate and what they call the\nThey're enjoying my artificial buttered colored flavoring popcorn and my soda and all of a sudden there's kind of a rumbling and the disruption and all of a sudden the screen goes to black and I turned around and three rows behind me\nTwo guys in suits that are worth more than my car\nAre screaming at each other their wives are holding onto their one arms\nAnd one guy climbs over one row of seats end of the other row of seats and a fist fight breaks out and the next thing you know\nThere's five or six guys who are it's very obvious have never been a real fight and their life are playing illegal their arms kicking their feet and just\nKnocking the garbage out of each other\nAnd the ushers rushed it and they separated these guys and the police came in about Fifteen minutes later we got to see the end of this movie rocky\nAnd I learned that day that violence breeds violence a couple of years later I was at Madison Square garden\nWatching wrestling match and which one of the participants was a Russian man\nThey wanted up his flying and threw it in the center of the ring and a fight broke out really crowd about two seats away from where Darrell strawberry who was a very popular individual at the time was sitting\nAnd or\nManager of the New York Yankees loop Panetta ... amazing I think it

production companies you just heard I'll bring you the latest [noise]\nNumber one that\nWas just a week ago that the president was exhausting the fact that Congress men have body slammed the reporter well if you glorify violence in your speech is\nPeople are going to hear that we don't know who delivered the bombs but odds are there was someone who is hurt the president's message and acted on it so he bears responsibility for this\nYou know I it David Axelrod and he's the one I count on on the left to also be a level\nLittle surprise me with this because do you blame the President Obama for the shooting in South Carolina where the shooting at Sandy Hook he was president at the time you might see his rhetoric was different but it happened during his tenure this is the president's style you think that he's pro shooting that people might interpreted that\nThe seeds or some unrest is a oh during when he was\nThat said that gets you nine a package bombs [noise]\nA series of pipe bomb

started it off it hit his mailbox outside his house didn't hit then explodes none of them have exploded where do they look like go according to the X rays and people have spoken about this to the AP to PVC pipe covered with black tape\nI don't think the president's responsible for that but what I Love to see a reset between the media and the president after the midterms yeah before that\nI'm not too sure to work after the first one didn't\nBut maybe the president after getting his feet underneath them for the last two years\nAfter getting the Mueller investigation over a that lasted two years

Tuesday I'll be all and Martha it's gonna be a crazy couple of weeks but have not been able to talk about history and uh about the history book for obvious reasons\nUh we got a series of package bombs nine in total now I Can't even say bomb I Would say a would be bombed devices and I said devices because it's not been proven that any of these packages would've blown up their looks like there's powder on the inside shards of glass on the inside on the outside it looks like a bomb\nBut for the most part there is no proof that it'll blow up but it almost says the same effect thankfully it didn't because a lot of innocent people would have been hurt and a lot of prominent people would have been hurt if it did\nHowever but it's not going to hurt the president or the former President Bill Clinton or Barack Obama because they've been screened for George Soros he's smart enough to leave his mailbox outside as compact\nSo that got him there forward in Delaware and never got to Joe Biden but two packages were intended in Los Angeles it was intended for Maxine Waters and in Washington DC in Florida down in Miami southern Florida that was intended older return addresses were for Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nIn Washington Eric Holder the former attorney general has been a big critic of the president might be running against him\nHe also was targeted so the people that blocks\nPrinting or they say it's the same printing that's on the label and then the return address his old debris was Mitchell jumper and his name is not spell correctly they also have\nA mocking sticker on it it mocks ISIS one device or at least one has a parity ISIS flag and as the phrasing praising get her done\nAnd that is obviously making a fun or get her done is uh the cable guy yeah we're still waiting so the device looks the same\nUh the new a New Yorker NYPD sources uh there was no they could not have blown up according to the CNN package\nBecause there was no blasting cap there was nothing to ignite it that according to even go man is the fact that nothing blow up shows that it's an amateur thing or they were pro who want to just send the message I got a bomb it got close to you it was intended for you intended to Iraq your world\nSo those are the things that we're going to go over the ISIS flag on it a lot of people saw it and saw Arabic riding on the\nUh so Arabic riding on the battery and I have not seen that any other place on a side note tomorrow we hope to have George Papadopoulos in Studio\nI had lunch with them on Tuesday he is going to get a chance to testify behind

tomorrow he has a story to tell they could blow the lid off the entire thing and leave it takes out of it but in terms of what my callers are saying\nA lot of concern a lot of pointing out that nothing was detonated and there's a lot of people who feel as though when it's all said and done there's some type of a plot\nOr on the left to make Donald Trump looked like the bad guys who we start talking about Donald Trump's rhetoric and not about the caravan\nAnd not about cabinet Tom and not about the economy so those are something we took about twenty five calls already anticipating coming out with you and Sandra and that's just the pulse of the people but since I've been on and since you've been on as you know we found out about two new packages\nOf both intended for Joe Biden I have yet to talk to anybody and like you I talked to Ron Cosco who have said that these are our bombs\nBut it just worries me then again if they were the most innocent like postal workers in couriers would have been in the line of fire it reminds me of the anthrax situation\nYeah very much so they mentioned Papadopoulos seems the number one suspect right originally he was sentenced to fourteen days in jail has served a day at ... as he addressed that yet oh yeah and what what what does that mean letters that say what is what is that indicated about the investigation\nThink it says everything about the investigation I think it says a lot when with congressman Jordan would Mark Meadows what Devin Nunes has has been doing it pursuing with ... been talking about\nThis twenty eight year old was really on ... was targeted possibly by a previous or a previous administration because of his links to Israel he was helping Israel with newly discovered oil and setting it up with Greece they did not like that\nThe word is there might be another Pfizer warrant and it was on him and ... yeah and they continue to look\nWe'll start coming up to them you need to talk to them wanting to have a\nFew rain finds himself in the middle of all this I'm really looking for the interview tomorrow quickly on your book it's in paperback what more do we learn Jackson\n... since we talked last time Andrew Jackson's ... has been to file for the first time since his death prior to the civil war he is now in the line of fire or what I tried to do is remove Donald Trump who's a fan of Andrew Jackson and see what past presidents thought of him because we do in this thing this war on history\nSo I have a look at what Reagan said Teddy Roosevelt said FDR said with Truman said no to Abraham Lincoln said\nAbout the impact of Jackson that battlefield when was special that made them those famous man in America it let them to become a two term president why why are we attacking him now why we let him off the twenty why we booting horrible phrase is on his tomb those are the things I attack in the paper back this time crap\nWill check it out thank you Brian nice seeing served back to the radio you go\nYou got to walk on any I Can't wait Sandra ... I'll tell you can ...\nThank you [noise] All right one eight six six eight seven six six nine that's mostly the calls I'm getting I mean I just had to be honest most of the cause believe this whole thing is is set up there maybe ... somebody else's behind it but there's no substance there's no proof\nUntil we find the perpetrator until we find a the person who would try to terrorize the nine people\nI Can't go ahead and say this is some plot either way but I Would hope the one thing that would come out of it\nIs it everyone tones that down if Steve ... bleeding to death on second base on

the Democratic party of they're not indicative of the Republican Party um they are crazy\nLunatics and I don't care what side of the political spectrum somebody sits on you have to grab them you have to hunt them down\nAnd you have to put them in jail for ... for a long time and that's what my father intends to do\nWell said and I and I have no doubt he he will do that um let's talk about the midterms hum wow it's I'm I'm surprised at how close some of these races are but um this is this is an important this is an important midterm election probably more so than any in recent political history\nIt is the most important I mean America is winning and taught in you know that and we know that and you know our economy is growing the fastest as ever grown is going by you know growing by four point two percent meaning GDP Growth is four point two percent with the lowest unemployment in the history of our nation we have wage growth for the first time he's sixteen years\nThe largest tax cuts in the history of our nation I mean I can go on and on non manufacturing is coming back the stock market's doing incredibly well up for a one case up through the roof and then\nWe could go on and on and on and they look small businesses in this country so they had never gets talked about but small businesses are used to be paying thirty nine percent in taxes now they're paying Twenty one percent\nThey are and you know I mean there are seven point two million job openings that exist in the u._s. ah right now I'm sort of the reasons we have three point seven percent unemployment but\nI mean our country is is winning on every front we're no longer getting ripped off to China and Mexico you know the new NAFTA deals are really incredible for our country and you know and that's before you talk about all the things that he's doing to combat the opioid crisis in reformed the prison system and take on the price of prescription drugs that have gone absolutely through the roof and\nYou know our country is doing amazing it's the envy of the entire world and you know the Democrats do stand for anything and I say this all the time I mean they don't they have no message have new leadership um they want to double everybody's taxes which would you know put our economy in a recession\nOr they want to attack law enforcement and they want to resist and obstruct everything that my father wants to do and\nUm I think it's a reason that we're going to do very very well but people have to get out there and they have to vote I mean\nAnd and and you know taught I hear from people all the time for my guys Trump guys out not on the ballot so I'm not going to go out and vote and I do please no matter what you do you can't think that way I mean you not voting in in these midterm elections is effectively voting against Trump I mean people have to get out there and\nIf the army of Trump gets out um and they go vote 'em we're going to do incredibly incredibly well in the midterms but people cannot be complacent they have to get out there and vote\nAnd and you know again looking at what's happening with you know below the border there with that to this invasion force that's coming up from from Honduras\nAgain the the president delivered he said you know what if push comes to shove Wilson the military down and of course we do a little while ago a word came down to the president's sending hundreds of troops down to the border\nI'm Eric I think just people are genuinely and pleasantly surprised that we finally have a president who not only promises but delivers all those promises\nTo our country we have to protect our our nation and our way of life right you have reporters in there and there is you know\nThere's tons of people with MS Thirteen tattoos um you know within the caravan there's criminals in there and ... you know you ... you have some bad pi I'm sure you have some really great people you also have some really bad people um from what all these reports all these media reports are saying\nYou can't just let those individuals walk into this country illegally I mean you ... it can't it can't happen my father's been screaming about the law for the last three years\nDemocrats have done everything they can to try and stop we're not going to give you any funding we're not going to allow I mean they've they've put up a roadblock after roadblock after roadblock which is why people have to get out and they have to vote we need to hold the house ah we need to hold\nThe Senate and in fact we need to pick up seats in the Senate um and then it's a lot easier to do some of the things that he wants to do but he's been screaming about this a screaming about this and then all of a sudden three years later when things could have been done to prevent this from happening if the Democrats would have actually cooperated\nHere we are in a situation where you have tens of thousands of people marching on our country and it becomes much harder to stop the now it'll cost is much more to stop them now and it's just a shame that\nThe Democrats have never had the foresight or the willingness or they'll want or the desire for a whole host of reasons\nTo actually fix this problem and that's systematic problem that we have in Washington DC with with the swamp and it it's it's it's horrible this problem could have been fixed very easily a long time ago and we would not be in the position that we're in now but because of\nYou know feckless were you know Democrats you know it it it hasn't happened and it's um it it's a very sad thing\nWe're going to

I'm not saying that's what you do I'm just saying that something like that that is\nThat that that is in the line with the limitations that you guys have because if we can add a thousand dollars a month only your world it would change your life\nWouldn't it\nBe dramatic and held his mom mom Seventy nine\nAnd how much of this thirty four forty two comes from her\nEleven forty than yeah she passes away you don't get a real problem correct\nSo we've got to solve some of the income issue one way or another here um and how much is your house payment\nThey work for Seventy eight I think\nThat's kind of that's your that's just due to taxes and insurance going\nUp probably right now\nWe only want to go and yeah it sure would be good when you know so\nI think more than anything the the the magic wand here is some kind of an idea\nFor you to create some income and I don't know what that is but I Want the three of you to sit around and talk about what you could do a you're obviously not going to do anything this physical I get that you got some serious limitations I understand that\nAnd I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help you uh but it man a thousand dollars a month\nWould change your whole life thousand dollars a month for a year and you pay that house off\nAnd that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem and right now you'd be in a serious problem two thousand dollars a month and come change\nYou feel like you were rich lucky we're multi millionaires or something it would change your life that much and so in is that possible yes that is possible it's very possible\nBut you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or whatever and again it done I don't want to put a bunch of strain on you physically but um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation where the over the phone so you could have an intelligent conversation with somebody on the phone sell them jumping\nRight and that that's possible thing you can do\nUm the you know and it doesn't cause you to work forty\nHours a week necessarily but if you could do anything that creates a thousand two thousand dollars a month that would change your world and that's that's really what I Would work on rather than try to solve the forty seven dollar problem that you've got what that is a symptomatic of the fact that you're struggling with income and legitimately ... your ...\nThis idea that your husband than you could do together um and just get them to get the needle to move a little bit here man it would change everything for you and thank you for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Benjamin is in Oklahoma

money\nIt's a free call a triple eight eight to five five to two Stephanie is starting all this hour Rochester, Minnesota Hi Stephanie how are you\n\nTo um but we also have an eight month old daughter out and so we're not quite to the college saving yet\nUh but we do have grandparents that instead of buying a Christmas gift their birthday presents what like to uh put away for her college savings and I'm just wondering what's the best way for them to go about that\nUm I Would go ahead and open the child and E S say an educational savings account how much money are they talking about that they want to put in that\nI haven't really decided but growing up I was giving savings bonds and they don't really want to do that I could I don't know if they're thinking like a hundred dollars or you know each birthday and H Christmas I'm not sure okay\nAll right well you can open some mutual funds as little as two hundred and fifty dollars others five hundred no there's a thousand minimum to get them open okay you're going to open an educational savings account in a mutual fund an e as say\nIt requires because the child is a minor that someone be in charge of the it can't be the custodian that would be you\nOkay and then your mom and dad can or his mom and dad can add to the child's educational savings account the\nOnly limit is you cannot put a total between all of view of more than two thousand dollars a year into that account OK\nYou can and a five twenty nine but more than that but you know we're not talking about that being a problem we're looking at the minimum and you just got to get some money scrape together to do a lump sum to start\nThe mutual fund you know so maybe two or three people put some money to get maybe you just put it in a savings account to get up to five hundred and then you open the say\nGreat that there's a lot of how things you can't just check in with your smart vest or pro when they can help you get that done\nHow can I don't I'm just starting your program and I I'm not sure how to do it when there is no money left she said at the end of the ... at the beginning of the month or any of the month and I was homeless for about a week and then had to live in a hotel\nFor about a week until I found a place to live and that and I'm just this is the first month that I was able to pretty much pay all the bills and fall and and start to get back on my feet a bit\nAnd I'm Glad you're turning around so you guys were having a career problem or something you\nKnow I've been a teacher for eleven years and I love what I Do um even though I only make forty two thousand and\nYet it already channels and doesn't cause you to be homeless out during the homeless making forty to groom\nAnd put it into that account because I might not reached a thirty six thousand just cash flowing get something my salary mhm\nOne of the penalties for growing ... shoot I Do that one of the penalties for withdrawing I don't read for what ...\nYeah it's about fifty per se or ... percent on taxes are but I I really don't need the entire\nEmergency fund I currently have thirty thousand a month to keep taking Fifteen thousand input into that I can rebuild my return my emergency found in about three months if you don't need it why would you rebuild it\n\nI mean I don't have to have all the thirty thousand I just built it because I feel very comfortable with having that is a cushion right and what is your income a year\n\nAbout a hundred and sixty okay so what is three to six months of expenses\n\nIt is about twenty three thousand okay that would be ... that'd be three\nBe within the range of three to six months of expenses at Fifteen thousand and um if you want to use some of that money that's fine and if you want to build it back up to six months later that's fine but it doesn't sound like you need more than twenty five thousand ever in your emergency fund\nYes but I'm not a fitness center here I'm also not a U.S citizen I'm I work here on my now ex patriot and I just feel more comfortable because if I Need to leave the country I have about sixty days to get all my affairs in order to leave\nMhm\nOkay so you're just going to keep a little extra will show what out there and that's why I feel what happens if that ... that event occurs a while you're down on cash because you funded this thing\n\nSo it's very unlikely um I just received a new role and at least for the next two years I'm probably very safe at my work life\nMhm okay\nThe thing is is here here's what's bothering me is the proper amount to have in your emergency fund there's thirty thousand dollars then the answer is no\nDon't drain it down because this is not an emergency you use emergency funds for emergencies period if the proper amount to have in your emergency fund which means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later\nSo you decided what the proper amount in an emergency fund is when all the smoke clears but don't tell me you're using your emergency fund to fund this and then you're going to put it back which tells me you don't agree you know you've got the and your mind the proper amount is thirty grand I think is what you're saying and so the answer is no don't put the money in retirement\nDon't use your emergency money to do that but if you're willing to reassess your emergency phone and say I've got this thing over\nBut if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around ...\nAnd don't monkey with it is emerging she found is is is foundational before you move on to investing of any kind so you got to decide your definition that is what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash one and it sounds like emotionally given the unusual situation that you're in you want to keep thirty grand around\nAnd so you should keep thirty grand around\nThat's it don't mess with that but if not if you're going to permanently lower it then use some of that money to do this then hey I'm just fine with that a cage is with us in Salt Lake City how cage how are you\nHey Dave how's it going better than I deserve what's up [noise] hey thanks for taking my call today I'm I'm a college student\nI'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance um but the more that I go through school and the more that I listen to you it makes me want to really make a living being a financial coach dresses in many years ago and still here today [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I wanted to get your advice on whether you think it still possible or somebody like me to run this type of fitness but maybe you're biased on [noise] the best business model to maximize success on the early going up starting\nOkay well the um you know see based financial coaching where you pay someone pays you a fee just to sit down and do one on one coaching which we do some here and we go we we have a program where we certify people that do that that come through our training to do that\nIs it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that uh because it's it's very much uh the inventory is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours and the day for enough money to equal a good living\nBe done but I'm just saying it's not it's not a slam dunk okay it's not an eighty thousand dollar your job your first or two years out\nIt's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side and work with someone like one of our smart Mr prose as an example and those guys are in the business gals are in the business of selling investments\nAnd there's nothing there's there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact that it's almost paramount that you do coach people while you're selling them an investment so that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're selling so I'm On a home you're coaching them and this house was gonna you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is is that really out of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that you're in a sense your financial coaching them\nAnd so but you get paid a commission when they buy a house and so uh you know this idea that some people have that everybody gets paid a commission has a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd\nThere's plenty of people on strike commission with high levels of integrity that do the right thing so you might explore that angle\nBecause truthfully you can make more doing that\nThen you can just doing a book billing by the hour and I'm not saying making more as a whole answer but you know as a as a young guy coming straight out of school as a financial coach you probably gonna have to get a little bit of miles on your before people are going to trust you\nYou know I could be I mean there's some people trust you and if you're really good you know you're no you're stuff than you'll you'll get business but I'm just saying it's it's a tough road to just do what we did back in the day and it's one of the reasons is not is one reason we quit doing that as our exclusively but we did you know\nMake a scale up when there's only so many hours in the day you can fill

about using your top talent to perform\nThe work that brings you the greatest passion triple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five is the number would love to have you on and we started off with Caitlin who's on the line in Charlotte Caitlin how can how\nCan this is um I started my own cleaning business for it to me and I just saw last year um I'm twenty three year old and I know I Want to do something else on to her narrow I but I just haven't figured out what that is I Want to do something I'm Talking about\nI mean I have been and cartel terrible acts here hoping that sounded as I Would come out of it related to cars but I just haven't come up with anything and\nCars is that right is that what I'm getting out of this can you tell me about that what specifically do you love about cars\n[noise] I just I Love 'em I mean I can drive down but I also get I think that they're so unique in that way that they're\nUm designed and built and trying to gather 'em I enjoy feeling different line then I'm just kind of\nGot learning more about that and they're All right okay so the ideas you thought if I go sell cars I'm going to come up with an idea for a business to do with cars and you have yet to come up with that inspiration so let's let's look at what you enjoy doing besides cars what kind of work\nA function task do you find yourself really enjoying\nIt [laughter]\nYeah maybe I mean how can people see I don't\nKnow I get the LA but but what I Want to do is find a pattern here I Want to see a thread if you will uh so you're you're thinking too hard I Want you to just reveal rattle off when you had your own business you're very entrepreneurial what are the functions in a day\nOr what are the roles that you have played thus far you're only twenty three but what do you enjoy what what's functions do you enjoy there's something that gives you a burst of energy when you're engaged in it what is\n\nCompletely wrong up All right let's go another direction I'm going to show you how you do this let's talk about what you do best this is what people compliments you on\nA could be subject matters in school or could be tasked functions that I've been talking about people always compliments you on it you know that you just always been good at what what is\nI currently make a hundred thousand a year um I completed all of these baby steps I don't know why for kids\nUh and then I guess I've been given an opportunity to take a job that\nApproximately three hundred thousand a year a cyber attack care to consulting and ah I've I've been raised with you know try to keep a stable job um you know you could be on five days a week and make sure you know you get your paycheck and um but\nI I think since I'm pretty young and I don't really have you know I don't have to support a family or anything I was just curious what your thoughts were on a either staying at my job or taken this position\nWell let's start with how excited are you forget the stability issue which I'll get to momentarily how excited are you about this opportunity\nIt it's pretty awesome uh the the field itself I I enjoy doing it um I don't consider going to a job but like a Chihuahua or anything like that I I and I enjoy it so yeah I ... to ah to take the other one is pretty exciting\nYeah okay that's great that's that's one question the other question is when you say stability you said you're going to make three hundred thousand dollars that's a massive that's over half\nOkay two times which are me okay so where's the stability she meaning that you're not going to have normal hours but you're still going to make three hundred K. that I understand you correctly\nYeah so um I I ... I basically work that out for like a twenty hour work week and I multiply that by the hourly rate so it's consulting so I you know I can have worked for three weeks and then I can be I'll have no work for you know months on end\nYeah but you're going to make three hundred K. that's pretty clear correct\nWell that that's given if I get twenty or twenty hours a week okay got around the earth All right\nBut is there some question as to whether or not that's going to be consistent is that a moderate goal or can a conservative goal or an aggressive goal the twenty hours a week\nOr ... ... ... ... that's pretty moderate um\nAverage um yeah OK yet but they may have some months or they they get a paycheck and\nYeah but ... this is a no brainer because you're completely debt free you've already gone all the way through baby step seven you have no wife and kids I mean you're in great shape to take this opportunity and and here's the other thing you've probably planned for it you how ... what is your uh three to six month emergency fund look like how big is\nIt an outline\nYeah I mean juice out a little bit how long would it take you to get that up to thirty or fifty you know a\nFire position\nYeah or just in this new position because you're in such good because you're such good shape you you know just taking a new position you can stack up some money and take you know my point is is let's say you get into this new role which you really want to take and I'm telling you to take it\nBut let's say you're killing it the first three months live on way less you already can anyway so the new job is actually going to allow you to maybe put six months away\nSo you got no risk at all 'cause you can jump back in the cyber security I think it's a no brainer I think you're over thinking it because it's not the forty hour week buddy you did all the hard work to get to the point where you can take a job like this you don't have to work forty hours a week\nOkay you got me\nSo I may be uh celebrate tonight my goodness don't overseeing this I mean half of half of the eyes is going mad love to be worked ... right now [laughter] I mean buddy this is the kind of smart risk you know because you put yourself in a great financial situation to be able to go after this there's really hardly any risk at all um\nMan and and here's the deal you're saying that you all you have to do is get twenty hours a week\nAnd that would put your three hundred K. if you only do ten you're still going to be making about the same it's not even a little bit more of course you got to be making more so again go go go oh that is fun stuff triple eight eight to five five two to five\nHi Ken thanks for talking to me ... I'm I'm twenty four years old and right now I'm working in the legal industry I'm but I'm not a lawyer my role and the affection coordinator so basically I'm working with different boards to help coordinate their program ...\nMy uncle ... however I don't want to work in legal administration I Want to work in a different industry\nMy question is do you think my current job would give me transferable skills how long should I stay and well let's lay down job ... and if I only stay one to two years in that position\nYou know you almost like a job hopping at all how old are you a twenty\nFour okay twenty four I forgot to write that down so here's the deal you're pretty much the average millennials who looks at a job we knew this from data that looks at a job is no more than about twelve months so first of all that's out there and it's not job hopping suck you left after six months\nYou've been ah in the legal world and you now know very specifically where do you want to go so congratulations being twenty four\nAnd and knowing where you want to end up\nSo uh the first question you asked me are your skills\nThat you have manifested in learned in the legal industry transferable to the business industry and the answer is absolutely yes\nI Do a quick example here tell me a two or three or four things that you do really well right now in your job if I interviewed your co workers and your leaders what would they told me that Rachel does very well right now go\nUm I Would say system um and processes\nAnd then probably also collaboration or one of my big are all very big job to figure out who's doing what program and then on the other side of of ah the organization I man who is doing something similar and then kind of match them together and figure out\nHow to hit the ball rolling in both directions yeah\n... I mean think about how valuable you are and again I Want to remind you something Rachel I tell my audience this almost on a daily basis here's where we sit right now in two thousand eighty seven million jobs available in the United\nStates seven million it's historically\nThere are more jobs available then there are people who are unemployed and you just told me you're really great at systems in processes and you're really good at collaborating with other team members\nThat's extremely valuable\nI Believe there are people listen to the show right now or go I Wish I could talk to Rachel I'd interviewer tomorrow\nSo you need to have terrific confidence there now you asked me a resume question here's the deal you put your experience out there you're you're twenty four years old so they take that into account you don't have a Fifteen year work history you're twenty four and as long as you are open and honest as to why you're moving I think a a solid\nHiring managers going to ask you

position that is right for you at the time\nIt doesn't mean you throw your hands in the air and take your ball and go home what it means is you say All right I'm going to practice proximity in a in a non paid situation so I'm going to go volunteer or or I'm going to say can I just chateau you for a day\nI'm going to get in places where some type of audio video production is happening and when you get in those places you will continue to meet new people\nThe first step is just talking to your body\nThat's just the first step and that's how you ... practice proximity is people in places so again folks if you're in a similar situation let's apply Nelson situation to you\nHe needs to simply asked to day and then start to ride it out and find the answers when he goes and looks on line or wherever and he makes a list who are the people that are doing audio video production in my area\nWhere the places what companies are doing this and that's what he's looking to connect to it's not difficult it's going to take some intention alley and some hustle that's all it takes\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Joe who's on the line in Charlotte North Carolina Joe how can I help\nYou can big fan big fan of the whole range of the organization appreciate all you do thank you\n[laughter] pay so I'm I'm looking at it I I I'm kinda continue to shoot down one I'm Wondering if if if what I got as a hobby or just your career so just a little bit of a back story I recently went to a good paying job and excellent benefits to pursue that with my passion I take about fifty percent pay cut to to make the switch\nAnd and as I went to the slave profession you know and I quickly learned that I don't know 'cause the right thing for me I think I might have jumped the gun I just want to get some insight from you\nWill tell me what the profession is that you just jumped to\nFinancial diving what is it a financial diving\nOkay so you jumped into financial devising specifically what are you doing day to day give me the quick rundown\nA day to day are basically just knock on folks doors ... who I Am what I Do and you know trying to get them to um you know meet with me so that I can help them with a retirement plan and education so are you working for a local firm or do you open up your own shop no it's it's a it's a national um okay so they're not ...\nOkay why did you jump into that I mean I I think there's a question you may have jumped too soon 'cause in plant financially but your question was is this hobby level you know it's just the right thing for me and and and I you know there's a little bit more to it than that I think I have a hunch on it but quickly\nWhy did you jump for this why financial planning\nSo you know I've been with uh the day for the last five ten years crowded and you know I've always had a passion for maybe that would help folks with their finances are playing out retirement or when I went to a fair every kind of

the rug out from under handle just because I've made mistakes or how would you suggest they handle that\nUm what the select soccer ...\nIt's only seven hundred and fifty dollars a year and not all of his um the uniforms and everything\nIn your household income is what I'm just under a hundred thousand okay\nAnd you I'm a U.S how much debt\nSeventy five thousand [noise] okay um\nI mean it's not a deal breaker it's seven hundred and fifty dollars of the thing that Sharon and I did when we were looking at things like that was we would if we found one thing like that that we were going to\nNot cut to hit our debt free go we had to find something else we're going to cut deeper okay so like that means that if you are going to cheat and go out to eat once a month now you're not\nGotcha or the if you thought you were going to do X now you're not and it sat jak instead we're doing select soccer\nUm and how many kids do you have three okay and is he the oldest or the youngest or he sold the oldest okay\nAll right and um well I mean you get yourself out of debt than the other kids as they come up and do you can do whatever you want to do right I'm with them in terms of uh you know activities in sports and stuff you can afford to do all of that the thing that we decided was that all of this is for fun\nBecause um I mean Daniel my son played ice hockey all the way up through high school we knew at six years old he was not going to play in an age you are right we we're pretty sure at that point you know and uh so we made decisions to invest in ice hockey to have fun\nRight not because we were trying to create a\nThe others yeah you know and you know so parents go bananas on this stuff is my point and ah some of them you know there's been ten thousand bucks on whatever and you know in a sport that the kid is never going to go pro probably not even going to get a scholarship\nAnd all you're doing just burn up the kid and a half your budget but seven hundred fifty bucks is not the case the year ... you know you just got to be but you do need to look at it what it does is it makes you stop and pause enough you called me that's pretty cool\nYeah he paused and he went crap I can think about this and so you know just try to find you a trade off to innocence pay for it or we're going to you know in a sense we're going to knock this out Dylan is with us in Indianapolis Hi Dylan how are you\nI'm doing great Dave thank you so much for taking my call\nWe're like forty seven dollars a month over budget as things stand now\nUm we had back in January we had some identity theft going on in our account and that put us almost I said twelve to Fifteen hundred dollars in the ...\nThat the bank took for over a draft and stuff so that could us\nWhen we wanted the banks charge you anything if there was a\nAnd B it well it was ... that was charged to our account\nI Know but it's the talk of the banks shouldn't be charging you anything\nWell they did and they said there was nothing they can do about it and change but\nYeah we did wait we actually closed banking and we just have a debit card that I'm just like one of those little Walmart cards you know so we don't even go through the banks anymore it's just a debit card\nBut um they charge us\nLike six nearby six hundred dollars in over a draft and they wouldn't take them back but um\nAnd um a couple of more thanks for the smaller next that we had well we out the smaller nice but we're still have a hand on our house I've talked to the house and loan people and they're working with us but we're having to pay extra a month on our mortgage payment\nSure how old are you guys\nFifty nine so I'm fifty nine and a thick the and mom Seventy nine\nOr you guys on some kind of a fixed income for some reason\nYes it's a disability out three of us\nAnd none of you were able to work\nNo I Do a little side business with crafts and things like that\nWhat is the nature of your disability\nUm man is a hip displacement what's wrong with him um he had um a as a and broke his back uh-huh and he has a um\nA third of the bone to getting close to his nerves back and he also had a triple bypass surgery a few years ago when he has a defeat the later and so he's got like twenty five percent of his heart is beaten so mhm\nOkay um\nWell what what you guys have more than anything else is an income crisis right due to the fixed income and that's why I was exploring the question that does sound like you've got some pretty serious limitations\nUm but what I'm going to do if I'm In your shoes is what you've kind of started doing there with the crafts\nAnd even in his shoes are obviously none of you all are going to be involved in physical labor of any kind right on crime but if there was something that you could\nDo like I talked to a lady the other day who was just going to garage sales and she was buying clothing for a quarter and a nickel and showing it on ... for a dollar and two dollars and she had done that like ten thousand times and made like ten thousand dollars\n\nSell some stuff on ... but I'm not saying that's what you do I'm just saying that something like that that is that that that is in the line with the limitations that you guys have because if we can add a thousand dollars a month only your world it would change your life\nWouldn't it be dramatic and held his mom mom Seventy nine\nAnd how much of this thirty four forty two comes from her\nEleven forty seven yeah she passes away you don't get a real problem correct\nSo we've got to solve some of the income issue one way or another here um and how much is your house payment\nUm [noise] they were four Seventy eight increase faster than it was that's kind of\nThat's your that's just due to taxes and insurance going\nUp probably direct yeah OK and what's the home worse [laughter] oh it's a right out of hundreds and hundreds of ... way only twelve only want to doing this you know I sure would be good when you know\nSo I think more than anything the the the magic wand here is some kind of an idea\nFor you to create some income and I don't know what that is but I Want the three of you to sit around and talk about what you could do a ... you're obviously not going to do anything this physical I get that you got some serious limitations I understand\nThat and I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help you uh but it man a thousand dollars a month would change your whole life\nThousand dollars a month for a year and you pay the house off and that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem and right now you being a serious problem two thousand dollars a month income change\nAnd so in is that possible yes that is possible it's very possible but you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or\nWhatever it and again it doesn't I don't want to put a bunch of strain on you physically but um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation with you over the phone so you can have an intelligent conversation was on my own sell them something\nRight and that that's possible thing you can do um the you know and it doesn't cause you to\nWork forty hours a week necessarily but if you could do anything that creates a thousand two thousand dollars a month it would change your world and that's that's really what I Would work on rather than try to solve the forty seven dollar problem\nThat you've got what that is a symptomatic of the fact that you're struggling with income and legitimately ... you're struggling it's my pleasure lazy or something like that but it just hand\nIf you could come up with any kind of a small business idea that your husband and you could do together um and just get them to get the needle to move a little bit here\nMan it would change everything for you I thank you for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Benjamin is in Oklahoma City Hi Benjamin how are you\nAt Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nSo my wife and I graduated college about a little over a year ago\nCool and we got a good job good and bought a house good and I'm Wondering in your eyes are definitely getting on dad what are we paid it off about half the boy and I'm Wondering and your eyes or your parents\nOr a from a financial perspective is a good time to\nStart thinking that they could cause ship the wife's getting kind of pushy and you know that it I'm sure mhm ah so I just wanted to get your thoughts\nI I don't think that there's a financial manager other than just being completely crazy like if you don't have sixteen kids if you're broke that stupid okay that's crazy but you guys are in great shape your sharp young couple whenever you're ... whenever you're emotionally in relation to ready to have kids and God says it's okay to have kids\nGo have kids I I don't I don't tell people that need to be out of debt and have their emergency when there's not a baby step for kids\nUm you know you're not going to be a certain place you're going to be fine a child is not going to destroy your life financially or as a matter of fact you probably won't even hardly notice everybody talks about oh children ... five hundred and sixty two thousand dollars to raise you out really not really they eat the same broccoli you eat after a certain point\nThere in early in the same warm house you're already in after a certain point and so the actual cost of a kid is just not\nThat it's not devastating\nBut again you don't want to just load up a whole house full of them if you're broke and that that will cause a problem\nBut to decide to have your first couple of children\nI mean it's that's not something that's between you and God and your wife\nAnd you guys are in good shape\nFinancially smart you're already moving in the right direction\nYou want to start now it doesn't bother me at all this is Dave Ramsey show [noise]\nDid you know that if you combined the data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every American has had their\nPersonal info compromised or act over fifty percent of our listeners and viewers tell us that they or someone in their family has been a victim and Seventy percent of those folks have had it happen more than once

together so\nOkay All right and so are you paying child support on kids more than one\nOn you know you know I'm not that I'm as they've or through the court system at you know fifty fifty it's all even though it's it's pretty good so\nOkay so you have joint custody correct and that that uh keeps the the the child support also deal OK and that'll be true of the new baby as well yes okay so this is your second child or a third child\nA second and how old are you oh I'm twenty five years old\nOkay All right I'm buying a house was not a bad thing or your first goal is you know when you're working on it is to get clear the death the second goal is to have your emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nAnd in the eye and then above that you save your down payment and uh we always recommend you put enough down and you buy a home that you can do on a Fifteen year fixed rate and where the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay\nNow my guess is that is going to be pretty limiting on the house that you buy your income\nDoubt overtime or anything like that around eight hundred bucks or so [noise] um for a week or a burial\nOnly watch a month yeah so about sixteen hundred a ... right\nYeah and I have a five eight okay I have a I matched uh their retirement and you know I'm I'm ...

problem and the problem you know the problem Trump stop looking at everybody else to say you're the problem the problem the problem the reality is everybody has a part\nTo play in this every single person has apart now we have new things coming deniro Biden apparently it's come from Florida ah this is not helping us\nAt all and and the thing is is Trump says things he rallied the crowd he does just drives me crazy some of the stuff he says but at the same time he'll say something like this and the media skipped over\nIn these times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of police\n\nI agree one hundred percent Trump going out and saying some of the things he says about the media and stuff like that about his opponents and they see it's it's you know it's funny is the way that they attack each other and ads\nEach overlooked kind of like cartoons cartoons can be ... point lead politically incorrect\nRight you can stay things on Family Guy or South Park that if human beings said them and let's remember human beings draw them they write them the illustrate them they animate them they direct them they

it's almost like you know we we allow it to happen it's when things are said in person that it gets kind of weird and that's what happens with Trump right because Trump will say things and he does it in person\nSo what ends up happening is the media comes out and attack said yesterday listen to this and this is you know the first of all the running for bombings that didn't happen attempted bombings I don't know they never so far I've gotten you know different information whether or not these things or even viable\nEither way it's a horrible situation but the media comes out and this is

troops at the border called up like southern governors\nYeah so this will be interesting you know Trump is threatened this and this caravan is that anywhere between eight and ten thousand depending on who you're talking to you and\nAnd it's you know it's funny this is where like the crazy right in the crazy left there they've always got the conspiracy theories you know and the it's a\nIt's for owes the Soros is funding this or it's you know the Democrats have put this together and so what you found ten thousand crisis act or people that are willing to make a treacherous walk\nFrom wherever to

it's curious\nI I think we're allowed to be curious I I don't know what's going to happen they're they're having issues some small towns have taken some people in the custody I don't in the overall scheme of things by the time it gets here I don't know how big it is going to be and\nIt's going to be one of these things where this will be a little something for the next few days if that the bombs have overtaken it but eventually unless there's more bombs and they don't unless they find somebody it'll dissipate and then it will become this again and then this will this debate and then it will get bigger as it gets closer\nTo the borders and I say borders because I think eventually it's going to break into bits and pieces and you'll find some staying towards the Texas side some will head towards Arizona some other ones that had towards California\n... ... but I just I I don't know\nI don't know and this is one of those things where it's like as a perfect example where I was talking earlier to somebody of of\nYou know most of the time when I talked to somebody who we differ politically on certain things\nAnd I think most of you guys if you you were smart enough to understand that because I like to think that my my ... my listeners and people to pay attention are smarter than the average bear and even if they're politically they slant to one side and it's pretty solid they're open minded enough you know more often than not we want to get to the same place we just differ on the directions we want to take\nRight\nSome of us want to get there as an individual some of us want to get there on the bus some of us want to get I mean some of us are going to walk there we we want to get a lot of times the same place it's just the way that we the route that we're going to take how we're going to get there and who's\nWe do want to get that we do want good education we do want how I have yet to run and somebody in in on the Republican side of the aisle if you will ... says oh I Would like for for nobody to have health care\nI think everybody would like to for everybody to have health care it's just the way that they want it done is they like the individual to be a part of this and they understand but there are people out there that are capable for whatever reasons in certain circumstances that they're never going to be able to themselves and for that\nThey got no problem and the other side is like well everybody should have\nAnd we don't want the same thing it's just how do we pay for it how do we get there what's the best route to take where's the compromise in the same thing for immigration I've yet to meet anybody on the left except wackos who won't open borders right\nIt's just different and how they want to enforce these things\nIt's it's the same you know it's it's that kind of issue we should be talking about it because okay we we agree that we shouldn't have this so how do we go about fixing\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three

recognize that are that used to be the Republican Party the extremes have the bully pulpit and the problem is we've now gotten to the point where\nWe no longer look at the other side is somebody I disagree with a on political things we now look you across the board is you're evil and your the enemy\nAbsolutely and the gentleman who you bring up is it is a great example we'll talk about the names Joseph Kopser he's running and tax is\nA you know Twenty years in the army he was a ranger he then uh went to the Kennedy School at Harvard got a degree in international relations ... was a professor at West point I mean really impressive guy\nAnd one of the things that he did after that is he went and created a\nA clean energy company which was a huge success he now employs hundreds and hundreds of people in Texas but a really successful entrepreneur he understand small business and for instance when he talks about health care he doesn't talk about it in a way that shaming people who don't have the same view of him who who you know it's not from this perspective of\nHere's this sick child and how dare you not care about them because I think people who are conservative it's not that they lack empathy for people they're just trying to figure out a system\nThat that makes sense for them and feel sustainable economically\nAnd what's so great with cops are as viewers he's like look I had after Twenty years in the army\nI had a baseline health insurance for myself and that gave me the freedom\nTo go take a leap and to build this business which now created hundreds and hundreds of jobs and it's helping to drive the economy and it's a different perspective on it of trying to look at the robustness of the whole community and ways that we can have conversations about things like health care and look to different\nMachines I said you know you guys will approach is wrong you come at Republicans and you call them deniers or anybody who who doesn't agree with you because the reality is while science is out there then you can find a posing science and the fact that some of the numbers have been\nYou know you know just dump a little bit people get frustrated and think it's a bunch of bologna if you come at it from a hey you know what whether you believe in this science that science the reality is we're going to take better care of the planet plus there is the money to be made here so there's a capitalism is a part of it\nWhy not become part of a of a solution here we don't do that anymore we can't have a conversation that same thing goes with health care I Want to find a way to get I Would love to see everybody get healthcare\nCan we can we use a combination of both what are the tradeoffs is Thomas Thomas ... say it's about trade off what trade offs can we have because at this point I look at the Republicans and Democrats they'd rather have a hundred percent of nothing than fifty percent of something\nLook you're preaching to the choir on this I mean especially with the environment I think the other thing that happens just to talk psychologically for a moment\nPeople have a and understandably defensive reaction\nWhen they are told that they that they are bad not that it's their views but when you switch it over to that\nAnd there's an underlying sort of negativity and environmental messaging and here I'm not being party specific I'm just saying when we talk about the environment we tend to come from the sort of we're so we an ideal that that man is bad and nature is all good and some people are like wait a minute if a beaver can build a dam\nLike why can't we build apartment complexes like what is this thing that everything that man does is it bad and evil\nAnd and there's this under current to it that people understandably so you know some people have a defensive reaction to and I think there's a really positive way for us to look at this and go look we put a man on the road right we we obliterated polio from the face of the planet we got rid of the ozone hole and not a single business not a single business went out\nOf of the environment we knew how to not you know regularly businesses to the point that they're choked off and die and we also know how to solve problems around the planet so let's actually talk about that\nInstead of just hurling recriminations at each other and telling people that man is bad and anyone who opposes this is\nIs in denial there there's we used to have steps towards solutions and look I Will say with the with the intellectual dark Web overlap with Jordan aton he was my thesis adviser as an undergrad we'd go back forever but you know one of the things that we\nThat around a little bit I mean I had a really helpful conversation with Ben Shapiro who I Would say is is is as opposed to me on most issues\nAh you know and and basically I was looking at a certain proposal and just called them up and was like hey what do you hate about this like tell me all the the issue that you have with us\nWe had a super civil reasonable conversation I came out of it not having massively changed my mind on it but understanding the weaknesses and I made a tweak to a policy proposal\nIn keeping with some of the concerns that he raised so it's it's not like it's something where it caused me to go oh you know I I completely believe now like let's let's get rid of you know the smaller the government the batter the best form of government is when you can drown in the bath tub I mean it wasn't like it was some huge reversal\nBut we helpful is there was a libertarian sort of concern that was that I was aware of but that he really reinforced vehemently that helped me come back and make a couple of small adjustments to the things that I was proposing the respect that and I think we tend to undervalue\nIncremental change you know we tend to undervalue talking come up with solutions and one of the things I always say is\nThere is a lot of really smart conservatives out there I'd love to have us all pretending not pretending I Would love to have us all actually working on solutions to make use of all these brains to say hey here's what I think is really important for a baseline\nHow do we get here without causing damage to small businesses and to really sit down and be able to utilize brains in a brainstorming away from all sides of the table that's really what the intellectual dark webs about\nAbsolutely talking to a gray her which is of course the author of the orphan accident and many comic books are you guys might recognize out there but we're talking about him\nSaving the Democrats and just having corals real\nConversations and again it's the trade off I was joking with my friend last night I said if the Republicans and Democrats each won the lottery the other night because the other side would be getting some of it neither of them would want it and it's this zero sum game and the fact is it has to be trade offs we can find a way both capitalistic ally\nIn it to help healthcare ... to do things and\nAnd maybe if there is some government intervention or governments brought in some way shape or form that we can figure out a way to protect children adults people who are vulnerable we can do that the problem is I ... both sides want it their way or no way and that\nTo me is ridiculous I'd rather have stuffing Seventy percent of something Greg than a hundred percent of nothing why is it ... that we've gotten to the point here is is it only big money and the donors that are out there\nOr is there other things that people are afraid of because this the six percent on either side the bully pulpit screaming you know social justice warrior lunatics\nHad been able to do many ways hijack part of the party and a lot of I think politicians are afraid of them\nYeah I think that that that's not an accurate I mean I Would say that one of the other problems that we have that we don't always look at as ... as as clearly as this is I think social media plays a big part of it and I think whatever side of the equation that you're on\nUm what we've gotten is is a virtual arena where people spend more time socializing than in the real world and they can unlike anyone who disagreed with them and they were creating a bubble\nWould it becomes a sort of the virtues signaling Olympics right like the more vehemently you can be opposed to something that is racist the more vehemently you can own left tests the more clicks you get the more benefit that you get the more followers that you get and it's reinforced constantly in a direction that propelling us opposite sides\nSo one thing that's really important to me is I follow a ton of people across the spectrum there was a big issue in Hollywood here because somebody said that we should follow bench appear to see what he thinks\nAnd a bunch of people from the left kind of blew up over it it's like how would you not like how do you not want to tell the people who you disagree with\nUh I Know what they're up to and you know a lot of my friends really span the gamut I've a lot of friends who are conservative a lot of friends who were Wall Street Republicans I've some friends who are kind of you know\nMad got Trump voters a lot of libertarians and when you do that what you start to get which is which is to advantage both strategically I think and morally\nAs you start getting ear for all the things that really turn people off like what are the buzz words that make people shut off and retreat into their their in group favoritism let's call us and we want to know how to avoid that and not just\nTo make effective messaging and not just to win but we want to also understand that so we can figure out how to talk to each other better\nAnd people aren't doing that you know people you go on you go on social media and you look at what's happening and people are really competing and doing like they're doing dog tracks for their followers and and the more that you are polarizing\nThe more benefit and applause you get and people start to compete for that\nI Want to do as a country I don't know no no but that's why we have conversations like this where you know you and I agree probably agree on a lot of stuff we may disagree on other things but the reality is if we were to try to do something we would try to find a solution and the trade off to get something done because we actually\nTalk about the book and will do that at a at a later date because we know we got stuff coming I'm very excited about this uh he's the author of the orphan act series a screenwriter agree with Richard you coming on it and I think we need a two parties that are healthy and I think right now both of them are a little sick", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018",
