South Korea has had three so I'm at meetings with Kim Jong un the sheer human rights was not raised once ... once\nI'm moreover we all remember that um while a president one gene was chief of staff to the late ... than normal here on a he was the one who consulted with the north Koreans and advised that South Korea should abstain on a\nU.N General assembly resolution on North Korean human rights condemning North Korea as human rights record so up presumably this is dumb in order to appease the north Koreans in order to\nPress ahead with this so called national re constantly Asian process but the question that I Would ... I Would like to ask is um at at what point does\nAgainst humanity turn into endorsement of the egregious human rights violations being perpetrated in North Korea pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the state\nSo great we could put that question perhaps in a different way you know people point out as you've just mentioned that a Moon Jae in a was a human rights lawyer and that's how he came to prominence um many people say well you know it's a course ironic now that is not raising the issue of human rights\nSo maybe the question is\nWas he never a human rights lawyer all along that he was just using that to um basically gain power in the south\nTo oppose or people who he um didn't like the military leaders and actually that he was very much in favor of North Korea and the first place that he was like his senior advisors now\nI'm very much sympathizers for North Korea we don't know the answer the question we don't know what's moons head but the point is he may not be naive he may be complicit all along in North Korea is human rights violations\nOr he has certainly I'm invested tremendously in this process of engaging the north Koreans the south Korean economy's not doing too well\nThe unemployment rate amongst young uh college graduates is high and still on the ice remember that the important part of president Moon Jae in support base so he's basically laying 'em most of his bed so all of his bets on this inter Korean rapper Sean process\nWell we'll see a human rights lawyer yes and he was famous for having defended some um democracy activists who are basically working against the military dictator\n... says that involved a Marxist and Marxist material course\nThe time um that type of materials bad so uh actually being a human rights lawyer in South Korea does not necessarily imply that ah that that one would be equally active on North Korea Kim writes but then again\nBeing a human rights lawyer by formation a president Moon Jae in does understand the gravity of crimes against\nHumanity and ... go ahead please you\nIn on that point let's talk about Amanda's letter I'm Amanda ... as a human rights lawyer she wrote a letter in the chosen ... the south Korean newspaper um tell our audience what amended asked a Moon Jae ... oh go ahead Gregory\n... widow as my colleague she's our human rights attorney or a chart gate human rights attorney currently based in Seoul or there was a terrific letter she published in the ... the very basic question that she asks from a human rights lawyer\nTo another human rights lawyer she tells him look I have witnessed\nUm I have a atrocities myself elsewhere in the world we both understand uh basically when are you going to take these violations seriously Mr President when at what point are we going to see your administration getting serious\nAbout the the the the human rights violations being perpetrated in the north\nIt's a good question to let me come back to moon does he have a plan to your knowledge to transition from this ah generosity that he's demonstrating towards a man who has no capability\nIs there any significant body of literature that says that moon is going to move to another phase when ... when North Korea's engaged\nA well of course this is the argument that engages will make that engagement will bring about exposure to the outside world and implicitly\n'em a chance to improve the human rights record of North Korea but on the other hand if South Korea focuses on infrastructure projects tourism projects\nEnergy projects pipelines do not talk to people\nPowell lives to not talk to people tourism projects can be tightly contained with few if any social side effects so these are not necessarily projects that will help\nThe people of North Korea so far I have not seen any sign\nThat the moon Jae in administration actually has a North Korea human rights policy I haven't seen any encouraging well eight eight when encouraging statement and I would be very very very cautiously optimistic statement by that\nSouth Korea and permanent representative to the United nations who said something along the lines that South Korea is an active participant in the drafting of the U.N General assembly a resolution on North Korean human rights now in previous\nAct will have to leave it there Gregory Scott ... of the committee for human rights Gordon in North Korea Gordon Chang on John you up to date twenty four hours a day seven days a week I don't want to\nOur police they put their lives on the line to keep our community

wrong reject cares didn't cinema imagine the damage she do in the U.S Senate\nDefend everything that pay tone is responsible for the content of this advertising than at any candidates committee W W doesn't that there was in it that or\nCommercial and retail electronics for consumers and therefore\nIt is not credible at this point at this point they're cagey about this\nAt this point to replace John however there is migration underway to Vietnam and\nIndonesia those are the two countries the economists mentioned\nAnd that going forward as the supply chain altered you know devices are getting smaller we're getting rid of chords we're getting more mobile devices and less of the desktop so they are the tablets and other electronics bigger ... the big box servers become a little Biddy box servers\nIt is possible that China can be augmented with other countries but not yet\nYou John that's not an unreasonable view but the point I think the economists tends to gloss over\nIs that you know first of all there are the terrorists that Trump is putting on and it's making life miserable for manufacturing and trying to but you know the more important story is that the jumping the Chinese ruler is making life miserable for foreign companies in China\nAnd I think what he's doing for various geopolitical in city has is making China an unreliable member of the global supply chain so companies for that reason alone are going to lessen their um exposure to China's geopolitical risks\nAnd therefore as they can move their supplied a chain um vulnerabilities and get out of\nChina Allen you are Mr supply chain what tell you\nWhat gored I hate to say it but Gordon's got it right I Would\nOh my lord oh my lord let me fall off my\nPoints first of all what what free trade extremists uh publications like the economist ignore constantly is the fact that national governments much smaller and less powerful then the U.S government jerked around\nMultinational supply chains all the time in countries like Malaysia and Singapore and Thailand are constantly imposing conditions on inbound foreign investment that for all of this talk the multinationals rule the world the company's\nAlways wind wind up complying with so if Malaysia can do this certainly the United states can\nAnd secondly there's a great deal of that reshoring ... or I should say of\n... of shifting production outside China that's either already taking place or that's being contemplated because these companies know that we're only at the very beginning of Trump's China trade policies and they want to be prepared and PS\nThey are not panicking and all they have have repeatedly said that you know we'd have cause rather not do this won't be the easiest thing in the world but we think that within several years we can shift a lot of electronics in information\nTechnology hardware production outside China to other low wage countries I Hope by the way that that includes Mexico because that would really help this country's southern neighbor which which\nDesperately needs it and would end would by extension help the United states for men to sleep and I think that that that is far from implausible\nGordon apple and apple most apple can move but it's going to be extremely painful because apple hasn't stuff manufactured by Foxconn Foxconn of course is deeply embedded in China but we got to remember John and Allen that socks on once was in Taiwan\n... or Taiwanese investors have created them in addition that means that whatever we regard as the difficulties of portability has happened already\nAnd it's gonna it's gonna they can move again and also the other thing when you talk about automation and robots\nThat makes it a lot easier to move because that limit does not eliminate but it's certainly reduces substantially China's labor cost advantage because a robot in the U.S as we've discussed on this show before is just about the same cost is a robot in China\nAnd in fact the economists did make one good point and that is that\nThat as electronics products become more sophisticated of for the reasons that that Gordon mentioned because of their production is so highly automated there is no more China cost advantage and Foxconn in fact this in the process\nOf making a very considerable investment in advance electronics production in Wisconsin\nSo we could very well have the\nResult that China still winds up making the vast majority of the world's walk them in perhaps but the more advanced office increasingly made\nOh I live in that sense of fear use of walkman I was thinking about you know the everything you need to know about pac man is in China okay one more detailed sure one more detail or concern here that I've had for some time there's a new phone from Wall way and I've seen it advertised in the United states what the heck is going on how and\nWhy are we allowing that to happen in the United states\nWell thanks in large part to the massive transfer of advanced technology by us telecommunications companies to China Huawei has become a global leader in the latest generation of that telecommunications technology which is called five gee\nUm and and certainly wall where he wants to be a big player in this you what\nYou were when you when you we don't allow pets\nFor that is poised to well\nYou're absolutely right and it's weird also because the U.S government and the intelligence community has already label called way as a threat to us\nGo according to news to people I mean I saw the phone being advertised the latest from Wall way it's that there is no privacy worthwhile wait it can't last long and of course\nYeah I don't think it'll last look I mean not only does one way but also the ... the Chinese\nWhere and why why it's the People's Liberation\nArmy the state within a state they are this is state security spy\nSure I mean they do make these handsets they are sold in the U.S they have been but I don't think we're very much longer because of the reasons that you John and you Alan had mentioned this is just politically unsustainable and it's certainly under cuts and undermine sort of security it won't last long\nWe have great fun with Alan Thomas and our pathfinder just worrying too much we've got to get somebody else well oh gosh I he did admit to reading the economists I haven't read that

works good evening to you Brandon\nGood evening John and thank you again for having me on and hello Gordon and to answer your question\nI'm back home in Florida we have a saying even a blind pay confided slot bowl once in a while um the Chinese yes it's true they're having some technical difficulties but to be fair we here in the United states in the sixties and seventies at our share of technical difficulties\nThey're heavily committed to achieving a what we know in the national security policy arena as space dominance\nAnd uh they are they are effort that so whether or not the next launch\nAnd the next few months we'll work uh I think it probably will but even if it doesn't they're going to keep trying until they get one right and we hear in the United states unfortunately are not competing the way we shouldn't be the way we did against the Soviets in space\nAnd so they basically in China have a lot of time to perfect\nA the technology they're trying to create and you\nWant to translate quickly there's a moon writes on and there's only one contestant that is\nThat's that is one hundred percent correct yes\nGordon brand and I'd like to just choose the topic a little bit because I heard you speak yesterday and I was absolutely flabbergasted at something that you said\nWhich I think is critically important which I think every American needs to hear and that is um we all know that Google has declined to participate in a Pentagon contract to develop the cloud some ten billion dollars\nA lot of people in Google or upset that um this does not fit in with the Google philosophy of don't be evil\nBut I heard you say and and I just was completely astounded\nThat Google is about to participate in a technology contract in China were affected the way the partner on the other side is the People's Liberation army if you could just run through back because there are a lot more details on that but I think everyone needs to hear this\nYeah so basically a quantum computing is it's the next revolution I'm that's that is the thing it is the next industrial revolution whoever can figure out quantum computing first it's basically like having the cotton gin you know of the laughing\nWe have what's known as quantum Internet basically it plays upon string theory and basically without getting into the mechanics of it it's a physics has shown that to a particle could exist in the same place can exist in two different places at the same time and the Chinese have figured out a way to manipulate that particle\nTo transfer encrypted data between the two particles are and it's worked they've been\nTesting is is twenty sixteen from that technology that initial investment they spun off technologies like quantum radar which can be a it's believed can see through the F thirty five that multi trillion dollar\nA program of ours to build the great stealth fighter they can see through it and they're married that to the S. four hundred Russian built defense system\nAs well they are now investing heavily in an actual quantum computing center and on and we and they have reached out to Google and about a year ago and Google has expressed interest in not only sending over talent\nTo this a massive new center there building which would be probably operational around twenty twenty twenty Twenty one\nBut Google also wants to infuse cash this is under the umbrella of a state owned enterprises in China which happens to be basically reporting to the People's Liberation army the Chinese have actually not been very secretive about the fact that the quantum computing center that they're building that Google could potentially be helping with\nA is actually not only for civilian purposes but also for military ends in the same way that Google and Apple's investment into a I research artificial intelligence\nResearch in China is also going to be used for Chinese military purpose\nLet me set the formula here if I understand this correctly Google as evidenced interest in participating in the pie LA's advanced advanced work on AOL and quantum cute ... corner and quantum\nWhen ... was looking to compete with Amazon and now with Microsoft for the super secret cloud contract ten billion dollars a year at the Pentagon I lay out this task very clearly Gordon\nThis looks like Google is siding with the non transparent dictatorship and just standing there transparent military that protects Google's copyright\nYeah I mean that's the only interpretation that I can think of John and this is something that I think the first of all the president needs to think about and we need to start thinking about whether I'm\nYou know in a company which is headquarters in the United states which does business in in our country is permitted to help the Chinese develop their military which is can begin to kill Americans\nAnd brand and have you seen Google addressed this parrot talks in any fashion\nWell no and if anything there's you know they're they're they're continuing to seek to do business in China I Will say though are in both cases of the the way I Am a quantum computing\nOn the fence they not actually going forward with it this is all you know starting the groundwork right now but I went less awareness has risen I think\nI I think that things will go on without the American people knowing until it's too late and so part of my\nMy hope is to raise awareness among the American people to say hey maybe we shouldn't have some of our best companies going overseas investing in the centers that could be used to ... defeat the United states uh enough you know whether it's economic\nOr military competition and there's something very interesting that there is a man by the last eight months later we have twenty seconds bread oh go

and take her to vote because coming up next segment\n\nGo mobile at the top ... six point seven mobile and\nOn one of those they point seven dot com or details [noise]\n... will so\nLaw you know from the IMF all wars dot coms through the\nCaves average Joe\nHere is a highlight reel of [noise]\nVeto versus crows and\nWhen you know the Texas policies and national policies\nYou know about veto like either living here in Austin I mean the guy is an incredible liar [noise]\nHe said that El Paso super safe and there's no crime on the border that's all coming up and then the borders on a big issue I mean Mexico has hundreds of thousands dead it's a beautiful country and many areas nice people in many areas but much of it is a war zone most dangerous country in the world\nWhen I was a kid we got out of the border\nIt's not safe anywhere\nNot even a big band anymore\nNot to the middle of nowhere five hundred miles from a town\nAs dangerous as hell\nBut let's go out and get the compilation because the Senate races show critical here dish\nOr junior senator or will not stand up to President Trump someone who apologizes for Russia to defend the country well under ... the leader of the country that sought to undermine our democracy through all stand up against somebody will stand up for ... or the election\nPeople always ask me about ...\nBeen here for Twenty years I went and looked it up Twenty years ago and it's basically in marketing and Scott ... how people talk in the terms they use\nLoving will notice I make hand gestures like Trump does and I mean these are all well known gestures the things I Do naturally but Vito O'Rourke do you notice with him it is an L. P. and Trump\nIs it professionally trained he trained in the streets of persuasion in the truth\nBut you look at veto he's trying to sound like Obama would the cage and the more you're sharing it and and the whole thing is disgusting and that's why they're calling him the new Obama\nYes they don't just want him in the Senate they think this guy is going to be the next president I mean another blue blood establishment trying to pose like a real person when he never built and he's in his life and his mother is a lifelong Democrats but the trick Republicans to vote for him that my mom was a Republican but she's voted for me\nYou are a line piece of garbage you say you want to ban all semi auto rivals are debts as you want to open borders you are an enemy of this country you are in a globalized piece of felt the cobs\nAnyways just watching it makes me wanna vomit effect on the middle east frat boy blue blood chicken necks carpet bagging down here in Texas go back to it\nFor us to make sure that our elections are free and fair that your vote goes to the intended candidate this this is beyond party politics is getting a isn't getting our democracy back on track and when he days\nAre constantly on bracket boss I was ... it's the Democrats trying to censor all the Republicans and all the conservatives all the questions it's the Democrats threatening everybody but you're talking about our democracy is under threat your friend your little piece of crap\nSorry just go go back to it\nDo that I was proud to help lead the effort to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court I was proud to help lead the effort to confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh to the court\nCongressman O'Rourke would have voted against both of them and he wants to see like Hillary Clinton promised to a point\nFor the people of Texas what we want to do the justices who will follow the constitution and follow the law and this is what you can expect over the course of this debate a Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you\nI mean even my ... admits he talks like Obama which is totally fake talk as many as Obama in the eighties and now he doesn't sound like that\nFor for for almost port Bernie Sanders for most people thought it through what people don't know what it's like who people go there to marketwatch burrito oh wrote pay all that was a bummer like for president twenty twenty\nBoth never did anything in their lives both looked like they could stick a golf ball through a garden hose both scum bags with like the country let's go back to both looked like they have Mr Ed teeth\nOil boy\nIf you read ... Iraq with Stormy Daniels you would actually have a real horse\nBoy you really bring a jackass a donkey with a horse you get a meal you'd have a mule\nThey've got a little baby new\nOh get both on my screen I'm Sorry I\nOh I'm so sick of these facts you're there you go back to Peter I mean yup yup Peter O'Rourke here it is\nGoing to be honest with you he's going to make up positions and those that I never held or ever take is dishonest swallow them yeah I saw it as I saw it I feel\nLike I said I stopped going back to\nThat and that's why the nickname stuff because it's for congressman O'Rourke\nOf getting back to that but it's like it's you know Trump's headline tad\nAbout things that happen in the campaign Ted Cruz and always kept his promise about votes that's what matters and he did make me mad he did do some flip flopping in the campaign and and then she said about Trump but they don't sit there and used corrupt quotes beat out when Trump has endorsed Ted Cruz\nIt does it fit when you're a Democrat saying that the Ted Cruz when Trump has endorsed Ted Cruz\nBut he's probably not a bad fall like let's just you just looks like one let's go back to her\nName's saw because it's for congressman O'Rourke\nNot only opposes the wall\nBut he has said we had too many fences walls already on the border he wants to tear down the ones we have an outlet and he brought up El Paso\nEl Paso is right across\nFrom war as one of the most dangerous cities in the world three thousand murders last year there's a wall there\nWall is one of the tools you use to protect us\nAll you've heard from Senator Cruz and is what we should be afraid of 'em it's a campaign based on fear it's it's the same person who is shut down the government is United States of America for sixteen days perhaps because they thought too many people had too much health care as\nLong as you get to Obamacare ripped everybody often tripled prices but Democrat shut down the government all the time to get what they want\nTo take away health care for millions of American families and vows to repeal protections for preexisting conditions I don't want people to have more health care what people do well enough to finish their education\nTo go to school I Want to bring people of Texas together which is already like Democrats over a third part to make sure that we're issue that we understand better than anyone else\nIf we are reducing the barriers whether it is to Mexico or Canada or China or anywhere else so we're selling more that's a good thing if we're renting barriers and shutting down trade that is a bad\nThing really interesting to hear you talk about a particle circus after here [laughter] I done it um\nIf if you have this special relationship where it falls again\nThey're the ones that live with all the fixed up and they got beaten fame or the shark is not the Republicans continue\nUm then then where is the result of that um we were all talk and no action on the

again I had a great time talking with you the last couple of days and I look forward to the next two days and Jerry ... is actually the Sunday night Monday morning\nCould easily get used to fill them especially because you've been so gracious to me and you're kind of comments about my work and you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the you're next on my Web page at the market will show dot com where you can email me Solomon Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to\nNumber of topics I said I Would get to tonight so I Want to keep my word first I Want to talk to you about illegal immigration\nI've been talking about this for over ten years now on the air doesn't mean I didn't think about this Twenty years ago and so on but I've never wavered in my position the issue and you guys were bringing up the last few days so I thought I Would focus on first segment at least and see your response\nIssue is really not that difficult if you'd knowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally have come here legally which is why those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone it illegal aliens one of the college last night said you know markets illegal aliens forget it\nSo you have the term document an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or loss them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over if they're legal they're not allowed to be here in the store in another caller so that why you know why is this going on it's pretty simple\nSo as an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they wanted your home to go into your home but they just lack the proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walks into your say your bank and wants to take the money out of your account right they would be asked to prove that it's their account\nIf they said it was there a cap and they just didn't have the documents to prove it the bank would not permit them access isn't that obvious\nWhich is why it is so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as this that can have your house and bank account if only they could find the misplaced documents for years now I've said the leftist\nLivable wage and and minimum wage right we we live with yours for minimum wage here's the wages that the government by the way\nThe term that people should be paid which is ridiculous on his face and a free market economy and a capitalist economy out of the government know what the right wages for you and your business the certainly not there when your business fails\nBut they're going to tell you how much you should have to pay your workers but of course people don't quite hear this argument and I could go on it's much more expensive than that\nHow about global warming or climate change right so they started if you're a member with global warming and then when it was really cold in certain places\nThey just really haven't quickly I was almost like overnight it became climate change sea so they could cover themselves no matter what the weather and if there are a lot of hurricanes and they claim oh the season they they've had been more hurricanes even if it wasn't true\nRomney actually had a right to use the wrong language stuffed up when we go again would language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take them back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remained that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they'd be saying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government's sending out the wrong ... message with actions like ball legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United bites language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at Ellis Island they were so happy to a vote landed\nAt the land of freedom so let's build a

the language that you were talking about one of the biggest glaring things is that you even do it yourself\nAnd I I used to do it but I'll marry you say American would actually we are us citizens in America and uh the liberals are lot not all liberals that's called radicals there they actually taking that word in the applied it to everyone on the side of this or so when they\nWhen they were talking American you know\nWe think that it's just citizens here now they're thinking the whole world this whole side of the world and immigration means nothing to them I mean this is just normal stuff and we have been brainwashed when we say Americans and they they say American they brainwashed us\nThink that we're saying citizens and they and they say they're brainwashed us to think that\nAnd everybody uses American but when you look at your passport if you have one it's a U.S citizen that's what we are\nAnd that's a huge difference we have to be so deliberate with what we say are words have got to be deliberate and that's that's got to be all the main thing that we have to do even on the air because those are radicals or taking those words at twist though that's\nI eat when I hear that word America or Americans in me you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind I'm not going to let them use or that and just because they think Americans ... you know north Americans of whatever they want to use it for I'm not going to let them get away with that\nOh and you know some of the songs right America the beautiful let that that's not there's I'm not conceding that to them there's not a chance I'm going to do that\nAnd I don't want to concede the language them at all that's why it's important and legal immigrants in legal aliens I Know people kept me on that um but I don't I don't see anything to them and and if you do that and then you're kind of given up a little bit now where Americans we passed for United States citizens great I get it\nBut there's something special about this country called America when the United states of America America usa whatever you want to call it\nAnd so appreciate your call but that's my take on it and now you're national forecast for cobra electrons\nEffect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of

the southern Rocky's\nA little too warm for snow in Denver the overnight low thirty four high later today a fifty nine it's winter weather preparedness week in Colorado a reminder that winter weather can arrive quickly and oftentimes without warning and the high country and there is today is look at your national forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorology\nNinety\n\n\nAnd then and then you can also add onto that health care bill of health Gillum totally ... well I'm a big it will stop or stops and you know living but\nYeah I yeah there's nothing like the right in the Senate and that's the point with right now it's been the wrong incentive you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get to have free hospital care right and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and this was terrific you you you know I I Would come here to that's why I said\nThey charge interest and we can make money interest then you know what\nYeah you should have given this idea to President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for the wall\nYou know any better than I Do only about ... [laughter] I don't think that's a great\nThing Steve appreciate it very much actually I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be a way up there in the department of education but uh the person I send to then I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's the head of communications for I think the department of health\nUh and so yeah it does happen and you know some people but you know what a ... it's tough and and that's one of the news stories that are I think they were hitting someone else's leaving the administration it's tough to work there\nEspecially if you're conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want it's tough it's tough and a lot of your points that out yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot to become ...\nOne of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing I mentioned this last couple of days a week and power not only hearings and subpoenas but you know they're going to go after taxes because they're they're sure they're going to find something there\nThat though oh probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of deal the Russians but even if they don't what business is it um there's\nWhat his tax returns are it's just not their business I Know certain presidents have done I don't think they should\nIt's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's none of your business Democrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know my I don't I pay what I'm supposed to pay and do my share but it's not anybody else's business by the way after the Kavanaugh hearings and all this other stuff if they go after taxes\nWhy to good people exactly why do people want to serve a pet especially people that sense why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider\nDemocrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you how to live your life\nYeah they're the party that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those that hey I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they're much more likely to say I want to go back to my family and to my life because they don't believe in this whole part and that's what illegals don't know what makes America special one of the big things is limited government\nThat government stays out of your lives and don't you find it ironic to say the least\nThat a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government\nAnd what they do when they get here they vote\nIt takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews and you know they say who's the vice president United States they can't name that that's not so important\nWhat's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country exceptional\nThat we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get and I don't try to indoctrinate them I give them both sides I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights you're going to have anarchy\nBut on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible that's why some people question is\nWhy I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military I Can't have a tank in my backyard\nOr grenades or is let alone nuclear weapons so there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that shows this debate in perspective where the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think ... mostly people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people have a real tendency to be bad and they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were had the strongest tribe and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they did this because we can\nI don't I don't trust humanity I I don't trust that and there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and I didn't get into this so much last night's caller mentioned that\nWe have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant so there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of and the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose but even there right how do you pass a law you guys know this the house has to pass the Senate has to concur and and the present\nLaw that's unconstitutional they really were afraid of big government so that's another big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand what makes this country so special\nBut most you guys do and even if you're on the left I Want you to explain to me why I'm wrong about illegal immigration give me call it eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine I'm Mark ... filling in on right on the radio\n[noise]

I'm going to the ferry boat and I know I'm going to respond to had no if they don't care to want to go in the history won't ... with no matter how\nMany respond okay I'm going to try to respond to okay so I gave it a lot of time\nSo first of all you said something about the land was taken from the Indians that they were here first the only problem with that is there were Indians before those Indians and their Indians before those Indians and there was nobody living anywhere on planet earth today that didn't take it from someone else that someone was there originally\nThat's just what happens in life it's it's you could say it's unfortunate and shouldn't be that way but you need to know your history\nMaybe you don't many of the people who are involved in the slave trade were blacks who brought blacks over here I'm not saying it was good it was obviously terrible to bring people here against their will but you do you have to put this in perspective\nThe time it was in slavery was absolutely awful and horrible but if there's one country that's trying to atone for that more maybe more than any other country in the world it's the United states of America we understood that that they can no ... no no no it's my turn now it's monitored\nAnd we understood I just had a black person that they are I mean the the overwhelming majority of Americans want the best for all their citizens they don't care about race in color and so on\nAnd the uh I don't I wasn't sure your last point I wanted to respond to it\nAh but then you say that the pleased when they do do some shooting I couldn't tell if you were trying to say that they ah they were not being responsible and some case sometimes that does happen someone gets shot never should have been shot and they're they're they're good and bad policemen they're good and bad talk show host\nBut in general that you probably know the two most blacks are ah murders by blacks are by from other blacks and in the in many inner cities they want more police not fewer because they want to be protected I actually I'm going to keep ... go ahead now you respond\nOkay and like I said no matter how you look at it the one thing I can say if I Can't say anything ill about\n... president I appreciate everything he's done because the aisle he asked uh what Air America dirty laundry is that everybody sleeping racism under the under the like is dart now that it out and being forecasts that\nWould everybody would you that you had Republicans that to get this name because how he how\n[laughter] but I think a ... like a lot of people\nLike up to a lot of my people yeah I can get mad at this man I Want to but the one good thing that he did bring about in this country was air the fact that the racism and hatred in America alone it's horrible it's horrible\nWay way way we were so where's he wears the race will see me with the lowest black unemployment rate maybe ever but we're we're exactly see racist or ...

in New York City Pammy wrong with mark\nYes Hi Mark I'm Florida and Texas those two states are the two you said that Democrats would really like to add to their progressive crown and I have to say that I Am very concerned about\nI really haven't heard very much about it but um I get the feeling that it's not going to well in Florida I don't know about Texas but\nI don't know if you have any insight to what's going on there I Know that I'm\nA several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida after that terrible hurricane last year and a the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because\nThey can vote or an ... in Florida I don't know what insight you have you heard about those two states and I had relatives\nWho live in Florida and I really can't say with them because they're they just do not want to talk about politics\nYeah that's another topic I uh have down for tonight I don't know if we'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side of you still get to keep them\nBut I Do have inside in Texas I I think Cruz is going to win and I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers seem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that's their fools goals like he was for Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest time although we finally won at\nFlorida is more problematic you're correct my hand the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that\nUh we could be were behind in the governor's race I think the senatorial race is is also wifi so that'll depending on who turns out you're absolutely right and how many are illegal votes they can get from people outside of the country on the Democratic side\nBut you know I think we're starting to come back to the Senate I'm more worried about the house than I Am about the Senate I think we're going to offer as individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm concerned about to have to I don't know what the ... congressional um situation is and I'm In you know Florida or Texas but um I don't understand you know I also don't understand why\nDown they appeal to the Democrats who live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states and you don't they understand that they're going to have a ten percent tax if the governor's race one by the Democrats in Florida\nAnd he wants to do a lot of radical things and he got as that gentleman a couple of callers ago said you know the states are\nThey can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer\nHealth care they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats don't\nYou don't understand their for their own their own them being down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrats in this and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying tonight is it's very hard to explain the conservative Republican positions especially when the Democrats it's much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are on the surface if you don't explored the oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah or or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about an attorney but the same job necessarily\nA and that would make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of left us than liberal positions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway just like now the\nThey know that I think the overwhelming majority of American people did not want to go through impeachment again I was wrong I was for it with Bill Clinton and what happened ... he won reelection\nUm people there and people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing and saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did the gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leads leaving that aside\nThey treated him some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and so they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when Dukakis by the way of announcing that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think at uh eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else that you want to talk about but right now is your national

very old\nThat are\n\n\nI wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married and then she left she left she's gone and it's the fast track to green card\nNow the way they have you ever heard of the way they act and I'm just not just touching up from what the previous a previous speaker was talking about um\nYou know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here illegally have a\nHave a you know get pregnant and then just totally disregard everything and then live off of the government um you can't get deported you can't um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever know I I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this is this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then\nThey want to just stay here and and uh it\nIt it's an amazing thing I'm going my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience I'm I'm having to live with it you know with lawyer\n... everything I guess you don't ... you don't see your child then\nNo no um they do restraining orders I'm under the way they act as the women against violence um X.\nAnd um you are here it's the fast track to green card and\n... and you know um I Would probably I'll run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on talking about father's rights and what happened is a ... the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to George in Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nAnd mark I keep hearing these wonderful terms thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a latch don't soup\nBut I think it's also a misnomer we do not have illegal immigration we haven't in Beijing going on these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we're being invaded by the failures of these other ...\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nIf it was any if it was their military doing it we would be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent late allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and that happens because there are people on the other side of have an agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America has said the United states\nThey just see it differently than we do and they they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against them\nPresident Trump was smart enough to make that his top issue and it's not at least one of his top issues and the American people responded and I think they did it correctly let's go to ... there's so many good calls here and let's go to Stan in while loosing Pennsylvania I probably misled upstanding Ron with mark\nOh thank you mark a great call you know you're got a great ...\nSo I'm a escaped your enemy territory for a while\nHopefully we can get ... out of their\nUh God but um I was calling basically uh\nUh I guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the on the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people illegals not only voting but bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and I was sick and um\nYou know how to stop that and if you remember like during the ... when we were sitting up governments either in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war as they were taking a people who are voting and dying their ... you know their thumb purple\nYou know you couldn't vote more than once\nAnd it seemed like if we could do that overseas why couldn't we do that here so we wouldn't have known not only illegals but people voting more than once in a you know disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nBut you you you know the whole controversy over ... voter id and the other side of the money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's the big crime to ask someone to you aren't let me see if you are who you say you are\nSo you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal but you know the whole big races were made in this you know how could you do that yet I by the way my position is different than most people don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put some for some effort I'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or you get to vote on the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I was thinking also about a year of the voter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and I'm saying you know\nIf you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that and while you're there voting where they just take your picture and start the process of creating a voter id then you're already there\nIt's not like you had to go someplace\nTo you know to get a voter id you're already there so they take a picture of person and\nSay you a digital camera feed it into facial recognition say in a in a tri-state area and see if that per person pops up\nIn another ward or district or state on the same day and you know when you said a digital camera you could chicken chicken see if they voted\nPreviously on that day and age but at the same time he could be starting of voter id form you know the sign that you got the picture you do that you have their dress\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know or you go back and you bring the the id to them mail it to them and uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them\nTo see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered and more than one place\nWell there are two problems okay first the other side does it they want voted for ... I think he was off off of that I Know that do but there's another point that you didn't think of\nI don't know how your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures\nOr they can't even find my name is the time of Pennsylvania or I wouldn't know originally you know I'm right right so you're going to people who are you oh my God that you go over to that table you're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out and if I ever won the ...\nSo when you have stand you assume that it ideas but they're not going to work I have a great evening\nI I I tell you one one thing I did have that went into vote one time it was a primary and uh I had a I asked them if I can have you know a a write in ballot\nRight and uh\nAnd he said oh yeah yeah you you can never write in Balad I walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nAnd it was like\nTotally amazed they say well you know what's going on you know ... and he said well uh [noise]\nOh oh you know you're a you're wanted vote Republican goes uh or or Democrat I couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do or writing ballot and I says well you said I could and he says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in ballots are not\nRight you know I I thought it was I thought it was gonna be worse than I thought it was gonna say you can only a write in on the Democrats like you can't run the Republican hey why my laughing voter fraud happens all the time let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine Marcus there for red Iranian\nWanting to do for your goals eight six six Ninety red on red on the radio [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accident free miles than registered joined the million mile club on line at red eye radio show dot com red eye radio in our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nAnd dance ski we have hundreds a flatbed and specialized million mile drivers white because if you like driving for a local trucking company with national\nPower than we have a long term home for you to ask you as a family of sixty locally run flatbed specialized companies in communities all across the usa and Canada\nWhere you can put down your roots you on short haul or long haul want to drive our list\nShow the public library will\nFrom ABC News [noise]\nI'm Richard Hatch who [noise]\nMore than two thousand Honduran migrants traveling and mass through Guatemala resume\nTheir truck intent on getting to the U.S three weeks before mid term elections President Trump looking to turn the caravan into a political issue people\nComing up in ... we have to stop them even though the laws that terrible\nIt was a terrible our laws are terrible there laughing stock all over the world the\nPresident has worn Central American government's the risk losing USAID if they do not stop those migrants\nThe president continuing diverge patients while Saudi Arabia says it's investigating the disappearance and suspected murder of dissidents Saudi journalist ...

time away from a and I think the question of how independent you are how free you are is largely a question and out of\nHow much the government takes in taxes yes they can take some then regulation

wanted to ask you what did you think of the tax cut passed by Congress and the president\nIt was a really helpful for ... uh one thing that happened was during the Reagan years we reduced marginal tax rates for people individuals top rate was Seventy percent ... percent during World War two\nA Kennedy took it from Ninety Seventy Reagan took it from ... to twenty eight [noise] unfortunately\nBush and Clinton and Obama raised it back up towards south or over forty percent and uh so at the individual level we began to take the rates down a little bit but business taxes is where the United states was where the line with the rest of the world\nOr the rest of the world started experimenting with lower business taxes low or corporate income taxes when we took our individual rights down and did very well economically\nA lot of Eastern European countries after they left the Soviet Union their individual rights like Fifteen Percent\nHungry it's business tax nine percent we were very ... we had the highest business taxes in the world and then we sat around going how come we can't compete you know with China and Germany and stuff like that in Ireland are lose business taxes twelve and a half percent\nA week what thirty thirty five plus\nAnd uh the Republicans took that down to Twenty one and it made us more competitive on the tax front than most of the country's law\nThe average European country about twenty five ten points better than what we used to be you know we were at thirty five they were twenty five and they would beat us when they send me to take a million dollars I live in Brazil invested ... million dollars what do I put it\nTo invest it and I said those joke thirty five percent of everything I like if I put it in Germany they only take twenty four I don't generally pot and we shifted that down and we're seeing a massive\nA diversion of a foreign direct investment [noise] out of your it denied states\nUh for starters there was a a five hundred billion dollars half a trillion dollars in the last six months which was arranged by American companies overseas and we used to have a lot until the Republican tax reform\nPunished you if you brought me back to the states they left it overseas is\nMaybe three trillion dollars to the left overseas I'm partly because largely because our tax policy said we will hurt you it's going to bring the money back and if you don't bring it back that's okay\nAh show three trillion stuck overseas because of our tax policy and we said you know what we're not doing that anymore\nIf you earn money and I'd stay through taxes but if you earn money in ... the French people take some\nAnd then we are going to bring it back home the America good no taxes no penalty no penalty for bringing like back then I said how 'bout that ad that\nWe've seen a tremendous again half a trillion dollars five billion come back last six months and an apple they said look we have two hundred and Ninety billion dollars of earnings overseas they brought ... billion right back\nJust a way that I play it all back now it's all coming at the right now and they leave that in in a London back because it doesn't matter in terms of our access to capital whether it's in London or in Arkansas are whereas before it did\nShow that money might as well are ready to be back but we've seen a half to try and come back immediately and we'll see more as a as we move forward\nAdded that guy's overseas you know German and French people and a Brazilians making decisions are standing that money to the United states rather overseas is really irritated their pets because we're much more competitive\nThan we used to be and that's been a big help\n[noise] yeah I Know I can see why it seems so obvious all these things seem so obvious to me I have a couple of more questions and we're going to get some of the callers questions for you also but right now we're going to take our in our national forecast for um detracts\nEffect snow off Lake Ontario

chance any\nQuestions or comments you have on taxes Grover Norquist will answer them for you [noise] president the Americans extra for mark on the radio [noise]\n\n\n\nThank you I appreciate it I'll tell you what you get to work right out of my mouth and here's what I've always\nThought flat tax and it's ... percent a cross the port\nIt don't matter whether you're right\nA Warren Buffett or whether you're the guy work down there and got all seven percent you'll eliminate every deep Doug seem that there is\nAs far as they are with the tech fuel eliminate all federal tax whether it's the fuel tax that we pay or whether Social Security\nIncome tax you name but if it's a federal tax it no longer exists you will limit the\nSixteenth ... and that in order to raise taxes if you're going to do it as Congress that means you have to have a super majority of both the house in the Senate to foot the bill on the\nPresident's desk for him to sign up\nFor it be for it to become a\nBallot or election of\nOn every two years that's when they're going to do and it requires a super majority of all register voters in order for the tax\nIt does it come out of your pay check you write the check every month or every quarter\nAnd believe me when people realized how much they're paying out taxis they would they would there would be a revolution in this country like you would not believe 'cause I was self employed and I had to write that check every quarter\nI couldn't believe how much I was having to pay taxes\nInteresting groove or what do you think of that to his idea\nI think he's right and a number of the ideas you put out there are in state constitutions or in California in Nevada or if you if the government wants to raise taxes state government wants to raise taxes\nIt's a two thirds voted legislature because taxes are about as permanent as constitutional amendments which usually take two thirds\nOr to impose on people\nAnd if you say it takes two thirds to raise taxes\nIt really slows with the tax and spend down doesn't stop them completely but it really slow it down it has to be a\nReally good idea it has to have rod support a to an act and it I think a flat tax with a super majority to raise taxes or would dramatically change our policy curious\n\nWhat do you think about some people propose the sales tax consumption tax so what's your response to that\nWell in Europe they have a value added tax which is a sales tax at every step of production if you're going to have a twenty percent sales tax is on the African countries do you really have to you can't just collect it at the supermarket 'cause everybody would buy their stuff then\nDown the street from the supermarket out the back of a truck or so they put that twenty percent at everything\nA lot of the way to get a twenty percent tax but he had little amounts and there's no one place we can avoid\nAh the difference between the United states and Europe is Europe\nAnd has a sales tax of a national sales tax of value added tax which gets every level of a production [noise] ah it's why they have higher taxes than we do they have stupid income taxes they have high income taxes\nBut you can only get so much money out of an income tax people will quit working they'll work around it\nHide money [noise] um when you add to that the difference between the United States Europe is that we don't have that and they do we don't have a sales tax they do some people say no no no we want to\nSweat rather the income tax and have a national sales tax tax\nIn stat well it's kind of what they promised Europeans and the Japanese and the Asians and the Africans when they put that in overseas or it will be in addition to it will not be instead of and if we could and I'm for\nBringing the income tax down towards zero I'm what you want to do is we just spend it not just turn it into a different tax what who cares if you got rid of the income tax and took the exact same amount of money out of ... how would that change anything it's the same amount of money out of your pocket or\nIt it makes you feel better somebody else's writing the check\nBut everything you buy from your house to your car to your to your food dear close would cost more than the taxes would be hidden in that so [noise] um [noise] I think going to a single right tax income tax or and reducing spending is to go to know if you got\nTaxes down enough that you could shift from a ten percent income tax too you know a Fifteen Percent\nMind that but you got to get the government to half its presence size before you could risk of that and you really have to have protections how do we know we're not going to end up with an income tax and the sales tax true many countries have had been hit with that\nAnd there's no incentive and the part of politicians because they get their money campaign contributions right is part of this have you know give me this donation someone in a lower tax this they don't want the things solved eventually right but it would reduce their campaign contributions as being fought on my part\nHaving taxes that are complicated allows politicians to raise money or to protect people bit by bit where everyone's paying up one percent in the same percentage less ... less opportunities to make money for politicians\nAnd lawyers and accountants maybe my final question for you well maybe I've got two more what about the midterm how do you know what do you know if if the Democrats ... take the house what do you think about what's going to happen with the tax situation [noise]\nIf the Democrats take the house there'll be no tax cuts for the next two years or they will be pushing for tax increases that while at least a trillion dollars and higher taxes Hillary ran on raising taxes by a trillion dollars over a decade\nAt least to try and I'm from where we were we cut taxes Detroit and a half they want to raise them I Try and from what we were so that's two and a half trillion dollars in taxes\nPer decade that they wanted to increase taxes belly pushing for that [noise] I I think with both Trump and the Republican Senate that they want to get a tax increase but they'll sit there and say\nHey if you want the military to get paid will only do that will only passed a budget ... ah the soldiers and airmen Tim and buy it if you get me a tax increase they ... they were ...\nUm but Democrats on the tax issue like teenage boys on a Sunday they keep asking for the same thing in different ways they just gather they get it again that keep coming back but they weren't one thing going higher taxes are and they were asked that question\nTwenty different ways of the green taxes it will save the planet all day\nAnd the taxes that only pay the other people a day while we package the same tax increase and as always\nMaybe maybe a new Supreme Court tax to pack the court who knows they can come up with anything you weren't quest talk\nAbout it really I didn't hear that yeah yeah\nI hear a lot of us want to get out of it and they want a repeat of breath proposed a tax for it or even or course prison Americans for tax reform that people get in touch with him\nAt our

I don't know that the guy\nPlaces knew all the rules that were there because they're not even formally umpires but if his glove was straight up and still in the field of play\nIt would have seemed like that was an out but if he tilted his arm back and it was actually already in the stands yes\nThe handed it shouldn't have been in and out\nBecause it wasn't on the field of play anymore\nAnd so there's a million ways once again I Know it's splitting hairs but it was a tremendous game the lead kept going back and forth every time that used to it would come back\nAnd get them one run leave immediately um Boston would counter\nAnd get back and it was great it ... it was really a great game one of the class of games I Would say of all times final score not a pitcher stole eight to six

him\nYeah that has its more as I said the for profit kind of like trade schools rain like last year more than a hundred and six sixty thousand\nPeople have claimed to the government at their school to fraud them and new applications continue to pour in I'm sure they will almost all the complaints come from for profit schools of which there are some seven thousand around the country to thousands sixteen\nOr the Obama administration announced the regulation aimed at canceling the dead of those with degrees from schools that misled or deceived them\nNow with ... into every life a little rain must fall because well this is a fair ruling I said okay if you get what about this but that you paid for but out in the back into that\nYou could very well and I don't know if this regulation covers this but\nHistorically if you were able to get your loan canceled for whatever reason and there are some uh situations where that is possible you were also at the end of the year charged the income tax on that money going I don't\nKnow that a little bit but but before we get to that point mhm okay once again here's the problem okay the system is set up that when you apply for that bone to Goto Joe's cosmetology school okay\nAnd it's going to cause two years or cooking school or whatever it is and for those two years it's going to cost you ten thousand and tuition\nYes okay so they actually give that school that money yeah and his band up front what they need to do first of all is do it like you would do it with the college and that is pay for each semester\nIn other words right if it's a two year school the government should first give them a check for a quarter of that when I went back to school at thirty that's how we're done camping but the problem they got in was they were doing it in one lump sum so I could say\nLet's open the rod stole school of flying okay and if we get a government you have to get a government certification yeah that makes you eligible for student loan ... okay yes that's like more important to you\nThan having an office ... and having a staff it's more important to you than having an airplane okay because the minute that you get that certification\nThat means you can bring in students who will give you a check from the federal government\nYes they will supply the money for your visitors it's almost like a business loan\nIn a way you know to the student I had never thought about it that way but I think\nSo and what they need to do is not pay for the whole show a mobs all paid for by semester sure or something like that to make sure that the school lives up to it's part of the contract they didn't do that now once again\nI hadn't even really thought about that angle of it but you're absolutely right\nI don't know how smart you are there are people listening to us today who have PHD's there are people is\nAnd we make a lot of fun of them because they take jokes pretty well because they're wealthy\nThey're called lawyers

presidents guy's hands full campaigning to make sure the midterms are not a disaster in fact you can retain or his advantage in the Senate\nWell as the house he's going to be working hard but at the same time he's got to deal with an international crisis not of is doing but a lot of pressure on him to make the right choice when it comes to what's going on with Saudi Arabia and what may or may not have taken place in the Saudi embassy in Turkey but the reports we're getting or so\nThey want medieval on them [noise] so having said that I Hope to see everybody in Tampa on friday night I don't care where you are you have plenty of time to get there if not go to Virginia Beach on Saturday and then on Sunday in the afternoon in Nashville or America great from the start you going to go in

Andrew Jackson the miracle of New Orleans which is going to be released on Tuesday but you'll get it early with the price of your ticket so let's get to the big three\nNow with the thing is things you need to know\nPower of three Brian's big number three\nOf the economy should benefit the Republicans but the healthcare overwhelmingly advantages Democrats now that may not be that may not work in the individual races\nBut that is called ... man he knows who submit to impose pain to issues as make or break for the Dems and the G O P Trump and healthcare we go inside the numbers in issues with election day Nineteen days away the\nNumber I think two words are going to define the night of the two thousand Eighteen election and an extreme which one is Kevin ... and the other is caravan\nYeah and let's focus on that caravan and illegal immigration is getting closer and closer and picking up passengers\nYou at four thousand a would be illegal immigrants if they try to get into our country coming from Honduras they busted through the border of Guatemala can Mexico stop them before they hit America regardless there's another surgeon at the border even without this caravan\nAnd we because Congress are virtually helpless number one\nYou know we need Saudi Arabia in terms of uh our fight against all of the terrorism efforts\nA sadly the king is probably out of it are these evidently very removed from day to day decisions but the prince says his fingerprints all over it Chris Yogi\nYes Chris Yogi killed and it's now becoming clear he was tortured to I have an idea let's be honest Saudi Arabia you kill them and America must make them pay the price well knowing a big breakup won't work for anyone except of course Iran and that's where we'll begin\n... looks like a good show he was taken in a to the embassy on his own bullet she wanted to get a divorce and get married and when he didn't show up at lunch they knew there was a problem men was there a problem according to the audio that has been released a not been released but been reported\nA evidently he came in they grabbed him almost immediately\nAnd chopped off his fingers walk questioning him and then gradually would kill him there is a report that they used asset to basically burn up his body but first they had basically more teaching in there with a bone saw to chop them up\nI just right for\nI talk to\nI'm not giving covered\nWith that being said Saudi Arabia has been\nA very important ally of ours in the middle east if you look in Saudi Arabia there in LA and there was tremendous purchaser of not only military equipment but other things what I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of things so there are an important ally but I Want to find out what happened\nWhere is this fall and we'll probably know that by the end of the way for Mike Pompeo is coming back we're gonna have a logged off\nI have nothing against the president taking his time but man I have never seen a case with such overwhelming evidence ever that means so much but John Roberts is always there to put it all in perspective he's seen it all lived at all and there's been\nYou are Fox News's cheap White House correspondent did I get your title correct you did and I think\nThere'll be a something something a little extra and your pack it this way for\nDoing this on this this thirty three year old who sixty minutes says with his revolutionary leader and was impressing everyone by letting women drive on their own which I'm against here and you know I fought against that I don't think women should be driving in America I'm only kidding\nYou Brian around anymore\nNo you can't you can't get around and they were ... do we miss characterized this guy if this is true\nIllicit if that if the prints in Sleeping Beauty is is being criticized for the kiss that will occur uh I don't know where we\nGo I have no shot but let's say let's talk about this I mean right now I I Know what the administration saying we have a lot on the line here and the president plays all his cards in front of you which we're not used to vote but it is overwhelming what's coming out now isn't it\nAh I mean it really is it ... there's there's there's no question that something is is going on here and it's going on if not at the highest levels at least in an orbit that is very close to the highest levels\nI mean if you look at the Fifteen people that turkey has said we're responsible for the disappearance of the alleged murder of democracy ...\nA number of those people up to nine or ten of them are a very much involved with the Saudi royal family in terms of security than this one fellow uh bought her abilities moot trap\nA he said to be an intelligence agency for the Saudi intelligence services so this this is getting very close to the orbit of Mohammed bin selmont and as you pointed out there's this contradiction here because he has liberalize some of the policies in Saudi Arabia\nOr but at the same time he has a you know I take it a lot of people who he said when\nWell and if he is in any way involved with the disappearance in alleged murder of democracy Yogi that is going to be a serious blow to us Saudi relations particularly since NBS as he's known is expected to take over from king saw him on in the not too distant future\nSo the word is they're trying to find a way forward here let alone the has the details come out that it cause Yogi if this is all through and the audio reveals\nHe was tortured interrogated fingers cut off while alive and there was a report did a to chop up his body he urged everybody to put on music while they did it\n[noise] yeah and and the fact that the ah [noise] ah the Saudi console\nUh Mohammed ... is a allegedly a herd on on tape it saying don't do this here take it outside you're going to get me in trouble in another voice on this alleged audio recording says shut up if you want to make it back to Saudi Arabia alive\nI made it definitely seems like like something very horrific took place inside the Saudi consulate and then there's this idea that cleaning crew was in there just before forensic experts came in there where walls that were re painted but you know if you're if you're a good forensic expert and and this is not just from watching\nUh you know and see I S a but if you're a good forensic expert you can you can find traces of of blood in places where you would think that you would be able to it's very very difficult to clean it up if you know what you're doing\nJohn how you explain this type of miscalculation if all this is true with ... I think that they think they could get away with it\nThink it's I mean have you know you're dealing with the society that for years has disappeared enemies and it's not it's not just Saudi Arabia it's just so many other places ah you know I I I I think I think Louisiana Senator John Kennedy who is ... is is known for his colorful language\nI trust gas station sushi you know there are there is a a long you know thousands year long history of dealing with your enemies in\nIn various met evil ways and uh I I think that this may be another case of that I don't know who or why they thought that they could get away with it but but somebody clearly thought that they could\nSo what's the way forward here in the revolution prove current uh revelations proved correct there's not going to be much time for the White House or for Saudi Arabia\nAnd this is why many people are saying that this is one of the most important decisions how he handles this will be one of the most important decisions that President Trump makes because you can can you just let it ... if if this was involved with the highest levels how do you just let them get away with it and if you have to do something\nWhat is it that you do because you've got in the overall a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of\nA military arms deals are going with Saudi Arabia that means tens of thousands of jobs for companies like Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Raytheon and and Boeing\nAnd then there is you know a greater trade relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia the president said the overall value of the deals that they signed last year was four hundred and fifty billion dollars and then you have to have Saudi Arabia's cooperation in the war on terror you've got to have them standing as a bulwark against the Iranian\nExpansionist um I'd ideas\nAnd and then you've got this idea of oil everybody says well you know America's become the number one oil producer\nIn the world you know that's that may be all well and good but you shut down the Saudi oil supply and you watch how fast the price of gas a gallon or the ... how fast the price of gallon of gasoline jumped so it's a very very important relationship\nAnd uh how the president deals with is he's he's going to have a very very difficult needle to thread\nRight I mean if he came out and say hey by the way of bringing up relations and no one would push back in the republic\nIt's time for the prince to step aside princes don't usually do that I studied a lot of prince tech upbringing I think the chances\nAre modern been Solomon stepping aside and prints naive suddenly becoming the crown prince again I I I think is highly unlikely\nYou look for the president went after me to take a Tuesday bump able to make a statement on this today\nTom if not the president or it may be possible for ... to come out and say something he did come out the other day and say something\nAh after ah he had had a meeting with the president so uh we'll see as as always our Brian you never know what's going to happen with this White House I mean the president woke up this morning and threatened to put the the US military on the southern border to close it if Mexico didn't do something about this caravan of of Hondurans which seems\nAwfully conspicuously timed considering we're three weeks away from the mid term elections\nSo I'm getting a somewhere that Venezuela actually might be behind is is that what you're hearing guy I don't know yet I don't know do you want to just do agree with me and make me feel\nLike I could I could I could do that and probably be pretty safe ground\nOr you could say it's impossible at this point a to a ... a John what's on the agenda today\nWhat can the president woke up this morning and drove the news cycle by saying that he might put the U.S military on the southern border to close it if\nA rise go doesn't do something about this Honduran care what he's going to Montana right ho though that he has he's going to Montana and that he's going to Arizona [noise] ah and\nThen after that he's going to Nevada so I you know he's he's got to be away from the White House for three days but even when the president is away there's still a ton of news coming out of here so\nRight uh we we can't afford to be away for a second by\nSomebody else is raising the John Roberts family uh I mean I Would I Would\nBe coaching my son's little league baseball team but unfortunately\nRight kids can't play because of the president that's\nUh that was an interesting hit I think John regrets

J. in uh in Arizona Fred\nIf you're doing Brian Greene a I agree with the previous caller I mean you have to look at it from a purely analytical basis who benefits from this instability between us and the and Saudi Arabia [noise]\nThere are many enemies of states who are very happy with this situation or very close with people in Saudi Arabia or\nYou know what I Would love bread you know what I

made those recordings how have they been a fan of ... these are things that we can make major decisions on without having a\nPool and you're in front of the ... the president agrees with you I've read by the way or the president has come out with a policy he hasn't come out with the position he's still collecting information I he evidently is not willing to share cut to\nLast for being on your radio and television or we have this or even exists whereas than than we've asked for it if it exists and I'm not sure yet that didn't exist probably does possibly does uh I'll have a full report on that from Mike when he comes back for that one of the things I\nVery that's going to be the first question I asked\nYou up a so he's got to hold these cards like you are Fred but when when the Graham came in and you know his own arm services gets a lotta information as well as tapped into the White House said this how\nDo I engage Saudi Arabia when NBS the de facto leader of the country is this brazen district disrespectful for the international norms that we fight for he is toxic there's no way we can move forward uh I don't I Would suspend arms sales as long as he's in charge\nYeah here's Bob Corker\nHad an alliance with them but look it's a it's going to be hugely damaged and uh I Know that Congress there at the lowest point with Congress that they've ever ban since I've been hearing them I've been up by the way of a friend of Saudi Arabia is okay I've tried I've tried to\nThis point I Would not be successful and that on the floor to die and I don't know that I wouldn't even

of big stories first of all a last night it was on the Fox news channel that Newt Gingrich said that the two big issues\nCome the midterm elections which are less than three weeks away our capital and the treatment up him by the Democrats will motivate\nThe Republicans to get out to vote meanwhile the fact that he got through Mr Kaplan I did that will motivate Democrats to get out and vote as part of the resistance so you got Kavanaugh as a motive motivating factor according to Newt Gingrich and then you've got\nThe caravan and have you seen this\nIt all started a down in Guatemala on friday with a hundred and sixty migrants\nAnd uh apparently they said we're going to try to take the same track that they took in April when thousands or almost a thousand migrants were heading through Central America\nTo the United states and Donald Trump warns Central American governments hey you're better turn off but a flow of migrants or else\nGives to all these nations it's substantial [noise]\nSo what is different this time than last time is the fact that now you got Honduras and Guatemala and they're both saying hey ah you know what if you're in the migrant um march toward the north a turnaround come on back because\nYou're breaking the law essentially [noise] uh but the big thing that bothers a lot of Americans is the fact that the borders between these nations are invisible and they're simply not enforced [noise]\nBut now we understand from Mexico which has sent or something like five hundred security personnel to their southern border in Mexico between Mexico and Guatemala [noise]\nUh unless you've got the proper papers they're not going to let people through nonetheless the president\nHas given the fact that it is just less than three weeks away from the

[noise]\nSo I'm very worried\nThat the president seems to have a love affair with autocrats\nPresident Trump Trump President Trump on the idea that he's already\nMaking excuses before the facts you know it's a\nTypical but it hurts us internationally\nThat is the former vice president of the United states Joe Biden on CBS or talking a little bit about the president and he uses judgment of how he's dealing with this disaster this political disaster over in Saudi Arabia\nAnd turkey regarding the missing Washington Post columnist or the president ... so what's he going to do is it going to crack down on Saudi Arabia let's deal in rich Lowry he is\nI uh how's it going it it must be a lot of pressure big big shoes\nTo fill ... kilometers out ... yeah ... ... I couldn't sleep less [laughter]\nI was just hoping you know what am I going to do for the first twenty four minutes until a rich Lowry comes on ...\nYeah okay All right I'll Bailey out so it'll be radio magic now I I think\nSo far so good uh what do you think about the president in how we said you know let's not be too fast to blame the Saudis regarding the missing guy\nSo I I don't mind the an attitude let let's wait and see all the facts what I Do think the president has seemed\nTo be too eager to accept\n'em a cover story from the Saudis yep so I don't I don't think that's the appropriate public posture\nAnd uh apparently Pam ... reporting in ... was quite tough than his private meetings with the Saudis so I mean this is the difficulty it it seems clear is they deliberately set out to murder this guy and the most hideous way you know out of a Quentin Tarantino\nMovies yeah and we're each day should condemn them there should be some sort of consequence but you don't want to destabilize the regime because this although I think the Saudis are bastards is is probably the best we can hope for\nUm in terms of the government and Saudi Arabia and to their an important ally and you know forced to choose between the Iranians in ... which we are you know on a daily basis you go with the Saudis\nEven though they're imperfect and repressive and murderous but I I just this is such an addition to being a crime is such a blunder I don't know figure I can come into your consulate and not leave and no one's going to notice well\nAnd and it makes you wonder has this ever happened before do does this happened to guys who simply aren't where an apple watches and and somebody's ...\nA brazen a man or a overseas so it's bad you know the the reputation of the crown prince will never be the same\nUm but you know where we can't overthrow the Saudi Government and create a liberal liberal government they're just the conditions aren't there for that that we have to deal with reality as it is\nAnd that's where I think you know Trump has represented a correction to an over emphasis on idealism you know in the Bush years he just has to guard against going out swinging too far and the other direction\nSure and of course everybody's hanging on everything he says because we are less than three weeks away from the midterms and you know the Republicans are terrified that they're going to lose the house there's certain it looks like they could actually picked up some seats in the Senate but that's another story\nRegarding the midterms what is on your radar as something that could break a either way for either side and the next three weeks\n[noise] I I don't know it would would be inherently in some sort of surprised what about the Caribbean\nUm it it could yet could could help energize the Republican voters I'm just so the question is clearly that the gap in the cabinet fight was galvanizing Republicans increase their energy which is hugely important and transformed um a couple of these\nSenate races where it looks almost impossible to me now that Republicans could lose nominal control I think they have at least you know the worst cases fifty fifty were Pence's tie breaker\nUm but the question is does that energy you know last that the next three weeks so there's something like you know crisis over the care of and maybe that\nHelps the problem in the house is just the these um districts that Clinton won that are occupied by Republicans are really endangered the ones where the Republican incumbent has retired there by eight of them are basically gone even Republicans admit they're they're gone and that gets you you know eight eight seats towards just twenty three they need that\nUh we had Eric Trump on Fox in front of this morning and he said look if the Democrats when we're going to be a lot of investigations into you know\nThe Trump Administration the Trump family everybody he said uh but then again when you look at what the Republicans have been able to achieve with a Republican president\nTheir record his body you know the president really wanted to build the wall ... you know they're barely building the fence or you want to get rid of Obamacare So it's not like a Republican led Congress is helping them\n[noise] yeah so they did attack which is which which is a big deal but otherwise most of the important things have happened through executive action and through regulatory actions so that the downside of Democrats taking the houses were on you you you know what the other party to take power period\nBut um as Eric I'm pointed out they'll you know some kids spend all their times the painting the president and they ... and investigating and try to make everyone's life miserable it's possible that is just that they have a one majority in if there's any kind of majority if they get you know Fifteen it's yeah like a wave Fifteen votes they're going to impeach\nToo yeah you're probably right hey rich Lowry thank you very much for joining us today here on the brain you'll need radio show\n\n\nInteresting challenge dog almost seven billion chaotic find to I'm going to teach me the station [noise]\n... not the only time it's been happening they need to watch it\nIt you know there's a lot going on uh who knows it could be just one of those during grim one's a logical stuff can help him one of my kids were kind of a key to his right now he or she is in a country Massachusetts do things for doing this on the brink ... radio show\nHey how's it going it's ... ... what are you what do you make of one of the other things we were talking with a rich Lowry about a little while ago is what's going on in Saudi Arabia\nThat he's hit men decapitated and take the fingers off of and then just chill or this Washington Post correspondent a rather a columnist in Turkey\nWhat ... what do you think about what is going on with that dynamic because so many people here in the United states Keith are asking the president in the United states get tough and do something about Saudi Arabia\nWell and what happens unfortunate if it happened we need to get to the facts of course however I think applying sanctions in this situation would be rather inconsistent\nI mean if we're going to do it the one we should do it to all and I mean just this past August we at Iran order seven journalist to be jailed and flogging awake at our coverage\nChina just in February detained relatives of three United States and journalists Andy you ask a green card holder for their coverage a serene a sham she was an American journalist who in twenty fourteen was killed by the Turkish government the drug and regime after the two days after the accuser and being a spy\nOn I mean in fact turkey under their German regime they've been one of the worst offenders when it comes to journalism direction\nNow are we supposed to really expect an honest investigation from the like the turkey if so that would be akin to giving credibility to Russia's investigation into the poisoning of Sergei scrape\nOff what do you make an interesting point you know the president's in a pickle it's it's a damned if you do damned if you don't we're gonna have to see what he does\nHe think he very much for joining us here in the Bronx ... meanwhile over on the news maker line we've got congressman Rodney Davis he served proudly the thirteenth district of the great state of Illinois Republican and he's on the house committee on agriculture and the chair of the subcommittee on biotechnology\nCongressmen or thanks for joining us here on the brink kill me Joe\nHey Steve thanks for having me are\nIt's a real pleasure hey listen ah I hear that the vice president was out at a rally for you ah what about a week ago right\nYou know he was he came out to Springfield, Illinois\nPets caged wants to help every Republican get elected but we got to get everybody the polls and he knows\nHe does know it and that's why he said this about you listen\nThere is a choice vision the people of Illinois searching okay\nTo make no mistake about it it's not just a choice between your congressman and his opponent but also it's a it's a choice between two futures in Congress itself\nI mean the truth the matter is that the Illinois Thirteen may be the district that decides whether or not we ever Republican majority or whether Nancy Pelosi speaker of the house and the next Congress and I just know in my heart here in central Illinois\nYou're going to choose results you're going to choose\nMore prosperity and I know in my heart the people of central Illinois are going to support Rodney Davis [noise]\nWhether you've got the vice president saying some very nice things you know congressman so many people think oh Illinois a that's a completely blue state that is not the case there\nAre absolutely not downstate Illinois could ever many states throughout this nation where Republicans are are winning re air winning seats in areas that they even Democrat or legislators drew to a lot of Democrats said we've got to get those voters to the cold and it's humbling to hear\nA vice president Pence said those words I was there when he hid it of course but here again a kind of you know tears me up a little bit but it also it puts a perspective on the fight ... eh we're fighting ... ever get set speakers cowboy cat\nI Know that is one of the things you're saying out on the stump what when you talk to people that I Know you've shaken a thousands of hands over the last couple of weeks trying to get out the vote for November the six what is the is there one motivating\nFactor for Republicans or independent to lean your way who are Democrats even who who may vote for you on the first Tuesday in November something that's gonna motive\nSure and so when I go shake hands in in whatever town that I'm blessed enough to represent I meet folks I just sat down with a group of senior class students in ... Illinois and the issues that they are most concerned about are usually local to them but when you you look at the national issues\nThat they move on to next and a lot of it has to do with fear in the fear of Democrats taking over and what is\nWhat is Congress going to look like it's man see polo see as speaker is Jerry ... is chair of the Judiciary Committee\nBecause I don't think there's any way with the flooded the left wing dollars coming in by the billions he lived in my district that they're going to hold off from teaching the president in ... Supreme Court justice and that is not how we keep the economy moving forward impeachment will\nOnly stalled progress that we've seen working with this administration\nCongressmen I wanted to ask you about a there's an ad that is being run by your democratic opponent Betsy monitoring a dead essentially I Know you feel it crosses the line because it takes shots at your family\nYou know it really does Steve my\nYou know my wife is at night to your cause cancer survivor\nI sat across the table from the vice president the president while we were trying to reform health care and my number one concern was making sure we add layers of protections for pre existing conditions have been attacked by my opponent for wanting to take that away from Americans and her allies and\nAn ad that was just recently brought\nIt took pictures up by a wife and my kids and used it in a negative ad against hey you can say whatever you want about me I stood up and ran for Congress to keep my kids out of it that's just something that cross the line and I don't think any candidate for Congress Republican or Democrat deserves what what happened to be right there\nNo kidding you know um that is over the line and that's just one of those things that so many people\nUp to her and said I perjure story I just wanted to give you a hug I'm sure you've gotten it from your wife but she's not the public figure and she and I I don't know of any Republicans congressmen who we're talking about\nIt as we try to do something about our health care situation to get rid of the uh pre existing conditions a provision say or our insurance companies have\nNo none of us are in no and it's a matter of fact the American health care act has has a line in there that says that nothing in this actual take away preexisting condition coverage I mean it's in the bill and it's been scored four Pinocchio\nFact checkers and it's just an hour at my opponent or allies have doubled down on the sly and it offends people like my wife\nBecause health care isn't just a political talking points to us it's just like you and your your wife it's personal Steelers\nAbsolutely well congressman I Know you're in a fight

there and important strategic\nAlliance the United states we need to be mindful of that as well\n[noise] okay so uh it's pretty clear from what the secretary of state said right there the direction this is going\nIt sounds like it sounds like according to what we've heard so far the crown prince uh was involved in order to take out this could show you a Saudi citizen a U.S resident who worked at the Washington Post as a columnist very critical of the Saudi regime\nIt sounds like by the fact that ah Mr ... said he told the president to give the Saudis a few more days to investigate or they're trying to figure a way out of this but it has been suggested that since uh the crown prince\nWhich sounds like order the hit on Mr ... uh the current print print has a number of other ...\nAnd uh although he probably wouldn't be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia they need somebody else to take over and it would probably be one of his brothers and they're just trying to figure out the best way to do that because of the virtue of of what Mr Pompeo said there they are an important ally so in other words we're not going to sever relations with the\nAh Saudi Arabia would simply got to figure out how

the not too distant future as an incredible that were already talking about that but um anyway and the men dish enthusiasm that\n[noise] they got the president of the United states states are speaking on Fox Business about the importance\nOf mid terms and that's one of the big things we're talking about you're on the brink kill me radio show today we're talking about the midterms we are talking about the the pickle of the president's in regarding\nSaudi Arabia because it looks like part of the royal family might a order they hit on that guy and the other thing we're talking about that

a ... helping raise some money ... it's a winnable district\nWell there you go All right Rob thank you very much now let's go to Larry he's retired military Larry what do you make of the president's suggesting today that if the country of Mexico doesn't stop these four thousand migrants the president should use the military and close our southern border\nWell thanks for taking my call you bet well first of all I'm we know that first of all we know that\nHe has the authority to do so I'm as commander in chief that's in the article to the constitution a section one I Believe based on his oath a particle\nTo section and a three says she'll take care of that the laws are faithfully executed under under under the tenth amendment he also a there was also written decision concerning Arizona if you recall the business of immigration it belongs to the federal government\nAbsolutely and that's why that's why it's so important that the president United States enact and enforce the laws on the books unfortunately and you know this Larry past presidents simply have not done that\nExactly yeah so I think well I think under Obama was called the something to do with his discretion in in the forcing the laws\nI drink and and President Trump is using his discretion to enforce them or are you so you're a hundred percent okay with the military going down to their southern border\nCertainly certainly and in that end of it\nThat one that won the premise is false everything that follows it must be false and believing anything that that individual or any of the Democrat but politicians say about immigration is really the like put shoes on a dead horse\nIs still there you go All right Larry thank you very much for the call and thank you for your service now let's go to a Columbia South Carolina Rick joins is he listens in on W. cue X. L. Rick thanks for joining us right now you feel the same way about the president using military at the border right\nTotally I'm totally in favor of that as President Trump's number one job is to protect the borders of the United states to protect our country and with regard to the ... incident um\nThe bottom line is to show he was not an American citizen and that a crime that alleged crime did not even take place on American soil so I don't even see what we have any legal standing to get involved with that sure it's an outrage and a terrible thing to happen\nBut ... is not an American citizen and I don't believe in a slap in sanctions on a country like Saudi Arabia and hurting the American economy I don't like go into the gas pump and having to pay three or four more dollars per gallon of gasoline\nYou walk into that conflict of his own volition it was a stupid thing to do well there's not an American citizen well I don't\nThink he was a count on getting murdered in there but uh it it is a quandary for the administration to figure out what to do Rick thank you very much well let's go to Jerry in Nashville Jerry um you you feel the same way what what what's the deal with the show the right\nExactly I feel the same way you know Russia through the drive by shooting of a reporter over there and we didn't have to put on a bunch of sanctions would stalk Kim Jong il and Charles is older relatives and and you know we didn't have to get involved with that China is actually currently\nOh it is a quite a situation and it'll be interesting to see what the president does Mike Pompeo told the president give the Saudis a few more days to investigate because they are one of our most important nowadays which is kind of what you guys are saying All right I'm CBC\nFilling in for ... we will return to a couple of minutes right here on the radio [noise]\n\nInteresting challenge [noise] I'd talk show host point seven million chaotic flying to I'm going to teach me the gas station [noise]\nIllegal activity why would they stop\nI mean so this is Congress ultimate failure and and that's why it's so important that you know Republicans maintain control both houses of Congress because if if if they don't it's only going to get worse\nBecause I think there are a majority Republican support Donald Trump in his immigration policies in a border wall another thing Congress these addresses the asylum a lot of people come and claim asylum and uh\nThat they're coached by their quota organizations say a few key phrases which gets approved at the border or once they show up in court if they show up at court eighty percent of the lose your cases so what Congress needs to do is raise that asylum ... or so they can't easily meant so much thought\nYeah Tom we're speaking at a time home in a former acting high stricter about this Caribbean ... be a president in Honduras said that there are unnamed political groups that have organized and they say other sectors that want to destabilize the country but we will be decisive and we will not allow it\nHe's suggesting politics are involved to make a Honduras look bad but at the same time people are doing the political calculations here in the United states and they're going\nLet's see there about a thousand miles away they maybe they could be and our southern border around time of the midterms and then we've got that whole ... separating families thing all over again\nBecause I knew a story for years I certainly do\nOn that far out from American people are paying attention this isn't Trump's a President Trump's failure this isn't Republican Congress scarier this is the Democrats younger so you know bottom line that\nPresident Trump he wants to do the right thing he wants to close to the polls you've heard him say it many times or their speeches he he's he's he's back Congress to close loopholes you said many times worse immigration laws in the world's log that's true so this I ... I think it's going back for I think the American people pay attention are Porter right now\nIs not secure and I think if you listen to those on the hill you know\nWe do abolish ice a\nYou know it's all about the family separation at least let me tell you about St family separation\nNo one likes to see families separated I get it\nBut because of what's going on right now if Congress don't make the change of these people do get to our border either we just open the border up a little keep coming back in ... in the hundreds of thousands in the past year full or we all we do prosecute those enter the country legally\nAnd separate them just like we separate American families when their parents get arrested sure I mean that in ... and let me tell you that during the family separation only\nA couple of weeks they did that that the numbers on the border dropped twenty two percent\nSo you know it it does work it shows a consequence and deterrent still illegal activity works and the third thing when you talk about\nIs Congress hasn't funded ice the proper levels they needed fifty one thousand beds right now the proposes forty thousand bachelor given ice ten thousand less ... which means that people that you do get a recipe book Joel allowed not going to be released so there's no place to put them so Congress has failed on all sides\nWill you know because he is a political issue the Republicans are saying look a come midterms it's a binary choice either a if you want open borders both for the Democrats if you want a strong security at the southern border to vote for Republican\nAnd I talk about immigration because uh you know we don't have a a really good story on there to counter the Republicans saying do you want a strong border or not [noise]\nBall it's I I I don't think the American public's going to be fooled by this law if they want to ... they're not talking about right now\n'cause they know it's gonna hurt but bottom line is polishing ice you could open borders because you're lucky to get by the border patrol and you get into nine states no one's looking for you there is no ice so you know I I think that the curtains been pulled back on them they're open border Canada\nAnd they can talk about it but they're they're actually speak louder than words or the let me say is better or not action speaks louder than words it's American people want to secure border and American people want to know this ... at a A R summers teach remains then they got the right parts of the office\nAnd they need to make sure that like parties and offers to maintain the president's agenda\n[noise] you know the president does have a lot of discretion when it comes to immigration as we've learned over the last two years going forward in the last two years of this first term of Donald Trump\nOr Tom Homan what else can the president do to a perhaps tighten up some of those loopholes or get rid of him or or just make the seat the our southern border a little more secure than it is right now\nWell I think we I think uh the wall to wall is necessary replaced\nAnd I've been around a long time I was in a bar to like you said back in eighty four eighty five and six and we used to wrestle thousand aliens night\nOn the same she'd go down the soccer field once it put a border barrier up those numbers draft where decreased they put a barrier in El Paso but wanted to sign that don't\nWant to know central every place to build a barrier that illegal immigration has decreased so that you know despite all the rhetoric out there that wall actually works as strong as photo illegal immigration is long slow down the road\nTo citizens there's no downside unless drops and turn this country there's no downside unless it was ... rations\nAfter truly for low level boat low level low skilled labor than Congress he's a fix it last night some sort of worker visa but to keep growing the criminal organizations to smuggle these people in the United states is what we're doing that that's something we don't talk about this isn't just an illegal immigration problem Steve who did this when when when\nIt was the immigrants are a criminal organization to smuggle them to work thanks very organization that will smoke John's assaulted Raj they all try to pay a tax when they worked two cartels plaza\nWhen when a criminal organization smokeless people to the plaza cartel owns that area you got to pay the cartel taxes so this this is not just yeah it was the immigration issue this national security as\nWell and the other thing is and this is something that we don't pay enough attention to because it's like it's a political thing they tightened the border you don't\nBut this is a ... about the tens of thousands of men and women in our southern border who put their lives on the line each and every day when they go to do their job and you know if there's a cartel trying to smuggle people across if need be they don't mind killing a border patrol agent\nY'all and matter of fact you know the um ah ah\nLast night or the night before last I was actually had a ball Joe foundation dinner in Washington DC 'cause I I still are bought let them twenty thousand American patriots as you said a stand on the line every day protect this country about what you say and I met a lot of families have fallen bought choice\nAnd so like I said last night that people don't want to build a smaller close loopholes for president than certainly do it for the men and women who died a defining destination there's there's over there there's a couple\nNames on that national law enforcement moral walk down the street more we work and if anybody questions the integrity and the brave men and women a pork chop simply walked at Wall Street than it is so this is about protecting his country and and and and taking care of the board\nOne thing I'll ... I'll be tied up changing diapers to cure these families the cartels will will push\nA large population of families across one sector the border dropped the ball was tied up with them they're pushing drugs to an area where they know poor chosen to respond to stand that crisis is that is that is proven intelligence reports for the last few years so this is ... just going to face up to and\nSo you are so right about that Tom Homan thank you very much we know you're very busy these days a former acting ice director Thomas Homan on the newspaper line sir thank you very much for the ...\nOr it was a pleasure and thanks for your service or listen we're going to take a we've got lots more show to go in this hour of the brain ... radio show we want to hear your opinions on the caravan our southern border also could show gay or the midterms you name it are you going to be the producer the final twelve minutes of the Brian ... radio show\nRadio show up people for the people you are with Brian kill made [noise]\n\nYou know what's not smart job sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes but you know what is smart zip recruited dot com slash Brian ... dot com slash B.

B. let's go down to Tyler, Texas Jared you're on the show\nI just wanted to say a long time called a long time listener first time caller love your show thing okay so ... about this about to send in the military thing down a Texas has been experimenting with that issue with the national guard and stuff and I personally think having served that ten years active service or eight of the trade to as a drill sorry\nIf he's if the president's going to send troops to the border to stop this care of it ... it has to be active service members we have the experience over a decade of the conflict in the middle east and uh yeah\nMiserable war ... and I want you to explain to to our listeners a big ... they may not understand why ... why not use the national guard why does why do we need the why do we need the army or at the border\nI mean it's not going to get in that regard I have mass or effect for yo thing\nBut active service members we did a ... kind of thing every day we have the training for it and it's something that worked out for you know over a decade in the middle east because of traffic troll points out we prevent smuggling trafficking so it's something that we do on the regular basis and I mean if you're if you're gonna\nIf you're going to have a large job you might as well call the professionals is not the\n... and ... no I I I Do know what you mean and this this report on on Fox News ah Jared is really striking hum immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they're having to release illegals\nAnd asylum seekers in Arizona because they run out of space so far in two thousand Eighteen more than Ninety thousand family units\nHave been detained more than forty five thousand\nUnaccompanied minors I mean we're talking about large size cities here uh people coming across that border [noise]\n[noise]\nUnbelievable ... the telephone call thank you and you know that's that's a that's a good thoughts boat some ... and again I I think at this point if you've got\nI mean we're looking what Ninety thousand family units they're not ... so they're not telling us how many exactly but let's just say that you've got a mom and a and a dad and a kid or two I mean you're looking at city sized those or medium sized cities of people that are coming across the border\nWe cannot afford that in this country triple eight seven eight nine nine what zero our telephone number that's triple eight seven eight nine nine one zero let's go to Knoxville\nPaul I one hundred percent agree we need to send a military there because I also I think President Trump used as a secular border power to sand as much as Obama stuff as he can I don't\nKnow why hasn't gone to the Supreme Court on this or a style and saying why can't the president just shut down the hall asylum program until we get control of the border that these people don't deserve asylum they're just coming across the border illegally come on\nWell ... that's what they're doing Charlie and they will be moved you know your um gosh it was Phil Bredesen or who's though you guys have a pretty crazy Senate race underway\nPhil Bredesen was responsible for removing tens of thousands of people are into into Tennessee and that's what's happening here is their relocating many of these illegals into an to other states that are not border states\nThat makes us a national problem and Charlie when you can you can you imagine how many of your tax dollars are being used to take care of these people\nFall it's time to call the Democrats blood they play poker and every time the Republicans bowl this time I make it a campaign issue send the military down there shut down the border drive the comics nuts and see if we can't\nPush some of these conservative turnout and for those\nPolls are wrong I just don't believe the polls are correct we need to get out and prove them wrong and have a huge red wave and November\nI'm with you Charlie I'm ... and I never put ... I never put much trust in the polling data but but all the polls seem to indicate the same thing that does have made a little worried but we can fix that like you said by telling people to get out and vote Charlie appreciate the telephone call real quick let's go to essence\nListening to us in alliance Nebraska essence walked into the program\nFor voters to have to the border so if we pray trades go to a toward the border to help out we need to go vote first that they have a great day\nWell that's what it says is short and to the point there but she's got a lot she's got a good point we played what was it yesterday day before yesterday we had the um the the Democrat running for governor in ah in Georgia [noise]\nAnd uh she was at a campaign stop and she admitted it she says hey this big blue wave we're talking about well that includes all of the illegal aliens coming across the border so maybe maybe just maybe this is the the October surprise maybe this was the surprise that the Democrats want to use these people\nAnd uh to to get out the vote\nWelcome to America here's your voting card\nI mean it's it's not out of the realm of possibility because we know what's been happening already [noise]\nAnd the Democrats will stop at nothing\nTo take down Donald Trump and the Republicans we know that All right we've got more of your calls coming up this hour folks triple

down to ... uh for Twenty years the exchange rate spend about twelve a so so that's all I'm like I said put money down there it was that she and almost twenty tastes so that was you know you ...\nYou know what you Eugene we're going to put you on hold a we've got we've got a pretty bad phone connection there so I Will try to get back to Eugene if we can because he's got a great point I wanted to raise about those folks are the illegals sending\nTo us on the Fox news app hello Mike\n[noise] high tide great show uh I just wanted to say what what's going on here is you've got American NGOs non profit corporations operating in Central America who are gathering up people into these caravans\nTo bring them to the United states\nThey're calling the press\nThey're funded by us tax dollars\nGrant money who is the American tax dollars fund these organizations along with a lot of Democrat donors uh to to do this stuff and uh and and the IRS\nAnd the and the attorney general's office needs to look into these organizations identify them and look into them and cut off their money\nAnd then you'll you'll stop seeing these caravans of people well organized\nI mean is there somebody is greasing the wheels with Mexico and Guatemala in order to get those people through those countries to the U.S border and I ... last time they did this there were some identified American NGOs that were involved\nThey're getting the attorneys to the border they're getting the press to the border and it's all about embarrassing the ... the the Trump Administration and are trying to affect our our border policy our immigration policy and a and it needs to be ... needs to be they need to put a stop\nYou know ... to that point Mike I'm does the conservative tribute uh the uh run by the folks over western western journalism they they've been talking about how powerful George Soros backed organizations have been and the influence they had in in our country [noise]\nUm he has ... they they've been linked to reply black lives matter and the women's march I mean you want to talk about they talked about Russia collusion with the need even talking about is the Soros collusion here\nGot thousands of these Hondurans that are marching towards our border and are expected to be there right around the midterm elections I just find that hard to believe\nYes and and um and and these people are being coached by the by the American NGOs they're being coached on what to say when they get to the border\nUm they're they're being said there you know they're being provided transportation and and they're not doing this on their own uh the the Honduran president recently said that there were political forces at work trying to embarrass Honduras\nUm I think those those forces are American forces or the NGO Soros funded funded through grants from the state department funded through grants from a health and Human Services supposedly doing humanitarian work\nBut what they're really doing is is gathering these people up recruiting them to get in these caravans come the United states and seek asylum\nOr after passing through to other countries to get here um seems odd to me that they wouldn't request asylum in the first country or the second country that they went through\nNo doubt and and that's why I'm excited that we're going to be talking with congressman Andy Biggs because he wants to punish a not just for example Honduras in this case but also Guatemala and Mexico\nFor every single person they allow safe passage through their country to the U.S border\nAnd and I think that's one way that we can fight back but you're right my we've got to target those organizations that are working here on American soil\nUm that are behind all of this was well Mike ... than

Harris out of North Carolina he's going to join this this is one of those key races if the Republicans want to keep control of the house sticker out everybody will be right back [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAre so every day from now till November six were going to see people at the polls\nAre are ... are you troubled are you concerned by the the vitriol and the rhetoric coming from Democrats to get in the faces of Republicans and just silence Republicans and and harassed them in supermarkets and grocery stores\nOh absolutely I I think it is is is ludicrous\nWe've lost all sense of decorum\nA and civility when it comes to a political discourse in this country and I think it's ridiculous and even to the point of being able to\nHave a normal debate on the issues and that that's what these attacks are about they can't attack conservatives and Republicans on the economy because what is happening and what the president's agenda\nHas been is working they can attack us on the fact that um you know he's doing what he said he would do and appointing Supreme Court justices that our original is\nThat understand that their role is to interpret not make law because that's the role of Congress\nAnd so when you can't stand on the issues you move into this kind of of just mob attack and even last night in our debate there was a coordinated effort\nBy the folks that are with Mr mccready that every time I Would mention Nancy Pelosi or a code word that they were prepared for they would immediately began to his and blue and laugh and and be disruptive and it was it was pretty fascinating\nCampaign trail we have not we have not up to this point um my wife\nLast night was a sort of chased around a little bit in the I'm In the theater I had already gone off the stage and was going down the stairs to the green room\nAnd there were two young girls one was trying to video her and the other kept kept bringing her with questions um she may have made the mistake to answer the first answer one of them\nAre because she wasn't sure who they were a but it became very apparent that uh they they were there with the mission and a purpose to try to harass\nSo you so you're telling me these these to these two women were trying to harass your wife after the debate\nYes they were following her around one of them taping with their cell phone and the other\n... her with questions um you know and I I didn't learn that was even happening until afterwards when uh some of our folks got her and got her down the stairs to the green room you know where we had a reassemble\nYeah I'm I was curious as to how they were how she was extracted from that from that situation\nYeah it was basically just our staff that just got her and she she was strong enough obviously just to walk away but they were um it was obviously a a little scene that they were seeking to create\nDo you know what kind of questions that we're asking her\nI Do not I think maybe one of them initially was a ... has mister here's bill about a access to abortion I Know that the abortion issue was one um and there were things down along those lines women's issues if you will that they felt like\nA they needed to make a point with and she quickly realize these were not young girls that were doing a high school or college project but they they obviously were were wanting to harasser while\nThis is ... that's just that's just outrageous\nI'm more or less conservative areas\nYou would think um I mean you would but like I said you know\nOverall um we've just lost the ability to to be able to have a civilized conversation or about political issues and I think the problem is because we're not talking about the issues anymore\nUm nobody wants to talk about the things that are like jobs and the economy and taxes and those kinds of things they would rather just a full of solve a threat and go after personal smear campaigns\nWell that's just it it it's unacceptable and Dr Harris we appreciate you fight the good fight out there in North Carolina we know that this is one of the races I'm\nA bat or that the Republicans need to win if they're going to hold on to the house of representatives so I suspect the Democrats are going to come after you up with a with the guns blazing as they say\n[laughter] ah no question but we like I said the ... district of North Carolina\nIs made up of some incredible incredible people and we're very blessed in this part our district runs all the way from uh east Charlotte if you will all the way down to fail North Carolina and we have

know I went broke I lost everything had to start over and all that and that's where all this came from this passion for helping other people came from\nThis idea that I hate that that's where it came from was I've got a P. H. D. and D. you and be and so what that does it makes me approachable right and ah I'm not I'm not some guy drops his glasses on the end of his nose and looks down in the salaries I looked down his nose at you you know a ... you know as as snobbish ...\nA yes or my body recover great so I'm happy I can do\nJust a little bit or I'm a movement issue there my shoulder but ... ... you got any future surgeries coming up\nUh what what are you are thinking of putting the money on\n[noise] so me and my wife have agreed that we want to use this money to buy a house mhm but she\nUm [noise] well we're we're we're not agreeing on is that she wants to put the majority of the money all as a down payment and save about twenty thousand for emergencies ... and I think this is a perfect time to get rid of all like that and we'll still have a good amount for a down payment on a house ...\nAnd still have some leftovers but she's not agreeing with me with that mhm and I just wanted to your\nYour opinion on what you think would be the better move\nWell she's not agreeing with you I don't know why she would agree with me [laughter]\nBut anyway the uh uh we tell people not to buy a home unless your debt free how much debt do you have\nTo get a we have about forty five thousand dollars\nAnd ... I Would pay that off and I would hold twenty back for an emergency but the rest as your down payment if I were in your shoes I Would not buy a house with that still laying around I think that's dangerous you're asking for trouble and so on and so\nMy vote is going on your side of this argument I'm afraid but I don't know I honestly I don't know why she wouldn't listen to makes now let me tell you this I Will tell you that I Would not do any of this unless you guys get on a budget and you agree to never borrow money again\nOkay yes that I have a track to talk to her about that I'm actually a new listen I'm trying to get her off board mhm but she's not really to come in ... they have also having trouble getting her on board with the plan and his well yeah\nI can imagine so um I I highly recommend you don't do anything until you can come into agreement okay because you're going to make a mistake when you Shannon I when we have an argument like this\nOn large purchases large gifts large decisions we decide nothing is the only thing we can do until we're in agreement\nAnd uh so I I recommend you do nothing until the two of you can get on the same page um do you think that she would go to financial piece university if I gave you a one year membership\nI honestly do think I've been talking to her mother trying to help me out just because she's so stubborn about this and her mother is on my side as well\nAh well I don't want to ask what I asked was can you get your wife to go to financial base university to the nine lessons and if I give you the one year membership\nYes there you think so why she fresh rubber\nI think that me and my me and her mind would sit down with her and explain to her um\nGo to the climate is free okay I'm going to give it to you but I'm only going to give it to you on the condition that she attends with you\nOK because if you go by yourself it will cause a divorce is you're going to get more and more and more and more excited about getting out of debt and living with a plan and you get it's going to drive a wedge further between you own I don't want to do that\nSo I just if you can talk her into just attending one or two glasses with you I think she'll go on and go to the others I'm pretty persuasive but ah but\nDon't go by yourself do it'll cause problems hold on I'll have Kelly pick up I'll give you the financial ... membership for a year and that includes the nine lessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else um but do not do this without her it's a it's contingent upon that my gift is\nAll right Dave is with us in Stockton, California Hi Dave how are you\nOh good afternoon date how you doing gay better than I deserve what's up\nWell that that's good Faye I'm with my wife and I are ...\nA little disagreement um last you should ask for our son got married we loaded with money to help them out really knowing knowing that we would never probably see the money again okay um\nWhy would you do that you're ... ...\nEmail ... that's a good question that's a good question I maybe it's because I haven't talked for about a year ago I lost touch with ... with that aspect of it but um we volunteered to pay for the material that they take a class which they did\nBut in the end they did and discipline in the telecom principles and or building a ... at all mhm well\nAfter six months we decided that they weren't trying to make the U.S back anything we kind of let them you know we weren't going along and me more money because they had made no effort to to reimburse anything of it and and there was no communication to now indicating the owner famous back\nWell you know as life goes several months later they're only vehicle broke down and um and they could not be repaired and my son had no way to get to work this is where it gets sticky 'em knowing that my wife execs river parents trashed would be dispersing funds to all the fisheries\nIncluding him we both agreed to front about Ninety percent of what the what we see with the understanding the would immediately pay us back when the checks from it and some of the logical is it they were born from us and that they were already keeps news to them by her her parents stress\nAs it today we have not distributed that money but it's getting it's getting a little stick here here is going to be just to be the next couple of weeks\nWe wouldn't do what you do in the meantime they've they took out I'm a five or a a thousand dollar loans to pay off for months of ... will do rent the otherwise they'd be I'm addicted in our daughter in law just does not want to work to help out\nI have strongly suggested and I think that's about as far as that goes to this is my wife's side that my wife write the check to them having come over his side at over ...\nAnd we would write them a check for the balance of what they did ... how do we didn't we didn't front them and it seems simple and we know if we approach it that way that would be successful\nAnd lemonade the temptation than using a hundred and Seventy not ... agreed and be in my opinion be more proactive to solving this\nIs so much from a non thousand dollars\nRight the eight hundred right now what's your network now what's that what's your net worth\nA ... [noise] I don't know five hundred six hundred what's your household income uh who I'm thirty maybe okay and\nLet me just say oh you know here's my opinion this is all your fault\nMy fault yeah OK you

mess\nI okay I take your job now I Try to correct if they're not making it worse yeah and so um\nWell one thing you could do as you say forget it I don't pay me back forget it I'm an idiot I should have given your money I've never given you any more ever under any circumstances\nRight right it she she believes that that we should just be trusting meal the check to them and then hope they'll reimburse us\nOur number ...\n... that's my angle hunter Brent are not going to not soft and legally ridiculous assumption\nThat is not going to happen\nYou get into when you're alone family members

causes you to choose the words that\nYou years you need to stop talking like you're talking\nI allowed myself to fall\nInto the credit card game no you didn't\nYou walk straight up signed up for the card there was no falling\nYou're not a victim\nOwn it\nI've done a lot dumber than you've done ghetto\nWhen I Walk straight up and signed up for stupid and as long as I\nBlame the government or I blamed amino banker I blame the IRS or I blame the economy I was not getting any better and I did I sat around and wind like it was a former like I was a form of prayer\nBut you got to own it you didn't fall and the credit card that you've ever heard anybody say I was forced to buy a car well bull crap you are not\nNo one's ever forced you to do anything they didn't have a gun at the car

help you in the healing process I Know because I had to go through the same thing to me knows whether it's New Jersey have may not how are you\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nUh first of all thanks for taking my call 'em my question is I'm a I'm a ... actually the first one um I I make about forty to forty five ... a year [noise]\nAh I support a family of four and I work for the postal service they have a ... a student loan debt of like um about Fifteen thousand dollars\nAnd um [noise] I have two friends one of them as I'm asking me to go for a business or like a friend um subway business so I was thinking about taking\nTo share like a two family house so I think one apartment to each other\nAnd it's going to be or what a mortgage loan Joe so I wanted to know what should I Do\n... okay\nWell we tell folks not to borrow money around here if you listen to the show very much the shortest path to wealth and peace and your finances is to avoid that and on top of that I Would tell you to avoid partnerships as the only ship that won't sale\n\nSo um what that means is that if you still want to remain friends with both these guys I Would suggest you say no because at the end of these stories there is a nightmare\nGoing in partners with somebody in debt to go into the restaurant business would you do know squat about is a good way to end up bankrupt and lose your friendship forever going in partners with somebody to buy a house\nAnd then he doesn't pay is half or can't pay his half or you don't pay your for camp a year and a half is ah when I was a precursor to the ending of our friendship\nAnd a foreclosure shown no I wouldn't do either one of those\nAnd that's my reasoning I think you'll have a lot better life have you avoid both of those paths and you can you can develop a career path that does not involve you're going into debt to start a business it's a matter of fact most businesses start without that\nI just start small we started this one without the card table my living room we didn't have a big fancy studio we went down to local radio station drove over there and they let us use their stuff because we work for free there\nI Know you figure out a way to get going and you what we call bootstrap it and it works but you don't have to go get an SBA loan and go deeply in debt to buy a subway franchise in order to be in business that some mythology\nIs with us in Philadelphia Hi Thomas how're you\nWith a degree in actuarial science back in may wow and I'm working at McDonald's making nine dollars an hour why I I've been applying and applying and I just I Can't find a job and I don't know what to do\n... well I I Would assume that the primary job for that would be an insurance companies correct\nYeah I I've been through the end my last year of of school I got very turned off the actuarial science so I've been applying to finance jobs and I can't get anything because every one kid everyone wants you to have experience and\nI don't have the experience and I I graduated early so I did I did summer classes and they can't do internships for summer classes\nSo kind of went into a job or you try it into\nA financial analyst financial I'm like I've I've been even doing accounting\nLike accounts payable any mhm receivables entry\nLevel stuff mhm oh you do is get your foot in the door I'm OK well here's

year\nWe had Fifteen thousand the applications\nFor those honored hires\nYou get lost in that ... and ... there's not that I don't wanna answer and talk to every one of those Fifteen thousand people is just logistically not reasonable and so what ends up happening is you get lost in the stack of that stuff unless you\nSomebody called me and says are ever but we would give them an interview\nAnd pull their pull their resume out of the stack\nYou got to get out of the pile you know\nAnd so some of these places you're trying to get on with you need to figure out if your sister that's married a kids play soccer where the guy that works over there or something like that where you can find someone that will put in a little bit of a word for you to at least get the door open\nAnd that'll get you in the door again you're you're not going to get hired because of that kind of a reference matter of fact there are very few references where you just calls up somebody and I get your hired an almost never happens that'll decent job anyway\nI mean if they're hiring just bodies you eat at home or something like that but at a good job they're really going to want to interview you and learn about trees and that will be true here so we don't guarantee anybody a tire but we will at least talk to them\nAnd you know what might be a very short conversation no you don't qualify investing or looking or at least we'll talk to them and get the resume out of the file [noise]\nIf somebody knows I'm Sorry go download that and let's see if we can tell them to show he'll help you and all this stuff is very very difficult out there but I think you can leave some\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nIn the world would you trust some random guy in a Q ... when getting your mortgage you really think

had to have good tractors that was easy yeah but who was the biggest cheerleader\nI I Would say my parents or my mom had followed you for years and also people in my church family as well because they are I talked a lot about you and we're encouraging me not to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans\nYeah yeah so I mean you went from being completely crushed by student loan debt to completely owning it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the day I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't really have\nAnother planet so I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later in the final payment\nYou know you pay them almost two hundred thousand a year for two years ... ... you were on which is pretty incredible but you're making four Fifteen minus taxes which takes a big chunk of and so you weren't living you weren't you weren't splurging on anything now uh you weren't starving to death but you weren't splurging\nAnd just completely lean to show as you're going along you're you're hitting this thing\nWhen you're hitting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah a Fifteen to twenty month only given month at what point when you started doing that did you go wait a minute this is actually going to work how far in war you before the before kind of the switch kind of flip for you\nI paid off all the smallest\nAnd then I started to have some more hope that I Would be at what a pay off the largest ones I think my largest individual alone was right around fifty thousand dollars and prior to that I had just looked at it and it was like there was no way like there's I'm not going to be able to do this\nSo your trunk and some of these like one or two a month yeah knocking them off the little baby ones when you first started yeah and that yeah but I had to give you a lot of emotional boost deaf in his debt snowball really kicked in for you then you can do what he was supposed to do it lets you know that this is going to work\nMhm wow wow wow wow wow wow\nAll right so what is the big takeaway when someone says oh I'm I'm a ... year hundreds of thousands I Can't get out of debt you say yes you can here's what you do you do this\nI think the most important thing is\nJust to stop burning from it stop trying to hide from it like I was trying to do um I was I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never get a day and I once I faced it and once I took personal responsibility for it\nAnd realized that I'm the one who signed a paper ... you know I Need to get myself out uh then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change or your parents' good with money\nThat they are their income as much less sure didn't know what mine is but I learned most\nPeople's [laughter]\nYeah I definitely learned how to live on a budget that for my parents and also um they had been in quite a bit of a credit card debt in the past and they always told me you know don't be stupid with credit card and um you know make sport smart purchases and so I think I learned a lot of those principles and then\nKnow there was a there was a sense of character that came from them that

jump in Ryan is in Atlanta Georgia Hi Ryan your question for ...\nWhen you don't [noise] um so I'm going out of business I've been in business for sixteen years oh about ... Nineteen years it was me hustling labor I'm doing everything for about the last six years I've been able to replace myself in labor I make a decent living now\nBut I'm just content I'm kinda happy with where I'm at\nMy question is is that I mean I don't know I mean it is it is it bad to plateau like that if it if I'm if I'm content and but there's definitely room to grow so my question I guess ... or\n... I I'm not sure which direction to head because I'm going to spot where I'm fairly happy\nBut Wyoming so tell me why you're happy define it briefly\nWell I think possibly and I asked myself there's a lot maybe my dreams are big enough possibly but I'm I'm happy to be because I brought my business close to home I don't travel a lot anymore and um I've got time and I get their money there too so\nWell congratulations well it's almost like you're feeling a little guilty\nFor being content you know days preaches contentment Rachel cruise almost wrote an entire book on contentment content that does not mean\nThat you're in a bad place I think you're happy you're thankful you're you're grateful you've been able to work hard and get into a new space I think what you're feeling is the itch to continue to challenge yourself and by the way that is also a good feeling you can be content meaning I'm grateful for what I have\nBut I'm not happy with who I Am so I'm very content I I'm honestly living the dream this is the greatest time of my professional life I'm having a blast\nBetter so I can be convenient and grateful but also want to continue to improve you've got a great business I don't I think you know I think you become a successful yeah amounts to ... well done um the thing I did when I kinda hit the same place you are\nWas I started the first stage of business and you passed it substantially\nIs to take care of your family and to survive on the end of the business to survive and yet you get asked once you get past the desperation of that stuff\nAnd uh then the thing starts to you control some of the variables and you brought in somebody do some of the work you didn't want to do\nAnd you brought it closer to home and you're making good money and show that that's the next step and that's what I Do as an example uh when I hit that stage people started saying well you'll never be successful in radio if you stay in Nashville all the big radio shows are in New York or LA\nAnd I'm like well not going to be a big radio show then 'cause I'm not going to live in New York or LA I don't mind visiting people but I'm not living there\nI like Nashville and uh well you got to have them I mean I have a seven minute commute and I live in a huge freaking house I'm not leaving you know so that you know that's where you get to so then I started to go how can I expand this without how can I expanded and scale it without destroying the parts that are finally achieved\nYeah and so can you hire some people can you expand your product lines can you make it digital or I mean what can you do to grow the business\nBut do it from a position of content ... now that you've got the variables controlling\nAnd that's that's the way to go at it so I think you're

Katz regularly for about five months and got serious about three months ago my husband and I have paid off around ten thousand dollars in debt and died and we have decided to eat well he decided he wanted to take a few and I wasn't a course Africa in our area actually at a mountain harm to add\nSo we decided to leave your car and I personally\nI think you know excited [laughter] um I was wondering if you have any last minute right there but then the people that got that have never taken that the EU and we're starting out by meeting of course we have a rather than we'll find out wow yeah you know I'm really excited so\nWhy did eleven people sign up but they knew you and trusted you\nOn most of them I Know and yes I Would say yes to that and then there were ... recruits Sam I advertise in all of our local church it will keep her and an elementary school like\nOkay I'm going to guess inside the ones that know you signed up because of who you are as a person\nAnd my best encouragement would just be be that person\nBecause they already trust you in other words don't try to be something you're not I don't think you're going to just in talking to you I don't think here that person you don't need to\nAct like you're a financial genius you don't need to act like you ah have all the answers um you you know all you gotta do is be able to turn on the DVD player play me\nYet but about whatever the lesson on mapping about that night and then put shares in a circle and love people and be yourself the other thing is always just talk about the times that you\nFor that you were unsure or that you do or whether it was ten years ago or ten minutes ago um because\nEveryone else has got their money act together but me I'm the only do for ... and it turns out we are all due to says\nThat makes sense how are they chose to the primary barriers to people receiving financial teaching is guilt and shame\nAnd call and if you can remove those by just that's what I Do tell my story all the time you hear me tell it if you've been listening the podcast that much how many times I've screwed up and you know I went broke I lost everything had to start over and all that and that's where all this came from this passion for helping other people came from\nAnd this idea that I hate that that's where it came from was I've got a P. H. D. and D. U. MB and so what that does it makes me approachable right and ah I'm not I'm not some guy drops his glasses on the end of his nose and looks down in the salaries that looks down his nose at you you know\nUh yes um my body recover great so I'm happy I can do just a little bit of a um a movement issues in my shoulder but besides that I'm playing\n... you got any future surgeries coming up a no okay well good well I'm Glad I'm Glad you're doing so good that's awesome okay so uh what what are you are thinking of putting the money on\n[noise] so me and my wife have agreed that we want to use this money to buy a house mhm but she\nUm [noise] well we're we're we're not agreeing on is that she wants to put the majority of the money all the down payment and save about twenty thousand for emergencies mhm and I think this is the perfect time to get rid of all like that and we'll still have a good amount for a down payment on a house ...\nAnd still have some leftover but she's not agreeing with me with that and I just wanted to your\nYour opinion on what you think would be the better move\nWhere she's not agreeing with you I don't know why she would agree with me [laughter] but anyway the uh uh we tell people not to buy a home unless your debt free how much debt do you have\nTo get a we have about forty five thousand\nIn your shoes I Would not buy a house with that still laying around I think that's dangerous you're asking for trouble\nAnd so on and so my vote is going on your side of this argument I'm afraid but I don't know I honestly I don't know why she would answer to listen to makes now let me tell you this I Will tell you that I Would not do any of this unless you guys get on a budget and you agree to never borrow money again\nOkay yes that I have a track to talk to her about that I'm actually a new lease and I'm trying to get here on board mhm but she's not really to come they ... they have also having trouble getting her on board with the plan has well you know\nI can imagine so um I I highly recommend you don't do anything\nUntil you can come into agreement\nOkay because you're going to make a mistake when you Shannon I when we have an argument like this we we have to we have a rule we have to do nothing until we can come in agreement\nOn large purchases large gifts large decisions we decide nothing is the only thing we can do until we're in agreement\nAnd uh so I I recommend you do nothing until the two of you can get on the same page um do you think that she would go to financial piece university if I gave you a one year membership\nI honestly do think I've been talking to her mother trying to help me out just because she's so stubborn about this and her mother is on my side as well\nOr why isn't what I ask what I asked was can you get your wife to go to financial piece university to the nine lessons and if I give you the one year membership Yes sir you think so why she fresh rubber\nI think that me and my me and her mind would sit down with her and explain to her um\nGo to the climate is free\nYou go by yourself it will cause a divorce is you're going to get more and more and more and more excited about getting out of debt and living with a plan and you get it's going to drive a wedge further between you all and I don't want to do that\nSo I just if you can talk her into just attending one or two glasses with you I think she'll go on and go to the others I'm pretty persuasive but ah but\nDon't go by yourself do it'll cause problems hold on I'll have to like pick up I'll give you the financial ... membership for a year and that includes the nine lessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else um but do not do this without her it's a it's contingent upon that my gift is\nAll right Dave is with us in Stockton, California Hi Dave how are you\nOh good afternoon Dave how you doing today\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nWell that that's good Faye I'm with my wife and I are few coordinators had were dead tree get free\nAnd we major wisdom and guided something where we also have a little disagreement um last you see that her son got married we loaded with money to help them out really knowing knowing that we would never probably see the money and again okay [noise] um\nWhy would you do that you're ... ...\nEmail ... that's a good question [laughter] that's a good question I maybe it's because I haven't talked for about a year I\nLost touch with ... with that aspect of it but um we volunteered to pay for the material that they take the class which they did but in the end they didn't disappear Metallica ... principles\nAnd Henri building a ... kind of at all mhm well after six months we decided to see what kind of make the U.S back anything we kind of like no we weren't going it alone and me more money because they had made no effort to to reimburse anything of it and and there was no ...\nAnd um and it could not be repaired and my son had no way to get to work this is where it gets sticky let 'em knowing that my wife and ... parents trashed would be dispersing funds to all the beneficiaries\nIncluding him we both agreed to front about Ninety percent of what the what we see with the understanding the would immediately pay us back when the checks in\nSome of the logic was it they were ... they were already Keith news to them by her her parents trash\n'em as it today we have not distributed that money but it's getting it's getting a little stick here here it's going to be distributed next couple of weeks\nWe wouldn't do what you do in the meantime they've they took out I'm a five or a a thousand dollar loans to pay off for months of over do rent the otherwise they'd be I'm infected in our daughter live just does not want to work to help out\nSo my angle is interested in ... mirrors and because we have not given his responsibility and came back with our loan I have strongly suggested ... and I I think that's about as far as that goes into my wife's side that my wife write the check to them having come over and sided oh exists\nAnd we would write them a check for the balance of what they didn't borrow from much of it we didn't we didn't print them and it seems simple and we know if we if we approach it that way that would be successful\nAnd lemonade the temptations that using them and I just said not Tina's back has agreed and be in my opinion to be more proactive to solve and as soon\nAs they show how much a nine thousand dollars\nRight he Edie Henry you right now what's your network now what's that what's your net worth\nA ...

against everything that you were supposed to have been taught by us which was you longer a family money right you're the one made this mess\nI okay I take your job now I Try to correct it they're not making it worse yeah and so I'm\nWondering you could do you say forget it I don't pay me back forget it I'm an idiot actually given your money I've never given you any more ever under any circumstances\nRight right it she she believes that that we should just be trusting meal the check to them and then hope they'll reimburse us\nEither ...\nOr ... that mind no they're not going to accept and lately ridiculous assumption\nThat is not gonna happen\nYou mail a check them you're never going to see this money and then you're not there shot if you're going to speak to your own children over money or not it's just the crap you get into when you're alone family members money all your fault [noise]\nSo I mean if you want to if she wants to walk you through that that's fine but don't ever do the skin\nAbsolutely ludicrous\nYou're asking for all the trouble your cost you caused every bit of this [noise]\nMe tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a

Can't really explain why\nI why I got it in and other people have not yet gotten it but I Believe that people will I Believe that in time almost all of my friends who have turned their backs on me or you know who just completely can't understand what I'm doing\nA so they've stopped talking to me I Know that in time most of them will get it and they'll come back to me and they'll say I I totally understand what you're doing so I'm just like patiently waiting for when that day comes but uh it hasn't happened yet\nIt's it's it's crazy talking to a brand is Rocco who's the uh well you should the founder of the camp the hash tag walk away campaign and\nAnd you know ... it's the intellectual dark Web rights being able to sit across and have conversations with people without looking at somebody and seeing the evil because they don't believe my ideology or where we used to have this thing where I may not agree with you and stuff but we could still part of his friends now it's I don't even want to know anything about what you believe anymore and I\nAnd I don't know about you brand I always look at everything and say the most of\nLeave or I Want nothing to do with you and that is not a country I Want to live in\nNo it's not and I I it's it's so strange to me watching again I if I use that term zombies earlier but it's like\nI've seen people who I think they probably once upon a time not so long ago word normal\nAnd they're just they're ... it's like invasion of the body Snatchers you know it's like I I see videos all the time you know because you know I think things are getting worse and worse the closer we are getting to the bed terms uh is is not helping but you know I'm seeing videos every day of people on the left\nJust becoming completely unhinged and going bananas ah and\nAnd almost every time it's not even based also something that's really actually truly legitimately happening it's something that the media has told them is happening which isn't true and then they're going absolutely I mean they're they're losing their minds\nAnd and it's very strange\nI I mean I I feel I probably shouldn't say this but it's it's the truth is how I feel and I'm all about telling the truth whatever but I feel really weird when I see\nSo many men doing this like because like I'm seeing all these videos all the time of like\nMen who are like freaking out about feminism and stuff and and the ... which is great ... I think we're like you said earlier were all about protecting women we all care about women but there's it's not that it's like the lives that the media is telling\nAbout how the right wants to hurt women and then I see these men going bananas about it and stuff and I'm like\nI don't you get like they are being manipulated I it's just so weird to me I it's it's so strange\nKnow what it is brand and it's I Love watching them they they're everybody got and then they put themselves in a position how much further can I go you went this far well let me show you how ...\nDo it for lack of better term is they're trying to get them and it's this whining about it that ... ... I'm a man I must just gender heterosexual cracker mail and I will tell you there's right now I Love women I Want to protect women are and I and and I want equality\nUh but I'm not going to bend over backwards to put somebody into a protected class like species is not the way it should be but it's ridiculous man it's ridiculous\nWell it is and it's yeah I mean you kind of hit the nail on the head with a basically there's there's two different classes\nOf of men are may possibly more but I mean there's kind of beta males which you're just sort of like what happened to your masculinity would you you watch this but the ones that I was describing a moment ago or you know I just feel like I'm seeing all these videos lately\nOf men on the left\nWho are like attacking even women on the right I mean there was a video that I saw the other day of this woman she was wearing a Trump pat\nAnd out and publicly crossing the street and there was a guy behind her I mean he looks like ... seconds away from punching are in the face and at one moment she even said he says some make some nasty snide comments about nine eleven or something and she said actually my husband died on nine eleven and he goes good good he deserved it ... and I'm like\nWhat what the hell happened to you you like what is going on yeah we've\nLost the plot we've lost the plot talking to a ... or the founder of the hash\nTag walk away movements so you've got this big thing it's October what twenty seventh and you guys are going to get together and uh and that's what think progress was saying is this Russian trolls because that's that's that's where they go with everything now everything's Russia's fault and and everybody's All right uh so tell us about what's going on there\nYeah so uh we're doing a walkway march on Washington weekend which is the twenty sixth of the twenty eighth and obviously in DC I'm so that's coming right up it's a week and a half away the weekend after this one for\nProfile you know conservative celebrities on the right who were coming to attend the dinner and people are going to be speaking and it's going to be really just sort of like an elegant way to kick the weekend off and then the next day is the main event the march and rally\nUm which is open to for anyone to attend 'em and I want to make really clear to because I Do get these messages [noise] more often than I Would like with people saying you know I Would love to come here march rally it sounds great but I didn't walk away so I don't think I should count\nGuys listen this is so important to people the people on the rights who have been conservatives your whole life or Republicans your whole life you are what we call the walk with\nAnd your your attendance at that march and rally is\nReally the most important thing because all of these people who are walking away from the Democratic\nParty and walking away from liberalism a lot of them are walking away from their friends their walking away from their family their walking away from\nTheir jobs in some circumstances they need to know there are people on the other side who are going to walk with them that they're not going to be alone that's why people stay people stay 'cause they think if I I think I I hate what this party stands for I don't even recognize him more but I Can't leave because I'll lose all my friends they need to know there are people walking with them\nSo for those of you on the right who are lifelong conservative Republicans come out\nTo this event and you see the walkway march on Washington and walk with those
