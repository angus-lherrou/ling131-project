Peterson on the bench tonight\nYou know because they were playing the percentages with geo Gonzales starting left handed pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers some of those ... those guys came into the game later on when the brewery started moving relievers around and then eventually you get to see her back yeah they share but yeah that's for next year so I mean you got a plethora\nOf hitters did you say that's what I did a vendors plethora so if you can get to the playoffs without Clinton cursor who this year was your third best pitcher and last year the when you went to the world series he missed a long period of time but it didn't matter the Dodgers still turned out when after when what are you paying thirty million for\nMe really what are you paying and thirty million for when you can get to the playoffs without him and you can start anybody\nJustice that I'd give you just as much chance of of pitching a good game as you have pitching a bad game\nBecause that to her show if he's five hundred he is he's got an ear re around four and a half he is the absolute definition of generic in the playoffs he's five hundred with an e array of four and a half this is not to say he's ...\n... and we talked about this you know for for the last couple of nights\nHe and Peyton Manning are the same they have a level of excellence during the regular season and they continue that into the playoffs the problem is is that other teams\nAnd things up they are much better in the playoffs and they are during the regular season so regular season success with Peyton Manning can do week six against the team\nIt's sometimes different from what he can do week Eighteen against the team when he was playing in the NFL\nSometimes he was still not great games other times he would struggle because defenses would figure out a game plan around it and he doesn't have that next level he's always at that top level and the same thing with Clayton courage all he's always at that top level but when teams figure out a way to\nTo attack him and Christian yellow certainly showed you early on I Want to rack up that pitch cat with the twelve pitch at bat in the first inning\nThey know how to beat Clinton ...\nAnd ... doesn't have that next level to get to that level is that so this is why\nGuys like Peyton Manning and Clayton ... are five hundred in the playoffs Peyton Manning has got to play every day because he's your quarterback when he was playing again this is the guy is retired a couple of years ago but he plays 'cause he's your quarterback\nClinton courage or someone you still paying thirty million just what you're gonna get\nAnd that's the question going forward right your in your thirties back injuries one Seventy five or fewer\nFor the last five seasons in terms of your innings pitched still dominated times the two seven three ER a in nearly six strike outs per walk there's a lot still to like\nA blob ... Clinton her shop but the fact of the matter is in big spots like this I mean you saw last last round right you could make the argument about rats and and making sure everybody was right with the review encourage job but\nThat came down to the analytics of reuse dominant in home you're going to be number two and your ego is going to have to deal with it and I'm sure there are still some conversations had\nDidn't get too deep into it they give you enough to know that there was a problem well now you give them the ball for for game one and he barely gets through three innings\nStruggles into the court that helped by his defense but good at badge by the brewers you've got to give them credit or going to this to their scouting reports and knowing that it's play off her show that's coming at you so you've got some opportunities and you can get some hits and then once the defense\nStarted to struggle that just spiraled downhill very quickly so going forward you got re you you've got Walker viewer you'll probably look around and free agency cause you do have money to spend\nAnd now it's Clinton her Shaw the ball's in his corner whether he decides to opt out or not\nWell that's the big thing now this if you want to get into a little bit of a a a speculative things now that not speculative but what could be going on as we know that when ... was taken out of game one against the Braves and put a game too it pissed them off now due to piss them off enough to a point\nWhere he's going to opt out and say screw you hey Texas Rangers I'll go play if you have Joe Jr already interviewing with it as rangers while ... for you to come from where did you go so hey you wanted to ask someone coming weekend I got to celebrate it\nBut now if her show it doesn't pitch well or pitch again in the playoffs let's say the Dodgers gets swept now you wonder if ... going to say you know I don't know if I opt out because I may not get\nThirty million a year for another six years which is the contract he'll be looking for because he's got the opt out after this year two more years of thirty plus million a year from the Dodgers he'll obviously want something longer than that which is why you would opt out now it's okay now if you get thirty million for the next five or six years maybe he doesn't get it because again\nTeams get to see in the postseason why are we paying thirty million for Clinton curse Shaw if he's going to pitch like this and the place where it gets\nThe in the play offs and have just as bad as good a chance of getting a great game out of him as getting a bad gave out or why would we pay in thirty million dollars that could be part of this to he may decide you know what I don't want to opt out because I don't think the markets therefore me coming off the season because I've not pitched as well and bottom line is he's not the guy he was a couple of years ago\nI mean he had that strike you stretch your one where he was absolutely unbeatable but the last couple of years cracks are showing both in his production and his ability to stay healthy so really if you're the Dodgers maybe part of your thinking when you pushed into the game to against the Braves was\nLet's see if we put some off a little bit let's see if he wants to opt out and go and then\nWe can figure out a way to move on obviously you're thinking about this playoffs now in here but you're you're doing that you're pushing her shorter game to knowing full well what the long term ramifications aren't there was no way a conversation was had

brewers who are minor league team back then would win twelve games in a row and he said when they when twelve in a row he would give out free burgers to everybody\nThis did not happen not even when the team changed and moved and the Braves bought the team and then they came to Milwaukee and then they became the brewers it finally happened in Nineteen eighty seven the brewers won twelve and a row and George webs hamburger puts a chain now he's gotten many more restaurants than that\nGave away over a hundred and sixty thousand free burgers because they won twelve in a row so an eighty seven they gave away a hundred and sixty thousand burgers\nWith the brewers win tonight it marked their twelfth would in a row this season and the George Web restaurant chain will once again give away free burgers\nTo everyone going to do it next Thursday over duration of four hours they announced after Friday nights when Craig council is tweeting about it very excited and everybody got to get fired on

thing\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] so what\nNot bad for everybody I'll tell you what that is coming up here and just a couple of minutes Jonah stocks Fox Sports radio\nYou can listen to the show on the ... heart radio as you can always find this on Syria sex them channel eighty three\nAnd on all of our Fox Sports radio affiliates wherever you are taking part in the program we always appreciate a few minutes your time as you can be alive here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios were Fifteen minutes good debut Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance does a guy go dot com for a free rate\nQuote so if you are listening to the show at one point in time maybe currently you've been on a diet or you've been watching what you eat and then somebody at work or somebody at the house orders pizza\nSo you slip up and you have a slice it'll come out one slice not going to kill anybody want one slice you cheat a little bit right but here's the question for you do you eat half the slice and throw the backup away\nMeaning like do you holding it you get to about half way and then you just tossed the rest of the trash no you compromise and the compromise you've made is one slice\nThe smart thing to do would be to throw the back half away scot the crust the most bread at most carbs but you have settled on the slice that's the compromise\nThe New York giants head coach pat Sherman are made an announcement on friday he let it be known on friday who is going to be his starting quarterback moving forward\nChanging wherever and when you're on the well we believe in you know the guys behind so Karlan Alex are both working in improving their work in each day trying to get themselves ready to play so there was no reason to discuss that right now\nYeah well yeah I mean that that was ...\nWhat are you doing you know there there's don't even bother asking\nYou will because it's New York but don't even bother asking you've already made the compromise you're not pension Eli Manning now you don't turn your back on him now you decided on another slice of Eli Manning last December when you fired bend Mac do because how dare he broached the idea\nOf Eli Manning being benched for a game at Oakland when you were a dog as team at the time how dare you even consider bench in Eli Manning so what'd you do you punish spend McAteer for it you blew out members of the front office everybody's gone\nYou were halfway through I mean come on ... you're not mentioned him now\nYou decided on another slice of Eli Manning at the draft in April when you took said well I'm Barkley you add every other quarterback on the table outside a bakery Mayfield\nYou don't turn your back on Eli Manning now you had your opportunity\nThe giants had multiple opportunities the last ten months to put the pizza down but they committed to half of it last December and they committed to finishing the second half of the draft in April bottom line patch or emergency sticking with the line now but that decision was made months ago\nWe all saw what happened on Thursday night we all watched it we've all listen to the fallout on all day on friday we just heard patch Irma proclaim no change your quarterback it's a waste of time we all knew that that decision was made months ago but here's the thing not every situation in the NFL that seems to\nBe bad is bad for everybody like you could just take that game on Thursday night for example in the same man the giants\nLooked awful you know look pretty good Carson once man Carson ones coming off of ... banged up an ACL\nBut in New York Let's keep it with the New York giants you know who looks good and all of this for as bad as Eli Manning looks and as bad as the giants do you want to know who looks good and all this photo Beck and junior\nBecause I laugh when I hear people criticize oh Dell and his behavior first off you have no idea what the hell's going on on the sidelines\nRadio is the soundproof glass somebody walking by the Fox sports radio studios right now could look in at any point during a segment and assume that I was possibly overdosing on math by how I'm shaking and moving my hands because they can't hear anything coming out of my mouth\nThey just see it and they assume that it's bad\nSo we have no idea what's going on on the sidelines we see the outburst\nWe see all the ah the anger that he is perceived to be expressing we have no idea what's being said we have no idea what's going back and forth well it's bad optics\nIt's terrible optics it's a bad luck for hotel pecking junior hold on a second if I were a head coach and you gave me the option All right maybe your best player on your team and he can do one of two things either hey\nHe can scream at and punch a swamp cooler on the sidelines by the way swamp\nCooler is the term that poor people use for air conditioning right if you are wealthy and you grew up with an air conditioning you have\nNo idea what a swamp cooler is I grew up with a swamp cooler right so you can either have your best player\nYell and punch a swamp cooler on the sideline or option B. head coach anywhere in football you can have your best player scream at multiple assistant coaches and throw things while he does it using ... the whole time which would you rather take\nThe coordinators I don't have an issue with either one I don't care\nI'm not so much of an optics guy because unless you hear what's being said you have no idea what's going on\nSo I don't care that Tom Brady at a conversation with with his assistant coaches I'm not sensitive like that people yelling doesn't get me nervous people yelling and throwing things doesn't make me\nCower down and thank God he's a really bad guy no they're just pissed off at the time it's an excitable game everybody gets pissed off so I'm not even bothered by it\nBut for the whole older back um hot takers he already got paid right\nThis isn't his contract year right the organization is already committed to them right\nSo this isn't a bad looking back and junior he got is cash and the more it becomes obvious that he lie manning is a shot fighter and that they can't get back on the ball down field the less the blame oh they'll documents going to take and the more you'll understand\nThe more you look at the situation and go [noise] yeah you know [noise] I got to be tough to be a wide receiver there I I guess I get it I guess I kinda understand it it it would be kind of a tough thing to watch\nWould be kinda kinda tough to to deal with that as the wide receiver when you're dependent on another position on the field to get you the football and they physically or aren't it can't do it or not capable of doing it based on the playbook that's not an ... problem\nLike you remember when you were a kid and your brother or sister kept picking on you you tell your parents but you never have proof until the one time they got caught in the act and you were like she she it didn't matter how much pain you were in it\nI it's actually a credit just fans\nBecause I remember what it's like and I'm Glad I'm not there anymore so explain what that is coming up here momentarily on Fox Sports radio do you want to let you know that we are\nBy guy go what does it mean when I go says just Fifteen minutes maybe Fifteen Percent or more car insurance to meet you probably should have gone to a guy could I come ...\nTime here on Fox Sports radio ladies and gentlemen our technical producer he ran in tip toed between the raindrops to get in here and fire away on the board he is Iowa Sam [laughter]\nI had to incorporate a little bit of a range dong into ah into our rejoined ... your drenched\nWell I also took a shower [laughter] 'cause I got here a little late I did run in at the last second and uh I was flying here and when it's raining in LA and you're trying to drive fast it's a combination for probably an accident but I did not care I was rolling All right yeah that's\nGood and so very safe out there so people lives over the uh a hard and are working men and women of\nThe California highway patrol um just look out for Iowa Sam or his license plate is crops circle one\nRight ... are going one up that's what Dr find him Oscar Meyer yeah it'll be all he drives a John Deere yeah that that's where you can find them got that thing up to Fifteen miles per hour as and\nIt's when it rains out here have you become soft like\nYou're not used to the cold weather no I Love it I just was I was taking a little nap I I like I look outside and I'm like oh my it's really coming down for LA geez I loved him and the Iowa I've talked to Breezy Point about this ... he's told me because he\nGrew up in Ohio and he grew up with you know coal and snow and all that stuff in Ohio and so now he lives in South Florida and he's just not used to it you can't deal with\nRains all the time it's often yeah but I mean like the cold weather the weather that you're dealing with growing up you know it was and if it snowed in we went down to twenty five degrees here and it's no no way I'd I'd probably die I'd probably just parish on all ... I take my shirt off oh yeah like we could literally do that I like to be ... it looked like I had a a shot glasses on my chest [laughter]\nI Would imagine that ever All right I'm\nKevin figures is your nationality here five worst radio he is\nI'll be familiar crime and crime is Clinton curse shot in the postseason\nClinton Kirsch a hula as routine every October\nMorphed into a gas can on national TV and was lit up\nBut he's ... he only has the story of like five and a half and you know the ... games are bad and then it's actually it's\nIt's unbelievable every single year this happens every year and at least one game and one theory here's the thing I don't think it's a matter of well you know he does his best stuff uh you know he doesn't know he's got good stuff he always had good stuff and it's I think he gets so amped up\nThat he's just he's just a little bit off and then it just it all comes on done\nIt only takes one better I was at the game they gave one against the St Louis cardinals this was probably most of your your\nGame one tonight and you've got all the way back from LA from Milwaukee unbelievable\nRaise the transportation there by Kevin ... taking the high speed bullet train those people know about it yeah it's awesome [laughter]\nSame one and twenty four team when they hosted the St Louis cardinals I Believe the Dodgers had like a seven to one lead going into the fifth inning\nAnd it just fell apart for commercial cruising and all of a sudden I think that Adams is a double or something and then it just all crumbled after that out of nowhere he has like one bad hitter he hits the guy walks guy gives up a single event it orders crumbles and see your point it happens every single season game five of the world series last year he had it for one lead blew it\nGave them a three run lead after that and he blew that so yeah and the same game so it's between the years with him and it always has yes\nBut the good thing is he's always really nice to deal with\nOf the nice to talk about I mean [noise] seven conversation here on our training God Forbid not happy at all [laughter] God Forbid especially after last uh\nOr when it when I Do finally pay off this tease that I promised the Dodgers are it is it is partly because of that will get to that here moment told me about what we do a roll out the red carpet and every body part on to the side because we have a winter in the house and that winter is Mike the nightmare\nUh who last week our executive producer here on Fox Sports radio we had the game I guess ... meltdown Mike mayor projected the eagles on Thursday night and Mike mayor your winter\n[laughter] or [noise] or like what I mean it's like my friends were like two years on this show great my mayor I\nGuess the OED outback melt down and you got to correct one game after you got to correct yeah how 'bout that some don't you either dumb luck or I'm actually like gun Nostradamus ... something like that just a dynamite job by Mike mayor I mean he's from Cleveland all he knows is winning at this point cabs are always\nThe browns have to win the lake Erie monsters ah won the title a few years ago this was incredible and now you just won the ... melt down\nA and you got a spot on in the very next game so congratulations\nOh so you can tweet us at off the Mike twenty eight and send them your congratulations especially your giants fans have very negative spin on the back story from Mike mayor last week and it pays off\nSo there you go [laughter] I I joined us stocks Fox Sports radio okay I'm One of the perks to not being in the fan share any more is that you don't have to really let certain things outside of your control run your life you don't have to deal with it anymore\nUm and that's something that you don't truly appreciate until you're now at\nGrass is greener on every side I get all that and you know like there are certain aspects to that are really cool but when you're not in the fans here anymore and I decided well if I was really going to do this that I didn't want to sound like a ...\nAn apologist for some team I'm just not going to do it I'm not going to be a kiss ass right they don't they don't write my checks they don't pay my bills they've never done anything to me they would probably try and sleep with my girlfriend is they had the opportunity to\nNot going to kiss their ass on the air not doing it just not happening and so I decided that a long time ago\nAnd put\nAlong with that and the truth be told I'd rather attending event as a fan than as a media member because I Do think it's enjoyable to kind of sit back in and get to watch and just relax you you you don't need to be ... as long as they're good see so I'm not going to sit in the nose bleeds I really don't want to do that uh because I don't trust my balance especially after a few drinks but\nThe only thing that still gets me going that still I still like I can still feel it and I still get hyped up about and still get energized and I have that nervous energy the only events that really do that for me from now on\nOur big fights UFC events boxing events and it's not even from the fan perspective per se because I just\n... just the tension and the fact that it's it is the most truth telling sports that there are I mean every other sport\nIs turns to boxing or turns to estimate as their metaphor you get knocked down you've got to get back a bit like when you hear all that stuff it all goes back to those sports so I still feel it for them or they still feel for them\nBut as a fan\nPlayoff baseball\nI commend baseball fans\nBrewer fans the Dodger fans who are watching on friday night in advance I commend astro fans and Red Sox fans who are going to be watching on Saturday Night I give you I commend you you have my respect because I don't know how the F you deal with it I have no idea it is so stressful\nAnd like a ... a on friday night and like a throwback Robin ... Jersey uh with cheese curds sticking out of his ears because he was he just didn't know what to do with his hands in the food in front of him so he couldn't handled himself with vomit running down the front of a ...\nI I don't know how fans deal with it the constant stress of baseball\nIs so long\nAnd there are so many pitching changes especially the brewers when like you're starting relievers\nYou're starting pitcher is going to innings and that was the plan I mean like every like there are so many twists and turns in a baseball game and I'm watching it and I swear to God I always watch a sporting event and I think Ari what's my biggest takeaway I that's how like if I'm prepping for the show was\nMy biggest takeaway what do I take from that that we could have some fun with and my biggest takeaway wanted watching brewers and Dodgers while I mean there's the Clinton crush of stuff which we will get into I'm sure Dodger fans are looking forward to that at some point here during the show but my biggest takeaway is\nMan I I\nI almost wish that these people who are watching these games can live a stress free baseball game just appreciate a stress free baseball game because it's too much man you're exhausted afterwards I remember it I remember being a fan and being so caught up in the emotion\nThat afterwards even if you when you're exhausted\nYeah and they look at football yeah why not you know what they needed a main event\nThey had a many main event that was in place and then they got such negative feedback over the main event because it was for women's title that isn't even really a title at this point\nThat they decided alright it's Madison Square garden we've got to come up with something when you think Madison Square garden you think heavy weights Daniel ... going to fight it still you know if he wins this fight and I think he will win because Derek Lewis doesn't have the cardio and he just fought a grueling fight\nUh then it's still sets up the ... and her fight down the road for Daniel core me I'm the only shame of it is that they lost\nI Do care about this going to be up on\nAnd then one more here for you this was a kind of a historic moment in the end they'll be postseason earlier this week a Red Sox second baseman brought Cole had the first cycle in the history of major league baseball's postseason Jonas do care\nDon't you know I couldn't care less about the cycle man I really don't\nIt's I I've tried to think about what the comparison would be and this is going to confuse everybody\nLike what like like would you rather have a straight in cards or would you rather have four of a kind of\nYou know what I mean like isn't for of a kind of a better than a straight\nIs anybody out there play cards on the show a Sam\nOr Kevin figures or Mike mayor you so you're asking for of a kind like dentistry yes for the kind of higher than a straight I see that is yes oh yes I'll get higher than a straight flush ... okay for the kinds of over ... ... okay\nSo the cooking you know what a cycle is the cycles a strange\nIt's cool it looks cool single double triple phone run it looks cool\nWhen the guy gets for home runs\nThat's that's for a vote kind like nothing Trump's that a street is nice it's neat it looks cool but you know you could you could hold up on a double when you can really get to a third or you can stretch a single if you really needed a double I just I I think cycles are kind of overrated but that's that's\nThe bigger picture we probably need to tighten up my analogy on the podcast if we could we can discuss this on the air will tighten up on the podcast so people listening tomorrow that are drunk right now I Can't hear those that don't make better sense to them so there's a net is

Maine is the best quarterback on the roster the media knows that\nPatch ... playing the best player at the position that he can play on the roster the media knows it\nAnd the media loves it because he is now showing them a weakness there will not be a single\nWeek that goes by that the discussion of Eli Manning and what you do with Eli Manning doesn't come up at some point post game\nSingle time because patch rumors now showed his weakness he's now shown what bothers him he's tired of talking about it and we're six weeks in he's done with it\nIt's a difference between being a fan and it's the difference between a B between being a member of the media as a fan you root for when you refer teams the media roots for interesting and they root for al\n... and here we are biggest media market your team is a total disaster your head coach is already losing it and he's already snapping post game after a Thursday night last to Philadelphia\nAnd if you were to look around sports find me a better team there is to cover right now in sports find me one maybe the Minnesota timber wolves mean they're fun team to cover you've got a ... your best player or one of your best players\nSetting up an interview a sit down interview with ESPN before practice only to take the third stringers and go beat up on the first\nStringers so that he can sit down and airs grievances afterwards all because he didn't get traded like it is one thing after another with Jimmy Butler but the giants are fascinating to cover\n... the worst thing you did the worst thing you did on Thursday night for your own peace of mind the worst thing you did was snap on the media afterwards\nI just play cool be boring they may not like it but you're going to have a lot more peaceful I wait get into the locker room and get into your coaches office a throwback a couple of shots of Jack Daniels whatever cool off stay away don't even don't even fall for it don't even bite into it\nBut he did\nNow the media does that's the soft spot that's where we go every single time you want to ride all its cage go there it's one of the great things and and I noticed because I talk to people who worked in Chicago at the time when it happened when John Fox\nIf we get I'm all for you to\nRam you know all we did was gay sixty three yard field goal ever since I was a kid I was just always been able to kick\nThe ball along the way this is Fox Sports radio on you or the twenty four hours a day and go you know so we just sort of a\nGuard ... Rondo Thursday at seven thirty Easter not by now [noise]\n\nX. box company alive you're on the guy told Fox Sports radio studios [noise]\nWe won't be playing\nPro wrestler porn star coming up less than ten minutes from now you're on Fox Sports radio you want to be a part of the game\nPro wrestler a porn star eight seven seven Ninety\nUp a less than ten minutes from now here on Fox\nSports radio I'm All right so I Do want to ah\nTo get to this because this is I was talking about this earlier that if you just watched a major league baseball game in the regular season and then you a week later turned on opposed to using game it's not even the same sport\nIt it's not even it goes from\nCasual relaxed hang out have a hotdog drink a beer get some cotton candy sing the seventh inning stretch\nIt to you can't move because the tension is so thick you can't move and it's\nOne thing I'll I'll give fans credit for ... fans will sit through these games and there so long and there's so many pitching changes\nThat just the highs and lows in the roller coasters man I don't know how you do I don't know how you don't take up a bad habit\nHonest to God I don't know how fans don't either by their nails or uh uh uh get into heavy drinking or or smoke cigarettes three at a time or like you're a chimney like I don't know how fans deal honest to God how you deal with the stress I don't know how you\nDeal with it and none of it's good for you I mean\nYou know it's like when people drink when they're depressed or people have got something going on there really bummed out about something so they drink so worst thing in the world\nThe worst thing you can do does then when you wake up the problems still there and you're hung over like come on man I mean it's it's one thing to get needing the balls it's another thing to get needing the balls right after stepping on a nail\nOkay like one of the time here\nI I watch these playoff games and I don't know how fans deal with it it's it's nerve wracking I feel bad for the fans when they're in the middle\nEight hours that no lead was safe I think that was the game curse all pitched as well to the Dodgers had the lead twice in that game\nAnd Kirsch I'll just served up me and and then there was to talk to the balls were loaded or it's just crazy and so I'm watching the game on\nFriday night and the brewers who are a big in that game\nAnd a and eventually held on to win which just goes to show you more a nerve wracking I tense moments later in the game you're exhausted afterwards so the so the Milwaukee Brewers hold on to win that game and they take a one nothing lead in the ...\nAnd the same old story continues Clinton curse Shaw\nContinues to struggle at times in the postseason and it's really strange man it's not like he doesn't have great stuff\nI Know he's he's up there in years maybe he's not at his peak performance but it's not like he doesn't have great stuff\nI mean John ... was even talking about in the broadcast you're watching early on in the game I think it was the first inning\nAgainst yell at each Christian yell at you spin unbelievable the best player in baseball this year and you're watching and John small to saying look I mean he could go a curve ball and the dirtier if he won ... and he throws out there and claimed crucial on command curveball and the dirt down ...\nIt's just not like he doesn't have the stuff there's just something about the post season\nThat it doesn't add up it just doesn't work now defense is an issue or they had a bunch of heirs of the Dodgers did in that game and that's that's a terrible look on on the team but Kurdish I was going to get most of the blame for it here as as manager Dave Roberts afterwards\nAs far as close as you think it was a\nFour executions and a\nJudges interferes that was uh something that very furry thing and um the relay to play that I Know that somebody will say you should have made the pretty uncharacteristic but it's just one of those things are unfortunately didn't make the places that I Know he expects from it\nYeah it's just it's it's almost unexplainable this point like you almost can't come up with an explanation as to why he struggles 'cause he's still a great player I mean he's he's still a of a good pitcher\nMean out here in LA people love him cursed Shaw day that's that's like a a a hashtags that goes around but the narrative on him is that he can't get it done the post season here was Kurdish afterwards as well\nYou know it was tough on you know obviously don't want to\nGo to a start but uh you know what happened the coach I don't want to\nFeel any differently to you today as far as the from the bullpen into the game and did that just things kind of get out of control because of some areas and that type of stuff [noise]\nNeither focus and then for control just a terrible students\nI mean and he's got aware of that and he's got to live with that and look windows closed fast it twice said and last year and I said of the year before when the Indians choked when the Indians out of three one lead in that series\nAnd they lost the cubs Indian fan the positive ones will try and spin it to you as I don't worry about it there'll be back next year I don't worry about it I read everything is going to be fine they're young team he come back you battle back\nLoops\nStill haven't gotten back Dodger fans how many times of the Dodgers had an opportunity gotten in the postseason and how many times did they come up short and eventually that just runs out\n... ... you can no longer just depend in and assume that you're going to get there every single time you you just you can't rely on that\nThe Dodgers had at a seven game at home\nYou can't ask for anything more in the final game of the season than at home in the seventh game and they lost\nAnd the more you let opportunities like that slip by the more you got to deal with it I don't know if I'm a rangers fan you remember the Texas Rangers back in the day Texas Rangers were down to their final strike against the cardinals I still say to this day one of the most underrated\nDevastating losses if you're a fan base the Texas Rangers\nIn the world series down to their final strike\nAnd I think there was an era nephew ... if you want to see how\nI remember that I have no idea a condor McGregor are we bringing Conor McGregor now a a counter McGregor are your thoughts on the air by ... or if it was ... for as a or somebody along those lines in the world series several years ago for the\nWhole yeah I mean that's fair I'm a let's go live to our Texas Ranger outfielder insider in the world series several years ago that nobody's talked about since then a Kevin figures Kevin\nYeah I Believe it was Nelson Cruz ... plated yes oh\nIs that guy I agree yeah that\nToo I always confuse him a nephew present every president another major league baseball player but Nelson Cruz is the guy yes totally press was on that team so it's OK yeah and and he and he missed played the ball that is one of the most underrated\nDevastating losses for a fan base that doesn't get brought up enough did get talked about ... people can talk about the bills and Scott Norwood and all that imagine being hunger strike away and your team loses it like you just can't assume I don't worry we'll be back and they did get back\nAnd they lost again I just think at some point we can we can focus on Clinton\nDamn in the back of your mind every time something like this happens don't you think to yourself there's another opportunity gun there's another one last\nI'm telling you is fans you keep inventory and you remember all these moments\nIn Dodger fans for the past seven years six seven years and had to wear it in the postseason brutal Jonah stocks Fox Sports radio eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox is the phone number eight seven seven\nThink we can count this is a win for the Nebraska corners\nWe'd only right I think I think I could do it so congratulations to salmon a brass got hey Rick uh thanks for calling in man we appreciate it uh it's awesome and again if people want to look you up or what's up your wrestling

pretty quick you know look and realize ooh we're like we Thirteen where did the season go it's almost over and then I mean this is your time flies time flies during the NFL season it's all a blur because you've got so many games and so much stuff going on\nAnd um I Will be honest with you and I don't know that there's a lot of ... you know national\nHosts are hosts anywhere that will knowledge this and maybe this was in poor taste um but I don't care [laughter] I really don't care and I\nI don't I don't all just be honest with you I was excited for the first game and week six of the NFL right giants eagles and I was excited and I was really there for chaos\nI did not care about the exes knows\nI did not have anybody on my fantasy teams playing\nI didn't care how good Carson once looked I didn't care about any of that I didn't care about our Sean Jeffrey I didn't care about the eagles all offensive line I didn't I cared about nothing of that like nothing none of that interests me and maybe it's\nFor the chaos that's all I was tuning in four and I'll be honest with you it it was the most I've looked forward to a Thursday\nNight game in a long long time rams Vikings was fun because it was a shoot out but you kind of knew that was going to be\nIn any kind of had it had a feeling of that so that was going to be you know the rams good football team probably the best team in the league right now the Minnesota Vikings a team losing the NFC title game they've got brand new features on a fence and all that stuff and ... you would think of them is one of the better teams in the NFC we knew what that was going to be bought\nThursday night giants eagles I was there for the chaos I looked at it like this\nWhen I was breaking it down and jotting down some notes and kind of thinking about how a preview the game I looked at it like\nThis if the giants lose and worse\nIf they get blown out on a standalone stage the fallout is going to be\nFascinating fascinating 'cause I consider look\nIf Philly loses their in last place in the division a pretty rough for game stretch coming up Panthers jags cowboys saints one of those the London games I'm not mistaken a guaranteed drama but it was the most fired up I had been for a Thursday game because\nI either way you're going to have an issue there was going to be some sort of drama attached to it afterwards no matter what and not only was there a drama and not only did the giants get blown out hotel\nBack I'm lost it on the sideline Eli Manning was terrible patch or um or got pissed after the game and of all teams that was the Philadelphia Eagles arch rival with one of the most obnoxious fan bases in the country\nThat was there to dance on your grave and here's the best part for as bad as the giants look\nAre only two games out of first in the air\nStill in the NFC East tons there's still there\nAnd so I was thinking about it and and it it just got me to think in in in regards to the NFL and how it stacks up\nWhen I was thinking and I noticed something because I'm looking I'm looking around the NFL and I'm looking at the NFC East and they've got no winning teams as of right\nNow we're doing this show live it is four oh five eastern time in the morning on October thirteenth is one\nOh five Pacific time\nAnd it's\nTen oh five PM still friday I and our great friends listening on Fox Sports nine Ninety to ... who were there listening right now but as we're standing right now as we're listening and I'm Talking and you're listening and we're all but a good time in whatever capacity you are hammered or not\nThere is no winning team in the NFC East as of right now and if you wanted to use that that you could say and it would be really easy and you could argue it's the worst division in football you might say that\nBut I Would say this and we can debate that\nAnd you can point to the NFC West and you can bring up some other divisions out there but I Will say this I don't know if the NFC used as the worst division and football which you know it definitely is it's the most interesting in the league I mean find\nMe a team that doesn't have a fascinating story line in the ... in fact\nGo around the NFL right now I I Will go round the NFL right now and I can sum up every single division storylines for each team I'll do it right now [noise]\nAll right let's go let's go to the other ... the AFC is you know about the New England patriots\nTheir division the Miami Dolphins look like a hot team to start out the season they've been exposed the past couple of weeks\nThe Buffalo Bills over the past several months in the past couple of years they've had a sex toy thrown on the field they had a former often took Lyman say he worked for the CIA and trying to remove his father's headed a funeral home there the wide receiver try and jump through a window\nThey are a mess owned by the way it was shown McCoy may or may not have hired someone to steal jewelry from his ex

people's ah shows on a Wednesday and so teams are trying to jockey for position and so there's four games\nThat I think are the most important games right here so the first one you've got number to Georgia number Thirteen LSU\nSo that's the CBS SEC game that's going to be a fun one or LSU last they're going to be pissed off\nYou know a a Baton Rouge is going to be ... is going to be rolling

game that I Want to focus on is the one and I kept by the way the brain is a good Jew is a friend or just joking so don't don't run run in cattle to them on social media you rats are All right so the

most overhyped coach and in college football history he has won anything anywhere blah blah blah blah blah I was in Hawaii\nWhen they last week one to Notre Dame\nAnd that's not bragging I'm saying that because I actually wanted to see what some of the reaction was because I watch the game at the hotel bar you know I was pulling one of those uh where I Would tell my girlfriend uh am gonna run downstairs and get towels and then one of the trips I\nA halfway up I forgot that I didn't get towel so I had to go back and grab somebody's talented bring it up like actually went down there to do something worthwhile when reality was I was just having a a mid July to two beers and I was smoking them as fast as I go to run back upstairs\nBut um and who hasn't done that\nBut I I was watching it and and I'm looking through just seeing 'cause I'm watching the game play out and Notre Dame at home week one great environment people are fired up for the game and Notre Dame is dominating the line of scrimmage\nAnd I'm watching I'm seeing some of the reaction on social media and I ... I knew what was going to happen and I just wanted to make sure that everything was confirmed and it's like this the game wasn't even over and everybody was all ready firing off ... hot takes all ready\nGetting crushed\nAnd I'm watching I'm just make it a no ... to keep to myself thinking okay well let's just wait and see how the season turns out well as it turns out Notre Dame is pretty damn good if Notre Dame ones out there going to the college football playoff period as it turns out Notre Dame ... pretty damn good\nMichigan was in that game for most of that game on the road in South bend in a crazy environment week one of the season or crazy things happened week one in the NFL and college football\nSince that game and all the Harbaugh hot takes Michigan is five and ... and ... out scored their opponents two hundred twelve to Seventy one\nI get it\nNot the greatest strength of schedule over that time it's not like he's playing powerhouse programs during that time but don't you want to have big games to look forward to\nHonestly think don't you want to root for that if your team's not in it if your team's nowhere close to being a top program in college football or if your team is it in the NFL playoffs don't you at least want to see a good game\nI mean just see a good game\nWhen you're watching patriots eagles in the super bowl I'm not a patriots fan I'm not a

into that about ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio uh I'm Still waiting by the way to get in reports of what the hell this burger joint was in Milwaukee\nApparently this was put into play years and years ago like in the Nineteen forties or something where a burger joint\nNamed George Web in Wisconsin if the brewers won twelve straight games will be giving out free burgers in Nineteen eighty seven they gave out like a over a hundred and sixty thousand free burgers\nUh so far these are the reviews I've got to George Web right now again if you happen to be from Wisconsin and you know anything about George Web the burger joint or maybe you can do better than this these are the reviews on a on George Web that we've gotten so far\nI have a little bit of a just the music here because

enjoyed the burger um it's free\nWhich is code for you'll never go back to pay for one so enjoy that on Thursday All right no I agree [noise] I don't know if anybody else does this but sometimes you'll see something and you immediately think a one person\nI get ... it'll happen on this show from time to time we talk about Kona beer so much because it's one of my favorite breweries and so people send me pictures when they're drinking like a big wave or along where it's a Hawaiian brewery but it's awesome they have great beers I don't think they have a bad beer um and so people whenever they\nYou see it and you immediately think of one person\nYou'll beat an airport and you see a coffee mug or T shirt or something like that and the gift shop and you think of one person to take a picture and send it to him you'll see a street sign\nA you you have a buddy whose last name is Louis and you're passing Lewis wrote and you'll send a picture of it like this happens from time to time like when there's anything Iowa related I immediately think of Iowa Samara attacked doing producer which\nI don't like because I hate his guts and he's an alcoholic but\nHe used to non Amish with Iowa it's it's ... ... put in my mind is planted there it's a stamp whenever I see anything Iowa related I used to think field of dreams that's all been wiped out it is now Iowa to stay on my technical producer 'cause he's a friend of mine and I see him every single weekend\nBut I was watching Thursday night and I'll be honest with you the only person I could think of while I was watching Thursday Night Football was Ben Mac I Do\nKnow that's probably something I shouldn't have admitted on the air that sounds a little creepy that I was thinking about bend Mac or do while watching a football game but just think about what went down last year\nThan Mac do\nAfter his team went to the playoffs the year before after he took over for Tom Coughlin\nAnd they lost in the playoff game against the Green Bay Packers bed McAteer goes into last season and there was a lot of promise there was a lot of people that actually like the giants to win the NFC East a year ago\nAnd vent Mac do dealt with an injury to his best wide receiver and often civil line that was a roast shifts and that's putting it mildly\nAnd an inconsistent defense with all sorts of dysfunction guys and the secondary calling each other out like all of that stuff\nSo he approaches Eli Manning and he says hey I Want to keep your consecutive starts street going but in Oakland at half time I'd like to put Gino and to get him some work and he lie manning said no either he starting\nOr I'm not coming out of the game I don't like how this feels so Ben Mac do started Gino Smith\nAnd Eli Manning was emotional talking about it and he had tears in his eyes and all of this stuff and ... who made the tough choice he made the tough call\nAnd he got clipped for it got fired organization through one of the bus got buried for it crushed I backed by Macedonia a year ago\nHe gave Eli Manning the option you made it could have started and come out of the half time and I sort of give you lie manning a little bit of credit as well too 'cause he didn't want it to feel artificial and I totally get it but it's not like Ben ... said hey man F you you're sitting this one out and I'm putting in Gino Smith\nNo he gave me the option listen we understand how much the consecutive starts streak means to you I don't want to take that away from you but I Do want to give a Gino Smith another look he's been playing well in practice that was the thinking behind it\nAnd you're going to Oakland and Eli Manning said no I don't want any part of it\nThe organization through Macedonia under the bus fired him clean house everybody rallied around ER manning poor Eli Manning how dare you snap is consecutive wins St ... consecutive starts streak rather how dare you do that Ben Mac do and now here they are still a disaster\nKick back and have a diet right and watched that game on Thursday and go [laughter] I guess I wasn't a problem but here's the thing about the giants then I could do was just one example of what the organization is\nTheir heat checkers their temperature takers that's what the giants are\nMac who made the call last year with Eli Manning he made the tough call that nobody wanted to make their because his last name's manning anyone you a couple of Super Bowls and what did the giants do they fired him\nLast may giants owner John Mara was talking with the M M QB\n... nobody's brought this up John Mars talking with the ...\nAbout the possibility of signing Colin Kaepernick and these are quotes from John Mara quote\nAll my years being in the league I've never received more emotional mail from people than I did about that issue\nIf any of your players ever do that taking the we're never coming to another giants game it wasn't one or two letters it was a lot it's an emotional emotional issue for a lot of people more so than any other issue I've run into and quote\nSo let me get this straight\nBecause some fans told you they weren't going to come to your football games that's why you wouldn't entertain the idea of sighing signing Colin Kaepernick or having one of your players taking me\nIf I was John ... and I said at the time I Would have said oh you don't want to come to the games I don't care don't show up there's a there's a season ticket waiting list for years long somebody will be right there to take your spot\nThere there he checkers that's what they do\nThey take the temperature of the public and the media and then they proceed you've got multiple examples of it\nThey fired a head coach for daring to sit on the line manning at half time of the game because it got negative backlash from the media\nAnd all the fan boys who wanted to make sure that their number tend Jersey was still relevant for another season\nI was a so I was watching the Tony Romo football life documentary I have ever going to do is it's actually really good um Fox Sports radio makes an appearance on the uh Tony Romo documentary oh somebody sent out a tweet like they did a screen shot one of the reviews of Tony Romo Z or early games as a broadcaster\nAnd it was a quote from the Fox sports radio Twitter account that said I'm Tony Romo as a home run already a as a broadcaster and ah that clearly meant that they didn't hear a my show with Brady Quinn because we have crushed Jody robo\nOn several occasions [noise]\nBecause of some of the calls he's made but uh we're morally just teasing we're just prying balls but um yeah it's it's pretty good but I don't I don't think he has any interest in going back then I don't think so either I think he said I I think there was an offer on the table\nAnd I heard there was an offer on the table from the Houston Texans um if you wanted to go back there but I just don't think he would walk back and I've heard\nThat his relationship with Jason

I'm just pick out one series and the whole game where they were first in twenty\nThey they cannot overcome any mistakes they don't attack down the field so first and twenty they threw three straight checked out and as soon as Jim Schwartz gets third in twelve plus he goes to a picket line defense\nAnd he forces you or he doesn't force you you they all they did was cave into the check down and say Quander road they'll pick up as many ... they have\nThe most futile looking off and I can remember and outside of three plays by sake one um they literally were stuck in quicksand the whole night and that is that it has not been a great eagle defense's point Minnesota Vikings shows you that the Tampa Bay buccaneers showed that they've had a lot of problems with the back and they've got\nSo it's it is a is a horrible look\nThere one in five there in the crypt there are thrown dirt on right now I've been wanting five in this league and we came out of it in Indianapolis one year we had the best running back in the league in ... and we we won eight of our last ten file we're in the playoff ... all the way the Senate and finished nine and seven but I Can't see this team coming out of it\nAll right so ... above the ... let's dive into this Giants' even the reason why this office is what it is but what started the obvious is Eli just completely\nShot yeah you you know he's he's out good right now he's not good he he he has no ability to extend to play\nUm he doesn't trust his office of lines who he's reading the rush\nThe weight bad quarterbacks read the rush and I don't blame him in some cases\nBut they and then he has not been accurate you could look at his stats and it says sixty percent whatever but he's not he's not that guy a lot of flash passes ... shutdowns yeah they're they're not taking shots and when they do the balls ending up out of balance I mean there are not accurate down the field they are to for twenty four\nAnd six games on thirty ten plus I mean all they do is part\nAnd so that may go to any phase of all they do is part [laughter] but I go back to the the biggest issue happened when they drafted Eric flowers with a knife pick\nAnd he just got picked up yesterday the actual but when you miss on a pick that high\nThe problem never goes away so what they did was they overpaid for Nate shoulder innate shoulder is a good is a good player if he's in the right scheme if he's in a scheme with Tom Brady in the balls getting out on time regularly\nHe looks okay he's a pretty good player he's not he's not an overly physical guy he's not a great run blocker but he's not going to get your beat mentally he's going to he's a good enough\nAnd so if you have to hold the ball and he's got to go up against ... some of these guys that are good pass Russia She struggles and so that problem never went away and then they had to give a big chunk of their salary cap to try to fix the issue and then the right side of the line is just below average\nNow and then there on the research center I mean you could just in a you know he's he's got no time he's got no confidence his arm looks shot the ages of ... there's no simple\nThe ball he can't get the ball down the field oh they'll back home and they might have been the wrong for them\nTo say it but he was right like when he asked the question Kenny throw the de\nPaul the board he goes I don't know yeah no that's true I mean\nLike you know he's crazy and he's a cuckoo bird but where do you want me to say he's right here he lies got no arm left\nBut you know I'm not defending owed out here in any behavior but they pay them the most money ever too wide receiver in the history of the game to change the game and that gives me an opportunity to change he thought they were gonna put more has played he wants to return to punch now he's screwed up in that area the week before you know but he wants to look too good to have them I Know but\nMean he's he's like you're likely to give me all this money they write this check for me to help them when these games and not give me an opportunity to win the game\nNow now I ... it will let let me ask because they would go back it's still a game ever giants have the ball\nFirst than go to for ... set up by big say climbed play out first play is you can't argue with to run the headache one\nSecond play and served play neither are of fade to back them in the end zone I ... I didn't get that I mean like to me\nYou get the ball the shadow the goal line I'm going to go oh della everybody knows we're going to jail but everybody knows that I'm going to Holyoke Jones who I met Ryan everybody knows what AJ agreement I mainly do\n\nThe weekend and we are seeing intelligent visa eyes on the ... and we're waiting\nTo see and now the playoffs are on the team but only one can call themselves [noise]\nWorld [noise]\nPostseason MLD Tom Ridge is right here on Fox Sports radio\nAnd knew why don't ask for a little one I saw one of those six point\nTo find out fast one on your

could save money switch the guy go go to guy go dot com and fifty minutes you could say fifty\nPercent or more on cards George or a bribe ball bigger aimed for Lincoln Kennedy on after the ... and ah to put a neat bow on the on the giants of shrivel come back up but I I don't know where you go from here\nOr are you when you spent all that money on those Dell back home and your line still struggles and you have no quarterback\nI I don't know where you go all the\nWell I mean you're going to they're going to be by all by all means they're going to be at the top of the draft again I don't think they're going to come out of this thing um you know winning\nBut I don't see this team coming out of it so you're going to go back to the draft and now you have to go fix the quarterback position and so then you're going to and then as you can see with all these young quarterbacks outside of maybe Cleveland\nThey're all going to struggle to win around her freshman quarterback I mean it's just the way that the league is it's just too hard\nYeah and uh converse quality\nMeat eagles the world champion eagles really write it there's sees\nIn got back to three and three\nAnd a clearly through the clash of the division and he said whatever you want about where they are in the conference right now\nBut it'd be ... there was a clash of the division Carson when big such incredible throw one thing you should never do is throw cross your body unless you are blessed with the gift of carts with\nWell you mean talk across your body or against or into the end zone late right to find out Sean Jeff ... is the most unbelievable throw us all week\nRight I mean he's washed out a little pocket ... he's rolling too is right and he just unleash is how it's or as out on foot as Alex ... does the right thing by his quarterback and tries to turn it back up to help\nAs well the eagles have turned her ... seas around and there are legitimate contender again for two reasons one Carson which is completely healthy and he is on fire\nAnd I'll shine Jeffries back in the lineup yeah like that combination right now of ALS Sean Jeffrey with cars who wins looks almost unstoppable and anybody that thought out Sean Jeffrey is a guy or number two that guy is a monster like they can't stop him right now\nAguilar is getting better alright ... is who he is which is basically him right now\nAbout it we'll see the health of Jason Peters lane Johnson going forward\nBut it doesn't really matter that much with Carson's plane like he is he is such a great player it's just such a great great player I mean he could he is back and I know he missed the first couple of games but he he could be back in the MVP race if he continues on this terror that he's on right now\nYeah at the ball on the money or there's it's it's funny early only gonna candy twice by Olivier Vernon ... and a ... came back and make some big plays that really\nKeep well actually the end of the play for fifty yards and you know to me he was running a dummy route there you could see was around ... ... you know it's just scramble drill in in Carson could have taken the checked out on that play and played it safe and just given it to urge for ten yards but that's Carson\nThe guy is looking to rip your juggler out of your throat on every single play because you can yeah well you can you\nCan is right ah and then a real quick on the Peters before he got hurt before he left the game and the tour biceps you didn't look too good\nWell here's your Olivier Vernon you know had a couple of good Russia's against them you know ... kind of knock them off his vows beat\nAdult years on his and he is but he could still lined up and physically in the run game move move bodies now but I don't know if what his condition is right now if she got a tour biceps or whatever um I've always said that a great team that wants to be great will make ten moves\nFrom the start of the season to the end of the season they may have to make a move for running back here are just because the health of that situation and so I don't know who that is they're not going to overpay\nUm I've I've heard all the names that are mentioned but there may have to make a move\nWill tell you I mean the the talks with buffalo are real for ... the bills wanted to\nPoint the bills kind of come to reality and that things could still happen\nIn a while I mean that that wouldn't be that would make sense\nOr look they they've got a one year rental and the super bowl at a J uh jai everybody knew that he had a bad leg now I didn't know it was going to lead to a tour and ACL or I didn't see that coming because that's not what his condition was\nHe had a lot of arthritic condition coming out of Boise State he had it but they got a one year rental for for from pick\nFrom age a ... like they would do that for the first shady go get them all rental and put a legit back behind it that could catch the check downs run the ball\nOut to all the things that they need to be a bell cow he would love to get out of buffalo\nYeah yeah so yeah it makes it does it makes a lot of such a high quality I Want you to meet the rest of the crew we got to stay out of his ... we're going to talk a lot of your key college games today is that we'll get into including Georgia and LSU\nIncluding a Michigan and Wisconsin to Oregon and Washington and whether anybody can

S. gets underway today in Boston Christian Bale the red Sox age goes up against Justin Vernon indifference throws all the I I don't know about you but I like I like the Astros to win it\nUh I don't bosses really good to have a great line up\nBut they just don't have any pitching other they sell you can't have David Price the your second starter and expect to be the Astros\nThe are they the you know he kept a the most prolific home run team in the history of baseball from you know smack them around and they figured out a way to maximize their pictures and everything and limit that lineup so if they've done it against the Yankees\nThen um we all know that that was a weakness in or a hundred and eight when team I think they can find another way to do it now so you you you've got the Boston Red Sox a fighting chance I mean I have a great line up I mean you know a very good lineup so look I I respect Houston uh obviously you know\nThey've got the game's best player right now and you know they have\nThey have all they have all of the they have all the pieces to win it again but I I think Boston can you know I think it's going to go seven games\nAll right well yeah that's it it's interesting the uh the destroys have a a distinct advantage in starting pitching but your point I mean look you know those bats you got ... bats and bending and the and J.

Brown in the run game right now he's a better run blocker than what they sold or\nIs it so they have all the pieces including Phillip door set who is just this speedy fast guy that can do the things that printed cooks did and he's he's a part of it but there's other things right now is fixed and they're going to be a problem\nI mean there is a huge problem huge problem\nAnd Cincinnati Bengals played some really good football foreign one ... ... what have you seen from Cincinnati and it is that real you're making a face some wondering\nWell I mean it's good you're bringing up the right team I saw him two weeks ago against Atlanta they won in the last play in a shootout against the falcons AJ green catches a touchdown pass um the the falcons completely blow the coverage and all that but it's All right they won the game\nSo I'm totally Marvin Louis before the game and um so I was asking about volunteers perfect who came back last week and I'm so he was he was excited to get his leader back on defense so [noise] you know everybody watches all these breakdown so ... has been watching\nSosa picked me up and he said you know the middle of the field is the most important piece of real estate the football game you have to take the middle you have to rule the middle of the field you you can have sideline help on the sideline you have back at the end zone help in the secondary but the middle of the field you have to own it\nSo right now if you look at the bangles\nGino Atkins is a certified well can they be defensive player year he leaves Lincoln sacks along with James yeah you want yeah he's playing out of his mind good yeah\nYou get bartenders perfect back you know mental okay and you put your drought this Jesse Bates safety and all of a sudden the bangles got really good in the middle of the field really good\nSo then you look at what they're doing off instantly alright they get a they get the running back back right so Joe mix in his back and he is a complete\nDo on raw supplier I saw those apply or\nHe had he had a little niece go so he missed a couple of games I saw him down the field with since I was playing Atlanta so I went up there and he's a kid he's like a big kid I mean big but he's like cabinet competition from the fifty yard line\nAnd he's jumping around like he just won the super bowl right and I'm like look at it and we're going to you played you know I got a bad knee I go dude you just like our jumping around here like in his office coordinators looking over their bill laser and he's like\nThis kid though it gives them a real threat it's running game they picked up an office line coach from Dallas and they're often aligned Latino names up there you don't know who these guys are really price dissenters out but they're playing really well together\nThis is going to be a great match them in fact more of an Lewis said his team down yesterday and he showed them all these clips of Pittsburgh Cincinnati where the emotions got basketball declares the ... the pre game the pregame feisty goes if we do this\nBut that quarterback went to Kansas City and he was awful who's responsible for five turnovers\nYeah it's been that bad yeah are you are they can ... be a ... a contender that we talk about ...\nYou could hide the quarter back I mean look I mean there were there last year so I Can't help but like but if you but you have to examine closely because\nThey play buffalo in the first round the playoffs\nAnd that set football back about fifty years quarterback playing that game between to Roger Taylor and Blake borders was awful yeah it was terrible does tragic either team neither quarterback had you complete ... percent of the past is now they did go to they did beat Pittsburgh the following week to get to the AFC Championship game and he played well against Pittsburgh\nPittsburgh they just couldn't come to the tide and the game and you know it was Twenty one now through before they looked up you know and then he was fighting against New England until the fourth quarter so\nHe can play good in stretches but\nYou know he got he got the loan motion and you can bet questionable decisions [noise] and he's just he I talked to the quarterback coach before the game\nAnd he's just said that's such a naturally talented arm I mean from strength standpoint that he just forget about the fundamentals and when he does he bounces of all of the ... ball or bounces off his right guards helmet\nPart Bobby let's talk about the quarter back then he opposed in Kansas City now you saw him he was a rainy day was not good good traction but he he just amazing\nOne is I show my home's has played a grand total right now of a six games six NFL games All right he is the MVP the league right now\nAfter six games five games this year one last year but what I Love is any read after every series goes over sits down with them and reviews all the plays with him and he starts charting the next series what he likes what he does like more coaches should do this with their quarterback\nSo he's kinda he's not coddling them but he's he's making sure that he's you know he's keeping his focus and all that\nHe is a dynamic kid\nWe could've changed Barry recruited him at Texas Tech the first time he saw him do anything was playing a basketball game and he dropped fifty over there and Tyler, Texas and he was the best player to court and he was slam dunk and he could shoot from three who's the best athlete by far there's not a sporty can't play what would that mentality a quarterback\nI was talking to twelve is Kelsey about him and it doesn't matter what the play is\nAnd what the route combinations are on any given play your number can be called 'cause he sees the whole field and he feels like his arm you get the ball anywhere across the field down the field\nYou name it don't it left handed unit whatever he has to do it so it is it's it's a very difficult defensive defend\nI I got to tell you I I'm really I'm happy for him to read I Am too I he's a guy that\nDeserved to win deserves to\nHe's really good quarterbacks knows quarterbacks he's great at developing quarterbacks will continue to

week\nWe were all under five hundred a and there ain't you were in the lead but you will not believe this and this is sort of crazy 'cause I was calculating this all out with the exception of the 'cause he's kinda joined late we all have the exact same identity of cumulative record for the season\nForty fifty four and one I'm not even kidding about that [laughter] they they are ... that is that just a line or you know we're we're we're going against the against the spread so horrible\nYeah it was well I'll I'll tell you this there was a couple of games where we got screwed by a lake now Alabama\nBarely didn't cover like they were thirty five and a half and I think they won't buy like an old I was probably a Louisiana Lafayette right now those against Arkansas as ours so yeah that that uh we got screwed over on that gate there was a couple of other ones that I I was just looking and going through and tabulate ... and I was like man\nSome of the spread and we're going to be that they save us in college yeah college has been kind of how the NFL has yet to fill out and then it has to make some bones in college\nMan what do you even though these teams you can make a few bones\nNFL we were kind of died down to 'cause there was only you and link so yeah it was kind of a bad week because some of those spreads like they were I there there was actually a lot of close games there there there was some ... and then\nSome of the game I think I think I'll have to double ... and we're over five hundred yeah but it's easy to both under ... are you both over five hundred you're both actually doing pretty well way better because they in college it's just so weird because some of these spreads are so humongous where you almost feel like you have to take like a team like Alabama and then you realize it\nOkay there just posting there's caustic so the people in Vegas are getting screwed over right\nOf it but it but didn't me up but I I Believe that's because the coaches are going to say this outfit for\nAll these coaches are looking at these lines okay they use it as a motivating tool that you hear about it from the boosters so if Alabama is favored by I don't know how many the paper by Twenty one of them is already they twenty eight twenty eight okay twenty eight over Missouri\nAlive point it's a lot of points but if Nick doesn't cover against Missouri he hears about it from a lot of important people in his you know within that Tuscaloosa community so it is mine in that fourth quarter if he's got two out of the game he's thinking about that twenty eight point spread I'd seen Alabama ... this part of the half time\nYou know in some of these games against Lafayette an art to yeah yeah yeah yeah they scored every single possession and then you know they back off but I don't know I have a feeling like some of these guys it's it's kind of important to them to make sure they cover yeah yeah I\nAh we'll have our college picks coming up so you want to make sure that you hear bald pay attention to that Baylor Texas line today at that game yeah to fourteen point spread yeah we both have an inkling there we both uh that's that's in Austin and we'll good about that in Austin yeah\nAll right uh let's talk and then she first second and see All right uh we talked eagles extensively let's go to the north\nAnd ah I'm curious to great division right I mean you've got the the bears at three in wall and the Green Bay and Minnesota both two two and one Detroit after that went over and then when the two and three um we're we're yeah had as far as the Packers man does something off with Green Bay\nThere's a lot off me defensively they're not a good football team so that's part of the issue offensively [noise] uh you know Aaron Rodgers a struggle with is health and they showed the health of the receiver\nSteps up but drawn allows Ellison is out and you know a rental car was out so and Jamie Graham looks like he's just\nHe just doesn't I I thought he was going to have this huge role on his office and he he's been so did I Will tell you she's been invisible there he's got one touchdown catch in the first five or six or five\nWe all the McCarthy ... ... ... is it starts it is it time to start looking at it yes of course it's eleven years\nIt's time to start looking you know I mean a\nLot they've they've changed he he changed coordinators this year my pet and comes in defensively but you know they just have not been very good you know the team that you have to really pay attention to in the end of the north are coming off of by weakest Chicago Bears right now and then\nThey go to Miami this week and then they play the New England patriots next week in New England but that's the team with ... with a proven proven defensive coordinator with tons of upfront talent led by what looks like to be the defense of MVP this league ... Mac early on\nThat team can really compete now they boot camp out the last time they played six touchdown but much ... much better player this year it was much better town around they they did what you're supposed to do surround him with as many pieces as you can\nUh let's go to the south first second or ... is Lana have any kind of hope I'm either one of them for their rabbits on defense but they still alive the fence\nBut that talent offensively they did not play well against Pittsburgh and so they needed they needed to play well\nI think um I think it's over for a while that you wouldn't you lose like last week they play without Grady chair the un Jones out for the year Ricardo Allen eye out for the year ... they they've been gutted right down the middle of the defense no great ... will come back\nMaybe Ricardo Allen comes back but I don't think that they can recover ... [noise]\nIt was probably they they were eventually going to go there you know it's a question of when they were going to go and so they made the move but you know that was as bad a performance that they had in Chicago that I have seen this year\nI'm defensively they were God awful that's not anything to do with James Winston but they were awful that day and it didn't matter who is that quarterback um that they could not uh they couldn't stop the Chicago Bears from attacking\nA explained to me how the giants were able to put up all those points gets Carolina in Carolina\nWell I mean you know like they have talent you know um I didn't know that\nThe giants did that to Carolina though did they put up a lot of points again yeah\nRemember it took the last ... right right okay under sixty three are feel go no I mean look Carolina they have a you know in that game or Dell has its best game of the season and they put Bradbury on him and he used them and they blocked him up up front okay\nYou know and so it clearly does not have a leap pass Russia's they've got speed on defense and you know the line backers make a lot of places they don't have a leap pass Russia's and so yeah the ... thirty one points that day but you know there were a you know sixty three our field goal the way they made him a meal out Carolina to come down to make a couple of plays there to get even to the forty hard line to kick that feel go\nDo you buy the Panthers ... are you if their parents deserve stock or you buy and panther style well say this I'm not I'm\nShort in um well um you saw a last week a that against Washington that they were good football team or\nThey played played washing this week but I mean against the giants they were good team I mean you watch Christian McCaffrey he's probably going to lead the NFL and touches he's probably going to get somewhere between three hundred and fifty four hundred touches now\nBig news is the way you can see\nWhat's the guy go go to guy go\nOh let's talk a little ah college selections shall we\nSome great stuff going on the couch picks that's right um the good stuff\nGood stuff today and don't forget a become a card new card member and discover card\nWill match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more that discovered dot com backslash match limitations supply and now I boy let's do it we're all in this one ...\n... it was sad Figi\nLet's get right to it [noise] your ah your your college\n... years old was at Columbia pen where does your YV league [noise]\nWe do every top twenty five ... you\nWere a little bit of Quakers\nIf we can get more if Lincoln we're here he'd be like do we really have to really have to make a pick everyday like I mean what do I record sucks\nRight here we go out all bird tendencies all bird is a four point favorite over Rocky Top actually offer it hasn't really\nExpect a lot more Walberg they'd be disappointed this year\nWell just spit him was you know who's going to be thought to be a top played quarterback has a plate that level tendency looks awful\nThey'd been awful on the road and at home\nOffers got defensive players and\nI expect that team to spill\nTurned it around I I'll take over to ...

Tunisian oh case the Golden State in the west yup it's here the association a curious ... where do you think about what brown Lakers and as far as you know how high did they go\nI think it was good that LeBron went to LA I think it was good for that franchise I think it's good for the NBA he's going to make the Lakers relevant in the NBA is better\nWhen the Lakers are relevant I mean they're just an iconic franchise with a great history Magic Johnson and you know the whole history right there Jerry West a whole group is\nThere's um ... they're going to make it relevant which is good for the league and so I'm I'm excited to watch LeBron I'm In a lake or uniform this year I'm excited watch LeBron anyways because I Love them but and he's great for basketball like he's just you know they they they have marketed this league\nIn the right way with their star players so many good young players and maybe these young guys develop in a much better rate right now in LA\nYes yes ah here you go you're ready ...\nOver on their warriors when well sixty three oh man\nWow wow it's going to be hard to think that they're going to lose twenty games like I just don't see it I'll take the over your over mhm yeah I I hear you probably\nThe me ever know like all those injuries they had last year Steph went out early last year but I mean if they're halfway decently healthy I think they're going to be saving every game they play yeah oh yeah\nHave you on the average the rest factor rather bag with her and you know the road ... you know ... you know type of matchups that just are never fair in the NBA and you're going to get you know half a dozen of those but uh I like to warriors one more sixty three\nCeltics fifty eight and while\nIt's a high number watch too high that's a high number of men but but you know looked at the sixth one fifty last year right then one fifty yeah I'm On the one the last Fifteen or sixteen harder to get there but\nUh I remember that we were out a couple of those games as we were a that's a high number opt out say less than fifty eight yeah I agree but I Do like the Celtics I like everything about it but I I still think that's a high number\nAre you going to stay in the east raptors rap is a pretty good raptors fifty five and a half\nToo high as do I know they made a big trade Kwai I but I think that's ...\nEight Seventy Sixers ... fifty three\nAnd a half a that's still pretty high and I know there one fifty last year there'll be they should be better but that's still everything went ... folks looks better yeah we still buy back down three\nBut he he's he ... the the complete hit she's\nGone into shot okay that's health that is held he's still pushing it it's a little darling yes he started yes you're not coming off the bench okay a Jay's come off Jay Jay alright so Jay Jay had his best year ever they need that shooting um\nI I don't see any change in his ability to score and the way he did a bench scoring I but I\nMean that's probably a good number is ... that's where the rat yeah I'll say I'll say over because I like him yeah\nA Utah forty nine and a half ... a pretty high on of the Mitchell and that group um I'll say\nBut during the tough conference out I'll say under\nYeah I ... I Will chew I Will sue here's your Lakers when you're writing my director for college football games directs the Utah Jazz oh does he yes All right cool so ah I Wish travels well out there um I Will say I'll say under for you tell how about\nThe uh the ... year Lakers overall under forty eight man\nWho I'm going to say under ... has high number I mean look what were they were last year last year well I mean ... Ron I Know but that's a big turn around and I'll say under forty eight ... ... what's the are feeling out there\nFor the cat is I mean look I on his way or the Lakers okay yeah 'cause I get you get I I Do live in laws that night I Do live in Los Angeles that's right but yet I'm sort of hung up on the cast\nThirty and a half at the ... oh my gosh\nI I mean there look the roster is not great but I don't think they're going to be like\nTop of the lottery bad like there's some bad teams in the eastern conference\nLike there's some really bad teams in the eastern ... while the Lana in Atlanta Knicks uh Orlando or bowls are without an argument or Orlando you don't know what you're going to get what the trade like you look at that eastern conference\nLike they're not going to be like yeah Brooke Brooklyn terrible certainly better yeah yeah I mean the Brooklyn yeah yeah probably a lot of layers\nAll right but yeah go I'm like just to see him like a ... in terms of the Lakers and figure it can also chime in on this to a ...\nThe consensus is like yeah you you you think that okay the young team they are going to adjust to it but nobody really thinks that they're going to win\nThe they're going to win the championship or compete with Golden State like LeBron is what I think that no and I I think I think they can get to maybe fifty wins maybe because well Brian is just so good that he that he can because remember this team was like I think they won like almost forty games they want to\nThirty five games last year with the young roster though ball missed thirty of them I think if you're just if all things were to be equal LeBron James by itself is probably good for about Fifteen when I was going to say it that way\nSo many forty eight if it were me I'd be taking the over I'd say there's a sense of optimism out here for a lot of people would have been writing about brain Ingram is this is just people go to be a star\nHe has to be a compliment I Believe a broadening on the ceiling is probably a number two option us an all star player\nA in a really good year or two he's that kind of players a Twenty one game score her with a good defense of versatility right he's never going to be on play with LeBron\nHe can play like little Braun can play it may be the Ford divide and then you off so I mean nobody wants to you and I mean I mean\nThey've done a little bit of it and they they only show so much in pre season but they they showed up a few all offensive sets and a half court while the bronze did kind of post up from the high posts and did a lot of passes and and work the off in that way where he did he had the ball in his hands but not in the traditional sense\nLike we're used to having LeBron have the ball a dribbling it up a court and essentially being the point guard their lineup is so versatile between Rondo and between anger and we started at point guard towards the end of last season after a while to get hurt\nThey have a lot of guys that can initiate the office to take the pressure off of LeBron\nFrom having to handle the basketball so he'll have the ball in his hands a lot but I don't know if he's going to have it in his hands the way we're used to seeing him have it and I think they end up saving his leg so I think if you look at the natural progression of the young guys and the fact that they believe Ingram can really break out for us a big season my idol fifty wins is beyond the realm of possibility I don't\nThursday at seven thirty eastern on Fox News now [noise] [noise]\nWell Fox ... ball Saturday\nDoes

MBA winter three nights in advance OK ... just NBA season starting it's got to be great this month of sports is going to be phenomenal\nBut we must start here\nWith you know one of the most talented athletes and all those sports not just the NFL in all the sports this guy is an incredible athlete he's so talented he's a game breaker\nHe's probably going to rewrite the NFL record book and of course I'm Talking about oh Darryl back on the twenty five year old\nWhat kind of hair cut do they call that Sam he's he's uh twenty five year old receiver of course he's a bit of a ... he's a celebrity he's got what a blonde mohawk is that how we're going to describe it\nSpaghetti top spaghetti top that a little robot ... yeah it's kind of it's kind of a Justin Timberlake Rahman haircut you know I I don't know what it is probably somebody you cooler people out there who are into\nHe's positive for Beckham except for he got paid by the giants and now he thinks he can pop off and\nHe thinks it's his team and he thinks he can run the show and again I Know oh del ... is one of the most talented receivers in the lead but I'm telling you right now the giants are getting dogs for taking a running back\nNumber two overall instead of a franchise quarterback and that was a glaring error but the bigger mistake\nWas the giants giving old job back I'm a five year Ninety five million dollar contract they gave him a wide receiver mind you sixty five million dollars guaranteed and that was a bigger mistake\nThan drafting steak one Barclay it to you got to hear me out on this because I Know oh Dale had a legion of fans not only in America but overseas he is a global superstar things to one catch\nAnd of course you've got the hair and he's a good dancer and he's tight would drink in low Wayne and all these ah entertainers and that's what he wants to be\nI mean he's got the richest Nike contract of any football player ever\nOh Joe ... is an entertainer but the giants made a huge mistake giving an entertainer all this money so I think the reason that it's worth paying or do back in the drafting a running back to it ... the reason is twofold okay\nNumber one\nA lot of money to sink into a receiver at a position where historically you don't need a great receiver to win the Superbowl okay I've done the homework here\nAre you ready for this going back as far as I could in a wide receiver contracts I looked at the highest paid receiver in the league and I tried to find one that won the Superbowl or God\nI couldn't find one I could not find the highest paid receiver who took his team to glory not in the last decade that's for sure and then I went back another decade and there was no evidence of it it does not exist\nCalvin Johnson was the highest paid receiver the NFL and according to the sport track a website that tracks all these contracts\nFor street years you know how many playoff wins Calvin Johnson at that time same as you and I there oh I'm not kidding paint wide receiver doesn't make sense I I was trying to explain this theory to my wife who you know kind of is a sports fan\nAnd I and I an alec guy analogize receivers two luxury watches or even any kind of watch right watches are a great accessory you know they'll show them off their flashy maybe you get a you get all boiling up you get all dressed up you put on your best to watch but ultimately you don't even need it\nYou don't need all watch to win the night you know where are you going to go and people are going to not comment on your outfit or your material or your shoes or what you're saying\nAnd they're not going to bypass all that and say man that watches killer that is awesome watch their luxuries you can go out to a bar put on your best to watch\nMost expensive watch it can help you pick up any girls oh you're not getting more numbers 'cause you're wearing a night swatch watches are like wide receivers their luxuries\nAnd if you don't if you're not sold them the whole Superbowl wide receiver ... Jason come on who who cares that just one reason no no no no no no\nI'm telling you the highest paid receiver doesn't win Super Bowls the fact historically in the NFL so then you say well you need a receiver Jason\nAnd I kind of pulled out the best receiver\nOn each team so well it started last year out Sean Jeffrey was the leading receiver the best receiver on the eagles you got a nice contract out of it you got twenty six million guaranteed twenty six\nYear old job back them got nearly three times the guaranteed money that al ... al ... on Jeopardy had the super bowl ring so the year before patriots beat the falcons right who had Julio Jones who you're Jones got four passes\nIn the super bowl buy them for four basses into overtime game okay in the super bowl and I like ... Jones a lot of the best receiver the patriots had\nWell you probably say Julian Edelman Wright user best receiver you had a great game but James White or running back lead them in receptions with fourteen in that Super Bowl so you want to go back to prior you Denver Broncos\nBeat the Panthers that was a defensive Laden team that led the Broncos to glory their best receiver and I was talking with gab and the producers you hear about it didn't marry as Thomas I mean if you want to give it to a manual standard fine but either way\nThat's your best receiving and that's not the reason they won the Superbowl so that it was a patriots before that and Seattle before that and before that the ravens with an ... Bolden and before that the New York giants with\nHow team next ladies and gentlemen yes the best receiver when the giants beat the patriots in the super bowl was Hakeem Nicks\nHe was out of the league at twenty seven years old\nFolks they're just it's there is no reason the giants should have given oh del back um all that money he's not worth it you're not winning a Super Bowl without doubt back um can you hear me in the back this is for everybody who's\nA huge oh don't fan and you follow him on Instagram and you love him on social media you don't need to pay him Ninety five\nStill there will be

rent because the NBA season starts Tuesday everybody's fired up about\nReminded everybody that at this time last year\nThe biggest story was where's ... going to go is he going to stay blah blah blah and I said he's going to the Lakers and at the time I thought it was going to be him and Paul George obviously things change in Lakers lost interest in Paul George wouldn't go why Leonard became available blah blah blah\nRight now\nMaybe because reporters want to get ahead of it a lot of guys who covered this a\nGolden State warriors team are saying that Kevin Durant is going to be leaving at the end of the season now we are going to talk to Brian when the worst um later in the show and we'll see what he has to say about that but you know\nI got to say when a guy like Marcus Thompson who's been on the show a couple of times you wrote the book on separate when he's coming out and said Katie's gone\nWe got to take a deep ... very close examination of that or what I don't understand then you could ask\nYou know I asked I'll ask my kid this will be like so what do you think Kevin Durant should do\nMy kids are like wait\nTo Kevin Turan who just won two straight finals MVPs and who has won two titles with the warriors and is on top of the what do you mean what should he do it it's not a logical question should Kevin Durant leave right I mean but that's what the NBA\nIs and I tell you this I can say this for sure\nUh yes I'd let me preface it yes I've been\nKevin ... the best player in the NBA for about a year or about two years well twenty Seventeen fine I started when he just destroyed LeBron head to head and I'm a big liberal and God this is not a knock on LeBron but the better score\nIs Kevin Durant the better shooter is Kevin Durant the better defender is Kevin to rent the guy's a unicorn there are no other Kevin Durant\nGame after Jordan it was ... it was great he was a good you know glowing Michael Jordan I mean a poor man's Jordan but he's not that far\nBehind ... still topped Fifteen player in NBA history LeBron unicorn bill like Karl Malone\nSpeed of John Will like you don't find that anywhere and Kevin to rent a unicorn as well so he comes to the warriors are the best team in the league\nThey win a title he's the MVP they went another title easy MVP so now we enter your three and all these reporters are saying I think Kevin ... gone well I I think the question comes down to this\nIs Kevin to ramp more likely to leave if the warriors when the title or is he more likely the day if they win the title\nI there was a favorites I think the only team that can challenge of his Boston I think Boston could beat them in the finals I don't know if they will but\nIf you're to rent this is what I keep coming back to you and this is the guy who's really unknowable I've got to know I'm a little bit on Instagram and you know after my appearance on the heard yesterday yes we send a bunch of messages back and forth a I gotta say\nKevin drains different dishes a guy\nWho grew up right outside of DC Prince George's county area I Know well as I Am from outside that area as well and you know go into oh kill academy and Virginia for some basketball and then it's time to pick a college and he goes to Texas\nKnow plenty of good schools locally where he could have been a star and everybody would have been happy with the text that's kind of random and then after\nSpending eight years in okay see he's shocked a lot of people when he picked the warriors so anybody trying to guess what he's going to do it's a fool's errand it's fun to talk about maybe not for him um\nI keep I just can't I Can't get past this and and you hear me all before we go to Joel glad you're in a minute why would you leave if you've won three straight titles something only Jordan Kobe and Shaq and done\nIn the modern era\nAnd if you win a fourth you've done something nobody in the modern ... no I Do realize that people get sick of tea me remember Jordan retired after this first three it's exhausting\nThe playoff runs added to add another twenty games of the season after three seasons you've done it extra sixty games about and of course Kobe and Shaq imploded after three years together they wanted to kill each other legendary stories about the alleged fight the practice so maybe that's\nWhy people are saying drift gonna leave but there's none of that yet yet there have been dream on VR Steve Kerr moments in the locker room and dream on first ran in Sacramento as like a skirmish not like punching but just like yelling I mean the videos out there\nAnd of course clay could leave but there's just so many unanswered questions my guess if he leaves and I don't think it's a given to me I think he would take the Lakers\nOver the next\nI think Kevin ... would take the Lakers over the next we'll we'll revisit this later but coming up next we're going to talk to ... the Fox sports college football analyst but first\nLet's go to either glow in

J. rhetoric\nThat's dangerous stuff\nVery dangerous now remember the one thing before I ranked the teams in the east\nJust remember this then Simmons loves LA than Simmons\nReally had a lot of fun out here this summer keep an eye on then Simmons wanting to play with LeBron James I Know he's under his rookie contract I Know that's way too far in advance just keep an eye\nOn than Simmons\nRemember Lakers had the second picking the draft\nBend Simmons for initially for the first like two and a half months review or maybe it wasn't too much like the first five or six weeks risky used to work out\nFor the Sixers refused to give 'em medical ... he was just quiet behind the scenes I can tell you a hundred percent ... people were trying to pull up ... percent gets refused to go to Philly didn't want to give any information landed with the next\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] you up to date twenty four hours a day seven days a week I talked to one of those six points that one\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nThe software for twenty seven mobile labs that are going to have a dot com detail with Jason mcentire\n[laughter]\nA big lead is now an\n... guy you know Fox Sports radio studio [laughter] ladies\nAnd gentlemen here's your o.s Jason McIntyre [noise]\nOur number two here on the big leaves fine ports radio host your weekend is off to a great start ladies and gentlemen I'm your host Jason mcentire coming to you live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios Fifteen minutes could\nSave you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance visit guy go dot com for a free re quote open the show talking about oh del back I'm In the New York giants oh boy I I Wonder if my next guest will agree with me I open the show saying yes it was a mistake\nFor the giants to draft a running back sake one Barclay second overall instead of a quarterback but I think it was a bigger mistake to give Becca Ninety five million dollars eight and sixty five of it\nWas guaranteed because now he thinks he's a leader and he can just pop off whenever he wants and I and I and I'm not defending Eli Manning in any way shape or form\nBut you just can't be a guy who's never won a playoff game as they'll go back um hasn't\nAnd and just read your two two time Super Bowl winning quarterback you know this is is it not productive you don't see anybody else doing this to their star quarterback\nAnd it just like it's counterproductive doesn't make sense so we will die back in ... oh do back him versus Eli Manning later in the show but joining us now my man\nOr is every week well last week I finally had to losing record two and three I was tied a couple of weeks ago for first\nAh that's fallen I'm now two games back in the leader tied for thirty eight TA joining us from Ohio he is half the game back tied for fifty a good morning how are you\nDoing I'm All right uh first of all tell me you did not pick the giants and the super ...\nI mean you wouldn't believe with that question let you do that I\nKnow you don't I did not know that TA no way\nYeah you know oh well you're here when it came down to a couple of things on a you know the contents wind was threes as a stale line con yeah um and the line on Thursday morning went down to pick 'em and and you know it was a ... you know they're talking about a ... Johnson for the eagles yeah out\nA bunch of guys and the secondary for Philly was out\nYou know it's a short week the Thursday night road teams were oh in five straight up going into that game well of course our own for so you know you've got a lot of factors that I thought I was a very tough sleep this week and I couldn't it was it was a hard time to find my fifth game so I thought you know hey let me\nTake a shot with the giants I thought there is some line value and you lie\nWhile you're talking about a mistake or you know with Barclay versus you are you could pay owed back um that's fine but ... that's the only if you have a rookie a under a rookie contract that quarterback you can't do it when you got a guy like you I can move by that often so ... it was just a bad bad performance and they've got the real problems in New York\nSo I think so you started out when one ... you've been hot All right let's go to the rest of your picks are actually let let me put cannot fire off one of mine first since ... we already know your giants and one that I I Will sink you took gosh I Hope you took them let's get started let me I took the Pittsburgh Steelers are getting two and a half\nThe spot isn't great given that they just destroyed Atlanta last week but TA or you know my comment is not a great coach he owns more of an Lewis\nThe Steelers always in the last few years just December the bangles and remember this is the bangles team that was down Seventeen three to Miami at home last week to start or the fourth quarter\nI just I I Know offensively the Bengals are good the defensively they're run defense is not good I don't believe they're off into protections good I I like the Steelers you're getting point\nYeah I actually leans looking at it and not take either died on I'll tell you what's what's interesting I'm In something that you have a Steelers a friend who's a fan who who's always in the last couple of years of talked about big ban\nOn the road on one PM games for whatever reason I don't know if it's just it's coincidence or he just doesn't get up to these games but his numbers are\nSubstantially worse if you look back I actually ran some of the numbers of the beginning of uh the beginning of two thousand six teams one PM games on the road he's a complete fifty eight percent of us passes\nVersus sixty six percent in other games six and a half you are or attempt versus seven point nine and his a TV dinner exception ratio is nine touchdowns I interceptions\nVersus fifty eight touchdowns only four interceptions so whatever for whatever reason I at one o'clock he just really struggled on the road and that that kind of push me away from taking Pittsburgh era I Do agree Cincinnati slightly overrated because\nYou know they're they're the fuck have struggled they hold out some of these games like last week\nA against Miami and then a couple of weeks ago in Atlanta and indeed week one so they have a you know they are all good overate from that perspective for me to stay away um but I can understand you taking the Steelers are probably are the better team or in the point that just that Big Bend that really bothered\nI could pick that I'm not sure you'll like this one I've got the Washington Redskins minus one at home versus Carolina um and really you know a lot of people I've got I've read some boxes you heard from people on the radio does not understand this line look one of my favorites are spots in the NFL as a team\nComing off a really really poor performance on prime time so Sunday night Monday Night games really getting blown out with the world can see\nYou know or just completely overreact\nThe next week and that's what you've seen public money all over Carolina here um you know Washington is not nearly as bad as they showed I mean it was just you know they they ran into a war and it's not going to get through breeze or looking for that record a Monday Night but if you look at Carolina they are they are overweight or somewhere to Cincinnati to me\nThe defenses is thirty worse than the NFL um and if you look at stuff a large ... play um overall the thirtieth in the NFL if you look at an offense and defense of yards per flight combined\nYou know they allow a lot of big plays especially one game and look they got lucky too they allowed the giants you know we saw a horrible couple of nights ago liquid thirty points on them last show last I mean they needed six nuclear deal with when\nI think you've got an overrated Carolina team against an undervalued Washington seem coming off of a terrible performance I think they're going to want to bounce back so I think this is more of a\nContrarian kind of spot play\n... it's weird to see a I I Would agree with the pick I have no problems with it I felt like I just saw so many people jump on Washington\nAnd using the same logic as you it makes sense but people who ordinarily it'd be like what's going on\nAnd maybe I'm doing too much research but it looks like Caroline is now favored by one I don't know if that sharp or public money uh but yeah I I don't think that's an awful pick and remember the Redskins just beat Aaron Rodgers at home but they also did lose to Andrew Luck in the ... so for me\nUm and that's what I've got the ravens minus two and a half over Tennessee huh yeah yeah and I know some\nPeople like on a home underdogs heightened but I just think this is the way you look at the numbers Tennessee is really really\nFast really over a year\nFor twenty seventh and the NFL in ... place I'm there often is just atrocious I mean they they they cannot move the ball you saw with the ... I mean they couldn't move the fog and buffalo last week\nMarry oh there's an awful lot for that one performance and the second half of them Philly um he is not look good\nI think I like Baltimore coming off of a last year you know I didn't like them as much last week when you know there are coming off a win against Pittsburgh out now you can get the full attention\nUm after losing to the to my ... so I I'm not sure kind of seed ruin will be able to move the ball against it I mean I think are often uh the ravens will be just enough um and they've got the special food the ban is there I you know my ... and a great job with this heightened because they wouldn't have won a game without just\nWith four hymns dot com you can bypass the doctor's office pharmacy visit and see huge money on your prescription ... just go to for ... dot com slash better consult a licensed physician ad following their confidential medical review you can have the proper prescription deliver directly to your door for a fraction of the price and today will supplies last you can get started with a trial month for just five bucks\nThat's right five dollars here's what you do just go to Fort hymns dot com F.

gentlemen what are the best guides covering the NBA Brian went horse Brian good morning how are ya\nHow's it going Jason it it's going great I'm pumped up for the NBA season so many good topics or I was gonna ask you if you had anything you wanted to get off your chest before the season starts I mean it's starting way early Brian doesn't isn't usually know November tip off\nWell it's really hard to know where everything's going to be in the year but I Would say about the next there and the best position that they've been in a long time for their future because\nThey're not going to the extent ... so therefore they're going to have all their caps they they've got a really exciting player and Kevin knock yeah they're gonna they're gonna tank this year so they're going to get another a high draft pick which you know we'll see maybe they get lucky and win the lottery you know I mean it's\nNot unreasonable to dream of that and and then you could have his eye on Williams and poor thing that's coming back from an ACL uh uh uh\nYou know and uh you know ... and the free agent guy I mean [noise] the future in New York is pretty bright but unfortunately that's something that you have to talk about right now because people are not really focused that much on the season\nI don't get you out of here with just one Brian when ... the great NBA reporter Brian uh LeBron and the Lakers that would be remiss if I didn't ask you about them I\nI think this team you know one two eleven okay what ... ... experience talent\nI think the only deeper team than the Lakers as the Boston Celtics and I believe this is the second best team in the west yes I had abused in which I think it's taken a step back and someone who's covered LeBron forever we know he elevates everybody or people kind of sleeping on the Lakers with low expectations\nThat team you're sleeping on his the raptors raptors are ridiculously deep team and they've got this third year player named ... who is about to bloom\nFell in love with the Instagram videos this summer he was playing it every pick up game available and he didn't I really\nI don't even follow him on Instagram I I I I watched him the other night and again that was not on television there was no television cameras they're built into Anthony Davis his chest without fear\nUm and I mean I'm not saying he's going to be an empty I'm just saying they've got a couple of studs and this guy is emerging but to go back to the Lakers um I think the Lakers are going to be incredibly interesting theme to watch\nUh I think they have developed the style of play from day one which is they're going to a stretch the court lengthwise instead of you know a side to side we all think about\nStretching the floor these days with teams putting shooters in the corner they're going to stretch the court with with getting up and down and speed and I see them doing that from day one which is how you do it you don't\nShow up in February and say okay now we're going to run 'em I think what Brian is\nGiving ... a a lot more slack and he gave David glad he's letting Luke Walton set the agenda for the team and I think they have a nice mix of youth and veteran I just think in the western conference chase and they're going to have a lot of nights where they're not going to or they're not going to have enough and their their biggest problem\nIn the way I see it is they're going to struggle to get their best line up on the court when it matters\nBecause they're going to have to find guy like you know for example I just mentioned Anthony Davis Anthony Davis\nYou know they play the pelicans who is going to be able to guardian city Davis down the stretch of the game they don't have\nBig men defenders and I I just think they're going to struggle to do that and they probably are going to have to make the trade at some point whether that's the end of the season or in the next ... I think they're going to be compelling\nI think they're going to win in the high forties I think they're going to be a playoff team I think the bronze going to have a lot of great nights and we're going to be excited but I don't think they're going to maximize themselves and\nFrankly I don't think they're anywhere close to the second best\nMickey and they'd have to weigh the white flag\nWild as an example I was like I don't know\nYou're talking about them being the second team in the west um go play against uh uh Oklahoma City if you think that anybody anywhere in the entire organization that can handle Steven Adams for five minutes I like I don't know they seem to think that you don't need a center and I look at these western conference teams ahead of them and I'm like I see a whole bunch of big men that are going to torture him\nMove fascinating stuff Brian when north as usual Brian thanks for the great self enjoy a year lunch event today and hopefully we'll talk to you\nI'm going to enjoy house they founded on Minnesota here [laughter] oh All right Brian ... do you have a good one that was Bryan went horse the great NBA reporter or new\nYork Times best seller a lot to chew on their boy a gender Nick here in the studio was just like reacting viscerally do everything when it we'll recap some of that next and I will rank the playoff teams in the west one through eight that's next on the big lead Fox Sports radio for\nMe\nThe place that makes you rise out of your chair\nAnd\nThis is why you know what we\nBox of sports radio\nOkay Ben Mallory here this is a thirty second commercial and I'm going to throw a lot of numbers that you would please stay with me and just Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance this company has been offering great rates and great service rover Seventy five years\nAnd any time you need help you can speak to one of their training specialist twenty four seven the company is guy go go to guy code dot com today\nSorry for all the numbers in five four three two one I Am out of time\nDesigned with exclusive smart likes to do it for English beamed Michelin late switched to the curb of your which giving you unparalleled street three long lasting ... report\nSo when the going gets tough\nMichelin ... is a difference you can see a billboard Walmart and then the other line retailers\nStill very general manager at ... or we're working hard to provide our customers with a quality experience\nLike during the ordinary things extraordinarily well hey we work with credit situations don't let your past getting way up your future let us help you today how their text my team twenty four seven to Gerald seven five eight zero nine we offer Nissan Buick GMC\nFor Lincoln dodge Chrysler cheaper ram high tech stuff today to zero seven five eight zero nine or shop tapes dot com\n[noise] or you should try and figure out from all the wonderful volunteer groups for your time would be most valuable\nHow about a few hours a month to help a child that will last for their lifetime ... be Acosta the cost that\nThe court appointed special advocates for a foster child go to Costa of Arizona dot org or ...\nAt five to four four one three five ... county\nWhere Rick pet to four or five bowl one one eight for touchy county\n\nMountain mobile auto glass is giving away the far\nRight now what you're insured windshield replacement you get fifty dollars cash doesn't delicious donors that White Mountain donor two wonderful launches that White Mountain cafe to amazing dinners at Los ...

listen we get big names on the show\nOkay I have I been in sports media for a while now so we get a lot of reporters coming by ah people connected to good stories and we tried to bring you the best guess possible I'm just going to say this when horse was dropping some have makers\nAbout twenty minutes ago on the show and I've been getting some text from people uh I I've gone on social media I just got a funny text from when we're saying man you moved to LA you're drinking that that purple and gold Kool Aid and you know I got a lot but yeah I'm bullish on the brown and the Lakers this year\nAnd yes some of it has to do with the gym I go to some let's just say some NBA people go there and my kids are in basketball camp where there are some parents of some NBA players ah you know showing up and and let's just say the parents of some ... some front office people in the NBA show up\nI it's just a weird deal out here in LA where you know you walk down the street and you're like is that an NBA player pushing his kid in a stroller like it's just weird and I will say that yes I've been more connected to some NBA people so\nGas and you guys up last week when I said that the Lakers have the second deepest team in the NBA okay that that's ... that's not fiction I Know the words have better talent and yes one through six the warriors no doubt blow away the Lakers but one through eleven and this is a marathon not a sprint and that's why\nI'm all in on the Lakers this year I Do believe firmly that they're the second best team in the west will they have the second best record we shall see but\nI think if they don't get to the conference finals the only team it's taken him down\nIs the Golden State warriors I I'm just not a believer in these rockets I Love the jazz we'll see but now let's get back to the NFL\nAnd I opened the show talking about oh del Beckham the pet children twenty five year old star the giants and\nYou know I I've been not taking shots at all do back um but I've seen through this act and I've been going after him for a while and Yeah Bill Simmons is laughing at me when I talk about on this show that or do Beck and block to be on Twitter I didn't attack ...\n[noise] [noise] oh spit in fact people I Know sometimes you know facts on what you want to hear what the facts don't care about your feelings like the reality is the scorpions and the frog analogy applies here to oh del Becca he took in one month\nIt to go do that come for losses before he took shots at his quarterback\nThat's it\nI opened the show telling everybody who's going to listen give me examples of the last star receiver to take shots public shot at his quarterback and I gave you guys two hours now to come up with things and you know you came up with nobody\nI Can't name a wide receiver who has gone after his\nIt'd be asleep but Matt Ryan has blown more than one game and he's been criticized by the media and the fans but I've never heard Julio Jones taking a shot at Matt right\nAnd then Antonio Brown who we know is of was the first receiver as ... as they come in mentally talented Ben Roethlisberger has made some really clumsy decisions over the years he's had five interception game\nHe's had bad runs and Antonio Brown has never come out and blasted his quarterback\nAnd then my favorite one was who I think you know as a case that he's the best receiver in

I was saying he got a son and you're like these Nick I'm In a way to put them up in the windows you can see it go like these\nLook at oh yeah yeah those are happening yeah I get to get to where things that I have that were like twice a year here uh as you know I wear the exact same outfit\nEvery single Saturday no I wasn't going to as we say treats call you out about it yeah but I Need answers yes what is it OCD or was that one on I mean you know everything I have a I have a pattern in my life I'm I'm very upset now in my life\nKevin ooh this is what I Do I were the exact same shirt every single day so there's a Monday or Tuesday like underwear socks so there is in order to my week no guys that have been around no well Nick knows\nThat I did change my Saturdays shirt I used to have this pact twelve network shirt and that I work for a couple of years here and what happened was my kids\nI'm going to have the same set garb every single okay you're you're burying the lead what's that\nI Need to know why why why actor\n[laughter] what do you mean you can't say I'm a guy in a routine that routine I don't like to change my routine there's okay that\nPattern in my life I get the routine right of driving home I get a routine of maybe even food like I get up at the end of the day there's only a certain amount of food\nRight now by the way I Do eat the same things each day I was a rotation of things that I remember my bachelor lifestyle that I now maintained Monday through friday you\nKnow your bachelor lifestyle has not exciting [laughter]\nBecause there's no variety and your bachelor I Need you to come in here yes smelling like alone now and and assert that's on button like four but because you're not ... well I yeah heroin it'll All right now I I did have a wild night but not\nThat kind of a wild night last night I don't want to hear it I Know you've got to hear this\nAll right so last night uh my station in San Diego is the flagship of the Aztec San Diego state football and made a rare friday night game at home against the air force academy guy so when you think of San Diego I mean it's always a beautiful day beautiful weather everything else\nSo we did our broadcast pre game\nGame was kicking off at six o'clock and he was getting cloudy but then it started clearing now we thought that was sort of an idle threat I'm checking the weather report maybe little shower during the game and almost on Cuba the midway through the second quarter little rain came down not a big crowd obviously\nAnyway so now we get to the third quarter and we've hosted we got listeners storage show there were just hanging out of a sudden you see\nLight me one one shot of lightning in the air the officials gather and they talking about things they're trying to get a report on everything\nPlayers exit the field all the fans exited the stadium midway through the third quarter\nAnd then all hell broke loose I mean the ... pouring rain there was like an hour delay they eventually did resume the game 'cause I was long gone by that time there may have been from all accounts about five hundred people left at the stadium as six ended up winning the game but\nNo one can remember a single time ever\nThat a San Diego state football game was actually delayed because of weather\nI mean I Can't think of one of the recent history and and it had to be\nAnd you know what how do we even maybe scary for some people because again why everyone eggs for you know for anyone who lives in this so called area down to San Diego this it's just simply rare and everybody if you don't live out here if you're never really been out here visited you here you know ah Tony Tony Tony wants to have the song it ever raised in Southern California and you hear all these songs about it\nUm it's it's very true obviously it rains a bit ... but it's you genuinely live your life and you're shocked when it rains last night my wife were watching TV and\nShe goes is that rain and I got no no no no it must be the sprinklers and a half hour later I get up to go in the kitchen and I see oh no it is raining yeah is that foreign so I mean at that shocked me\nGo we a lot of weight gains anytime get canceled because of climate whether we see we sit every Saturday we see games delayed or something because it just does not happen\nIt doesn't end and because of that um here's what's funny about that if you if you love the sound of my voice\nYou're going to get a lot of me today really explain if you don't wow you're going to get a lot I mean they're just said well you just go you know what happened here because of the rain ah Bucky Brooks you know he's in high school football right he has to coach and their game got postponed to tomorrow are you doing\nI'm doing I'm getting my Steve Hartman on looking just you know\nI'm I'm ... working out what else am all try to get like you so I can buy the same outfits and wear them all the same family are\nAll right well you you other style by the way I Love with jade is wearing today there might look into UCLA is this is my honor today a\nWay to USD [laughter] I'm confused and ended up she ... the north ridge girls oh okay yeah that's what I see the sun but she's wearing at UCLA colors proudly today why not UCLA oh and five were start since Nineteen forty three\nAnd a they'll get clobbered against it so they\nDid and I drive last week\nMaybe I think they have tried it against\nBy the way if you want to look that's an team gold say while they're on five but the five teams they have lost Stewart combined twenty four three this year ... so does that count no because my chargers have only lost to the to bite him in the joint get the yellow fin out of the room right now okay Nick and gab and our big\nCharger fan well your neck are both same outfit Saturday guys yeah [laughter] that's it I mean the only ones here I go year\nRound the he's the only during the football season you'll start seeing him where some gold layer Lakers ... the little that type of a flavor you own regular clothes\nOr you know maybe a couple of the gene so but that's about it and so there it is never seen them but anyway these two guys are losing their mind because the line on tomorrow's game chargers on the road against the browns essentially the game hoping it pick up\nAnd then immediately the line move to the chargers minus one like money's coming in on the chargers but in the last twenty four hours apparently an avalanche of money is coming on the browns and now the browns are at one point favorite\n[noise] now now\nSo they're they're actually better than they are but they're only wins are against buffalo where Josh sale and made his debut ... forty niners after they lost ... below\nAnd the raiders those three teams are combined foreign eleven so forget who the chargers have lost to who the hell are they actually beaten they've donated them do they know how many of the forty niners after they went down to fourteenth zero they actually played football ended up winning the game handle it yes\nI Do have a early reading on this game tomorrow in Cleveland that that there is the thing right there in Cleveland where we know the defense has been good at the ink leaving where the dad go rounds can be five and oh yeah it's ... it's in Cleveland where are we know the chargers really aren't the greatest when it comes to stop in the run and they have like Seventeen running backs the browns do\nAnd I'd be bothered with my brother said he balls with his ... sack off with his brother you're saying this is ... ball yes\nOkay\nGlad I'm Glad you mentioned ... before we get to that wow okay not actually bad is that good or bad what do you think he's right now I don't know what I'm listening to is good or bad I don't want to sound like I don't know what I'm Talking about but I don't uh let me talk about the discover card for a second okay become a new card number\nAnd discover car will match all the cash bag you've earned dollar for dollar at the end of your first year\nLoren more discovered dot com slash match\nLimitations apply\nAll right well let's get into Alonzo ball right now be oh by the way just to keep you updated on some of the potential upsets right now on the college football scene that we got some of those for sure a Third Reich Ohio State is losing at home right now six minutes to go on the first half to Minnesota whose own two in conference play\nMeanwhile Florida coming out their big win last week\nThey are getting clobbered on the road by Vanderbilt Twenty one to three are and we're going to have our gate or man a Alex ... joining us here I'm sure he'll be in a great move in about ten minutes or\nA ... ball was on the court with LeBron for the was high watched it\nHad the great alley you play right out of the box they're perfect pass by LeBron lines of put a down not so much after that um we we've been talking about this whole dynamic of Alonzo ball and LeBron James I even spoke to Michael Thompson this week had him on my show and I asked Michael\nSo do you mean you X.\nMichael yes 'cause he I I Know exactly I ... accent I said give me the Laker wind up forget starting line I'm Talking about who are the guys on the court\nAt the end of the game and the games on the line he goes you mean like game seven other western conference finals when the Lakers are playing the war is you know that's my clear that's Michael right this we're jeopardy or is it who's Microsoft and like I said well who's on the court\nThat goes all the bronze on the court you got ... on the court you got ... on the court you got Josh hard on the court and you've got Ron do on the court\nAnd I'm thinking to myself All right so now you're ... I didn't I was thinking right now now you're talking about game seven other western conference finals so by seasons and after all a shakeup of what's the white wine about\nTheir lawns all ball is on the bench ... Rondo is on the court also the wound up playing on a one year contract so\nAre you telling me that one show I mean\nIt is playing critical minutes in critical games late in the season for the Lakers my guess would be is that LeBron is comfortable with Ron ... on the court with him and would like him to remain a Laker where exactly does that put Lorenzo ball who a year ago was introduced as the new face of the Lakers\nSo that all changed once magic and the team wars that front office was able to give the Brian uh the benefits of that happened when they\nTold us on line so he sold us on Showtime is back\nAll of that magic has sold you know he's he's selling us this right two years ago now or you know beginning of a line just grew last year and then all of a sudden lines of hasn't\nRookie campaign it was it was okay it was okay at some flashes a lot of injuries and so now once they saw on the brawn\nWhat was the focus of Ron then all of a sudden it with these veterans they brought in then all of a sudden it's already twenty Nineteen 'cause we're wondering who else are they going to get\nSo now outlines on the back burner so the idea that now if you don't play line so I think Laker fans are going to be okay with that because they're going to say do\nNot that it's your expectations are too dethrone the wars but you're thinking hey you never know and the only way we're going to what is it playing the best players and we all know Ron does a better players and lots of right now so I think Laker fans will actually be okay with this because of the ... coming in changing the dynamic of the team where\nI mean maybe we've got a shot\nIf Iran doesn't come in say they still sign Ronald because you still need Fifteen guys and roster then you say no no no develop the young guys give lines of the chance even if he airs ball air balls in the playoffs or something like Kobe did it's good to learn from it but one foot bronze comes your entire or expectation changes\nBut here's the thing you have these four young players you have Ingram you guys could I keep telling very odd Josh heart any route Lorenzo ball hit three of them are on the court now they have in trends Jeanette starting lineup or more importantly when the games on the line and the only one of them that sitting on the bench\nHis lungs or ball by the way first of all do you think will ... will remain silent if Alonzo sitting on the bench Rondo starting runners playing the critical minutes Ron does now and trench all abroad genes do honestly believe I don't care what the Lakers are paying low bar ball\nAllegedly to keep silent right now there is just\nI have a bunch of feeling good about that holds that plays out that way\nI could see this whole ... ball Laker thing just absolutely exploding in the wrong direction\nI completely disagree I don't I don't think that's realistic because what Brian James of art and you saw yesterday um the way he's already taken Alonzo under his arm taking them under his wing letting them know I've been there I was the hype the guy who came out in his case high school came out of school coming directly to the city and what time from\nLines they'll just did the same thing I Know the pressure of being on the spotlight I Know the pressure of everybody wanting you and interviews and he's taken him under his wing and logical forever be with his father and that's just that I Would never come between that relationship\nBut I think there's an element of him growing up and kind of realizing this was a team we have a chance to do some special things and I'm a part of a team\nAnd I think it it kind of that you know I got it not saying don't be my father not saying don't build the brand 'cause I think Alonzo very much wants to build his brand and continue to push the merchandise but I think there's an element of I got it that I got it\nAnd you think that little bar is going to respect that it doesn't matter what the ... and all of them are shown any respect ... anybody other than him saying keep\nIn mind he was doing this on a ridiculously bad Laker team over the last four or five years right so it well he was able to do it he was a fresh thing on the sideline and in fact he was probably the most entertaining 'cause the Lakers not only are they been bad they haven't even been entertaining\nOr like you have there's nothing there was nothing to hang your hat on like I'll give an example of Phoenix sons have been bad but you look at Devon book or you know\nThat kicking plates Seventy three point yeah name would absolutely we didn't even have that here so ... was able to be a sideshow because you say at least that's entertaining\nNow you've got magic here you've got a bronze here you've got the other guys here and you've got expectation he saw gave us example earlier a you know once labonte came ...\nCan you wear hats in the ... any like okay well I don't\nKnow but it doesn't matter my point is you're just so far but you live in LA do I mean well but I Do you know going back and forth yet you know go out and saying that well now it's not like I used to now let me tell you about the scene I\nMean I can tell you all kinds of foreign clubs or his way back in the day but go ahead so they think about the foreign club went in there and he was the number one night club in LA it in\nIn eighty four we do need to update the guys who was actually in eighty nine and now we've got to have I got here and you know you get in the foreign club back in the day this was I was telling the guys that used to work back in the day so in eighty nine after I left\nThe raiders and started working on air in radio I knew everybody at the forum but\nIf you weren't going to get into that for them ... there's no way I was going to get into that foreign club unless unless I had someone with me\nSo here's how it used to work a Billy Mac who does the TV for the ... just come into town and he's doing you know some early work so we uh we used to have a little competition out there because\nIn order for us to get into foreign ... we had to be next to an insanely hot looking woman okay All right so what we would do is we would sort of work before I'm looking you know\nAnd and basically we would tell the girls we were their ticket to get into the forum ... were they all wanted to be when in reality there are ticket to get in a like the way you weren't retro that's how we used to work and that would get us into the foreign covered that foreign club at that time still in the late eighties early nineties or magic was still playing the things\nThat I'm able to match the biggest nightclub in LA but I was ... LA's version a studio for maybe it was fifty forty that's warm SARS yeah but the studio for is when I yeah hardee's back in a family of four I it was because I mean and the thing about it was if you were there enough times\nThe celebrity they all have their spots but you would walk he would get in and you could see each of these celebrities that were regulars ... el had their little position Eddie\nMurphy Madonna oh they're all like\nBut yeah I can only imagine though I'll get my dog for a whole point was ... I I think in theory right oh man that long ago doesn't play or if he's you know sitting out for a quarter last few minutes\nHe's going to be yeah OK but no one's gonna care because let's say the Lakers win that game the last four minutes everybody's gonna want to talk till abroad I Want to talk to you know bringing or talk to them out of here would ... even ... Jeanie Buss even he's so far down the pecking order now\nAh but I think people are just going to like oh yeah and the bar well\nThey're at home against the chargers the betting line is basically a pick them for the game and you're sort of like shouldn't the charges be a substantial favored over the browns what are your thoughts on that game tomorrow\nOr a couple of things you said a lot of chargers fans and there's no such thing so I needed to\nCollect well they're charging way and I got nicotine gab and so the the good old charger fan in LA just happen to work on this show how's that\nI understand you know you know it's betting money that also comes in right that info on the bright line that people people are all over the brown they love the Cleveland Browns is just it's a very popular picked right now it's a popular team that something different people love Baker Mayfield is why\nThey captured America's heart a on hard knocks you know the problem for them to do is wide receiver position right now really than they signed ...\nEarlier today he's not going to play against the chargers but they lost one wide receiver waking er in er willy is rather she got injured in a book affect collarbone on friday and he was replacing were shot Higgins who's out with a leg you know like injury so you just got Jarvis Landry in ... so a tough deal for the browns I think in that regard but\nYou know what if the team that building confidence\nThat that the big big thing for them as the chargers charters you know we'll see if this type of game that the charges usually lose right at the shorter theme is different so it went\nGreat point and by the way is that ... son\nAnd you know label that plus for the Baltimore Ravens that's worked out for teams are stick out and find or you will see you know again it's a stolen got quite often you\nKnow the old lines and it's and it's all lines even that's why I thought I saw one final thought\nDrew Brees he's completing Seventy eight percent of his passes easier that's ridiculous Seventy eight [laughter] I use thirty eight years old\nI'm try to put perspective historical perspective um we're breeze belongs to the all time you know passing yards leader right now but I don't hear him mention when you're talking about the whole time greatest quarterbacks in NFL history why\nKnow I think let's go back to Paul warning Jim Taylor and a Jim Brown what you know what I'm saying yeah you just mentioned it earlier if so you're playing in a narrow with Tom Brady\nYour you know what I mean and Peyton Manning\nI mean does your contemporaries right and I mean they're you know they're all over the place and they play you know pay just draws eyeballs the TV and Brady was just the most iconic play or maybe the greatest player ever quite\nWinning Super Bowls and Drew Brees just putting up these incredible numbers but you're playing at the same time a Tom Brady I think that's what I think you know look this past week or two the appreciation nationally grew rich or a breeze so I think that there's something to be said for that and by the way an interesting narrative and no one is what we talked about\nYou know how franchise quarterbacks don't want to be taken out of a feel for ...\nWhat about taste something hill and what you just providing\nFor the New Orleans saints I mean he may very well be their quarterback or twenty Nineteen and they have said rich water on the box or as well ... what you know what he's done right now as far as adding that running element that we're wild ... type thing you can catch the ball and he's Jack of all trades player\nIs one of the pastors players on the team nobody wants to raise him my gosh I mean the states or dangerous dangerous team that I think after all the narrative is over I think\nDoing Alex All right we'll have a good wedding out there don't worry plenty of time for your gators to come back on the road against vanity you do not want to lose demand after meeting all those you\nKnow we don't want to just go right about that that um if they do so much it's always a pleasure I Love the grape or conversation you guys are great\nThank you so much Alex ... joins us every Saturday here he's course on series ex um NFL radio when the guy go Fox Sports radio studios the courage shark curse is back\nOh boy and in full force after what happened in game one of the national league championship series\nWill tell you more about the fallout coming up next [noise] [laughter]\nCollege football [laughter]\nEvery fumble hammering touched down\nWhen it comes to see the only football coverage on your radio\nWanting me ...

Saturday is hard when you're washing with your company alive and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios that demands can save me Fifteen Percent or more in a car insurance is a guy go dot com\nFor a free re quote All right so we're keeping an eye on the top twenty five scores or Ohio State man still struggling right now the second half underway leading Seventeen fourteen over Minnesota and of course half time is vanity or down Twenty one seven\nWhen Louis in conference play interesting games coming up Georgia on the road against LSU canals you bounce back after their last last week he got Washington on the road against Oregon we're finally getting some games on the college football season the ... that actually matter\nYou know and that's been my complaint every week is that\nYou know you'll have two or three of the you know forty games fifty games right um that that actually really matter and so now we're getting some good ones bad I mean you even mentioned of course you got the big one tonight with Michigan\nI'm going up against Wisconsin it if if your Michigan you know this really matters because you've got the one last but it's been the Notre Dame so it looks like okay that's a quality loss\nAnd if you're able to beat Wisconsin is rank fifteenth right now the foreign one in ... and that's a great when in in the conference or and then you can go on and I think they still have Penn State Ohio State and you can get some winds against them and mess around at the end of the year when we have one last obviously gonna come down to that Ohio State game but\nIt's a big game for Michigan no labs that little that's a great one there and even Colorado if you're talking about for the pack twelve they're sitting there as he is trying to you know rebounded three into right now but Colorado's right Nineteen thirty five and oh they're undefeated yeah they are undefeated so we're always saying you know can impact will get a team of the costs will play all say they mess around and again\nHad maybe one loss a to a team and that's a quality you know a Washington if you will or something and\nThey want a table and and they you know they end up winning the pact world champions they're going to be in the in the play off of course we all feel like it doesn't matter who's in the play off as long as Alabama's man I as\nLong as it's a two or yes it's healthy it's a given\nWe're going to have my uh Heisman update a little bit later on the show where it's a two has been city at number one probably not going to move out that spot for a while so we'll give you an update on that coming up I last night National League championship series got underway the Dodgers made a decision Kelvin member in the series against\nSeven shutout innings in game one Kurdish I came back with\nHis longest and most affected postseason performance every one eight innings they've never done that in the postseason game gave of just what was it two hits three hits I mean he was lights out in that game against the Atlanta so I was a little curious\nWhen David Roberts and let me preface by saying this all here or is it I said they are but I'm just like\nHere it comes as much as I Love David Roberts when I said Dave Roberts made a decision\nThat's not really reality\nUm the fact is is that management makes all the decisions\nAs far as the Dodgers against Cernan and for David Roberts Dave Dave when he got the job and remember that he's a bench coast for the ... who didn't even give him an interview for their vacancy and it gets hired by the Dodgers and it's sort of like why Dave Roberts\nBecause David Roberts sign on the dotted line that he would be a faithful soldier to the demands of the organization other was will tell you how to do things Dave and if you follow the script you're good\nAnd of course last year came within one game of world championship anyway they made a decision to start curse shine game on this series and wait for real in game two\nAnd you watch Percival the whole dynamic in baseball she'll ... starts for the brewers\nAnd they go after two weddings might it's starting pitcher anymore and baseball is that called me up you know I mean that's gone I've ever do last starting pitcher in baseball\nAnd he had some heroic moments may have been Madison Bumgarner very good you know the just the old school throwback he'll go complete game he'll pitch the next night if you need them to help close the gate I mean just ... and that's around it hit home runs too but um I think he was like the last guy to get some of these before\nGo head to head tonight he's able to American Legion of sharp during uh up until the last\nCouple of games but I I I just think as you mentioned ban the analytics in the in the the math behind the sport the science behind the sport\nOr has definitely taking hold and as you mentioned is even taken away instincts and and he got from managers you kinda have to go with this routine here's what we're starting here's why here's here's what you do any couple of different scenarios\nUm it every now and again they Roberts rather management's will do something in a game that was them yeah but the most part as you mentioned it's it's being written down and they're getting rid of the old guys\nWho want to do it you know their own way\nYou know the social or getting outta here we're ... so she was still a you know a play it you know and again the guy was a catcher for every knows the game but those kind of managers are definitely being phased out so anyway so curse starts last night Dodgers get up to the one that the late\nThey ... they put the relief pitcher already and he hits which was weird because\nWhy if you were going to plug ins Alice why wouldn't you least wait till you could pinch hitting for him right but they already made the pitch he moved so now there's pitcher this relief pitcher is batting in the third and he I mean that wasn't just a home run that was a clobbered job how about this it was the first home run\nEver by a left hand hitting pitcher\nOff a left handed pitcher in the history a major league postseason you and the person who wrote that stat [laughter] you're not true new that first left handed hitting picture they hit a home run off all left handed pitcher in postseason history\nWas a moon shot I mean he'd be last for that and and her ... her so I said you know I knew he could have but I didn't know he could hit like that um and you know what what's disappointing about this so if if if your car saw fan or is that\nAll that well their game five was a disaster there was a disaster for sure and what I was going to say was at least if he could've caught this for for the performance he had this last outing as you mentioned ... never gone that far it was it was a it was a beautiful performance if he would have had that last season when they go all the way the world series you would just say like I Would be one of those you and I always talk about\nA and B ... off the air we talk a lot about what is that you know it just fills rivers MBP or ... or ... Super Bowl like moment even if it's not a memorable play\nThat could have been one of those for clean curse rather have that outing last season it may cause of the world series yeah they lost but just a minute look at this in a World Series running was able to do that exercise demons\nWhat to do it this season when it when you know and then the following up with this in the season where we don't really know exactly what's going to happen this postseason it's\nIt's kind of a waste of a gym for Clinton\nKurt show well he had his longest\nPostseason ... followed by the shortest exactly ... and fall and then again when you look at his career numbers his career ER re regular season is insane to thirty nine ... that is the lowest ER a of any starting pitcher in last hundred years career wise starting pitcher\nHis career postseason areas for twenty six so you know and by the way he has his opt out clauses in his contract this year\nI I ... if ... was he really insane enough to opt out of his deal he has two more guaranteed years on his contract to the tune about Seventy million dollars if you are correct showed you roll the dice and put yourself on the free agent market and ... those two years hoping that you're going to get a bigger deal\n[noise] here's the thing in most sports I Would say no but in baseball we have seen it we saw let's just say here in LA with the angels yeah our pools they signed into like a forty year over like seven billion dollars he's still getting paid a Josh Hamilton even though ...\nLast one I'm your television showed a Fox Sports ... details mass ... [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nI had to get all the way to that part yeah yeah right there Hi Steve Harvey Kevin washing ... by discover card we treat you like [noise] you'd treat you\nAbout that All right so a again keeping her eye and some of the games have a tendency now shaken a twenty to Seventeen lead on the road against number Twenty one Auburn\nThe balls Owen too and conference play three and a half minutes to go on the third quarter they're ... still leaning Florida at ... for the coming up a big win against LSU nine forty seven to go on the third and Ohio State still has shaken Minnesota yet twenty fourteen buckeyes\nSeven minutes to go in the third they're so some interesting games one of those days and Saturday where we gave you though I only get that you know that was that day when a lot of teams went down every\nCouple of years we get those in a you mentioned you got Tennessee up on October right now I mean you've got you've got you got some games right now that that could really costs teams that chance at the college football playoffs or you know even the ones that are ... you know\nAll right I Want to get to coaching right and we were talking a little bit about the day Robert situation you know the day Roberts only gets paid a million dollars I say only about a million dollars to be the manager of the Dodgers he gets the same amount of money to any green gets to manage the San Diego hydrate I\nI'm not gonna lie that doesn't look good but\nI mean if you said it's life his relatives so to the average American that's a lot of money but when you look at other coach I mean look at college coaches college coaches that lesser school obviously you know their schools and All right big names they're making one five oh yeah one two and a and then the coaching Thirteen games he goes in a hundred and sixty to monitor the postseason\nWe're talking about which sports where the manager a coach a matters\nAnd you know this this was a situation where you know when I when I think a basketball and I ... I leave college sports out of it because high school college the coaches are the stars I mean that they're you know because the the players are filing it now but when you get to the professional ranks\nI I can make an argument that major league baseball managers in NBA coaches are almost on the same level I mean let's look at the NBA how many coaches\nAre really difference may cause you can think back to uh Larry Brown was a guy even though you go from team to team\nThere seem to be an immediate turn around but it was a short shelf life and then he'd over walk is overstayed his welcome you could say that Phil Jackson\nWas the best along with a guy like pat Riley of handling stars because their egos where every big as big as their star players which I think is necessary if you're going to a coach effectively stars at that level but most of these guys\nAre just guys sitting in the suit on the bench would you agree or I mean do you think do you think MBA coaches have more of a an eye out\nI Would say this I think NBA coaches\nHave more responsibility mattered more to a team that major league baseball but\nI Do think eventually that they could be neck in neck\nBecause I think the same thing is happening in the NBA analytics this is a system this is how we're going to do it here the type of players and it's more front office driven you look at there are more and I'm In Houston\nOr we're going to shoot threes you know we're going to get through the line when I get it I don't even care of your check fifty six threes in a game I don't care this is how they're going to do it and so then of course now again now works in that case because they might then Tony who of course his office that he ran even before being and he was a match that but my point is they have this philosophy\nI'm so but I mean if you look at\nYou look at young ... and things that he's been able to do a do you look it was a quaint Snyder um so I I Do think coaches still matter\nAll all but let's go back to Dan Tony All right so obviously he revolutionized the game in Phoenix obviously what Steve Nash made Steve national superstar failed in LA failed in New York got another opportunity in Houston now it's working like it was back in the Phoenix days still has your total jail in at eight hours rarely ...\nI Would tell you to hold on okay if we're asking them to have to be the greatest coaches I'm not saying that but I'm saying can they be good to great coaches absolutely um we say he failed in New York because he you know he didn't have the Phoenix Suns success and I and I would agree with that clearly they haven't been in the playoffs since he was there\nHe got into the you know with the conference ... I mean he had a looking like a competitive real team that that they were great and but then he takes it only made lenders sensation for ... station he got you know Tyson Chandler and in in in a Mars thought a mind Carmelo any mind shepherd those guys to do something so again\nThat actually it was something I Would add to my resume pilots him did we make a championship no we're in the postseason a time or two yeah have you seen in the next since I left\nAll right well pop would be the obvious choice of an Enron a coach who is like a bell a check of\nRight so you got Brad Stevens I mean I agree Brad Stevens is the ... the heck of a ... well he is but is he going to get next level I mean right now on paper assuming that Hayward is going to be healthy and a hundred percent this year for Boston and they can keep Kyrie Irving happy this year\nYeah Boston's the team to beat in east what do they don't win this Steven sort of you know level off with I guess your expectations like all the time with you has to be you know I Want a championship or not I mean you don't have to be a good one I Would say now are you Maxine out your roster\nSo I Would like it it to the bulls like Phil Jackson and if you only gave him two or three seasons you'd say well he didn't he didn't get the job done because they didn't beat the pistons eventually\nWhat for years and give or take they finally did so appointees Brad Stevens even if they don't do it this year as a mean next year he does it the point is I see his coaching making a difference and that's the difference between what I'm saying in baseball\nYou're starting to see where managers don't make the difference it doesn't matter\nAs much this lineup matters is rotation matters you know here's how we're going to do it let's shift our defense it's almost you know a a written on a note card here's how we're going to do it whereas the again the NBA all of a sudden breast even comes in and make the Celtics these where we all went oh it's going to take them several years to rebuild\nThe first year like oh second they're like they're they're pretty good then all of a sudden the last two years or the number one seed in east\nWell ... let me give me an example doc rivers alright\nDoc rivers you're proven my point by the way okay now proven my point doc rivers from a ... when when Dan Tony ...\nAnd Dan Tony was with the Lakers and and reverse was with the clippers from a media standpoint it was like night and day\nLike doc rivers here's your media dream right he'll he's he's he's engaging with the media addict yeah he is he's the perfect guy you ask them a question he'll give you an honest answer and he loved them then Tony was the polar opposite like you you couldn't get anything out of this guy he was and I was covering a lot of\nAh games at the staples center that year with those two guys\nBut I'm trying to figure out exactly why rivers are paid more than ... million dollars in the final year of his deal and of course he got a new deal now he's no longer running the show 'em and yet they're record with him as a coach was no different than Vinnie del ... who he succeeded so why am I pain\nWe're like oh this is going to be the ... three no more ... is going to be atrocious\nThey ended up being a pretty good team not saying there are great but I mean\nThe needle put your ... okay there's never an art and I I can bring back Vinnie down that girl and\nGet that no you can't it well you can you can bring it back and get it mediocrity again dark rivers everything I gave him he had the team any and whoever they get to the ... and I\nAnd I would agree with you on that and I was a disappointment but I Would also say some of that just simply one of the players\nGet the job done I got you guys up what was it three to one on the freaking rockets that was an all time low James Hard was that Chris yeah all his fault and yes rivers that was Chris and I'm Chris falls biggest fan obvious to him and that was ... get the job done I\nDo I do I pay the ... if it's all it always comes down to the players always well it's the players the wonder Lucy why am I paying a coach all that are paying the\nCoach to get to help participate in getting a system to help the the ... all of a sudden develop some of these young guys and we've seen that you bring 'em over and he ... all of a sudden the clippers are contenders every single year because he's here I'm not saying it's solely because 'cause I got a hall of fame point guard and a hall of fame caliber power forward and Blake Griffin\nWith all of a sudden if I put you in their up three one get the job done\nWhere's your heart\nThat's what John Butler was saying that those young several ... where's your heart I'm a hundred percent behind you again what is the manager\nAny I mean this was in the sixties first African American head coach in any professional sport and he still plane and even though the first year they lose to Chamberlain in the eastern conference finals the last two years bill Russell was back to back championships under the aging team by the way they were no longer dominant\nWhen he was still able to be the guy center and wasn't a bench guy obviously and coach the team at the same time do you think that's even possible now no but if there was a shot I think believe it or not\nTroy blazer and kind of creating new things now he's no longer interested in you know he's a veteran Jordan he's ... he's like no matter what I Do your now I could beat\nThe warriors I could sweep the warriors this year with this young Laker team and you're not going to say about a ... you know so ... if it's done for him so now I think we've brought as interested in is doing me like doing my thing if he's in so let me do these HBO show that aired yesterday everybody's raving about it I haven't seen that the shop episode to yet\nUh let me start any of these movies let me do this let me start to let me start our school I mean let me do all these amazing things and I can steal a bronze and his son Ronnie\nWho is going to be a freshman in high school next year and I can see him saying alright sunny four more years but by then there'll be one and that will be gone right and I can see him saying let me try to hang out long enough that I have a shot to stick around and then he goes to some team or whether it's the Lakers whatever and he's a player coach he's the only guy could see\nPulling it off because you'll have the clout like Bill Russell did bill Russell at that time many would say maybe viewed as the best way of all time low Ron will be viewed as bless player Alzheimer right there with Jordan he will have the brains just like Bill Russell where no one question is like you know once you get a question of the bronze IQ\nAnd I think there are organizations like for instance maybe the wars and maybe the wars we do that with I guess the ... saving\nHer obviously has shown he down places role I mean you had Luke Walton Fillon they won twenty four in a row without Steve Kerr and then he handed the clipboard to dream on that one again and and so I was going to say we have motives and organizations that are interested in being trailblazers\nGreg ... bringing a Becky I'm Sorry oh Hammond Becky ... all the way up to assistant coach so I that's not far fetched but I I don't think it'll happen but I don't I Do think there's a couple of ways that we will somehow with the warriors organization and then maybe the bronze those will be my two chances\nI got eight that's good that's a ...\nProblem is you're thinking so hard now you can't you're done my my my opt out what you mean I don't know I got it okay I've been trying to see I Know you are I'm at no Gavin no hands because we're getting a new outfit\nOut of this I'm excited you know at least where you can wear Fox Sports radio money we don't have a vote right around [noise]\nFox Sports ... will have to get by the way we

seven minutes to go Florida\nOn the road against Vanderbilt again they were down early big Twenty one three they now have a three point lead but there's still again very much in doubt twenty seven twenty four gators with ten minutes to go and this was the game that flipped Auburn had a narrow lead but now Tennessee and burn control\nThirty Seventeen on the road at Auburn are when nine minutes to go on the game so we've been hoping\nThey'd have to have one of these type of weekends and maybe just maybe this will be\nThat Saturday it's been it's been fun so far just because you've got to keep an eye on all these scores you know I have you know four or five TVs in our face and you're like oh shoot wait okay wait oh ...\nAnd now you're Vanderbilt for instance they just kick the field goal uh the last possession in score and so that was big for them because now they're down three the Florida they are able to get the ball back even if they could just feel go try this thing up so yeah man this is what makes it into\nSchools you've never heard of these they sound like law firms I mean that's not that interesting to me um I mean it's interesting to see to talk about as a stat line where he's you know be like twenty to twenty five three hundred and forty odd for touchdowns\nBut this is some real some real action here and I'm looking forward to Wisconsin Michigan later on as well ah there's a couple of other good games you got coming up here shortly Georgia LSU that should be a good one\nA Washington Oregon which is big for Washington because they can't lose is if they're trying to win this game and still have a shot at representing the pact wasn't getting into college football playoff I'm\nEven a a you know pick say going up against Michigan State and that that Michigan State is rank well but that said you know I should be a good game Colorado us see how legit or the bus the five and ... right now only undefeated twelve they remind me of Utah like a couple of seasons ... where do you like oh you are never mind just Utah\nWell we'll find out about that game by the way who can\nForget eastern Washington versus ... state you know I got what are you may I might DVR set my DVR is set for that one isn't it ... I I don't know what what do you think their mascot is\nAt ... [laughter] ... wherever you ... um by the way there's a game going on right now that has some significant and that is Nebraska\nSo before this college football season during this off season the two most celebrated higher rains were Scott for us to Nebraska and chip Kelly to UCLA I'll go in there to today they weren't combine all intent\nYeah now I mean ... you know ... sometimes you don't get what you asked for at least immediately but right now to brass go with five minutes to go has a ... point lead on the road at Northwestern and I'm hoping for my Bruins there on the road against cows who's ... or shaker\nOr that maybe this will be the day the ...\nNineteen forty five UCLA war started since Nineteen forty three when you start talking about things that happen Seventy years ago that history\nNo that's all they usually only happens in baseball right where you\n... that was the first started this or that sense Eighteen Nineteen area yeah [laughter] well they did it with these two programs ah nebraskan UCLA but like Nebraska are going to finally get a when Scott Frost walking through that door ... I mean he's walking through on the coast [laughter]\nBut in walking through as a player that's for sure how do we know his old school central Florida is undefeated they share\nA undefeated last year you know and you know what to um I have a feeling I mean they're going to get the win here but one of the things that I think would\nIf he could go back you remember when they lost a few weeks ago and he tried to do the whole tough if you're not going to be tough I don't want you you know the team and if you're not going to be you know if you're if you're 'cause we're down over to her oh and three whatever it was it if you're not ready to suck it up and man up you maybe you're not the guy for the school\nAnd like do not right now\nI don't know if you have the ten year enough to do to do those types of things you know I don't know if you have to have the success to do that because I think some of those players like I Will leave coats [laughter] I don't know you like that\nBut hopefully it looks like they're going to get away and ah they're up ten right now for a lesson for a minute or a little about four\nMinutes left in that game or to North western who's not the greatest right now so the two and three but what's to come in and out they have like every five years they're good\nCentral Florida I mean what do you think about central you remember they were only twelve and twenty Fifteen two years later last year they go Thirteen and know what will Josh tribal is their new coach five and ...\nThey got things rolling so uh it'll be interesting to see how these all play out I I wanted to 'em by the way I wanted to get to a little baseball subject matter that we did not address\nBecause it was a major melt down in the aftermath of the Yankees are losing\nOr in their series against the red Sox and it came from cc ... but it is\nNow that we have some kind of scandal involving officiating or umpiring almost on a daily basis I mean there's there's now a a scandal about a pack twelve official was in a\nCentral headquarters replay booth Lenny in his opinion on a play that seem to be very clear that was a targeting against the quarterback that wasn't called the targeting and they came out\nBut I Want to go back to this uh angel Hernandez situation and major league baseball\nSo if you don't know the story about this umpire a year ago he's a Cuban born empire any file a lawsuit against major league baseball for discrimination\nOr that he was being prevented from being at the major events all star games postseason games and everything else since then since he filed the lawsuit he has major league baseball he worked the twenty Seventeen all star game he was in the post season last year he was in the post season this year\nIf you miss game three of the sixteen and one blowout that the red Sox had over the Yankees and the first for any this guy's at first base he's the umpires base they had for reviews in the first four innings plays at first base and three of them were overturned\nThe best part is when he got the one right the smile on his face [laughter]\nWas like mom I made it kind of ... he was so excited to get that one right for review hers basin for any three of them were wrong you would hope that would be the entire postseason run for in a pie right either right or get one reviewed every couple of games are a few games are so uh but I have for the first four innings I mean\nSometimes when you ain't good yang good well and then the next game he's behind the plate and ... about the ad a meltdown yeah so this guy is the where I mean one ... as I haven't heard anything about any fine against the ... [laughter] I guess\nSo in fear of him either they're still giving him these plum assignment I think so but the best but here's the thing about this if your baseball this could work two ways one way it could it could not work and your benefit we detrimental because other\nPump hires even players rather you know even though maybe staff within ... could say oh that works they're scared of this threat or they're scared of this type of law suit\nOn the other end you could say the best thing to work because you say see we told you this guy's not great you know you can say no the reason why we didn't put through these positions is because you're not great\nHe they gave him opportunity last year ... let me throw something that you are right now as far as umpires concern I have been on the record many times for years saying baseball's the one sport you don't need officiating because in the NBA or calling ... and the NFL you're calling penalties same thing in the NHL\nBaseball it's simple it's ball strike safe out fair foul you you don't need it you can do this all electronically but even if you wanted to keep on piracy at each of the bases because you know you have to say you know even if you go to replace safer out well let's talk about the strikes are\nGrandma you know all he did was gay sixty three yard field goal ever since I was a kid I was just always been able to kick\nThe ball along the way these blocks sports radio\nYou dragging on and tell age and the more\nI don't want them to [noise]\nTo find that last one I'm your TV show to Fox Sports com for details fast walk [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd er what does it mean when I say it's just a few minutes could save you fifty percent of our car insurance means you're probably should have got a guy got our concept you minutes ago from the Tennessee Auburn game where the ball's right now with under a minute to go have a third team point lead so\nWe have our first set of the decade or as a rank Tennessee oh into an S. E. C. Y. oh looks like they're going to get the victory on the road against number Twenty one Auburn\nSee one of those schools at you\nThirty two here for Auburn I Would not be surprised if he was looking at the\nLook at this oh there it is top of that helmet yeah by three different guys yes ma'am football's ridiculously violent but a big win for tendency in Ann Arbor and I mean now we're getting down to what the big game tonight for Georgia because everybody saying that it's going to be to SEC teams\nI mean we know Alabama well everyone's\nAssuming now that the the made for TV ESPN playoff which is nothing more than that is always going to include multiple SEC teams because they control the U.S\nYou know what I mean it's getting it's getting low now you know these teams are losing out to ... to be some a couple of big games come up in the later on tonight as well by doing it by the way they\nDon't we miss butch Jones when he was a do we still love our butts Jones this is when you when Bush Jones was coaching at Tennessee State we have to play this song constantly because it's so so good uh Nick is looking for right now you got it ready to roll [noise]\nI mean that is something that is like absolute music to my ... that's ... ... what's his name is already know man [laughter] I was gonna say ... built out first of all the carbon grew up to me Randy Newman [laughter]\nButch ... only going to ... like\nToy Story that college football [laughter] you know you hear this a I miss much Jones at dinner that's funny All right well guess what time it is right now\n... yes what [laughter]\nThe high ...\nIceman up to I don't like to publicize it a lot but I Do I Do have a Heisman\nI've actually seen a there are\nEight hundred and Seventy media members that have a ... that's a ... vote in other words there's six squad rents\nAre they each have a hundred and forty five voters and as I mentioned to you before you ask me how do you get\nOne of those boats and since they don't increase the total either have to leave\nThe state that you represent or you have to die\nTo lose your vote unless you give it up right but not if people do that and and former winners each of them so\nWhen you just become too old\nAnd you you give it to me would you like my vote but you have to stay in California I'm not going anywhere if I Am I'm well that's right you you my wife and going anywhere and you've made that commitment to the rams I have a\nI had a moment last week I'm not going to win the alliance with the Packers yeah there was there was a check you and you know your check on that I Will not wholly off\nOn that I checked in\nThat was a nice when I I just dominated Aaron Rodgers yeah\nYou're you're you're you're breaking up with somebody yeah go on their Facebook page and I'll actually looking pretty good how would otherwise ... wanted to see how they were going through their last little way uh you know they got a new hair cut I watch that's\nWhat you remember when you were alliance fan beating Aaron Rodgers how sweet that was literally habit three times third season three right up until now he's thirty four so did you go\nBack to that place you know when they did have those victory in house we did was look\nLook a tomorrow I may or may not do a little I have a little bit playing really to talk about about the yellow hello I knew this was ... I can see in evolution is alliance suddenly total hell reversal of fortunes in March their way to the playoffs they're off this week\nThat they beat the dolphins the following may or may have some that mostly All right\nHighest when we go and here is my current number three taxes\nBut you are wrong\nMurray with five eleven me go on to try to make it a seven point game\nWell one of the questions about the Heisman races if your team loses that hurts you\nKnow when your team is no defense and your ... Murray who in a game against Texas had four touchdown passes ran for a judge down almost four hundred yards and total up and so to drop them out of my top three would be insane\nYet ah he needs to be there and if we were you and I were watching that game he was the reason they got back in that game I mean that run alone right they're they're taught us that we just said the highlights my three touchdowns tied it up and then there's ... good and all that so he he's the reason they got back in the game he was the reason that you thought they'd have a chance to win so I wasn't his fault\nBut as we know you can't lose many games is still with the highs and so he may be max one more but he can lose\nToo many more high ... or global quarterback is my current number three by the way that call was a courtesy of Toby rolling from Lear feel\nHere is the number two\nHaskins is going to roll back the fifty looking fires middle field\nGoing be from a corner the end zone\nMcLaurin\nOn a boarding one yard past court asking stomach foreign\nBoy and asking the Iowa State quarterback last week as they continue to roll up against Minnesota through for over four hundred yards three touchdowns he leads the nation\nWould twenty five touchdown passes and putting up some big numbers again today is Ohio State has come back in that game it gets Minnesota or by the way just today another four hundred yards passing day so he's\nBut you know he's he is scary man again we talk about how he's the best quarterback Ohio state's hat and in quite some time and they've had some really good quarterback so the ability to run when he needs to he's not a runner but the ability to Romney needs to [noise]\nAnd he's got the basses release really I think maybe it all the caused by ah how's football is actually absolutely a study and as you mentioned I think he's with the performance he did had today I don't think you're going to fall\nOut of your lives next ... no he is not a but as good as he is he ... and this guy\nHere now on the snap rolling writers to our faith ... corner of the Amazon\n\nGoing\nTo like go from ... fields been calling the action for to attack by law\nUndefeated Alabama number one team in the country let me read some numbers for you as to uh is\nSix games into his season for the year he is completing Seventy five point two percent of his past and he is averaging nearly twenty yards a completion\nHe has Eighteen touchdowns\nAnd no pets [noise]\nAny as a couple of shows on the ground so\nStatistically speaking if he keeps up this pace he will have statistically\nAs far as pass or a fish and see\nThe greatest season and the history college football it's rather McCall yeah and it's ridiculous how many four quarters he hasn't played or how he plays he's taken off or how many times in a hurts comes in because it's a blow up by the way\nWe gotta tie none of these teams are great but\nOh well up on this thing now its side thirty one thirty one they were saying\nOh mommy right\nWe're trying to give Scott process in Nebraska credit that they were finally going to get their first one I thought it was fairly safe about I was like four minutes northwestern got a field goal to cut it to seven\nAnd now northwestern is score to tie the game they're heading over to you and I started doing this or the other will go shooters and all of a sudden so Steve Steve you out to help his break that die master to say or what happened here\nNorthwestern scored and then the brass can went three it out with two minutes to go and the northwestern got the ball right back and ties the game and they're going over time tied at thirty on\nBy the way what are the jobs that a lot of people thought was going to be an open job for either a Scott Frost or a chip Kelly was the Florida job dad mall and ended up getting the Florida job\nAnd Florida is on a roll\nThey came back after the big win against LSU the camper behind today got the victory on the road against Vanderbilt so everyone thought you know Scott fries he's at Central Florida come to Florida now I'm going to go to the brass got chip Kelly everybody thought he was going to be with the gators\nAnd I don't want that SEC pressure thanks I'll go to UCLA he didn't want that I think he I think he would prefer to be a west coast had success at Oregon\nUh some of his ideology\nIs more west coast especially LA well any recruiting also can be a problem if you're not really familiar with the landscape writing Miami rooting for those kids Florida state's gonna for those kids even Georgia so absolutely come to LA\nI mean you've got millions upon millions of people here right in your front yard so uh it made sense for chip Kelly to be well animal has done a heck of a job I mean obviously you had a great job at Mississippi State did wonders for that program on your own remember jak press got even getting to the number one ranking ah but this is a great turnaround for the gators\nYou know and that Florida is one of those schools that thinks they belong in the conversation with a league football program because they were there for a while under urban Meyer and the ... era and everything else but I think for a lot of these schools that think they\nBut there are a few schools I've I I'm sure I mean it was very early headed obviously as well in Wisconsin I think is a team without a lot lately they've been good but they haven't been great I haven't taken to the next level\nRight to um you could kind of go down to Virginia\nTech kind of like they'll have another one of those you know the shape and they are less miles and he had a bad more six and they've got some national championships like war has national champion go more recently as\nWell recently yeah so but yeah maybe George Will be more of an equivalent Georgia well again you know they they finally said goodbye to more correct\nAnd it doesn't seem to have heard that Jordan

and there's like a hoodie they'd been wanting to wear\nWell is it basically called me a woman a cause I got all my boots I've been wanting to where I actually spent a we're too to center in touch with the feminine side I don't think\nThere's anything wrong with that is true our live and the guy on Fox Sports radio studios fifty minutes his daddy Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance guy go dot com for free re quote appreciate you good luck it out on the price for the hearing today I was listening to you guys on the way and and uh I Know that in Nebraska decide everything fall apart\nAnd if you're just joining us there all by ten with four minutes ago found a way to lose that thing that overtime in northwestern UCLA is going to break out later today they haven't won a game either and I was thinking about this how long have you\nBeen at Fox Sports radio ooh good question um maybe\nSomewhere between two or three months now who to three months now right and a nachos every day so like\nThey have two or three months is ... you know maybe like a week and a half hour shows okay so how would you feel if after today's show after tomorrow show uh the big execs are called you up and said uh we we would like to sit down and have a talk\nAbout a ratings because so far or this is just uh these shows it's just not up to snuff\nAre basically uh with with what we're seeing so far from you\nOoh I Would say that sounds familiar really [laughter]\n[noise] I think I've been\nThere before [laughter] okay but what is\nThe opposite when those ratings are good yeah there is that I really don't\nRecession already yes I get where you're going his ... it's been two months so if you are in Nebraska fan if you're a UCLA fan and you're talking about two high profile big name hires Scott Ross chip Kelly and people are already getting frustrated and sure I understand frustration but\nA college coach after six\nFive games you can even having this conversation yet\nI I think it's even harder to have that conversation in college football\nThan you you could have it more in the NFL would you shouldn't 'cause see your point you need to get these things time but you it's even harder to have it in college to me because so many things matter and college systems matter more than anything right like if I walked into the NFL and I got let's just keep it local Philip Rivers I I I got to start off I got to fill it rivers I got a great based on good to go\nBut in college man your ideology could be totally different any faster than the if you're a rich right\nYou know I Need thinner guys we can even offering to live and they still being three fifty like in Wisconsin I Want my offensive line will be two fifty to sixty\nSo your whole ideology in a way you going to go about it is different so I have er crews have these young guys who came in under one citizen who thought like I play this way no I'm changing it and just watching it and they're young and they're still literally maturing both mentally and physically I agree with you we don't cut any coaches in any ... any long enough time and\nEven if the players at Nebraska and UCLA war good\nWhich they're not especially since UCLA just sent a quarter back to the NFL even if they were good um they leave so to your point in the NFL I mean let's look at Jackson\nComing into this year and one one football game in two years and even the browns leadership was like well wait a minute let's let's get a GM in here\nLet's give the guy quarterback how am I going to judge a coach if he doesn't have a quarterback so now\nAnd this year and I actually don't even want to have it until halfway through next\nYear so as I mentioned you before because in these three months that I've been here they're going to bring up my ten\nYear like by the way your radio a great holiday where an absolutely great won't get really really good ...\nUm the Indian you hurt me mentioned that this many times your problem mark is that your rational okay [laughter] that is a problem irrational because here here's\nWhy the wrong business you are in the wrong because in India but a lot of that conversation with two edge but also it will it'll hurt you or as well even when you're at home 'cause you're rushing all that's why they don't want to hear the yeah no I hear ya I hear\nWhat let me let me say this I think why we get\nThese these ... we have these conversations in and we get these coaches that are fire when we're like man he had a horrible job that he inherited are horrible team that's why he's here in the first place and then you know they didn't lose when the game are they only won a couple of these fires like man you didn't give it a shot is because part of it is\nI'd rather him than me and sometimes GM's ... yeah yeah yeah the ... have you got to go yeah the failing because sometimes a coach can say brother I can only cook with the ingredients as bill parcell said you know what I did you get you bring me\nAlthough when you're a coach in college you you inherently in a way you are the coach and the gym\nBut no no but I'm referring to remember what I'm saying coming into yes what I'm saying so I coming into these players who you know this is the system is or the players are the things you are left me look I'm trying to make the best of this and then obviously again going back to the NFL where it's really you know about guys who are already here you're not giving me this you're not signing this\nYou know and and that's why I think they're able to let these play these coaches go because\nIt takes to burn that's another year for me to see it was the coach right it was the coach right right well I mean I always do it too I was just over a quarter but of\nCourse they do everybody does it with everybody no matter what your businesses this August\nGavin piped in and said Scott process started it looked like a system coach because he left UCF and they went into a bunch of games without him and he goes in Nebraska and they haven't wanted against is the first time the program has ever been on sex and I thought well wait a minute no that's not that's how it works out all\nUCF is still winning because of what Scott Frost built\nOutlaw Barry Switzer with Jimmy Johnson players with the Dallas Cowboys what happened up in Oregon as well I'll chip Kelly lab saluted outlawed George C for with Bill waltzes players with the forty niners\nAnd so now you have to give Scott frosty ability to say hey what you build it UCF can you go build that at Nebraska and you're not going to get the answer in two months\nSo I think there are some people for instance clay held and\nEverybody is hard on him and they you know there are they looking for help night maybe he should go if he loses tonight they should they should let him go and people are saying that and I can understand that more than a Tom Herman\nMore then it's got for us because I saw what they build I saw chip Kelly I seen what they build I've seen what they can do I know their identity\nI don't know ... office is the defenses or does he developed quarterback because he developed defensive player to the defense of renting a developed running back like I don't even know what he does well\nSo to me when you were that guy there's something or or I guess in this case nothing about you that's identifiable then to me I can hear that more so than a Tom Herman or chip Kelly while to me that I Need to give this person time because I Know what they do ... if you want to go to the NBA might and Tony\nIf I gave him the players and give him time that I Know what I'm going to get I'm going to get an office is going to rank high the tops of the labor going with a bunch of games\nClearly hadn't won a championship but my point is I Know what I'm gonna get so the idea that chip Kelly needs to be gone already if they go oh and six that after you know today is absurd because give him time give us recruits give them ...\nThis is fine for radio sports\nNews for a white mom I Want to six points\nTo find out that one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for details fast fast water [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nOkay uh my wife and their [laughter]\nMargaret Kelvin watching a buck you'll be along in a couple of hours or you know whenever he gets there Adam cap when the ten minutes great news quick way he says the money's which the guy who got a guy could icon Fifteen minutes\nSaid Fifteen Percent or more on cars a man each other's sneaking it under the radar okay I Want to hear that so Troy Aikman the other night did you watch the giants and the eagles\nAnd I want my eyes back I Want like the area so I didn't watch I Am and I mean they're not even light for three hours I I Want my our and about our fifty minutes\nRight while you it was actually fun you just have the time it so that when you got to the TV the eagles out the ball [laughter]\nAnd the eagles and the balls fight yeah there was a football game happening if there was the giants had the ball it was a kind of like turning on the TV at noon there's an annoying soap opera on\nUh that isn't really that good and isn't really offering you any entertainment and so uh that's what happened with that football game but I noticed\nYou know there were more all the unnecessary roughness calls in the you know the controversial a quarterback not that bad of hits that are getting dragged inside\nAnd so everybody's all upset about that and I get it we're going through that as a as an NFL society that's fine but at one point\nOr not necessarily roughness call was thrown at the eagles for a hit\nI Want to call it middle of the road like I've seen less north shore with Clay Masters and whatnot called what it gets called and they do the formal replay and and then ounces just kind of like oh oh okay I guess that's the that's that's the flying into one Eighteen and Troy Aikman just\nKind of quickly goes containing the fun out of the game or a day\nI was like OK to things just happen wine is quite a sentence to come out of the mouth of one of the lead broadcasters short for Fox on\nPrime time National Football league game boy they've taken all the fun out of the game so there was that but then secondarily I'm also thinking to myself\nI don't agree\nAnd it was strange coming from a quarterback and I don't agree now I Do think we're in that\nWe're a little bit over our skis right there trying something new and and this is what normally happens we've got a new rule or we're going to be very stringent about it and then it will it will dial back\nBut a new normal will get created and I'm Sorry if it's not very uh popular but the fact that there are more points and the fact that all of our fantasy teams are all good\n... and the fact that these games seemingly are never over and there's thirty eight to thirty one like that rams Vikings game a couple of weeks ago I'm Sorry Matt I dig it it's fun I like it I don't agree okay\nHum I refer let me rephrase it\nI'm not a person who believes just because there's a bunch of points that all of a sudden there has to be the what's funny is I enjoy raven Steelers you know games that would be Seventeen for your I enjoy those I'm not saying I Want nine that three every week type of games but I enjoy defense\nKill him but if you hurt them or your your your bruised him up a bit of an effect how he plays in your team as a chance to win so I enjoy I enjoy defense still in all sports um and to me if you want to tie to the NBA like just because they're shooting three then that's the way and it looks like that doesn't mean it's entertaining me I like watching a guy dropping down a\nRoad came all I Want and showing me some post move\nWhile you're you're from your from Detroit had yeah so you don't get an opinion on the NBA Entertainment as you like it when people beat the living crap out of each other and the final score Seventy nine Seventy thousand by people\nYou meet me beating you right now is beat us at ... am I Know but but so are you ready to yes it more often more explosive I'll give you that I understand that but I Do think there's an element and I think what choice and then I think this is why you get\nObviously guys from their era and this is the guy in mind you who basically retire because of concussions yup\nSo this is you would think he'd be more of a sudden Clinton gave up its right stop killing these quarterbacks but I think there is an element where he knows even when I was back in you know the San ... playing were friends on the back yard that was a part of\nAn art nobody wants to be an athlete and feel like the other side doesn't have a chance to be like you and me going to play like Billy Madison let's go play dodge balls kindergartners right yeah I mean like we're going to win you and I think\nRight and I think I think he appreciates when he was playing the competition of man I had to be you know Lawrence Taylor and these guys had to beat that forty niners defense with Charles Haley and all those dancing or all those guys are back as a beat these guys and I think he appreciates\nThe competition of it like beating a sound great defense like anybody who beat the books\nFrom like two thousand and one oh five you're like my gosh we read the books have you read the ravens pretty much any area was was there you guys would be the end you and you wind going like that's why you saw this love and respect from guys who are Michael ... and Brett Farr of the world and like they just 'cause I Know\nAnd the last thing I'll say real quick Mart when it comes to the whole hard hits look it's football guys are going to get hit hard I Will be the first to admit the last four years of my life I don't enjoy the hard hits as\nMuch as I Am way I'm not saying I Want all the hardest I'm\nSaying I on defense because now I Know what it's doing these guys are right they can I just watch the junior say a documentary and it it it was tough\nTo walk out of the ways that amazing oh man I mean you see and I have watched it yet I read about it I'd watch their well actually interviewed the guy who did it okay yeah we had him on his on a showdown in San Diego I Can't wait to see but I have an edge in\nThis um it's good you're going to enjoy it it's gonna be tough to walk off the last you know forty five minutes or so because\nYou realize how many guys are walking the earth how many guys you and I do shows when they do and and then you realize\nThat something go wrong oh yeah and it or you know cool to watch it as one hit in particular\nA it was his own team made it and they went to go tackle the guy junior got 'em down earlier in his teammate comes flying any hits them any his body made up\nJust such a a natural reaction that it is now knowing what it is you know him taking his life it makes you go it makes your stomach but with that being said uh I think the NFL just needs to be more forthright look hits you might\nGet see the you might get some random walk around your lip here is all the information\nSome guys are still got a little a as a wire heightened thing I think his fans we can feel better about what do we feel better about it knowing that the players know so not only do we know but we know that the people were out there\nHave decided I Want to go ahead and take on this resolutely agree no question so I actually don't conceptually disagree with anything that you just said I have nothing against defense I don't think every game has to be fifty to forty or anything like that\nI I what I Do think though is this especially someone who grew\nNot fun anymore and I know that Grapel didn't even get hurt by getting hit by anybody he just simply took a bad step out of the pocket but I understand what the NFL's trying to do the NFL is trying to say we need a all if if if possible all thirty two of our quarterbacks\nTo play sixteen games and it makes a huge difference the forty niners season went from something that was interesting to something that suddenly feels like playing for a draft pick in the blink of an eye and if I ... I don't want that\nBut let me ask you this is this really gonna be any different than than a ... or any other year meaning\nSome guys are going to get hurt on flu place Jimmy gee some guys are going to get hurt on what the even the league now still deems legal tackle it just going to like a freaky way that he fell he's got a following his wrist the wrong way I mean we saw what your boy um\nAh the quarterback ... Taylor when he fell over here on her as he got hurt and obviously it just things are going to happen\nTo me still regard it's football so violent sport you got guys let me think how many times we see a quarterback his own Lyman kind of lands on his leg wrong I mean things happen that that you\nKnow but but is it a coincidence is about to be weeks six is it a coincidence I'm looking around the league right now Rogers hurt but hasn't missed the game doesn't look right though Mario\nMissed a game and a half and outside of that I starting quarterback hasn't missed the game\nOut I'm real quick thing is you are you made reference earlier to who could have seen all these ties coming and I'm thinking now that I've watched that ten minute clock in the summertime we should've known Mike there have been a bunch of other games that were really close and we're going to keep seeing that if they keep that ten minute clock are they going to get rid of that\nWell there's been no talk about going back to Fifteen I Know it\nCame with some consternation some people complain plus you know you have to see the other thing is going with this world where the other team you know they get the ball back to tired\nStudents ties I think lose an extra five minutes if it can make a really good point I think people should be talking about that more of the ... the the the issue Dallas around the league and this is going to be a big issue with the competition committee\nWith with a defensive lineman this was the one issue that coaches have guys that I've talked to how in the world could aid defensive lineman turned his body on an on his way to ... to hit the quarterback you just don't have the time to do that and that's something that the competition committee has to do has to take a look at and I think they will after the seasons 'cause right now\nIt's it's it's been costly it it hasn't been a long road ahead by the way that's up to the issue which we all thought it would be right it's really\nTaking two steps will sometimes you take a ... you take only once one step and you fly the quarterback what he's supposed to do how how in the world can you turn your body in the air and we saw what happened with the defensive lineman for the dolphin to wind up to his ACL he tried to do it and didn't work\nAdam really great stuff thank you for coming on today we appreciate it does suck you\nOkay Adam caplin series at him NFL insider he brought a great point though we've had some players\nCome up ... or ... or make some awkward plays or the you know that they didn't like that and live normally it looks a little\nNo you're going he was too weak guy tackling with their arms out like spread because they're just like I I wanted to echo am but I don't want to talk\nTo you they don't know exactly what to do that and it is in favor of these QB then you got you know been Robbins burger out here flop and like he was you know ...\nOut here you know flailing they get some calls so it's definitely an interesting thing by the way a league um\nI'm looking like a genius right now oh you want to say that hold on we put all our ah your\nAnswers to the questions MVP of the league NFL or you know teams going to represent NFC AMC\nI'm looking like a genes right now hold that hold back I I Want to hear why you're seeing yeah I'm gonna tell you that okay that next high that's going on that [noise] [laughter]\n...

I Will say one last SEC teen can still get it no doubt\nAny loss Enron T ... Alabama go six and six or in\nA way and I wouldn't even be mad [laughter] and I would not even man I Would and then I Would go to the NFL and I would say do you want to put your worst team up against them right [laughter]\nSo no chance Nick I read your lives don't say that [laughter] do you think to talk of the law is going to be in the NFL\nYes right okay do you looks like he's going to be special and they have all these players all around the only issue where he's the Alabama's defense and not quite Alabama Steven now granted it could be because they're playing ninth stringer I kinda like this Alabama better\nI like ... yeah yeah 'cause I mean we talk about this they've never had a quarterback that you go it's pretty good\nI've never ever watched Alabama and walked away and said their best player is there a quarter but I Know\nI mean a gym McCann was the best but that wasn't because of his quarterback play if you know what I mean [laughter] ah thanks Brent yeah I didn't want to go all Brennan you um\nBut he I I think it will be it'll be a backup in another ten years in legally who I think he could play football or what's the one that's calling games now forgot his youngest ... Mac or ah\nOh oh oh no I'm\nLike two years before McCarron that gonna he's already calling game game yes is it back or\nNot McIlroy yes a golfer not McIlroy but it's something like that [laughter] I don't know I don't know I have three kids will come back\nAlabama keeps winning all these years with no real quarterback right now all of a sudden they got to a nice day and I think that even way we've got to go back out there you know [laughter] it's not freak out in the late\nLuckily our light lauded as already forward enough and so if you give up a touchdown and say okay the only thing as the gamblers we get all upset and they say but\nThey will uh when they get extended everybody\nOf course they do that's a that's the nature of it okay for down for Pitt but they're in field goal range so this\nWould mean that Notre Dame is going to need a touchdown still a lot of time in this game twelve twenty three to go to bed with an opportunity at a five point lead right now they're up fourteen to twelve and they've got a kicker lining one up from thirty six yards away a\nDrag McIlroy Greg McIlroy McIlroy boy he's calling games now or that field goal is not good\nThat they'll go is not good I have a really good friend here in Southern California is at this game I gotta figure he's really nervous because when you go to a game all the way out there in South bend at a team is six you know if they suddenly lose their perfect season that's the kind of guy they would blame it on my back to Southern California and all the Notre Dame fans out here will be like\nThat was your fault you went out there and put the ... you would hope he makes it back right side yeah we'll have good good luck to you on um I got another workplace question for you you don't like what we started off\nThe show where you got her off of that you put me in a press you keep trying to be fired or something like I'm actually just snap on the bus this one will be here for you at this one's a little less personal\nUm I Wonder about this this is the kind of stuff I Wonder about what I'm driving around okay\nLike if a friend comes over to your house as pop open a bottle of wine and he says I'm not happy at work what's the first thing you would say to him why and ask them what\nThen it gives you the reasons well I just the the co workers in Iowa just number not driving\nJust not the right fit for me and what I bring to the table and so I really would like to uh I'd like to work for a different company\nOnce that was established then I Would tell him or her to leave carry like go to get another job yeah\nSo but we don't do that with athletes know that's one Jimmy Butler is saying that's what Jim e butler is saying that is what Kevin Duran said three years ago and it's what Kyrie Irving said a couple of years ago\nAnd what we do in sports when someone does that is we immediately judge them to be\nPoor people poor employees a misguided or guys that don't understand the right way to go about business why\nWhy like I and I know sometimes it's difficult to compare sports jobs to the other jobs in the corporate world but the rest of us may may have\nBut I Do believe in this and here's how I can prove it I've made it very well documented here five sports radio that I'm a fan of the Golden State warriors Mets are defending Kevin to read\nA book ... personally for the last three years and I've often been backed into the corner by people say oh how would you feel if Kevin then left the warriors\nWell guess what kind of sounds like I'm going to get my shot to respond to that next year and you know what I'll say\nThey want to go do something else when there's something else\nSee this is why I'm Glad I'm here sometimes because sometimes we got to bring you back down\nThere [laughter] I said why don't why your environment and you want something different as they ... as a working adult in America you get that here you go here and me tell you why\nIs what is your why what is the reasoning behind it what we have found out is that Kevin\nIt's not my type of community or I hate my bosses no he actually has fond memory of all the people there at the time they're the city there everything has was validation of I'm not great unless I win so he then took an easier route is that different than most athletes\nI think a lot of guys like that's the one they weren't rings military NBA play what race but we'll get different things that I Want to be the guy to lead Eighteen God's will do that that whole car is doing what he said I was tired of being son I got a ... you have in the\nBronx brand those gas around in the ... and I'm Renee right what what well although\nI was here so Kyrie goes to a team that you know at the time we didn't think it would be a super team now looking at everybody goes they know he's going to be the leader of the team\nKevin Durant was that'd be go joined us you know one Seventy three wins who I was up three one on and should have been so again he has the right to leave Iraq one hole you agree with you on that\nSort of females so here's the thing about major league baseball and\nThe brewers are going to win the world series um and I and I I've been saying that for a week an hour for the president started the brought you to have in August so long you know the brewers here's what now look at what I'm going into a layoff I look for the team that has\nThe look the look and sometimes it's not easy to find\nBut there is especially when it comes to baseball this quirky it doesn't really matter if you have the best team you're right you know what I mean like somebody who just went off the end of the bat in the ninth inning and it flows over the first basins and you're like oh my gosh we won the game that doesn't mean you're the best team\nI'm I'm sure the red Sox or any other shows and quite frankly the Dodgers they're they're probably better teams and the brewers they're probably the fourth ranked power ranking team of these\nTheir way and do not just ah get into the play offs but somehow taking the decision from the cubs doing it at Wrigley Field I'm an all year long yell at each that acquisition he's probably the MVP for me they just have the look\nThey get something going on there may so awesome they got some positive energy going on\nYou you know the team that a first of all bashed rows without some say about that well there are there yeah they have something to say about it but to your point you know who reminds me of what you're saying that example of that to me was the Kansas City royals\nAgree where they just had that look like they actually are stupid enough to believe that can win that letting you don't like they didn't know there are too young they were just like we just go on an airplane lose play you know play our way and we can win and next thing you know they did it when they were two or three years whether\nThey want well no the only one one where they win two or three went on yes yes they went through the last one of the giants they beat the Mets I think in the in the world series but yeah like they were ...\nThat's what I say my point was that I I I feel you were you looking at me like\nJust like they they're going to win does this not fit the eagles last year I mean they lost their MVP quarterback\nAnd then the backup came in most awful for two weeks and then somehow some way to like oh my gosh like this some sort of magic hit and they went on a four week run and they want to sort of all I'm with you but I'm not ... not the the Astros I'm not counting on anybody all four of these teams are are standing\nBut the brewers um you know they get game one they're like they're already man this game is flying flying by early scheme and the fifth inning right now and when a scoreless game goes into the late innings and you've got the best bullpen and baseball and you're at home I just I didn't like me what is there going to find a way to describe this one out you know\nSince we're in LA I Will say\nAnd they keep fighting back no they do and so they got to live to the Dodgers credit man I mean that in there and the Dodgers staff to man that pitching staff and obviously got stuck herself man [laughter]\nHow are you going to do that you had a mean\nArguably your greatest ... by law Audi I hate to reclaim commercial I'm like ... what are the greatest human being and which are not so great\nDude any such a great example is all of these things the only thing he's missing he's got a little bit of the might drop complex where you're like gosh if there was a just some sort of I don't know popping personality trait that you had you'd be an even bigger deal but I think many yeah you just hate\nMail out without the commercial it paid man do know what I mean like great great encourage does not hosting Santa online I don't know I get carried away\nI mean unless they do I have an Amish skit ... other than that [laughter]\n[noise] oh good thank you so they were in ... the main ... ... ... ... who was the best quarterback for Fifteen Years it would not I don't think it would including Tom Brady was painting may was then yes but when you went into the playoffs\nAnd there were like who's the best quarterback you were like\nOh say [laughter]\nIt is\nYeah I Would say while you're there once there was a playoff game outside yup once I don't care where he was if the game was outside in December January you're like ... this isn't going to do well\nIt and even I I did the biggest Peyton Manning fan and have an obligation let's go\nLet's go who we play the ... the patriots where ... some right [laughter] that's roe [laughter] oh boy and my point is that screen Kurt Shaw or for the last decade has been no ... no pitcher that you've won over here and there's no pitch you would have had the ball a witness to gain his hearing what is it like two twenty nine\nYou're watching it on TV this is what I'm Talking about with the brewers you ever do this quarterback drops back\nEverything's in rhythm less it fly you can't see on the TV where that thing's going yet [noise] but you could just be you know it yeah you're like oh that was in rent them this is going to get that that like that's what the ... that play for Notre Dame had outlook [noise] the second he let that go I'm like you saw my arms go up um I guess the fact\nThat you're a little little concerning behind the Bruins I'm not going to lie like yes they're they're they're really good I don't think they let the national league and the gory just ... up to the bullpen is good they look I'll give you this is the best player in baseball you know a common denominator\nIs is it's it's Cain I mentioned came when I mentioned the the royals rental Kane\nIs a common denominator I don't know why but I just felt the need to say that 'cause he was with the royals and I said the last thing that has a book\nIs good player um but that was a great pass a for Notre Dame yeah sure Notre Dame ... million Peyton Manning was that guy though to me he had that Clinton cursed shall we managed to best ... and thanks to lead told me to thirty nine so I was close\nA career you are it's that's totally dig holes in the air or what she did and where you know guys hit the balls everywhere I mean this is the last three or four years every year the new home run record no new home on right now new Roman writer yet ... two thirty nine that's crazy I hate\nFor him the way his own fan base looked at him because they love him they understand what you and I are saying but there is it yeah but there is this\nYour base and they keep an eye on it but there is this thing in the back of their head whether it's just like\nYeah man with love ... man yeah but it's just not you want it to be all you know all the way there\nIt's not and it's it's not an artist you the reason why to mark is because who are the two of the Dodgers rival the giants what are they done obviously not lived most most Reese\nMoments I saw the tweet last night as ready for the three was ready for this [noise] somebody said this out last night\nMadison Bumgarner could take the mound in a playoff game tonight and give up when the six runs without getting it out and still have a lower playoff the IRA think late in ...\nThat was the most disrespect will stay with my like I was like oh\n... oh my gosh they're\nAt their lives my point [laughter] look first of all I'm sounding like a genius right oh man because that's my point though the the brewers on was that ... was it a summit of just ... first of all these baseball players are on the line there did not aligned with the ice you know there's\nThe chance are getting carried away there I Do like they're getting used to be a little gold chain that your grandfather world he was Catholic look like now\nIf everybody can have a turnover in college football that's the key chain is what they call it an eighty girls huge good run dmc Jane have personality in baseball please I'm not worried about the personality I'm worried about that you're gonna you're gonna rip off you out of that well okay and that's\nWhat I'm worried about is you're going to slide the to the second and you're like choke yourself these\nChains have gotten ridiculous um they buy as has at least seven up it was our CEO by\nThe way okay or Syria I hit the homerun birth weight one nothing bottom of the\nSouth you interrupted my point I'm Sorry go so I use it because my oil with Madison Bumgarner is he's Tom Brady\nWhere\nJust maybe skill level Peyton Manning still better like as far as I Know what you mean like back then like people were like what it turned out that was about to go to the greatest of all time like Tom is if you go back I'm saying is seven years exactly that's the way it felt\nCan you come in and close the game or give me an ending check I got you\nWhat'd you make that face 'cause I have a question about what Notre Dame just that I'm listening to you oh they absolutely and listening to you know you're not but it's cool one hundred percent I'm listening to you know I definitely can be a hundred and got to be at least eighty five percent while I'm never a hundred percent listening to anybody but yeah like eighty five percent listening to you I heard you I heard you but\nSomething just helping them to Notre Dame game\nThat deserves conversation which I probably brings to to say you're into that conversation so let's go ahead Steve that they ask did you like mine now jeeze metaphors and all that stuff that I was just given\nDidn't went around and you're right about that I can send them a largely markedly ... I mean there's a ... when I mean I don't yeah less\nFrom the ceiling of the floor of all the guys that were posters on our wall didn't win a ring\nYeah uh you know grant hill in winter when a ring or you know painting hard away the time you know all these guys you know it but my point was he wasn't like oh he's he's a nobody this or that and so we've gotten to the point where we've pushed the guys like Kevin Durant who are great who are hall of famers were having so much success he won a whole bunch with under went to the finest with a gun\nBut he even felt I needed validation to give me the second is playing the league like a decade but he admitted I needed a validation of winning a ring and I'm like man where we come to wear a horse guys leaving leaving early on and then\nWhen Paul George doesn't want to leave we all knew he was lose readers whatever he wants to saying okay so you know maybe he wants to play that he likes it there maybe they treated them well they banked on\nHe they banked on how they say we're going to take a ready to ready for you even though we know you can come in for free agent this summer\nIt maybe once I may not that was real nobody's ever like you

[noise]\nI call it makes sense why right if people don't know the history there because he talked his way out of refused to become a charger However I'm now challenging charger fan\nCan you revisit that experience and ask yourself if you still hate he lied to things happened hey you ended up with Philip Rivers was better quarterback be\nDo you not agree with him that the chargers organization is run by ...\nI'm trying to see where there were a lot was stolen [laughter] okay so anyway but be that as it may ah we had the whole like going into\nThursday night\nHe lie manning hall of fame thing people get very upset and one of the points I brought up is I don't really understand even the idea of rooting against somebody getting in the hall of fame now you've got your favorite players and you want them to get in cool\nIf somebody else not your guy who cares like I like the ... there's a museum in Ohio you don't have to go\nBut that's not where the conversation went the conversation simply went to whether or not ... going to get in and too many people kept responding to me by going you're wrong he shouldn't be a hall of famer I'm like I'm not having the conversation as to whether he should or shouldn't I'm simply telling you he will\nSo right now you're all remembering Thursday Night Football six years from now you will\nTwo thousand Eighteen you're not going to remember you're not going to remember a game against the eagles what's going to be remembered\nIs he lie manning is basically patriots kryptonite\nFor the rest of his life is he yes for is that fair some for defensive line they had a Tom Brady look for ... or okay\nIt's a fair conversation that is way too can textual for sports radio in the hall of head\nIt just is a you know that the quarterback gets way too much credit gets way too much blame the quarterback is the credit he won the super bowl and BP twice against the New England patriots and the greatest dynasty that the sport has ever known ... you know outside of Lombardi ... what is that you want to say\nI Want to say a lot actually he's going but I'm not here to tell you why I'm simply telling you what is okay\nLet me let me going to go so let me try to find a way as to why he want\nYour ... probably Ninety percent correct that he will because I think that's a little bit I get it number one he's Manny right in him and his father was\nBetter than his record because he was on bad New Orleans saints team so he gets some slack 'cause he was an amazing cops what players pretty good in the league but he had a horrible line horrible team with the same\nPeyton top five quarterback probably about the auto body is going to write so he lie while\nPainting is dominating and he's becoming the man and then but he had some issues in the playoffs where are all of a sudden we see his brother doing what he but he couldn't having some playoffs success specifically going up in those years that he won the Superbowl\nHere's the thing as Steve mentioned earlier he's like own for in any other player ... let me add onto it Steve didn't get to he's ones well in one way is a career that's almost five hundred ... let me also add\nThat's a lot of interceptions he led the league and interceptions multiple years\nYeah how about ... years I remember ... speech being really good I Believe you spend more than anybody\nHas he had much more playoff success um well if you're a Super Bowl wins one [laughter] no I didn't you make a point are you into that we all know too much are you hearing I'm\nCool with that we don't have we just go by the better player there's no comparison Brett Farr was a better player\nI'm young ... losing season as a Packer I'm not being funny I don't did he left other other than maybe like the last year or two but I Know are they losing any that the nerve to get the Vikings to the NFC championship in almost when yep\nYep don't Brett Farr don't look we we we were starting to rain on Brett Farr a little bit too much here Brett Farr whether they'd be Pete three times if I'm not mistaken he ally manning was how many times\nYou know particular order I Would lie to pull that Brett Farr I've got like ... I Would like to read to you the top ten all time passing yard edge quarterbacks no particular water or you know that Drew Brees is number one that was a recent story and therefore you know the number two words Peyton Manning\nThere's the rest of the top ten in no particular order Warren Moon\nPhilip Rivers John Elway Ben Roethlisberger Tom Brady Dan Marino [noise] and\nEli Manning tell me again I I get in the hall of fame\nBecause Eli Manning as that way too many seasons where he was bad he was either okay too bad\nI don't disagree with you and let me add on to the ongoing to go to the I'm not looking for someone to tell me know look\nTen percent that maybe someone will look and say so All right let me give an example Brett Farr through a whole lot intercepted as you mentioned 'cause he played a whole lot of years he threw three hundred and thirty six well he threw five hundred and eight touchdown help help I get it\nRemember he like man and came into the league with Ben Roethlisberger and Philip Rivers see the same exact draw the same year I'm all those three who's got the most yards passing\nPlease be Ben Roethlisberger\nHe lie manning six rothfus burger is seven Philip Rivers is\nAids marathon projects the way things look right now pretty sure those other two are going to pass them so they play lawyers well oh well when he falls to the protest really an eighth all time but he's going to the hall of fame\nNow we also have to be you and talking about contacts Matthew Stafford is going to have the most passing yards of all time\nWell listen carry Collins who seventeenth so I get it like the the job you're Matt Ryan is Fifteen or you know Carson Palmer is twelve obviously we shouldn't run this through ... that's why I was a ... of quarterback gave me they don't\nNecessarily just give me ours but I'm looking at Brett Farr I'm looking at nine and seven wants to act look his very first year in Green Bay eighty five Ninety\nSeven ... living in five thirty three thirty three Seventy five eight and eight nine and seven twelve before twelve and fourteen and sixteen and fix my point is thirty or thirty three nine seven it's well before we had one foreign twelve year book it all those years of being either good to great give me he lies record\nOne eighty six to one twelve is Brett Farr as we're winning record\nThat's what I Want to know ...\nJust barely five hundred and one twelve on a weight yes he's thrown a lot of yard but who hasn't thrown a lot of your eyes when I'm dead say they say\nThere isn't really going to answer Graham profiles for eight hours [laughter] that's all they're going to be out that's not what we're all doing exactly yeah but they're just about maybe just maybe like if you're a security guard\nFor like um who's allowed\nGeiger counter McGregor security guy might be able to swim yeah you bet you bet you busy\n[laughter] okay ah found a way still wanting to oh this is he's living in a bad again I didn't go baseball baseball Supreme please your friend ended up with your neighbor and a big moment and I am brewers I bought hubris [noise] uh I Know you've been waiting\nShopping at the bit or to uh to get all of this he like many frustration offer you just had\nOh yeah I Can't believe you know there's got to go jacket a goal jacket Bucky\nIs going to happen it's not about the station I found this is so fascinating to me because with multiple people this week I Try to have a conversation that apparently I'm simply not allowed to have the conversation is not don't you think he should be a hall of famer the conversations do think he will be\nHe is going to get in\nIt doesn't matter if I or you or you or anybody else\nThinks he should get in getting in I just don't know how the guys getting it I really don't\nI Know is the top ten all time in all of the matter and he has two Super Bowl wins over Tom Brady I think that's why he had the million interception among us okay I'll read far out of completion oh he's not come on that and I'm trying to say that far but if you're going to point to that then I that's the only thing I can say I would\nPoint to his record Bucky that's what I point out is one of these one twelve and want to wait\nAs a starting corner okay oh it it it'd be flip out in the brain that's a great point he's looking he ... he\nMight want to ask is this a bench him to say on David record a five hundred I think\nIt's only been to the six times they'll\nMaybe can't end his own for\nMark [laughter] lucky they get your name\n[laughter] when you go ahead you know where\nYou're at la [laughter]\nAs far as what was your name was he went\nOh what's that job was\nOh we went and got away with one million dollars in swing on\nIt that is that right now I didn't break is rich way back then 'cause that's just the way you know break is read says oh not a\nBad night All right um ... no yeah you you got it when you ask the bud lane answer by the way I did yes he is and I laugh\nHarder to come on you can't be no wait you're telling me you do not believe that you'll hit in maybe senior committee or Letterman and Thirty years so you know he's in ... when he broke the battle over the me\nThe only one out there is only one I went out on the only one I Would I think he wanted to be the one I wanted to\nBe the guy at this moment and the Dodgers like please don't have those moments week because that's the reason why it's hard to get rid of him but just every time he are out of a month or two we like man maybe on a little bit ... as a bit\nYou know yourself week is kind of like you lie manning in that way oh oh\nWell no in that dynamic he is I mean if you don't know the story if we go over the six years with the Dodgers\nEvery time the organization and its bans decide you know what that's not our guy we're not doing this boom something happens to be a lot of great month and a half ago my last we gotta keep this guy is not like we're keeping this guy then he goes through to strike it out um\nMake or he'll he'll have a throw from right field that one of like two guys can do\nAll nice pets oh his arm is his arm is unbelievable um but anyway I mean that's what\nThat people can't see I get it I get why everybody doesn't want to wrap their heads around it I'm with you on my head is my head is wrapped around it six hours from now get self ready go jackets speed super boring dog and a half\nCentury or what is this whole if a moment that he might have been falling ready to record it off his helmet\nWait a minute yeah I usually ended and asked them anyhow that was that was that was a better guy\nThat had better analysts and ... and the easy past ... doesn't marry the the team that was Seventeen I Know\nI mean we can put turned over and he won the Superbowl\nBy the way when he threw that passed David diary or did he almost get sacked before he threw it I mean did he did he not did\nYeah I was ... he met ... Boston so that that's why I say oh they're better off than we\nCan I say you say what's this all day moment and then he didn't go oh that's the that's the only one like first of all it's one of the most epic things ever happen in the NFL second of all\nHow many other guys could I go find who are in the hall of fame that don't have a moment anywhere near as cool as that\nBut at the hall of fame is supposed to be reserved for the exceptionally his robbers burger going\nAnd what's his moment\nI'm if oh yeah ... we had arguments on this really if he's in him being\nWhich was why would then be in the first Super Bowl they one was not because of him true I met that the second one he wasn't the super bowl and VP okay so now you're going to go to the Superbowl asked us to say I Tony ... you're ready I did\nYou're ready for a quarterback who also has two Super Bowls and neither Superbowl had anything to do directly with him Peyton Manning thank you\nI knew and said oh the differences what's the difference he\nHe's out at any point you would like to think that the guy that you're bringing into the hall of fame that at some point you felt like they were the best in their position\nI Would agree man I mean it's possible that why why it is and it's funny because all of them are\nThe best dude he's the best student again\nWhen there's never been a moment where he's been one of the two or three quarterbacks that you're like in the VIP circle you know what I mean things\nIn the real quick to Martin I hear it's going back to Bucky disrespected been robbed his brother is respected you didn't last of you and I\nTold her I just don't know who you're with look you just gotta wait you just gotta wait for a little bit of the people who's with\nUs is that part because of all\nThe mark Austin was trying to disrespect him using you know look at I look all these things that he liked done that just like a big men no big fans record is one thirty seven and sixty five right one the\nOne that what you do you see the difference heat waves games yeah and I do are you seeing my time when I hear everything you know what I'm saying so just saying he's still getting it has such\nDown to three hundred and forty touched down to a hundred and eighty\nOr we looked at ... or ... it was like three thirty touchdowns to like\nIt was like two hundred and Ninety and her doctors something like\nThat is one behind battle over on the list so from that class happens instead of sex from the two thousand and four class\nYou a big\nMen Philip Rivers authors who can't get it\nEvery quarter back from Nicholas ... oh yeah they do so so Philips up Philips out who wants to you on it and wants to participate in his you know what will be about up probably what eight year long bat\nAn eight year long but it's about an eight to not only do they feel it's getting there are all getting then you today on all the way getting in I don't want to last\nA little different I Would if these were the NBA we were talking about point guard Chris Paul rest of what I Would be with you in it felt to me rightfully so there are a little more like a everybody will be the greats of the greats\nRight I mean yeah you're right you're forgetting marketing your ... your reverence Philip Rivers is nowhere close to being done has ... ...\nEvery quarter backs that you're gonna keep him out\nHe's going to have to have a moment though yeah he got to make it to your upper bowl you're going to have the yeah I'm not even saying yes to when it gets to a Super Bowl with all the numbers in another talent that we know that he has like him him his own time and not talented player so what was then south moment revolutionary\nHe and the game ... office mate is made us want to watch football\nOr may limit you just call the office and it's named after someone else\nInto so how did it or you know how how does the in fact you credit for that and then he was he was the joystick\nAnd that he made it up and that's worthy of what's ... what's his moment it's got to be a Super Bowl has got to be this what's their thoughts as women\nThat followed you gave me the moment ...\n... that's not a moment [noise] uh no that's the thing the thing that is what you said he needs a moment transformative you ain't got a game has changed the game I mean the grape\nYes like Barry ... okay I'm not comparing the ...

Florida State Syracuse and us see\nNow there are some teams on there there is some teams on there but if Notre Dame a truly\nIs what they appear to be a team that can certainly ballot a high level against other top level talent Michigan Stanford Virginia Tech they've already beaten all of them I had been all of them pretty ... pretty handily\nUh there's no reason that they shouldn't when all those games\nYou know they can be in the mix and I think the big thing to look at when you look at Notre Dame is how they rebuild the program after that championship or parents championship game of parents against Alabama\nAfter they guy kinda like hammered against Alabama or they brag Kelly went back to the drawing board\nPlay on TV they're bigger everywhere big offensive line big running backs bit wide receivers big defensive backs they looked like a heavyweight team and in fact all of the teams that we were talking about being in the mix with the playoffs\nThey all do the same Alabama's big and imposing Ohio State as big as a big and imposing Clemson big monstrous imposing a no Oklahoma last last week but they are big um so they have all the teams that can get into the playoffs in seriously compete\nBut for you to be one of those teams you have to be built the right way and it's full of heavyweights\nPurdue Nebraska Michigan State Maryland and Michigan that's what's left for Ohio State\nYeah there's\nGoing to go and put them in there now losing those games I Hope that the fight and horrible as can beat him\nUp but I just don't see him losing those games I Wonder I'm starting to hear from people I don't necessarily look at it this way but and you know that the college football playoff is not my cup of tea I really really oh you don't like that [laughter] oh man it's not that I don't like the games it's that I don't like the way they are put in\nNews talk in sports for the White Mountains talk one oh six forty seven\n\n\n\n\nYou're saying [noise]\n... walk in with all of them that are they all your bucking bronco [laughter]\nYour second half coverage is going data\nFrom the play those ultimately got I'm Angela coverage dental have used [laughter]\nFox what ball Saturday oh my God my from the get go walk sports radio studios here's Marc ... and ... year NFL veteran Bucky brook there I assume\nThe kicker in the packed well and there's unrest in Milwaukee final our Margaret Bucky Bronx company alive guy go find source radio studios Fifteen minutes conservative deeper than a moron car insurance guy go dot com for a free rape squad Washington and Oregon died at twenty four\nThree takes on the clock Washington lining up for thirty seven yard field goal attempt\nAnd they will ice the kicker time I'll call by Oregon so we'll take a few moments before they go out there and attempt this kick does that work\nI Am I saying the kicker sometimes sometimes make you think about a little bit sometimes it allows him to take a practice shot you do you have called him out of the moment you don't want them to get the the practice I don't\nKnow I find that well that's a good point but I mean sometimes they like to call a timeout right before the snap 'em and really mess with guys I figure I mean I'm a I I Love to play golf and if you get the shot every single time I tell you what that ... ...\nS C I stuck they did and they let him get it all got his practice shot went right through the up rights you know it doesn't count but now he's in his now now it's random they feels good\nNo you don't want you want to call it before he can have the run through\nYeah that that didn't that didn't work out too much by the way you're authentic\nWhy because like it it it is so easy to sit from afar and looking gains interesting I don't understand why they just caught at play but there's so many moving parts um when you call them please you have to think a player to ahead of time so if his first intent\nYou send the play in in your mind you're already started thinking well if the second law and order on this if a second shorter want to do this or would this be the great time to take a shot\nPlay happens bolus spotted you need to have the next year\nAnd so when we look at these guys with those big old play sheets and um it looks like the cheesecake factory menu ...\n... oh the ice you know the kicker weren't invested their work ... said he said he pulled\nThe ads or going over time going over time here in Oregon twenty four twenty four between U. dub and the ducks\nHow about that how about that I don't think it was because they I mean I think he just miss hobby you could say that but I Would say that they look they asked him he made when it was during the iPhone on is that mean like he missed it okay\nIf I get a practice shot by definition I Am less ice then I Would be if I had not swung my leg for the last half hour\nMaybe this like playing golf flavor to waltz carry so you're the first one straight does it mean to the next one is going to go straight\nNo it doesn't mean that but it also doesn't mean that that you asked me if it doesn't go straight it just means is golf and it's really hard which obviously kicking years as well based on what we're seeing happening around football right now\nNo so we go say to the ice ice work aren't on the news the next thing you want your Oregon handled by but okay you can guarantee their guys together you\nKnow I the reason I asked is fascinating that you're calling plays the high school level because people were going the other night in New York and uh I I think a lot of that is they want\nOr or even saw their head coach at one point patch armor\nOr you read his labs throw the ball like he was holding it too long but by the same token I Wonder what you saw therefore through your eyes not only as a play color but realizing that he like many is not a mobile quarterback and had zero time so what were the giants supposed to do\nIs hard because I feel for past Germany because what he's having to do is he's having a coach around the quarterback and that is something that is hard to do because when you're when you call them plays when you build it enough and she just didn't really think about players not place where the players that want to get the ball to rather than the plays that are like and\nThe ... as you want to get the ball to stay quiet Barclay man that's kind of you can always handed to him oh their Beck and junior that's a little more challenging because now we got to throw it to them where water is best routes\nVersus what is my quarterback but does he still able to throw it so O'Neill everyone secular task about the interview and ESPN but he talked about push to boil down to feel getting over the top you would like to stretch to feel a little bit\nThose are the big place his quarterback can't make those big place so he's limited he's limited in terms of his impact on the game what he can do because defensive backs no oh man your quarterback and thought of all the opposite right here hang on it so everything now is harder for him because his quarterback is in it\nWondering about solutions here because yeah there one in five\nAnd so the easy thought is you know to New York giants ought to do\nIs just get one of those topics again I heard the giants and Justin ... name only eight years old many sentences over the last forty eight hours a but you're not going to tank if you're in New York Giants and remind everybody there are two games on the first place Bucky I Know the one in five but there are two games out of first place nobody's got a winning record in the ...\nYou didn't tell me what do you think it would take to get him and whether or not it would be smart to try to do it I Will be a first name ... Taylor\nNo he didn't play well in Cleveland I the terrorists who showed up with a browser is not an upgrade over what you mean they both are bad\nSee I I think it is an upgrade just by virtue of the fact that he can move if you go to the line that\nWay if he's going to be oh scared to Iraq to play with the brown okay he doesn't help anybody you always have all and he wasn't using his legs to create place so if that regime is going to play he has to play like the directives that we've seen play at his best at times in Buffalo\nOkay so you don't like to ride Taylor how 'bout Derek car am I calling the raiders to see if they would like to get out from underneath that contract\nWill you can call them because they would love to get out from under their country and really don't have to be\nOh man he he\nIs not being good no he's not this this is it like I mean maybe they could get them at a bargain basement deal but\nFor the raiders I think this is it I mean I hate to say\nOlder parents with the little kids that went and bought it was the number for Jersey [laughter] this might be it for him that there might be it yeah jak ruined may move onto the next one um\nHe does do you realize\nHow much worse that makes the ... trade oh it's I mean there's offered all around it was so bad it's been so embarrassing\nGrew in ever since he did the trade continues to come to press conferences and say man we just can't find a path Rauscher and people are like just I mean they want to yank their ears off of their head and throw them at the TV screen [noise] okay so it's been that bad you realize how much worse it would be if they did that because\nIf you understand\nThe genesis of why the raiders including back even ended up in that conversation\nA north of twenty four million dollars to their quarterback and has also decided to pay you know north of twenty two million dollars a year to another player it's very rare in the NFL that you get both\nAnd while the raiders could have done it they opted not to so in other words they shows they chose Derek car over Leo Matt right three weeks later they're ready they're like\nYeah [laughter] no no oh my I mean so you're you're not going worse it couldn't have gotten worse than it is it brings me back to his vision that I keep having\nOver Twitter about quarterbacks in over valuing the quarterback we're very very comfortable overpay for average performers their quarterback\nCase came as a sixteen Seventeen Eighteen million of equipment and escape into a bitter play it and live in you know ... in a simple to me so well we pay case getting more money than living bill\n\nA Fox Sports radio the best in news and going\nThis war days a week or so the intelligence you know they weren't really see is why are you in war you know somebody\nWanting for seven three six\nWheels extra voices makes you feel like when you're still tell your friends\nYou listen to the right here clocks radio these rocks or something about that was born with an addict to\nDie in car normally here I Know on one of those things [noise]\nTo apply that last one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com or details asked\n[laughter] just flew out to the war to extract the NBA's [noise]\n... [noise] of course was with the Dodgers not that long ago [noise]\nMan [noise] that things have gotten out at a bit about the biggest nightmare the Dodgers fans ever could have experience but\nSwing squeezes it we go to that night\nThe Dodgers lead the brewers for two three\nUm okay great news quick way to save some money switch the guy go go to guy go dark comedy Fifteen minutes you say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance are Bucky\nSo if I'm just taking 'cause I'm always I I Wonder there's sometimes in the fantasy draft mhm bass player available say good play well hang on a second hold on because every NFL team does that too right\nThere are all in every interview oh we're we're gonna we're gonna take the best player available All right so then next year when the giants pick one two or three ... what is the best player available is running back you're going to take him when you just grab sake one Barclay\nYeah but you're dealing with that just that that's not what is going to be out there but let's just say it it\nCould be let's just say we don't know whenever they passed we have no idea of the top guy on the board is one of his running back is not boat I mean it's not because they're not there's not a generation of talent like I said well it worked out there but I'm throwing out a very okay let's let's say that in an area\nReal scenario yeah running back is there say the running back is sake one Barclay junior junior then you have a quarterback that is ... how close are those grades are they similar talents it is similar to ours you take the quarterback what if you're not if there's ... who's the next ... who's the next best player with running\nSo you're not just taking the best player available you're taking the best available but factoring in position to lead\nIt factors in but it only factors\nOn the greatest kill one guy seven point oh and the other guy six point\nOn the sixth one day I don't know if I buy this what okay let's say the grades are not similar what if the giants come to the podium and there is a generational running back available and there's no one else degrades all that close they're not taking them\nThey're not taking him they've got sick one Barclay Mm right\n\nI Will tell you know this is what I Would say okay what do you tell me if there is a guy that was the trends in the town ... back in the draft carried the tigers the best player in the ...\nLike if he's up there and everybody else is well below that you're calling somebody to trade you call it that you're trying to find someone to tree right or whatever but in theory you always want to take the best player you don't want to see 'cause heres what happens when we reach up and we do those things Blake mortals happen\nK misses your risky happen\nYou want to make sure that when you selecting in in the best way to do the criteria were you thinking in the top five the guy that you take in the top five she'll be someone who is a perennial pro bowler for someone that we eventually talk about being a goal Jackie guy\nThat's how they're staying there should be for tough or pick if you're taking someone up there and you know they're not that you're doing it wrong because what happens is they always play to what you saw ... so what do you see someone who potentially doesn't have that they're always going to be what it is\nWell here's something I'm playing devil's advocate for a while here I actually don't disagree with you fundamentally and here's something I've been wondering\nFootball so far this year one thing I Wonder watching football this year is are we getting closer to removing the ...\nThe quarterback is suddenly any less important but I did a good quarterback\nStart to grow on trees Iran this step by Kelvin earlier before you got him okay where do you think and I wonder if you know where do you think this year Tom Brady ranks in terms of passing yards\nA I mean he's he's down like a new he does that adoption Israel said it's up to him or\nHis outside of the top Fifteen yeah he's outside the top Eighteen he is nineteenth and the league in passing so therefore because of the rules and because of the way things are being slanted toward the quarterback\nEverything is all of them are good all of them get up\nThere exceptions Eli Manning is not\nAn end Derek car has not been but I can give you twenty guys Ryan such Patrick came out this year and looks like a hall of famer I could give you twenty guys that look like really good quarterback so doesn't that denigrate the quarterback position\nIt does I Want to pull the men are hoping I can pull up just a\nPacket or whatever we have research they they give us his research stuff and then also at work research yeah but I I thought I Will suffer right here I saw this I saw this thing that\nDoes it kind of news come unrelated I mean it is like duct tape closer to lock and key like how do you get this thing delivered to you uh\nI mean it comes it comes it comes every week comes in email okay comes over but I saw something that they were like twelve quarterbacks with a passive rating\nOver a hundred oh I hear I pulled out up right here I got that they are there are a lot of them\nAllowed eleven quarterbacks have a rating of over a hundred ... which means they used to be sacred ground ... I mean there there how many and I I I realize we're talking about a small sample of five games but I mean how many quarterbacks have retired\nTo yeah like Aladdin quarterbacks right so think about that efficiency higher rating over a hundred and some of them are not ... one of them is Ryan Fitzpatrick another one is Mitch trivia ski\nAnother one is Jared golf who's actually number two in the league who a year and a half ago people were asking if you get thrown out route\nI mean it's some it's unbelievable when you look at it um\nWell right Tom Brady is not one of them you know so a lot of any quarterback separating about a hundred tolerate he's not one of them\nSo thing as lead watch ren first\nFive weeks of the Eighteenth season most touchdowns in the first five weeks of a season in NFL history most points and the first five weeks of a season in NFL history\nThat's what we're talking about we're talking about\nPoints are coming off I mean that people are lighting up the school board\nLike we're playing pinball and so the old metrics where we used to measure quarterbacks and all the other stuff where the throat though those skills out because everybody's going to be a pass with a high pass a rating um\n... what does a look at a dairy car\nWas taking dairy car to test um when I was writing about him potentially being on the way out the door and Oakland uh-huh his passive ratings still above a Ninety in the old days\nA couple of years ago we were say oh that's a pretty good rating that's not bad uh-huh\nIt's changed now and so as you talk about the quarterbacks\nThe value it has to chew evaluated will be able to look beyond this that she looked beyond the completion percentage which use everything I'm open to last week league wide average in terms of completion percentage sixty five percent sixty five\nChanges the way that we have to look at these quarterbacks it used to be a big deal for a quarterback by over sixty is not just the look\nI've got Aaron Rodgers I'm two two and one I've got Ben Roethlisberger I'm two two and one ... I've got ... oh wait a minute ... I'm In first place\nBecause they got 'em on a nice deal I got I got about ... you know what I could I Do I got ... I could go get some people sign him like I don't get without him so we're we're entering I think a phase of two things a\nThere are going to be more quarterbacks to choose from in the we can win with that guy bucket number one and number two teams that have a solid quarterback on a rookie deal\nYou wrote an article this week on NFL dot com about the best wide receiver do oh in the NFL voter huh\nI Will tell you it is coming up next [noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\nThat rain catch every bumble hammering touched down\nWhen it comes to see the LA football coverage on your radio\nMoney ... face is Fox Sports radio\nAt discover we believe anniversary should be a time of celebration not obligation\nThat's why we think annual fees are ridiculous and now just for giving us a try we're going to give new card members a one year anniversary gift they'll never forget\nAt the end of your first year will match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar no caps and they'll catch is because we know if you try us you'll like us and that's worth every penny try it and believe it at discovered dot com slash match cash back match offer only for a new card members limitations apply\nHere\nYou get to see any clue feels so much less cooped up right I guess like phantom pain find well\nFlorida means of double line otherwise it's chaos that you'll find it's\nHard to be without your bike to do something easy and protected with progressive motorcycle insurance wouldn't bc policies low Seventy five dollars a year you'll be back on the road enough time there's a progressive economical today Gratz because of the insurance company in a village and you bring information widely policy\nA race to benefit timber Mesa fire and medical auxiliary at station Fifteen sixty north sixth street in shallow competitive he and his ... am\nThe cost is thirty five dollars for adults and twenty five for children ages six to twelve\nOur streets register online\nAt C.
