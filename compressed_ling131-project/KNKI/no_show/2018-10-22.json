that and I would come on we I I Can't name ... I Know I go ahead yeah um or you know whatever the case there was always something there was always something we had a player who\nI [laughter] I think it's the off season he was going to the airport just grabbed a bag at his house through a bunch of stuff and it didn't realize he had a loaded gun and [laughter] we got here say they put that is bad\nFor security and they're like ... um you ever think about what you want to tell us you know I'm waiting for my flight I got to get going\nAnd then you have a a a gun in fact it's a loaded gun in your bags are oh oh snap I forgot to take that out\nSo that got him in a little bit of trouble but it was always something a which is which made it fun in some respects like looking back on it I think it's great for a radio career or Freddie broadcasting career 'cause you've got all these stores the issue is I'm too young like you know most guys you tell great stories of the players they played with\nThose players are guys are retired or dead so they could sell whatever story they want and no one's going to a counterweight or no one's going to be upset by some of those stories\nUm I I just that the most shocking thing about this I ... I cannot picture and\nThat's why I'm so taken back by I'm almost lost for words I just can't picture Charlie fry getting busted with a handgun that is the most of the craziest part about that story the fact that Charlie fry would show up with a handgun in his bag and you I mean that's amazing and were you surprised when that happened when it was\nI Love when you ... what are they just think I I was only with Charlie fry for an off season and a game that was it\nIn his bag and a judge or a vision and wants to go ... okay [laughter] I'm All right we're often\nRun an era of traditions back to football though because there was a lady came on I don't know if you were watching 'em this team has gotten a little bit of a criticism or there was someone involved in this game doesn't get any criticism yeah you might have been the guy calling the game\nYeah so the Dallas Cowboys are looking to to win back to ... huge division game against the Washington Redskins the Dallas Cowboys were set up to tie the game\nThey were going to attempt to forty seven yard field goal to tie it enforced overtime in D. C. and then there was a the long snapper got busted for moving the football's got map infraction how many how many those get called\n... I mean it's you can if you're going to call whatever he did do it every ... every single time and it was such a a cookie cutter touchy call and I got to be honest that five yard difference because of the way that ball kinda hooked at the end I think he makes it if it's a forty seven you order versus the fifty two\nI think he makes it I think that things snakes inside the upright instead of hitting a square and bouncing\nBack well let's find out how it played out this call courtesy of the cowboys radio network no way he's going to lose bars certainly\nTime for a second line\n[noise]\n[laughter] I Know that that and he's gone out out there trying to beat the crowd you start to get\nHas got a flight has gotta catch 'em so the cowboys loss but one former cowboy he didn't lose you know he was up there doing his thing slinging it from the booth well known for his first guessing it's what they call and the business\n\nNews talk in sports for the White Mountains I talk one oh six point seven\n\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nGood to have global that [noise] middle while they're still in Korea ... drop it gets hot so that I was playing ... used to I like it around and around the block it's turned into\nAiring before our very here I Am I ... I like both Aaron ... is kind of like a ... even ... and stuff on it [laughter] hey we're Family Matters is that the lesson I don't know is that an aim of the show yeah I've got a it's kind of bubble in a nutshell I I think even steroid when you have another step on or by the way\nAre for those you're just tuning in Volvo is our technical produce or um but there are times where he doesn't go by boat above his nickname he turns into Aaron his real name I'm an errand is real safe\nAnd down and Aaron is really really nice and then ... uh shows up at the gym and it's believed they believed that believe you believe your mom ... I mean it is shocking to see the ... just the change\nFrom one man to the next uh but just based on the first song that we got as a bumper song it's safe to say that Aaron is left the building Lobos here for the ... how long do we do that's what I don't know [laughter] how long have we known each other a little too long\nOkay so what have you ever in the entire time that we've known each other see me be safe\nI just got the worst mouse of any like seriously life yeah\nI I'm I'm a I'm a break it down like this Eric what was I Can't you can't use my introduction that I I I was when I was an intern and about three years ago walking in here I'm sitting here first shift above all walks in and says I'm ignorant and then walk in HR complaint\nJust something Brady and I have to ... you know gotten together we've noticed this little thing and if we can wind up a little bit and get you know and that's all we do know you know you work a lot of wind you up buddy that's why we were you know if the batteries there and we'll just\nLet the on switch and let you go man you know what I mean yeah I Do yeah definitely [laughter] uh we're\nBrought to you by discover ladies and gentlemen become a new card number and discover card will match all the cash back you burn dollar for dollar at the end of your first year there are more discovered dot com slash match limitations apply\nSo Brady you achieve this before we went to a break and you talked about an idea you had that could have possibly change the end of the cowboys Redskins game you tell us or\nYeah so [laughter] let me just say this I'll preface anything I say next by it's not as if this would have put you know changed the outcome um but it could have because maybe would have given Dallas more time okay so here's what I Am proposing\nSo the two things are funny when you get down to the end of the game right is time and distance\nSo you can obviously at the end of a game you can throw a Hail Mary further than you can a long field goal you know make a ball field goal let's say\nDepending on what team apparently for Dallas it's less than fifty two but you can easily throw the football you know sixty or sixty five yards at a Hail Mary right\nSo the minute and this was around like the two minute mark where Dallas got pretty close uh that's scrambled or for first down he got somewhere around the ballpark of eight twenty to twenty five yard field goal I Would have thought about on first out taking a field goal right then\nAnd the reason being is this your down by ten to to score game so again the two things you're fighting time and distance I Would have saved myself as much time as possible so once I get in that scenario where I feel like I can now get one of those scores quickly and then I think\nDoes their job like the cowboys defense did\nAnd yes you're still you're still have to accomplish the goal of getting a touchdown but again you can throw that from wherever you need to and probably have a higher percentage shot of that happening as opposed to hitting a field goal from\nYou know whatever distance that it has to be so I ... it's not like I'm coming up with that idea it was something that I've got a credit ... anyway\nHe use that strategy one time and again we're down your guy argument and and yeah and it but he was right because it did save us more time later on and trying to come back round it was unsuccessful and it doesn't look as good because it makes it look like you're lost by a little bit more but really it's just it was a one possession game\nSo it's something that I I Wonder how many coaches think about and I'm sure people out there especially if the cowboys being that they are the cowboys would have lost and they would have been kicking if you're going first down they'd be thinking what the world are they doing and they lost their minds\nBut it actually might be a smarter way to go about hailing those scenarios where time is precious and you want to keep as much to it as you can\nAh here's the problem because there's such a spotlight on the Dallas Cowboys everything is with a magnifying glass so it ... and a lot of it is unreasonable that Prescott you know lost his top two targets in the off season\nIs often some line hasn't been what it's been the past couple of years a year ago he lost the best player on the team for six games um so it's not like he's had a full arsenal to work with\nBut because he's a cowboy quarterback he gets critique to win Romo was playing Romo got crushed constantly um and if you actually go back and look at the numbers he wasn't as bad as everybody made 'em out to be actually thought he was a pretty good quarterback so um if Jason Garrett where the head coach of any other organization\nAfter this many years and had accomplished what he's accomplished in Dallas with any other organization is he still had coach\nProbably not and I and I\nMaybe for the rams probably when they're in St Louis\nOh what do you like to read [laughter] well I just I don't know I I\nThink I think I'm catching your fishing\nThere do you buy it but you have you ever gone shopping at the ball in the NFL had yeah I'm ... now now what\nPoint does Jason Garrett start to approach jet Fisher territory 'cause at least Fisher did go to a Super Bowl and he had he had a couple of deep playoff runs um with Tennessee even after he won the Superbowl but but at what point is is Garrett now in Fisher territory you know it's kind of in between\nYou remember when I got the Bradley\nFinally got fired by the Jacksonville Jaguars\nYeah we almost it wasn't that we were surprised he got fired we were surprised that an NFL team actually stayed loyal for that long because Jacksonville did something that was so unheard of around the league it's almost like Jason Garrett has surpassed ... Bradley and he's now sitting in between ... Bradley and Jeff Fisher for the\nMan if they were anywhere else they'd be fired rankings and I don't and he's going to get critique to get in for the way he handled this the the end of this game and whether you call the penalty Bush league at the end where they move the ball and it was a snapping fraction or not\nThey're losing games because he's decided to go conservative and get your Jerry Jones has always been a gambler he's a loyal guy but he's always been a guy who takes chances and I can't imagine this such well with\nThem probably not and it looked Tony brought up the best point and\nAgain when when they're eleven seconds left or lose eleven or twelve it was actually after they went back and looked at whether or not uh the Kobe easily plastic was a catch\n'em in that instance they instead of running the football which is what they ended up doing that they ran a one more play right there running the football they should have done what he said they should've clock the football game and you're just spike it's you stop the clock there the last second and then you start a timeout\nThe goal or potentially you know you'd be looking at a uh going for a touchdown so that would have been the better way to play it I thought the way they put it was extremely conservative and you know it's interesting because there's so many examples right like you can look at um my ... over in London today they are to go for two\nAnd it didn't end up working out and we've seen him do something similar to that before and I you know I Wish he'd other coaches do something similar to that I just think the law you coach and I was I was listening to Bill Keller talk about this he said look man\nI coach for Fifteen Years I saw a lot of stuff and it gives them more stuff you see the more that you realize more teams make decisions that lose them games than when them games so if you continually make winning decisions or maybe it seems conservative decisions\nThat a lotta times allow your opponent to make a poor decision that allows you to win the game and that was that was basically how he described it and I think that's pretty accurate accurate for a lot of head coach is out there who have had more experience in the NFL and obscene more done more\nA Brady ... Knox here Fox Sports radio comedy live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios coming up next there is a really bad look for one NFL quarterback right it's a bad book and it's very strange and I want to go inside the mind of every quarter back in Brady Quinn\nAnd find out why the hell this keeps happening right so we will get that for your next year on a pest are but for all the latest round the world of sports just you know what I mean this is really easy\nTo do and I'm not trying to tell anybody had to live their life but I Will just suggest that for the next minute and a half to two minutes who knows maybe five minutes\nWhich is building a better bank looked like it starts with building\nCapital one cafe warm inviting places feel nothing like a typical bank\nWhere you can open an account with no fees are minimum in five minutes and you'll always find people ready to help you not sell you welcome to banking reimagining\nFor saying [noise] [noise] ah you talk to this point so being chaotic flying to I'm going to have communication [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost going to ask you certainly get over four years it doesn't mean that totally makes sense band quite frankly I don't think the Ohio State anything if I was Ohio State I was saying you so much as we used to a sexually documentary zero\nSkill you need both ... did not increase Ohio state's value one iota there's not one you're so you're now you're not going to hold on to get a hold on a true or\nIs this is absolutely true to get a bunch of wants to start here since there is zero when football team they've got the same value youth snakes it when it don't matter you think you're going out there and losing every game is good that was his name out all the games\nYou get the rest are what Doug said cast did\nLike searching the junk godly issue\nLet's go ...\nI don't want to be battles with the media but you know I heard somebody today on TV in a blessing and calling the wars between the postseason David\nPrice has been much maligned ridiculed I have been one of the leaders in the clubhouse David prices really professional baseball player in the major leagues since ... he has\nBeen in playoff series with Tampa Bay\nAnd also the Detroit Tigers the Toronto blue jays in the Boston Red Sox he is now one one game as a starting pitcher and twelve playoffs so I don't know who the bows or was it the M.

what the Red Sox have done but when you look at the spurs\nGreg ... always had Tim Duncan Tom Brady and bill ... but the beauty but the red Sox have done is they've had three different managers now go

players were out there they know they do it they were aware of what was going to take place it happened that was the harbor set of Bush league move by Michigan and for Jim horrible to let them do that when he's supposed to act classy [laughter] like I look at that I think that's more of an indictment on Michigan Michigan State\nHey you got to market territory man that's just way it's gotta be Brady ... isn't that an argument for Michelle [laughter] [laughter] well I guess they were playing and they just want to say that\nI'm now let me ask you this real good I I actually through this idea out a last night on my highly rated weekend overnight Joe that nobody loses their this idea of going nowhere but go ahead okay I actually think\nThat it was worse from Michigan\nThat Penn State's got a couple of losses and that Ohio State lost yesterday because now Michigan is going to get everybody's best shot and I actually think the Michigan's in this weird predicament\nThat they get everybody's best shot and they've never won anything normally it's it's that's reserved for teams that have won a title the warriors get everybody's best shot may weather gets everybody's best shot the patriots get everybody's best shot the eagles are getting it this year\nMichigan gets everybody's best shot and they've never won anything like they they've got a losing record in bowl games is that just speak to the power of Jim ... and and now he's turned around the program\n[noise] um yeah I think it speaks to that\nBut they've been bad for a long time before her back out there\nThey're oh yeah they were there were ... or like a five hundred or a little bit better team like a bad relatives who are talking about they weren't Rutgers I mean they were in Michigan and yeah they were like ... they were a

matter what the records are those two teams hate each other and they're going to have\nA a good game regardless they're gonna get each each other's best shot every single time regardless of the ranking regardless of the record that's just how it goes right they give each player at Ohio State a pair of gold pants would you be Michigan and believe me those guys take that stuff seriously\nYeah what yeah it's kinda weird 'cause you're thinking like what's the point of the gold pants deal I I don't know what's behind it I just know that they get that gold pants now now what does it make any

it a ... a ...\nHe didn't he will look he he you know twelve pass at Sam's for the time that he was in in ... was it wasn't it wasn't as if there's that much pressure there was some\n... but she just started taking off and try to run I mean he really got out of even just try to throw the ball down field at all\nAnd they had a couple costly for ... and I think the than you'll Hackett they're off as a coordinator was probably frustrated I ... I'm sure Doug aromas frustrated officer Tom ... has been frustrated where they invested money into this guy even though they were going to have to pay in many ways that picked up the fifth year option\nUm they invested money in this guy for this year and then the two years after but as you and I talked about\nSo the team could cut him and not on anything under the dead cap\nAnd it's a much more tradable contract so essentially what they did was they extended his contract still with basically being a one year deal but the ability to then trade him and get back compensation for them or if they want to if things don't work out after this year that's essentially what they did\nBut he was bad bad I mean it and I don't think\nYou like do you have you ever watched the Jacksonville Jaguars then you've missed out on him hitting his office of climate and the helmet ah him making some Aaron throw\nEnvironmental and by the way he's six five were like yeah we're not we're not talking about Peter ... of game of Thrones playing quarterback who's ... is often supply him and he's six five and hitting his often some limited back in the helmet\nHim um you know everyone throws bad decisions um you know leading his team and rushing because he just thinks that every drop back passes supposed to be a draw um that's that's essentially what it's been it's been frustrating to watch\nBecause you know ... they've got to defend that should be able to win you a Super Bowl but he's so inspiring now those guys are staying\nAnd other fighting post game boy that they're right they were going after each other post game apparently\nOf course because the Audrey Hopkins was woken up on ... like as soon as ... as a player a high level you've really got some issues because he is by far and away their best player on defense that's saying something because Kelvin Smith assisted\nAJ boy is not bad Sean Gibson's good class Campbell ...

incident that Ron do jam now to proceed to get over that really really well\nAnd good good slap at the end of the job or some video does it does appear that he may it's battling on Chris Paul can can I just said this I think it's good for the MBA yeah of course it is [noise] they need to actually\nGet in fights because they kind of seemed like the ... where you know like they're all going to talk and get really close to each other like they're almost were springs three nothing's each other's ear and then finally find that we actually had some guys land upon and yell Rondo looks like he knows how to fight a little bit so you've been more respect or raised on\nWrong Angela and you know what I said this and and I got destroyed for it but I'm the use an athlete can even speak to this Brandon Ingram has always had this knock on him that he's soft and that he doesn't have that dog in him and you may not like the idea that he pops Chris Paul well Chris Paul was engaged in another fight but the fact that he actually did throw a punch\nPlayers are going to remember that around the league and I actually think it changed the narrative on if you don't have to like the punch you'd have to like the tactics but at the same thing with volunteers perfect yeah maybe dirty player he may hit guys when they're not looking or take cheap shots\nBut tell me how many times that hasn't paid dividends when a guy goes over the middle of the ... ... they're not thinking about oh well don't worry I'll take the hit because he's going to get fined sixty Kay\nHe's thinking I don't want to get my head ripped off so I actually think it's it's going to end up benefiting Brandon Ingram and it's going to change the way guys play him moving forward I really do\nWhether or not you think it's a a bad tactical disrespectful or classless it's irrelevant because when it comes down to the war of sport um you know class and sportsmanship is is usually spoken out more for when people lose\nYou know it was let's just be honest when what people when\nThe way people lose I think is when people talk about that more so so that point you know people were going to do in that arena whatever they can do to win even if that means\nPlaying those sort of mental head games where you know it might be a fight or an old circulation or it could be something like that but in college football when you've got Devon Bush who was walking through this this team a tradition that Michigan State does before every game she knows it\nHe knows they're going to be out there doing their walk and he stands as ground and tries to walk right through him to pick a fight\nIf you don't think that that fire Michigan State up of course\nBut if you didn't think that it didn't fire up his team mates all players often stick in this dude is going to be talking trash the whole time he might cheap shot me of course that's in the back of your mind\nYeah no I I think it's going to benefit Brandon ... and I think ... and I was seeing it in a weird way if you if you get in trouble like guys getting in trouble together\nGuys are weird man it's like this built in camaraderie you know like if you ever like getting a fight with a group of ... or you're you're on the field of play and and you stick up for a lineman you guys are sort of linked and that's a story you're going to be sharing for the rest of your lives they met at one time we got in trouble with at one time we did this bill to certain camaraderie\nPeople can knock raised on Rondo for potentially spending on Chris Paul or brand an anger for maybe taking a cheap shot I actually think it's going to bring those guys together because that's going to be a story there'll be talking about and goofing around about in the locker room for a long time so I didn't think it was that bad oh the people don't want a black\nGuy for the NBA can you believe these guys are fighting on what\nWas a great opening weekend in the NBA shut up man it's or it's people are going to fight stop being so over dramatic\nOkay so did you find it odd that LeBron\nGrabbed Chris Paul and not as if that's the thing to watch because that's the one that's not going to play well in the locker room not not\nIngram getting suspended for games or or is on Rhonda spinning\nI Would just think that in it at all or ... or a fight right your natural instinct right if you're at a bar and this actually\nSomewhat actually started to get into it also occasional what are the guys from our crew this past week and and I was thinking the back of my mind um you know if if somebody wants to happen like how would I react in that scenario because you're you're in the spotlight you know there's really no upside is all downside right\nWhen you're you're first inclination or instinct is like that's my guys my boy like he's on my team I've got to protect them and defend him right\nBut that wasn't the case you know it was like LeBron first went to protect Chris Paul and pull him out this way and so I don't know if he thought that was diffused\nThe scenario faster or if if it just it is true colors showed through and he's like yeah dude we go on vacations together you know our our family our friends and I don't want to burn disparate so where were you guys pioneer square\n[noise] um no which some some sports for like down the down the way from\nOur man pioneer square it's on man I'm over there yeah where your partner square guy absolutely by the way yeah so who is trying to fight Joe Davis who was that I wasn't Joe it literally just a guy with one of our crew would some random guy got so I I only got ... again ... have wider huh she our story\nAnd that it was passed along and I was thinking like All right what would have happened if I was there and like there was an altercation you know you got to be really careful nowadays\nNow let's go live now to our violence on the streets of Inglewood insider mobile with the latest venture actually okay\nUm I Want to talk about the fact that no one's talking about the elephant in the fight I should say that when this all jumping in St no [laughter]\n\nI don't find that all of it and I'm thinking MBA player and I try and get sorry [laughter]\nI'm Talking about the fact that when it's all went down\nThe reason it's entire scenario\nYeah I Love I Love Carmelo Anthony afterwards also saying you know that that that stuff that doesn't even happened on the streets and you're right and I didn't know it doesn't happen on his way to go in the street to use weapons okay you know nobody's speeding or throwing jabs they use tire irons and beer bottles\nI I don't know about tires anymore but I had to go higher I always have a new hey yeah but it didn't make sense I'm I'm going to go with a breeding Quinn on this I think it was more or less of it was a Brotherhood\nOh a Joe Montana [noise] no I'm not quite ... yeah\nAnd so so that's kind of who I see\nUm his cop is and that's where I potentially see this going I'm the only difference being that I think he's got a better team than Blake was when he first got the Jacksonville and he's got way more weapons and he's got an offensive vie to coach shoes you don't really there to help him succeed so you know if he doesn't make this work\nHe's got no one to blame but himself because he's been giving the keys to all that\nA mat nagging the coach for the Chicago Bears a step to the podium after the game and you would have thought that they actually won the game here was ...\nThey look close and I just don't go up and I saw him catch the ball and uh I just couldn't tell exactly where he was how he came down with the extra effort was and then you can see on tape or just a little short\nAnd I just got done saying everything that happened to us everything that I just said and we we were a yard away from time to game [noise] to take that and think about that for a little bit\nNow he's talking about the Hail Mary at the end we're Kevin White caught the ball and they got stopped at the one yard line I wasn't able to score doesn't it seem like New England is always on the right end of every single play that that is sort of like that\nThey're better for those who wish it's amazing I mean the bottom line they're better prepared for every situation than every single other team and they had\nThe patriots lost the turnover battle they um they were more penalize them the bears are coming into the game they were one of the day I think last week the patriots I Believe weren't penalize and didn't pump the ball if I'm not mistaken that was that was an actual stats from the patriots a week ago\nAnd they lost both of those battles and they still won the game and the score may be seven points but that was not a seven point game down the stretch my knowing them was a much better football team\nThey couldn't get consistent pressure on Brady and he just called them up down the field and and by the way\nFor all the talk about Brady not having weapons and and wait to see I don't know what the update is on Sony Michel but it looked like a pretty significant injury\nBut you could do a lot worse than Josh Gordon Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski to throw it who didn't quite a bit yeah you could do a lot worse or the ... I think a Gordon's actually played a lot better than I thought this early in his in his time doing\nWhat he's been good they've got other guys to step up and Chris Hogan I think is under rated but um you're right that they've got some talent but at the same time\nYou know Sony Michel really brought kind of a burst of the backfield has got some speed is a good runner they could really miss him 'cause as good as James why that is you know he's really who they like to use and catching the football is the fact that I'm not sure he could take a take on that number one role or the cowbell running back that we saw on Sony Michel like that could\nThat could be an injury that if it's as bad as it looks\nAnd he's out for the season it really could impact them down\nThe stretch or he's ready to go and I'm joined us not just this Fox Sports radio as we come to your life and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios batten down the hatches whatever that means and that get prepared because

Hussein everybody's job is on the line a Blake ... teams around the NFL that are that are in a bad spot\nQuietly even after a win in one of the more bizarre games you'll see a week ago the Miami Dolphins have yet another issue that has come up\nTo where the Miami Dolphins and there are wide receiver democracy Parker who\nHow many games do have been an active for oh I Can't even count how many now as it is almost with a whole season yeah the\n... ... it's it's it's been there's been several games where he is ... to where people aren't really sure what the hell's happening I'm now he's got his agent because Adam gay said that said he was trying to get the head coach he was trying to get some other players some looks um that demanded Parker wasn't a hundred percent healthy and now we've got his agent\nCalling out Adam gays\nStaying that Adam gays as incompetent saying that he is really hurting the reputation of his player this after the dolphins recently had traded Jarvis Landry who had not so nice things to say about Adam days after he left\nA they traded ... can sue or like over ... can sue\nAh they also traded Jay ... a year ago and apparently that was an issue uh and then the Ryan tannahill situation where Ryan tannahill went from a full participant in practice on Wednesday and Thursday to not playing Sunday against the bears does your guy Brock Tobar fast\nGot the opportunity to play a week ago played well and actually played okay on Sunday against the lions but how do you\nLate scratch and then say afterwards at the injury took place the game before\n... it's very bizarre what do you make of what's happening in Miami\nIt's tough to to really make sense of everything that's going on right now I mean this I Know coming into the season\nThey really wanted to try to shape the locker room and have the right type of character guys because I mean if you'll remember this was a ten when team two years ago and how to get his first year and they felt like that kind of covered up\nOr I'm overshadowed some issues that their team had as far as chemistry and\nWhat a diversity struck in that season you know how they would counteract it\nAnd so the next year they're the season was littered with adversity right I mean it started off with a hurricane they had a linebacker player go a wall that a a coach who I think you were quoted as saying he went skiing in Miami office office work desk I Believe that what you're saying yeah I'm a number of this\nYou know I got a new snow for Christmas what do you want I mean it's Florida it's knows there are some times\nSo uh they went through all this adversity and the team didn't play over the ... and they obviously lost Ryan ten and how they bring in Jay color\nOr so the bottom line was you know they felt like they needed to change the dynamic of the type of character people that were there and they need to get rid of some guys who you know some it was more of a character and who they were in their identities\nOthers it was just you know they're getting paid a bunch and they wanted to try to\nUm take out some of the money that they are on the cap\nAnd so they had to make some tough financial decisions but um you know now they feel like they're in a much better place but it's just odd because you know democracy Parker was one of the first round pick they were hoping\nWould be that down field threat fifty fifty ball throw it up he'll go make a play on it and he just hasn't really come along he's almost like recording treadmill after the Minnesota Vikings never really has become the receipts\nAnd him being cleared and him being a hundred percent are two different things and that's what I'm kinda curious 'cause you'd expect is Asian\nTo come out in his defense and make the sort of statement right I mean he's he's getting paid from the player so he's got a direct connection\nIt doesn't make any sense for Adam gays to to bad mouth a player right just think about it if you want to trade him 'cause the ... deadline hasn't yet which you'd be building him up\nSo it doesn't make sense it's not like he's tried to bad now from\nHim saying that he's not maybe a hundred percent healthier where they need him to be that could be accurate I mean that could be a legitimate and\nYou know they're looking at him saying yeah he may be cleared to practice and to warm up into play but we don't feel like he's back to what his hundred percent is in order to help us and in order to be able to come in there and in fact our games\nUm yeah the full a comment from the agent here is following a this is a quote I now I'm going to be the agent and I want you to give your best to Adam gays impression upon hearing this right now I don't know if you've ever met Adam gays um his nickname is ... um he he does appear to be a somebody who\nWill throwing a liver from time to time ... I'm going to go with Kobe where I'm gonna I'm gonna go hoping Hagen um but maybe he ventures into the cardiac world I don't I don't see him as a school pouches guy I think that's a little bit too soft

appearance last hour here on Fox Sports radio and live that Jesus had the bangles plus Nineteen and a half so if the game when final as it is live but Jesus loses again\nYeah which I think we can all expect right I mean I I don't know maybe there's some garbage\nCan house with his friends or that points right we share can now pick six or by Kansas City or just a\nA dynamite throw by Andy Dalton their pick six and a thirty seven to seven extra point pending you're on a Sunday no not not absolutely not at all or LBJ is going to rebound with a bottle of Jack Daniels later is what he's going to do because he cannot win and nothing bad because God Forbid he actually put some faith\nNot even a lot of faith just plus Nineteen and a half worth of faith in Andy Dalton and instead\nHe throws to\nA guy on the chiefs I didn't even know who the hell that Iran Parker I I don't I don't know the only Parker I care about us Rob Parker of Fox Sports radio forget Ron Parker\nFor Ron Ron Parker's the safety or just picked it off his former chief slept for a little bit came back to playing great the season with the air berry being out I'm worried about what are the bright spots in that defense so\nWell good for him a at thirty eight to seven out of Kansas City chiefs are up on the Cincinnati Bengals [laughter] so cool man so\n... it's a again I just go back to maybe lived as you just should take a a vacation what do you think\nKnow all the little look that's the one thing about this show nobody on this show ever takes a show [laughter] [laughter] nobody would dare take a show on here during this broadcast from five date Pacific aid to Lebanese eastern time\nBecause they wouldn't they wouldn't put the other guy and that sort of predicament 'cause they care about the team aspect of it is definitely wouldn't do that\n... that sell you that I'm not working next week I saw the\nOh oh yeah [laughter] well you know\nYou have to carry the show with those limbs or will cry all about yeah uh we are the gum on ... to Jonah Noxon ... now you know what I Want to hopefully error cool partake as well but you know and they want\nIn in ... mansion or he's got this shows logo\nOn the urine OKC ... as a reminder as a reminder of how he feels about this show as he spits in the face or you the listener and ... he care [laughter]\nHe dares to take off a show during football season to leave us life is that's all right\nThat's the kind of treatment we're all going to get if we have to take off during this you know glorious time of the year\nOh at any point side bubble if you need a day off or you have another obligation or ... ... you're going to get a ... oh yeah lashing a flaw get get fuel is I was going to take off come November So I'm kind of scare tactic it oh yeah listen I owe my either body I'm locked up or so I'm On my weekend\nOvernight show that nobody listens to I ... is our producer Iowa Sam he took off a week to go back and see his family in Iowa and and to go spend time with him and he really cares about his family um he had been gone an hour and I told everybody that I suspended him moments before the show\nBecause because I didn't like his attitude and I know and I smell booze [laughter] I told myself I was on his side Santa mom got about a plane he had he had a schedule vacation if I can turn it into a storyline on the show you bet your ass\nSo it's got to be done right that's what everybody thinks that I really do the dark skin you know what why does raise to have to venture into the conversation\n... some reason when lie about it you know became an ally ... comes in\nIt's more than one okay All right Aaron whoa whoa whoa wait there\nLike where did this just keep 'em to lose just like going off the rails regular ... we will or if I'm if I had him in the ... yeah unbelievable\nThis I I Can't believe this but but not as active really turned British Michael's no uh but none of they don't do that come on this is um\nYou know I'd be very hard to go to the next ... yeah it's going to be off the entire shown\nActually said oh no I wouldn't allow you to it too early aren't so great let me ask you about this because going back to Kirk Cousins decision in the off season where the New York jets reportedly had offered him more guaranteed money than the Minnesota Vikings did\nCorrect I think six million more it's like Ninety million for ... yeah and he got eighty four with or was it eighty seven eighty four eighty some eighty four hundred eighty four three years I Believe it's twenty eight per year so he gets the guaranteed\nMoney but he gets less guaranteed money to go to Minnesota for the Minnesota Vikings any passes up the opportunity to go to the jets more money and the idea was there a better football team and you can't knock the guy for it if he's a hundred percent correct better football team no doubt well let me ask you this\nIf Kurt cousins were on the jets is their record any different than what it is now sitting at three and four\nHonestly probably not you could maybe gives him a game maybe they're there for three and a baby cousins and turn the football as much but but the the thing is is I mean look at the Washington Redskins\nRight I mean he was their quarterback last year I thought he was you know one of their best players I Know they made some additions um and obviously the you know you're you're changing the styles quarterback with Alex Smith in her cousins but [noise] um that seems a top of the NFC East right now\nYes it's the Washington Redskins as that was the scene that her cousins ended up I think the U.S\nDo would be to look at Sunday's result and say her cousins member of the Vikings are shows the jets what they didn't get when he decided to sign in Minnesota that would be the easy angle to take on that but\nI actually think even though they lost the game I think in the long run the jets won because\nThey didn't sign Kirk Cousins had they sign ... cousins they would have landed they wouldn't have landed seemed Arnold\nBut they didn't sign Kurt cousins they traded up and because the browns took Baker Mayfield them because the giants took steak one Barclay Sam Donald fell into their laps and I think Sam Donald's been the best rookie quarterback so far in the NFL it's either him or its Baker may feel but I Would lean more towards Sam Donald\nWhen you factor in how much money they're saving in his rookie contract with sand Arnold\nAnd the idea that they don't have to occupy that much of the cap on guaranteed money to give to Kirk Cousins\nEven though they lost on Sunday\nIt was kind of a blessing in disguise that Kurt cousins decided to take less money and go to Minnesota because I think in the long run it's going to benefit the jets moving forward I don't think he would make that much of a difference on this roster I really don't\nThe other thing is I mean think about the motives behind her cousins\nNow granted you can sit there and look at it and say took less money to go to Minnesota so clearly he was more about the team that is going to and maybe the opportunity to Super Bowl\nBut the jets were just leverage\nAnd and I think that that's a legitimate complaint I Know you're all about that stuff ready but out here on the west coast\nWe don't do that in mid west show boating stuff in the gym we come here and we're Jim bullies out here on the west coast\nJudging by both sides are going to count but I I guess that would that would be true [laughter] um [laughter]\nUh it was what what we have to have sex or Jay Jay ... on Thursday night guys just for ... I wanted to be a little pointed here so I have is a ... have just regular game like that wait\nWait your ticket the under ... it's ... it's prime time you're insane but you but you know what\nSunday Morning guys we got a eagles versus the jaguars across the pond and when we stadium two and a half off sensitive touchdowns for the jaguars over under\n... could be ... Kessler\nThat's why I did two and a half or not one and a half all [laughter] I've got to go on but I'm not sure starting yeah most of the shade of what's been it's been a tough one for borders on your shoulder and I you know you don't want you made this give me the other Arab before genesis anything\n[noise] two and a half a sense of touch down ... percent of the one hand yes jags in London they've lost the last three or four in a row three narrow um\nThree in a row they've scored seven points and back to back games only fourteen ...\nI'm On the back of my ... was going to get to start and I think he's just he's going to just do just enough to pass he's going to do just enough to pass is three I think ... is going to START I think he's going to have a pretty good game committee over how about that but I'm going to look at them I don't get that\nLiterally Moran three minutes ago you were talking about how you were planning poorly against their board will pick last week so yeah but what are the odds that you know what I was a very strong discern that football game ever\nI Can't wait I'm actually going to get to watch this and have a drink while I watch it when life that Jesus may come back into this I mean look ... homes as to what Sarah border stuff yeah so did\nI got there we go to\nKeep it on Sunday Morning right so we're going to do a number of wins for the NFC North next week All right so here's here's the games\nPackers at rams jets ... bears Seahawks at lions and St ... Vikings as a Sunday night game next week over under two and a half wins for the NFC North\nSt says Vikings of ... that is a tough one you just sort of one and a half or two and a half two and a half from Japan is ... the Sunday night\n... ... and I were on the air when the Minneapolis Miracle happened a year ago very true and and and get and he's not going to be have that South uh we only have ... what will pull it for for next I okay yeah so I was that was too much fun since we're not going to hear Brady a next week we'll just hear a lot of this upcoming segment\nHum I Will take the under of two and a half wins for the ...\nFinal one guy's right we're going to talk some agreed and brothers we did this early in the season number wins for the group and brothers next weekend over under one and a half or will say that half that I'm close at raiders Redskins giants\nWill to reduce the risk and the raiders or a\nRedskins at giants and it's edited half yes yeah yeah he's going to go the over I don't think I Am too I'm taking the over the over to say something about Hooters man yeah but who just wanted to do it got those got those wings man like somebody put a bunch of bubble gum in a frying pan\n... not not the greatest wings but their beers are pretty cold man ...\nGot his ... and also it's it's kind of grew in but it sounds like something out like a cello hinted did I say that but yeah but it sounds\nOutlook a known just leave that one that's uh I hate the alright so here we go a break when John his X. box portrayed it that it Roberts we're all done All right so\nUm so yeah that'll be good to recap next week without some of the year are coming up next year on Fox Sports radio huge day a huge day plus you will get to hear the single greatest call and the history of sports talk radio that's next year on Fox Sports radio\nFox Sports radio\nAnd where you get your balance\nMorning I'm going to run through all of my stories in the ...\nMy name is Preston James I've been a stock options trade her for twenty three years I used to be an active swing trader but that all changed once I discovered my money press weekly paycheck method these days I'm a passive trader calling and more cash while being able to sleep at night than I ever dream possible\nI'm passionate about the market and I like to keep it simple\nMy methods are changing thousands of lives and I'm confident it can change yours\nBut let the proof do the talking by going to pay check proves dot com that's paycheck proves dot com you'll see a seven minute video revealing how my money press method grew fifty four thousand dollar account to one hundred and Seventy four thousand in less than nine months that works out to five point eight percent per week you'll see the proof right inside my real brokerage account\nThis isn't about overnight riches but once you discovered this for yourself you can start on this same passed overnight you're seven minutes away from changing everything you thought you knew about trading and investing go paycheck proof dot com that's paycheck proof dot com\n[noise] trusting [noise] challenge [noise] dog was always a A N K I find jobs [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's ready to get his ... show was the team doesn't matter if I Want to be here or not I'm going to be a big time player it looks like that and the co why lettered we're going to get which is great news for the NBA get bad news the NBA\nAnd it's great to ... letters back and that's bad news because suddenly everybody is saying oh man you gotta worry about the rafters now knows collide Leonard\nFitting in with that all sides have a great bench already banned came off the bench tonight for eleven points they have a really good second to play as well and he's a huge appraisal when he's motivated and wants to play watch out now the rafters are going to make some noise\nTo get the rest of what Jason Smith and my comment that pod cast did like searching the Jason Smith show with my car man and it's always you can hear the Smith show when my comment wink nine to ten am eastern back right here on Fox Sports radio [laughter]\n[noise] it's still ...\n[noise] I don't want to bring battles for the media but you know I heard somebody today on TV you know last time I was calling the war's been turned the postseason\nDavid fries or has been much maligned ridiculed I have been\nOne of the leaders in the clubhouse David prices really professional baseball player in the major leagues since twenty or you know he has been\nIn playoff series with Tampa Bay and also the Detroit Tigers since Ronald blue jays and the Boston Red Sox he has now one one game as a starting pitcher in twelve playoffs and\nSo I don't know who the bows or was it the M.

I our solo gigs or at stinking genius one that's on the\nPlane showing everybody should be following us at Fox Sports radio this was the gaming flexed into Sunday night now yeah hindsight's always twenty twenty in these situations and I'm not trying to crap all over the NFL or or whomever else's involved in that decision but boy when you watch the game in\nTo this prime time spotted it ends up like this you know sometimes I mean it's forty five to ten now forty five to ten it's the worst disaster you could possibly ask or unless you're a chief's fan but I mean hey\nIf anything on it it's given us a reason to ignore it you know if it's cheap and then I'm sure bingo than you are but it's but it's given us a region to ignore this game and focus on the date and was in the NFL the world series and a little NBA right\nYou know 'cause it was a six point spread though so that was thought that this could be a blowout or what it was also done especially because the chiefs we're playing at home um there was a very strong possibility they were coming up that loss to the to the New England patriots\nHere's my question and again she fan ... just don't get mad I Know you're watching the game right now a couple of getting mad at me one of the spectrum too I'm not complaining I'm just pointing out this happens sometimes\nBut when you have the score fest that's going on in the NFL now even though we took a little bit of a step back and a couple of games today but when you have games in the forties and its feeling more like college football\nUm I I I think this is still a draw right I mean I Know the way football fans not going to dig into a forty five ten game but the chiefs or becoming must see TV in my opinion and\nI hate to say that it seems to me it's like just the worst feeling coming out of my mouth ever Arnie the chiefs are must see TV right now with the way this off into some it\nWell or they must see TV because like you just said they're often says humming or because they're five and want if they were if there were three and three or something like that you wouldn't be saying oh we've got to watch just a team because there are so great offensively but they're not so good defensively and that's why there are three and three or something like that you you wouldn't be praising their their them at that point\nWhere they're really not good defensively is what's crazy [laughter] right now I mean if you think about it outside of the fourteen they gave up the Jacksonville you know they've constantly given up about four touchdown justify the game but hey it's working tonight\nWithout without a when you score so much you're you're bound to give up on the defensive and anyway so\nAll right so will you fire me if I Want to start on a topic from today that isn't necessarily I don't know mainstream and a lot of people's eyes on you know where I'm going\nI Would give you a little leeway here like the judgment say a little leeway you got here\nOkay because I kind of want to start with the Jacksonville Jaguars\nShe's out of everything we can talk about you want to go back to that thing\nI well here's here's the deal here's the deal from my perspective I've come to accept and I we talk about this a lot this leak is a week to week league will sit here in ...\nAt the time but something that's starting to come together in my mind boy Jacksonville really screwed up their gamble on Lake ... and if you have that mindset of oh well the ravens you remember they went to the super bowl ... so you don't need a super star quarterback\nThey're paying Blake portals like a super star quarterback now they gave him a three year fifty four million dollar extension now they have an out but it's not too after next season just do it as a Twenty one million dollar cap it\nNext year and if you cut him it's sixteen point five million dollars in debt money you've got miles Jackie got class Campbell you've got the Jay Leno rams you got the bat is due on the planet on that defense\nBut army that is just becoming a nightmare a nightmare and Jacksonville right now now\nIf I'm Still hired and I'm Still around what can you do if you're Tom Coughlin to try to save this without\nWhy I take it six of twelve sixteen thousand yards isn't going to cut it for use of that stature to find\nOut um could they rework that contract if they wanted to make it a little bit more cap friendly or is it no way no how uh there's no doubt that they're going to move on from late ... they have to I mean right now there's so much bad blood ... standing on the sidelines today\nI'd I'd want to go out and put somebody in the throat I couldn't seriously I I'd be so aggravated there'd be steam coming out of my ears and not that anybody's here to blame\nBut he's got to move out to a fresh situation and Jacksonville is going to have to move out it's just not what do you do in terms of the rest of this year and as you mentioned next year there's got to be some way to figure this out without getting past that you know great point where you can't come back and we're we're already may be at that point right now\nI mean they're fighting in the locker room jailing Ramsey we'll get to the audio tonight we got our editors great crew with a guy go Fox Sports radio studios that are chopping things up and and you'll\nSimilar to what I experienced with Oakland last year whenever they started to now granted Oakland didn't go to the championship game\nBut you start to know and in this knee jerk league in which we live in the power rankings which are dumb anyone that does power rankings they're dumb they don't matter they're irrelevant stop it but so in all of these little rankings that people do on Jacksonville oh number two number three maybe number one\nAfter they beat the patriots like they did well they've lost what for their last five right now a layering\nSay that I the funny part is I die for Blake portals in Miami or you know somebody else tries to somebody else's treasure I you're laughing and nothing that gets pulled over but they keep doing that real quick even though he played okay today or an ... Ryan tannahill I don't even want to hear if he wants to come back as a wide receiver I'll think about it but\nSeventy and let's see do you think it's three dollars the ...\nThe parks and recreation or ... or ... access or for more information about five three to four ... four zero\n\nGo all the talk of six and seven mobile apps that dog one of those six points to have a dot com or detail\n\n\nRadio one college years about it now\nYou're by discover card and we treat you like free you are already I wanted to get into some of your real quick but those who don't follow the trajectory slash plan I'll go show uh we we we usually about eight hours before we go on\nOf giving these early tweets the wind is earth so I've got a few here for you\nBy the way I called the Ohio State upset last week I don't know if you remember that\nAh I don't remember or whatever but I'm I'm I'm I'm ... remind you though that's [laughter]\nI'll say this much boy when Ohio State loses they just go ahead and say we are we're we're done here think about I Will last year and now boy that produce game great energy\nI haven't heard from in Iowa State fair I don't think we're going to hear from them wow uh to what twenty Nineteen now or what\nMaybe they can all complain about Nick boasting not being committed to the team\nOr maybe we get into that a little bit later yeah I don't know if a laptop wait let's get to these two yeah real or Steve asked Bailey seven three one writes Arnie can we discuss the patriots moved the first place\nAnd the dolphins turned back to mediocrity no a Johnny rights at sacrifice today I think the cowboys would be better off with T. Bo\nI may have to agree with that boy do they just look ... there's no doubt that that person got is not even forget about being a franchise quarterback he's not even starting quarterback\nOr in the NFL right now the cowboys are really what that one slip through their fingers unbelievable that a chance to tie it I didn't even believe they were in that position ... did you see when they fumble than it was uh what is the ten\nGame at that point I thought it was over so uh yeah they got to make some changes\nThat and that the fumble was set up on a holding call yeah because they added like play that got him out of trouble when I was holding calls so a poll ... bills mafia rights can we started with Jacksonville that crash you just heard is Fox Sports radios ratings right now why\nWhy you gotta have Paul well and then he doubled up with my world series prediction ... a pre ...\n... yeah well I I don't look I got the Dodgers waiting in seven I think they've got the better starting pitching other than sale and I know praise pitched well but you can't count on him of all these that she'd been the number to start up for the red Sox I I think the Dodgers have much better starting pitcher right now\nI I just it's crazy for me because I I I've been a Dodger fan my whole life\nMy favorite player when I was growing up with Steve sat larger fit for twenty four hours now twenty four hours on it and it's and it was wild because when I was really young they want a World Series and they were constantly there and I thought oh my gosh this fandom thing this sports fans ... being a Dodger fan we're going raiders are going to Super Bowls Dodgers are going to World Series\nAnd then you hit this thirty your voice you know quick yeah [laughter] it does [laughter] but they had not been to the world series since Nineteen eighty eight when they want it and then they go back\nLast year and a credible series we got to live a lot of it together on the air here on Fox Sports radio and then you know you you you go back the following year when honestly I don't think they had a great season\nAnd maybe they got a little lucky that they were in the division where you didn't have a Red Sox a or power or the way that even at times this season the Indians had run away with a central they were able to stay right there all season long and\nI'm kind of shocked that they're in this position\nBut I kind of thought that I I mean I think they got a great chance well you had to go and pick 'em in seven\nGotta well thank you you got to remember out of the red Sox won a hundred and eighty victories a hundred and seven of come against the Baltimore Orioles so take that for what it's worth a look I Know the benefit of the little bit and even back a typical wasn't all that good either\nSo you know you could add a little bit but still a hundred and eight hundred a that was a damn good season it's going to be a great world series I I'm just I I think it's just going to go seven I Want to see the red Sox other than sale and we didn't even know cells go to pitch like I had one\nFirst I was legit worried about him I mean I'm not and again I'm not trying to sell anything short if you're hurting your hurt right but you you start hearing about certain things that you can get that out of nowhere you're in the hospital and out of nowhere\nA you're out for quite a while but\nIt's um it's getting them selling to these guys that night it's I'm not pitching for like three or four\nDays I think I'll get one right during the the playoffs or is this something yet for a couple of years and it just started to get infected I I got to assume you just got it\nI I guess so I've never experienced belly button rings I don't know if any one of the guy go Fox Sports radio studios have I I'm pretty sure I can put ... in the category of not wanting us I think yeah oh he does oh okay well we'll find out but yeah\nYou know by the way USA Today said he said that with a straight face Chris Sale but apparently was putting everybody on all those so it wasn't the belly ring then huh right he was hospitalized he's had problems he's fine\nYou know he had that they're the pushing back from game five\nGame ... if there was a game so yeah so is he going to be ready to go where can I go ahead and start my world so he's ... he's already been enough\nFor the started for day more so yeah oh well so am I liked the belly ring story so much better he should've kept with that one was he really trolling on that one 'cause I kinda just tapped out on it a little bit so that wasn't a real story that was made up right\nThat's correct\nWas made us I feel so just sucked in right now in ... he he was completely dead panning and I think some locked away and then some reporter I think it was USA Today talked with a different teammate who said oh yeah he's a joke\n[laughter] he's quite the joker as he's either way I looked up the Dodgers team from two thousand two yeah Dave Roberts forty five steel starting center fielder Alex core about it\nGet a huge ovation and the game one intros because he had the stolen base in Boston history or to stay alive against the Yankees two thousand four\nI really mad right now I'm really mad I feel like whenever I sell for an April Fool's joke a couple of years ago Oregon football put on a April Fool's day\nThey put out a tweet that they were going to have the first ever L. E. D. field which if you're thinking of organized so look for something that the ducks would do right and I felt for that thing hook line and see what do you\nCredit I'm Still waiting for ... for them that I'm not talking about and I said earlier and I guess all that I wanted to I hate I I got it I Want to laugh and I like I said I ... I was enjoying he never saw any wants to have these kind of joking but there will how it\nGoes a long season of baseball when the Dodgers got I think it was Ryan ... in relief\nThey had actually ... I think it was a kick out here in the end is they convinced him that he didn't speak English because he was born in retail and on for weeks this new Dunn and her teammates thought that the guy didn't speak English at all by the way final in Kansas City chiefs forty five ten\nForty five to ten market down I still have more coming up here and I just didn't take long did it oh my gosh well last week's game cruised let let me let me follow up on this and then we'll go more in depth\nAfter the break because it's not relevant to the NFL today but I think it becomes irrelevant conversation over the next couple of weeks involving college football and I think you and your and tourists touched on this a little bit last night you can hear that show Fox Sports radio dot com on the podcast page Arnie or we under selling\nThe role that UCF central Florida should have in the college football playoff conversation\nYes we're under selling but that's because I don't want them into the playoffs that does that mean to me is that wrong to me is that selfish of me is a big lead us the college football leaders or is it all the above I I don't know what it is I I I guess that's\nIt's happening across college football right now they're athletic director Danny why not to be confused with the former ... quarterback came out with a I guess his statement that's received a close to two thousand and re tweets in ... in which she kind of challenges the current model\nAnd I'm not going to read the whole is that in northern Italy long but one paragraph says college football is the only sport in America that is not settled on the field which no reality I mean to me it is but not every under the ... he gets it gets a shot I see what he's saying\nNo no not yet well all we we get some better practice is that we might be ready to take them on you know were foreign three it's not like the seasons completely over we're going to die offs we could come on we can still make a run in the playoffs give me a little bit of a break\nI I Know this sounds dumb and no one wants to hear this but if the seas in war to end today you would basically be in the playoffs\nNo yes no\nYou wouldn't be a oh I'm Sorry a Baltimore would have won the ...\nOver you that to me like I hate what people do that you know you're like the guy when I'm watching a baseball game with and then it gets hit you go oh that's all right and well like the second\nHold on hold on hold on hold up hold up yeah what's their record right now a foreign three\nOkay the team that's getting it over them as foreign three to it's a tie breaker saying there and a three way tie at their record for the last playoff spot right now so it's not like you're ... games out I mean for in three is a playoff team right now when they were here you know\nYou don't understand that well one of the dolphins were not the Oakland Raiders\n... I mean what's that mean I Will not rewriting the unit I was a ... I Would take three wins would go tear down a goalpost right now that could happen in Oakland All right we've got to take a break and when we come back to the guy go Fox Sports radio studios let's refocus on what we learn from week seven in the NFL Saudi and playing a Fox Sports radio\nTwo teams have a shot [laughter]\nOnly one will be champions\nFelt season starts now [laughter]\nWe got off

radio [laughter] he's in gentleman\n[laughter] how many how Congress we\nMissed it coming right before you and I think it's always difficult to judge rookie quarterback performance [noise]\nBut I think if you're a swatting these guys and I think you could make a strong argument for Baker may feel that the best I think you can make a strong argument for Sam Darnell at the ... the quarterback so far I think they are clearly the two best of the world where the quarterback that are playing and starting in the NFL rate them Josh Allen\nFound a bills fan not very soul and I'm also not sold right now on what I Am theme from Josh Rosen doesn't mean that those guys are going to be bad remember Jared golf was not very good his first year either\nJust that if the ranking the quarterbacks right now the rookie quarterback Baker may feel and Sam Darnell haven't been on a different level compared to Josh Rosen Penn Josh a\nHouse kick this coverage with clay trap you want to talk about a way to

to the AFC Championship and they beat the New England patriots that the Patriot when feels like something that was like a decade ago it doesn't feel like the safety right now\nAnd it's crazy they were

low ranging from forty to forty five\nWidely scattered showers are back in the forecast throughout our Monday mostly highly conditioned by sixty to eighty five and so on and off against scattered

old dog\nNew tricks mainly the [laughter]\nAll right so a winter winter for me or any good job tonight now before we get too carried away here in counting my winnings arguably I think we've had this conversation a lot but I I'm old and I forget things are you a believer that mid season coaching change helps hurts in different positive negative what's kind of your thought on\nThat I I guess it depends on the team which way they're going and what was the expectation so you know I Can't say one way or the other and so I Know which one you're talking about\nI Am talking about the Cleveland Browns who for today tied the NFL record with their twenty fourth straight road defeat yeah they haven't lost to they're going to a Pittsburgh next week where the browns\nHaven't won at Heinz Field since two thousand and three so what you're saying\nThat could extend to twenty five\nOh God I don't want to be mean but this is you know usually I'd say doing anything in the mid season does absolutely nothing okay so um you know making a change like that it's not like the ... going to turn around and make a playoff run that being said and like I said I don't want it to some mean there are only reason you get rid of your Jackson now is God Forbid eagle\nTo do is your fire now you go with the interim coach the finish out the year and then you go up to the real coach that you want to go for a long long time like Lincoln Riley or urban Meyer somebody like that\nDon't don't you dare selling can ride it out of a drop that war games have gone over time this year including their tie earlier this season and I mean let's let's be honest about it the game that they should have one of the officiating or didn't blow right for him against the raiders I mean Oakland should be on six right now in all honesty\nBut they're biased coming up and we love and so they have the Pittsburgh game then they get Kansas City at home in them\nAnd then they host Atlanta now the only reason I bring this up is because there was a report out of Cleveland tonight on the flagship for the browns which is Ninety two three the fan and Darryl Roy Roy leader writer sorry if I'm saying that wrong bro\nBut he tweeted this earlier this evening just a couple of hours ago and said quote hearing rumblings that browns owner Jimmy has limb\nAnd GM John Dorsey are less than pleased with the current state of affairs added\nStay tuned he didn't follow that up a couple of minutes later with red alert were officially on red alert now we're going to change\nIn two weeks though because when they were two two and one I'm sure they weren't saying that at that point where they\nI think you're probably right\nBut I mean the discipline at fourteen penalties that's the third time in seven games that the browns have been penalize\nTen or more times in a game so I think the the the problem here is that okay we feel like we've got the pieces were still playing very undisciplined football and only I got to be honest with you I Know John Dorsey went out and brought in Carlos Hyde and the off season right but I I think Carlos Hyde getting trade it for a fifth round draft pick\nWas more about the kind of saying well maybe the contract but to me I think it's about play Nick Chubb you guys are\nThey connect there but I think that's a situation worth watching over the next couple of days now if you're gonna make a move you can't make a move on Tuesday and Wednesday you've got to make that move either tonight and obviously it's it's midnight in Cleveland so I don't think they're gonna make the move tonight or you've got to do it pretty early tomorrow morning don't you I\nCould you imagine Todd Haley or Gregg Williams as an interim head coach right now in the league\nThey fired weight Philips ... after a Monday Night football game on the way back from the game so on the plane yeah you're right though usually got to do that or the Sunday night Monday Night especially after a debacle this wasn't a debacle and\nYou know it's going to be hard to do what are you going to go with the interim coach until you can figure out who you really want who you're going to be able to get in there and and take over from that and and by the way what a perfect ... you're talking about perfect timing what is the best time to talk to somebody like urban Meyer how about the coming off eight twenty nine point laws\nAre so Purdue and you know the fans are rumbling right now that'd be the best time to talk to that guy\nWhen when you say I mean I'm I'm sure there's probably those conversations have already happened not directly with urban but what's his people when you think\nHow I Would do the backup yesterday just a change your mind at all things different at all [laughter] I like it\nA couple of quick tweet send a then will again there's nothing official tonight just a couple of hey keep your antennas do does anyone using tennis any more canine tennis up and be paying attention in case something could go down in Cleveland there buys in three weeks a lot of teams like to use that buys if they're going to make a move\nBut by that point you're right only what good would it be then you'll probably have three more losses on your schedule where are you really going just to go ahead and let the guy coach out the seats I don't know what a buyout looks like either but I don't think that bothers me has on a Jeff hit just up on Twitter he goes he goes Arnie I have\nTo watch the browns every week in Oklahoma because of Baker Mayfield my raiders suck my USC Trojans\nYou ever want to

Mann limitations or fly I\nHear ya gotta\nCarry over from the conversation we had last segment yeah I thought you would be all about how Michigan react I mean you when you beat your rival I thought you would have dug that that seems very an audio\nI I did talk smack against Michigan State and see how a class C they are and all that\nI Will say I don't think I've ever\nHad my way home before the game ... who was stomping on the logo to from Michigan\nDevon Bush I I don't think I've ever seen that that's exactly what I was just going to say I I've never seen it I've never seen it ended up being a situation where they actually had to go out\nAnd break up the spray paint to cover up the damage that had been done so there's there's hate and then there is tearing the absolute you know what out of a logo admitted field as out of\nYou know I had the sound out I'm like oh look somebody's put graffiti on the logo before\nThe game I'm ready to that [laughter]\nOh he was out of it you know well what's what's funny is it's probably worse that he did that it would have been great to see him stumble on a play if he if he was trying to go to make a play make attack or something he stumbled on an area where he had created a David but all of the Bush and that's a bad\nMan Michigan all of a sudden now right in the middle of this whole thing\nAbout um as long as they started it\nOh attack Lee and their coach was just standing back there last according to the heart\nBy he was standing there laughing I've not seen video of him laughing\nLeague or mark Antonio whenever he said\nBush league in on prompted in just shook his head and started laughing that knew he he went up a couple of nachos in my book I thought that was hilarious All right it is time everyone's been waiting for it everyone marks their calendars if any of you still have\nPhysical calendars for our stock up stock down by cell or any let's get afterward I Want to start with the I guess exclamation point on the conversation about huge accident\nAnd all lead into it with the good tweet from Matt Ryan who writes the browns are all in on having football guys like John Dorsey and Scott McLuhan run the team I don't see them going on for a big name coach you would want power over them\nTo ruin what is being built so Arnie are you buying or selling that huge ...\nAnd is going to finish the season for the reasons I gave you that\nUm they want to go and get an interim in there just to make sure that you Jackson doesn't go on a winning streak so they have to keep them around another year and I'm being serious about that so they'll probably let him go um right before that uh right after the game or a before the pie week so what does that about three weeks from now for weeks from now\nOr give or take if they don't go out a winning streak I really believe they want urban Meyer and somebody somebody like that\nUm I don't really think wants to go ahead at his age have complete control I think he just wants to coach and show people\nThat he could do it in the NFL I think he's really disenchanted what's going on at Ohio State earlier this year are we just saw that twenty nine point was I think he's thinking to themselves you know what if I if I'm ever going to leave now's the time they'll leave and I think he may do it\nHe didn't come out today and said he's not ruling out taking back play calling from Todd Haley\nAnd for those that have followed Hughes career he's not afraid to kind of speak his mind so we'll keep an eye on that three weeks by the way before it ... by ... eleven they've got Pittsburgh next week and then they host Kansas City\nAnd Atlanta luck to you they're buying or selling Arnie even though they lost last week to the patriots the chief should a favorite right now than when the AFC Championship\nSolely on by not you know the patriots had ten days or to prepare for that game they play and everything for that and they still only one forty three forty\nPlus they played at home or let's play on the up and not let's see what happens when both teams only have one week to prepare let's play that game in Kansas well let's not we see what can the city does it on when it comes to the playoffs I Would like another shot of that one New England in Kansas City without the patriots getting ten ... ten days threats and also\nNow that they may have a problem it running back with the ... show going down\nWith a twisted near twisted ankle or whatever it was a that can be a difference maker\nAlright Ernie this one's going to hit it\nAgent has gone after Adam gay several former players have or even though there for three to have a winning record they started three now but are you buying or selling that Adam gays could be on the hot seat in Miami\nYou know I think as I Am buying it yeah they started three and all and\nThe bad loss wasn't so much to the patriots even though they just got steam rolled it was a game against Cincinnati where they had a couple of picks fixes and there were winning Seventy nuts to get you Seventy three going into the fourth quarter and they got that one simple way yeah I think he's on the hot seat they got a a tough game on the road against the Texans\nAre they have to go to Green Bay or the coast look as much of a pushover yeah I I\nI think that's true I think he's on the hot seat big time here\nOkay so there's been a lot of tweets tonight I haven't\nGot to him about the potential of the jaguars may be making a tray\nAnd naturally everyone turns to where Tom Coughlin was before and says right why not why not bring you I'm Manny here\nShip Blake board all out I don't know contractually if that could happen while it was the one who's going to want to take quite portals [laughter] and I think they're hoping the giants might and you know you have a guy that they feel as a quarterback guru and\nEli Manning it by the way he like many actually looks like he's younger than Blake ... even though he isn't but only are you buying or selling that we're going to see a movie made by the jaguars ... to try to get someone in there that maybe take over for one Blake ...\nYou mean a a as a trade or getting a free agent to come on in\nAll you know the other name it's always brought up whenever there's a quarterback situation and things are struggling in the NFL used to be T. Bo for so long now it's ... so he's out there at the very least\nKnow it is intriguing I think they're going to stick with portals just because of the money they're paying him and then maybe see if somebody wants to pick them up after this year 'cause like you said he has one more year left\nMake that move just yet but if three and four or they've got to do something to do is to say if captured that comes in that he's the difference maker I think he just stick with portals and see what happens from here on out\nYeah and you know it's going to be ... I say it's gonna be interesting a lot I mean we we have nine or ten weeks to go in the NFL season so a lot could play out but\nEveryone just acts as if there's this magical place that once all of your bad players for their good players and well we could just strange I mean we could just go get their car for the raiders of asking the raiders are are not good and they might be thinking\nBut I just don't think they're going to take on all your bad players and all your bad contracts so they could give up their quarterback they gave a hundred million dollars too so it's not possible with that said do you still consider Jacksonville to be a contender even if they stick with portals they went to the AFC Championship game for goodness sakes last year\nNo there's not a contender let's not get carried away\nOn the patriots was there'll be a a more of a favorite the Pittsburgh Steelers or even Cincinnati in Baltimore um I Would even say used in in Tennessee still Kansas City the chargers no there's not a contender let's pump the brakes on that Chris\nBuying or selling this has been the worst primetime matchups so far this season in the NFL Thursday night the Broncos beat the cardinals forty five to ten\n... just hours ago the chiefs wrapped up a forty five to ten went over the bangles and I mean no offense but tomorrow night we get the one in five giants against the two and four falcons Arnie\nBy the way you are you mentioned the playoffs this was a playoff team and two thousand sixteen I went to the playoffs\nAnd lost in the first round through Seattle but I mean as long as you don't go and do what John ... ditch your roster you still have talented guys there\nAnd it good news they didn't do that to map Patricia All right I have one more yeah grab a break and we'll get to say going here to recap everything we need to know in the world of sports are earning this is a tough one for me because I'm having a hard time really coming to grips with it his Minnesota good\nMaybe number three maybe number four in the NFC\nThey look pretty good today did they not I I thought they looked exceptional look good cousins didn't put up the big numbers if you send them statistically a two hundred and forty one yard but what he did was\nThe two touchdowns the no interceptions that that is what you're looking for and they didn't have a great running game I Know Murray add one explosive run but for the most part he did nothing that defense is what gets done from Minnesota they still have that great defense so\nYeah I'm Still fighting the Minnesota they'll get better every year somebody better guard the win because that guy is still true and you're up there but otherwise yeah I think it was ... but I I think they're fine and you'll ... you'll see them in the ... and it probably wouldn't that division\nGood stuff All right when we come back to the guy go Fox Sports radio studios were going to talk some college football I have notes from Doug Peterson and we're

I never picked up a golf club wants to do my good me not want her there's no one oh my goodness have not even swung a golf and I got a big argument coming up\nYeah the independent Bob got all by the way your annual tournament and independent Bob just called me a few times just ranting thinking it was ... and he just ranting and raving ... Elizabeth Warren thing just send him into outer space yeah he's just like this is just well\nThey they they believe that a good thing to do that they believe that this is a good tactic you and I just kind of just in general if you just look at the tactics right now the left as using I mean politically we're not talking about the moms in restaurants were not talk\nTheir political tactics I mean there are many this is their mainstream political tactic\nAnd they believe stuff like this is going to work and and that's and you and I made sure that before it went on vacation when we were talking about cabinet not understand this is the mainstream now yeah of the Democrat leadership in this country because we'll always get calls from people saying well\nThis isn't the average Democrat it's the average Democrat now representing new sure in Congress and in the Senate\nRight\nThis is the standard and we'll get to Elizabeth Warren too and uh the the three big problems that by the way the narrow down just to to three well one of one of the things I I Love was uh I I never believed in white privilege until Elizabeth Warren\nA white person makes the claim yes she's Native American you all white privilege that white privilege fried rice or cultural appropriation\nYeah right I'm and and again they\nBelieve they're on the right track I Know it's just it's just unbelievable so we'll get to that uh the polls everything else you've got a great show ... for cobra electronic fears are forecast\nSet to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there's a low pressure system and in the Pacific there's a low pressure area both of those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nAnd if you get up into the higher reaches of the\nSouthern Sierra is an southern Rockies you could pick up some snow fall as a result of that ... at the end of last week the winter weather forecast from the climate Prediction Center was issued a couple of regional highlights it will be warmer in the west know changing the chances for snow in the Northern Rockies it'll be drier and warmer\nThe great lake region is expected to be drier no parts\nBill upping which means wetter conditions are possible across the country for winter there is a true national forecast from red eye radio on meteorologist John trout\nThank you John eight six six Ninety red eye if you want to join his six Ninety run I sure I Would say from family yeah but [noise]\n\n[noise]\nCrazy and then then I guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren then does DNA matter\n[laughter] right right\nDoes this does this destroying transgender isn't mhm if DNA matters because remember the the the next thing is as as we all know uh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing the ... just starting to embrace right or remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter] before this one of the leading liberal icons\nYou know socialist icons social justice warrior ... who broke a ton of social justice warrior winds and regulations ... number one you were saying the DNA matters does in this so DNA matters across the board then and then it matters for ah your your sexuality it matters for your gender huh\nThat writers for your race huh right is is that the\nIs that the whole point or or does it not in\nOkay what's the determining factor of what you are then what is the what is the [laughter] [laughter] where does the decimal point go what is the what is the fraction that indicates that you are a particular ethnicity just great stuff well and if I were doing a debate with her on stage I Would say\nA former President Obama said rate is just a social construct yes do you agree\n[laughter]\nAnd people forget about that because again what you know it that when President Obama ... just before\nThey asked him you know why do you say that you're black and when you know your ... mixed mixed race and\nHe said because I've come to know I come to realize that race is a social construct ... it's what you think you are ... so is that it now is that done now has the left moved on because when when you look\nAt it there were so many rules of the social justice warrior that Elizabeth Warren broke and they were completely quiet mhm totally silent ... everything from cultural appropriation\nSo the fact that race apparently is no longer a social construct it has something to do with DNA that's why\nAre you using science [laughter] move toward [laughter]\nRemember when Ben Shapiro brought up science on a on the doctor drew show he was threatened with violence\nSo you can't bring up science that's wrong\nBut see this is this is the madness of the left because there are so many different directions\nHow do you know which one is the row here's here's the thing when Trump says something the majority of what Trump says that they criticize in fact check this off the cuff mhm right it's it's an opinion or just the thought that he just boom records out right and and and the insanity of the left\nWhich is I'm going to call them the whole my beer party from now on cars whatever Trump does like hold my beer I think that I won't watch what I'm going to say it's actually premeditated and thought out yet no planets\nThey were trying they're trying to prove them wrong on something that he didn't give a half a second to he didn't give one one hundred and twenty fourth of a second [laughter]\nYeah the navy seal and it was a huge ad I with a gun [laughter] ... and the swimming pool or it's you know that that's it it really is the um that's the madness because they believe that something\nThat's going to win for them look in her state in terms of you know her Senate seat\nYeah she's pretty safe like Dick Durbin he can get away with saying and are doing a lot of crazy things he's safe as long as he wants that seat but at least for the time being you want to enter the arena and twenty twenty\nFor the big house well by the way not present the White House I mean yeah but [laughter]\nAlthough although Hillary was a contender for both\nUm [laughter] we ... do you have to get up on that stage and you have to bring down out look again you know those um those blue states where they're safe they can they can do the crazy things they can do the protester type attitude but do that up on stage you know we talked about this\nWas a few months ago when we were talking about what the the the pool of contenders in the primary season and twenty twenty will look like right\nThere each going to have the top each other on how much they hate Trump that will be gold number one you've got to show your anger and you've got to show how much you so the person who hates Trump more\nIn terms of the perception by the voter or the rank and file Democrats might get the nomination because that's the goal number one for them so but in order to do that they have to get up on that debate stage during that primary season\nAnd that's what they have to do they have to do the crazier and crazier and crazier because no longer can you have a debate no longer can you have a real discuss\nNo uh jobs we need more jobs ... we have winding up people right now I'm so the what are you going to do well you have it has to be about the hatred for Trump's so you're gonna have to display you know the one who hates them most is going to win\nOver ... or where it's going that we thought the only way that they could go if they were going to go more or less which is we're offering you everything for free\nYeah yeah and I mean ... ... ... and that we are the other\nDay we yeah we do we we do have a fascist mindset and we do is to control\nA lot a lot of things we do believe in the intimidation of of uh the tactics out there we don't believe in the constitution of the United states which by the way it's become clear and we brought this up a few years ago and we were amazed\nAt the very little response so we got from Democrats on this right where we said look they don't really believe in the constitution we now know that they don't they don't believe in the Senate\nThey don't believe in the cars that by the way that gained ground over their vacation then you know the Senate has to go to the electoral college the electoral college has to go to the Senate has to go and what they what they may not realize it but that's when you get into not carrying that belief get you to the point of\nNot caring about individual rights because that's why the Senate does exist that's why the electoral college or you know it exists\nBecause we're not a direct democracy were republic where constitutional Republican or a public why to protect individual rights that the Democrats and the ACLU used to care about right but now as we know they don't write and so you know that's where you've got to we really don't believe in America\nAnd so in order to get you to vote for us we'll give you as much free stuff as possible to me that's actually what the Democrats\nAnd I I you're you're spot on and but the problem there is what CNN Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo asking tough questions from all cash\nMm that forget about the media ask ... wasn't so tough but they did ask the question\nIf your Hillary and you get back in and twenty twenty the it used to be the boiling the frog slowly right okay we'll give you a little more free stuff and then ... a little more free stuff\nYou've got to go for one cause you have Gillum and Florida promising to world Casio Cortez promising to world Bernie's been promising the world\nCan Harris now over the last couple of days yeah you know saying okay let's give everybody right now let's let's get people's six thousand dollars a year that's the starting bright right let's just give cash to people and and so uh so we're to the the the the free cash free health care and free college\nYeah and and they know they can't pay for it and the American voter knows they can't pay for it but how how do you do it if you're Hillary and you try and put up a plan of a little more free stuff no you've got to go full on like the rest of them did\nSomebody will get to the point where we talked about before the twenty sixteen election just offer every American a hundred tops of dollars [laughter]\nExactly or one

a huge you have the cabin on hearing where America has seen\nThat there are major major things that are important to many Americans that they now understand that the Democrats do not believe in and we talked about the cabinet and forget about the Supreme Court ... what it showed was that depending on their politics\nThat the Democrats do not believe in a presumption of innocence right or the mindset of due process and we set up back at that and you know at that time\nThe separation of powers and the three branches of government and the rights that are included in the first amendment to the constitution of the majority of Americans can't tell you what they are\nBut\nYou look at what is didn't grain that our culture and one of the reasons is the TV ... the TV shows on lawyers all the way back to Perry Mason or the presumption of innocence and due process\nThe mindset of due process is ingrained into every single American\nSo we saw that with Kavanaugh\nAnd we saw the reaction of many people realizing that not the fringe of the Democratic party but the mainstream of the Democratic party has now jumped off the cliff and\nYou have a president who again is if you want to look at

the guy I may not ever vote for the guy but\nAm I motivated to go out and vote for this person what are they gonna do for me\nYou're talking about other sports were just talking about rank and file voters rank and file voters right because what did you see Wall Street journal going through Harlem and the than the day after the election and twenty sixteen why do you think he was just the you know random\nParticipants on the street interviews\nAnd the the one common thread in those and those responses from those respondents was he was talking about problems we have here at home she kept talking about problems over seas somewhere outside of this country\nWe should the reason the Trump one was not because he had all the solutions but because he simply identified what the problem was what the problem is the worst and and the fact is you haven't had presidential candidates that have looked at the topics that people have cared about\nAnd even point out these are the problems and we have to solve them that's how bad it have gotten by twenty six team as we said the Democrats were talking about and still are climate change and raised are two major problem ... well they're not right Americans didn't you would that way ... is president because\nHe identified what the problems were and now we can debate all day long whether all of the solutions\nThat he has come up with or that he has promoted or the correct way to go or not ... but the fact is he came up with the problems\nAnd identify the problems and politics are so bad in America today where if you just identified the problem in twenty sixteen that got you elected president of the United states right\n\nThen what you have now is two years later you've got a ton of people\nYeah I mean that's in in that did it because what you have to deliver in order to be reelected for a second term\nAs a result\nSo if we're still looking at low unemployment and we're still looking at you know the people taking more money

you what motivated the left or the right more we do know there's no doubt the right is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nNow I I watch it on the Mike called before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because\nMike was not driven to call based on what we had said and therefore he you know became passionate about giving his point of view across my called with that passion about the Russian\nCollusion investigation and his anger and his feeling that this could possibly changed the election you know and and move it to the Republicans before we ever started talking about I think that's important\nBecause I don't find many people like Mike mhm I don't think honestly\nNow we've covered everything when it comes to the whole Russian collusion from day one and we've asked every question known to man kind of we do things that we have looked at it more or as investigators in partisan\nAnd we believe that hey that with everything going on and with the Pfizer warrant and and and everything there that we are going to find out\nThat probably the Democrats were up to a lot more hijackings than the Republicans ever dreamed of actually doing it as we know already the only evidence including with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly would be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to\nGiving the money to uh Perkins gave it to a fusion GPS and gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who said he got his information his salacious on verified information\nOr against Donald Trump from people close to the Kremlin right so the only people that colluded in any way with the Russians were the Democrats from\nTo go to the polls no it really isn't um it it could it is it an underlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives\nAre based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who really brought to light so many things in this thing if you really followed it\nBut\nIt could it be there again is that underlying motivator that's I don't think that's the big push right now I don't think that's the big emotion nothing right now um I Do think there's something to the the the fact that\nThey then alleging all this sense you know a after the election and since certainly he's become president uh and they never showed anything for it and and it's really been this media circus and it's really based on nothing\nI think that's a motivator but it's not what I don't think it's the here and now\nI don't I don't see it I look I think that there are some people that have looked over the last couple of years and what the Democrats have done and they have included\nA ... in its in its contacts the whole Russian collusion thinking how unfair they believe it is and maybe that's partly what's driving them to the polls but the difference that we've seen over the last month in the energy level or what are they called the excitement level and upper Republican voters to come out\nWhich would make the difference\nIn keeping the house and increasing the number in the Senate none of that has to do with Russian collusion right or the Mueller investigation at all or not\nAnd see I don't know what a a a ... report does the if the if the report from last week is true that says the that Mueller would would uh issue the core of his report after the midterm right after the midterm\nReport without including the fact\nThat of how all this information was obtained and what you just spelled out now does that direct line that we know\nThat no one has disputed between the DNC and the Hillary campaign and ultimately Christopher Steele you can't you can't debate you and you can't ... you might get that out a report I don't think they do it's it's incomplete um\nWhat I Know what the report right now it's not going to even talk about that in in that that's the whole point it's like a ... but it's not even going to talk about the possibility of Trump looting with the Russians I I just\nBecause where where it would be the evidence if there's not going to be in the movement on indict\nIf it is just to report a crystal outta over at CNN a former Washington Post I write it you know where he said you know I think it's ... it's ultimately going to be just a just a report he's been saying that for a while\nIt's it's ultimately just got to be a report it's really not going to be any more indictments unless maybe there's a you know lying to investigators charge somewhere else along the lines\nAnd and we've got what are the Michael Flynn hearing ... probably will never see this ... right\nBecause in and that'll be a complete does that it'll just happening right it's it's not a delight to be done the last\nTwo years you had accusations gone just as good as it over\nExcept for the fact that you have the I. G. working on some information of what was going on at the department of justice during that time based on what the president and the White House sent to Mr Horwitz and we've been asking this ... I still haven't seen anybody else\nAsk what what we asked why would the White House sent it to the inspector general but we're talking about the debt is ...\nAsking the quality is taught by the way on vacation I owed everywhere nobody is talking about talking about and we said it when it happened we said wise you send it to the ... the only reason you're sort of the ideas because you suspect corruption why are there no leaks on this why is nothing coming out on the story at All right\nWhen ... and people have just to refresh you win rubber when President Trump said he was going to declassify ... the ... the application and other emails that were sent between the FBI and the department of justice was to Twenty one different pages but uh and then it came out well he\nUh uh we have some allies that don't want us to ah you know released it there it might be some sensitive information so we're going to send it to the inspector general\nTo look at it and expedite whatever that are meant for it yeah expedite a report out of and we still why would you give it to the I. G.\nI. G. S. nothing to do with whether you should release it oh corruption and how how to our allies know what would be how our allies know what's in it and what's not in it how could they object either way because they don't\nSo why are you studying the ige e because one region you're sending the I.

down I taught one oh six seven and [noise]\n\n\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nHouse and or the Senate\nClint ... can start again\nReally is that the those are the words of a leader is that somebody wants to matter again Hillary Clinton giving a series of interviews trying to steal the headlines before the midterms might have a good one\nThe New York post Michael why do you believe what you're hearing now is somebody who's preparing for for a rematch\nWhat Ryan just a clip you played as is one of many examples of\nI've been writing for months and often you know people say you're crazy but I've been writing for months that she wants to run and that each of these things as another little sign another little step into the arena\nAnd I think you're seeing more and more uh once the midterms turn she and her husband are going on this speaking tour for six months seven hundred bucks at the high end too yeah\nBut that's true but to me I think the main thing is she going to be out there the two of them are going to be out there\nThis is a way of keeping her name front and center at while all the other candidates scrambled to put together their teams instructor raise money she's going to be ahead of them again and I think she's been sitting here thinking who can beat me who among the Democrats can beat me uh in primaries and you think\nThat President Obama could step up and say step aside Hillary you're you're too old and you lost\nHe could but still who is the alternative I think that's the question and until somebody emerges\nShe is something of the default incumbent in that position of being the nominee I look at us Brian who can lead the party who couldn't unite them around them a message look how divided the Democrats are there may be twenty people running in twenty twenty\nOr justice President Trump or in sixteen had all of those are Republican opponents\nLittle by little he started with a small base a little by little\nHe gained traction he got his base up to twenty twenty five thirty thirty five as everybody dropped out he gained more and more I think you could see something like that with Hillary Clinton a war of attrition where she starts with the biggest base and grows it as they all drop out\nSo you know you do point out some things that I read the New York\nToo because when I did kill us answer about did your husband should your husband have resigned after his affair lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky so her answer was she was an adult must do terrible answer that is\nWhat is technically legal but that's but that's the Clintons they're never going to change I mean that is the things they never really change would you a\nChronically needs to push back on the left nuts on the right the right would be high fiving if she ran again here's Murray Harper worked for John Kerry said\nI think that she has become a distraction I had mentioned respect for many of the things she done in her life and her career but if her goal is to help the Democratic party immediate tore the comments particularly about me too and sexual assault\nIt's just not helping it is a distraction at a time what Nineteen days out from the terms were democratic candidates are looking to the future not the past and she is the path\nI think that's a that's a very good point that Maria ... but she's also talking about the midterms that she is a distraction to the midterms and I think that is all of those all of those women who wrote those articles that you cited two or three of them\nThey also basically are complaining that she is a distraction against the party's candidates in the midterms that'll be over soon enough then we'll turn to twenty twenty almost immediately the field will start to take shape\nAt that point she will not be a distraction she will be one of many people I think seeking it but she's going to do it in her own way look she may have health problems that surface\nAt some point I spoke to President Trump but my interview with him or two weeks ago he said he thought that she did not have the mental or physical stamina to do it um I don't know if she does or doesn't but I think she's getting ready to run I think she's gonna she's preparing herself she's positioning herself\nAnd I think she wants a we know Brian she wants it more than anybody\nThey they lost they showed great deference and they stepped aside they did something else she isn't capable of showing any class absolutely it's selfish might not really great point one meal [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] I talk to those points a TNT I find is going to teach me the station [noise]\nThen made the ... ah that that may politicians think the central and south Americans were more important than Mexicans\nAnd said two thousand eight law written by Dianne Feinstein that tree aid can it can Canada and Mexico different than it treated Central Americans because back in two thousand eight\nMost of our apprehension we're all Mexican now they're all predominantly\nCentral American it's a shocking that when you look at it at the hundred thousand family in at apprehended last year from El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras\nMerely Ninety nine percent of them remain in the country today so what that says it's all pretty much does four hundred thousand apprehension is we cannot repatriate down there once they enter put a towel in the United states we cannot just send them right back\nSo that's the reality ... your country is not the problem\n[noise] ... I I think you know listening to what you're just a a played\nMy comments would be the formal in just a few days circle Mexico into the United states coke convene a conference gearing Washington\nA including the ... northern cry uncle concrete subsided level on Buddhist and ... and ... was very clear about that meeting which Mexico and the U.S participate or work ... was that we need to work\nOr you know regionally on a two track approach one we most\nAre short of development is better\nIn those countries are so people are not forcing go immigration decision and that also LOL lost most of the year before that was the main conclusion Indian the only long term solution\nSchool as well as Mexico and Central American countries\nBut at the same time we cannot obviously um look the other way to the fact that a ... most the trail and absurd that as a ... in my view that see a probe that will change things I guess everything is going on is just a um you know ... it really a close up on us\nTo a step up the pace to find long term structural solutions to this phenomena and that is precisely what we're working for\nInvestors so you're saying if they want to stay in Mexico they can stay in Mexico but they just want to come here do you guys have laws and rules when it comes to refugee status or gas workers status or\nYes we do we do have both things we do have gas workers styles and we do have a a refugee status are ordering to our own immigration laws on the international law and in fact Brian about at least around a thousand people\nOr how to self yesterday had already requested\nRefugee status in Mexico and I was the intent\nA and we will continue to do so and that's why we call on the\nUh high at the office of the high commissioner of the United nations on refugees to help Mexico in this process so which transparent it's clear it respects human rights and he'll holes that role and it's an important challenge obvious but I think we will be able to handle it\nYeah I Know you don't want to comment but there's some message that we're giving to Central Americans in those try and go countries\nTo make them think now more than ever now over the last eight years more than ever did they feel as though they can come in and not to beat the system and can stay you heard that that that's an American\nExecutive American a federal government worker or the spokesperson for homeland security who said that Ninety nine percent of the people coming in or not Mexican\nQuick question about the wall when I look at what happened when I see the wall being effective in Israel when I see the well being effective in hungry or when I saw how effective the Berlin Wall was a because for the wrong reasons when the iron curtain dropped they controlled movement\nWe have seven million open jobs here nobody wants to shut down immigration we just want to control our borders why does Mexico take that personally\nI Would first of all Mexico understood in some respects the right over the United States I've I don't see any concrete to protect its borders centered and force of law and I want to make that very clear and where in fact have a very\nStrong corporation agenda with the chest and all the authority\nTo us we don't see eye to eye on everything and you know the United states has the right to protect its or it's that we don't question that if you ask 'cause we were you know your friendly neighborhood we would say perhaps that's not the best way to go and we have made that very clear\nAnd I think that's several analysts have pointed out to the fact that there are you know perhaps better ways to secure our border and we have a very comprehensive agenda with United States from that required\nUm so that's that's pretty much where we are we you know we are as as neighbors ... some friends who you know\nIt was on an issue we as I understand that but it is it's there's something about a wall that bothers you I mean there are communities that don't want fences with my community everybody's got a fence but you don't take it personal if we could control our borders it'll make your southern border more defensible\nBrian ... again we're not against any country and forcing and protecting its borders a and the fact that it was personal because uh you know white white Mexico in general does not appreciate\nThis position is ... is because it has been in some instances\nA couple with a narrative that is very offensive\nThey're liable to be a you know ... people in a big group that's all he is okay\nBut um if you do it generally stationed in that regard you will go on to offend all of Mexico and let me give you an example but you know being blunt about in previous administrations more than you know five hundred miles of fences were built\nYet but they were not coupled\nWith a narrative that was offensive to our country and that it's important so we go we have a good dialogue with the Trump Administration says yes we do have differences but we believe that through corporation and Valerie cuts off those differences as we just eat on the crater rim and that is precisely what we're going to continue to\nYeah a pride matters so I understand that um and hopefully people will get that point across but when you see how many jobs we had when you talk to farmers and that not only not seen all Mexicans are Central American should be working on a farm I'm not generalizing but a lot of them do\nAnd seven million jobs are open farmers are desperate for a guest worker program it seems like we just can't get out of the blocks and we're and we will have some simple problems\nI agree wholeheartedly with you I I think for example and we have had discussions with the U.S on the ... in that regard that for example the age to a B ... program which allows temporary work is on the ... to come to your\nShould probably be reviewed unabated in a way that it's more a it's more simple and more effective uh let me tell you something Mexicans don't have a cheap rent that event that\nYou know goes ... tells him go and you know break the law on entering the United states um if there are sufficient and simple legal avenues I think that people will choose those alive and\nThat's what I Hope and I understand I understand that this is a very sensitive on devices Easter political into the United states\nThe system including a ... you know discussions with Mexico will end up helping Indiana both contact our demographics are complimentary and as you just had I had sat down with the X factor people for you know over the last month and they feel that they need a lot of people in order to you have all the jobs\nIn the same happened with the uh for example um construction business\nSo these can be a window ... countries yeah and and we should work on it right the ship Brian\nAmbassador of the you know the story of our country you know when the Irish first came over they were building the railroads and when the Italians first came over they were they were working their way up but you know up the ladder it happens it through that's the history of America you have your own history as well but I got to just back I before I let you go and I know you're busy\nJust on this four thousand to seven thousand people that are coming towards a border do you did the Mexican authorities have one last stand before they get to Texas Arizona New Mexico or or California\nWhat I Will let you know Mexican authorities will make sure that everybody ... is complying with Mexican immigration law and that it's only a it through that way that they could come in\nAnd we will continue to follow this situation our staff does not to have anybody to break the law of the United states are much\nRight uh that means is really know where to stop him a mass or can't take enough I I look forward to the dialogue between the between the countries\nThat circling the benefit of the ...\nAnd ... when we come back your phone calls

good a general you got a brand new book out called leaders myth in reality do you believe we would have\nBeen having the civility problem if our leaders would set a better example\nNo I actually think we've got a crisis of leadership in America and I don't think it's limited to one side you could say maybe it's limited to leach however you want to do it but the reality we we do\nYeah and do you think it goes is that filters down to diners are where we see people yelling at other people that are restaurants\nI think it filters to every one think about it how you act at the dinner table

called leaders myth and reality and you went back in history to make sure you had it right and you had a confession earlier you didn't have everything right in your first two weeks to leadership books or you learn more\nWell we certainly didn't have some things right now I thought about leadership and so we went back to look at these Thirteen leaders in history and to see what about them we didn't really understand that so we did these pairs of genre we did geniuses in reformers founders\nPower brokers and we tried to look at Thirteen fairly diverse leadership experience just by people and see what it is leadership really is\nGoing to throw it was so mad at you please stylist who could Walt Disney what did we learn from Walt Disney struck down with cancer early probably would have been even bigger and greater but man his legacy lives on in his name has never been stronger what did he do\nWell it was extraordinary is a very talented animator in his early years she created this studio they created Mickey Mouse and really technological breakthroughs but then from Nineteen thirty ... thirty seven he drove his team to produce\nGage the company and mortgage the I. P. to Mickey Mouse to fund the picture when it was hugely successful\nFor years later we as a bitter strike for many of those same animators because the company had grown and got more corporate the structure and the bureaucracy had changed and suddenly the kind of leader he'd been at a smaller more family like company\nHe couldn't do here and he couldn't grow he couldn't adapt to that new reality show what really happened is brother Roy ran the corporate side of the Disney studios from then on\nWalt Disney focused on things like Disneyland so he was great in imagining things and focusing on his projects\nHis brother became great at running a big empire\nSo if Stanley McChrystal was looking at Walt Disney in his forties thirties and forties do you try to get more do you try to broaden out Walt Disney or you just try to get somebody with a skill set to match the problem\nWell that's great that's a great question I think the first thing you do is try to get Walt Disney to adapt but there's some people who can't or just are not interested in adapting and then what you've got to realize is he's not the right leader for the new reality of the Disney studios and then you bring somebody anyway\nA little bit like apple and recently was Steve Jobs see those bakery and insurgency at a company that he created when he came back he even said he was better suited for that job\nWell that gets ... so he grew the leader is all in context the followers and the situation determine the leaders effectiveness Margaret Thatcher\nShe was strong convictions believe very strongly and certainly conservative ideas and because she was so unwavering in that she became very very appealing to the British you went through the very difficult Nineteen seventies she became a very popular prime minister and then after about eleven years\nThe arc of her leadership she became more autocrat\nPolitically assassinated and that wasn't that she had lost that it was that the times had changed the context it changed her followers had gotten where were you ever style and they essentially pushed her aside\nI hate to boil everything down to sports but how many great coaches hit the ten

to me part cells seems to move on to a year before he has to cause he senses they heard my act before\nI think that's true plus there's always the danger that the leader starts to think they've got all the right answers they've had the success that here the press they start to believe there's really smart they lose their humility and I think that makes you less adaptable\nI Will never use my ...

principles and say what do we want our president to be how much integrity\nHow much forthrightness help how smart do we want and what kind of experience and I think if we did that if we had a

Arabia is coming closer to the slowest confession in international crime history as it becomes clear they killed and possibly caught up in American resident ... who was an outstanding journalist I just worry that Turkey's trying to gain through causing pain to Saudi and fracturing our relationship between Saudi in the United states of America\nThe numbers\nYou have some very very bad people in the caravan but I Will seal off the border before they come into this country I don't bring out our military every\nSingle person we sell countries that they are fun to her and by the president's vow to keep them from entering the U.S\n[noise] ah there you go out of the Caribbean coming closer and closer about seven thousand people from\nUh from Nicaragua from Honduras from Guatemala El Salvador all coming to our border demanding entry how did we get to this what's it going to take to reform or immigration laws and what does this house is going to impact the election\nNumber one where there isn't it different from past midterm says that there does not seem to be an appreciable fall off in the intensity and either party\nThat is true sixty days and counting to the most consequential midterms of our times what the GOP seems to have secured the Senate or the president's approval ratings hits an all time high because his numbers said the house from Democrat control possibility whereas it gone how do we get it back with me right now is one of the great minds of an election\nOr analysis and that is real ... up\nThat's that's what real clear is about is taking the average but this Wall Street journal poll I found I found really a really interesting number one that has the president's approval rating is forty seven percent basically higher than President Obama's at the time had that happen\n[noise] [laughter] that's a good question it was a like a six month or six point net gain for him over the last month and a look this this is a good trend for Republicans with just a couple of weeks left I mean I obviously as you said um you know we don't try and focus on\nToo much on any individual poll one poll but certainly this has good news for Republicans and the trumps getting more popular and he certainly you know if you look at it he's not getting more popular among Democrats they hated him from the beginning they still have them they don't give them any credit for anything so his games are really coming among Republicans and also independence and that's important\nIs that temporary or does the mayor from Tallahassee going to walk away with this\nWell they they had the debate last night um and you know they were both sort of\nGetting after each other it's it's gonna be interesting to see how this works out I mean we've had for example in in the Senate race though real quickly we had a poll come out yesterday a CNN poll showing a Bill Nelson up five we had a poll come out this morning showing Rick Scott up one and we got another poll coming out about a two and a half hours\nI'm so Scott Nelson's leading by about a point to half an hour average that the Senate race is really close um it was really close and I think Rick Scott given his name id his money how he's doing with hurricane relief all of that um he's hanging in there Gillum seems to be ... you know moving moving ahead of the census and so the question\nIs whether again it'll all come down to turn out if he's able to generate the same turn out in the south or the during the primary which was off the charts and he's got a good shot at becoming the first African American governor of Florida\nWho said that that would be great historic but a guy that's going to raise your taxes has an FBI investigation is done it by specifically done a terrible job in Tallahassee how the heck do you win that's a recipe for a loss\nHey look this is where this is where the the the Democratic base is this is the guy who is exciting\nHe's very charismatic he's run up during the campaign\nYou saw him last night um handling these attacks from the census mean he is a slew of the operator any any any he does do a good job of sort of couch and his message in a more centrist um you know more centrist language than than a lot of a lot of far left progressive is due and again he's\nHe's full on you know single payer health care abolish ice all that stuff\nAnd which you would not think would would play well in a state of Florida which is very much a purple state very much put down the middle but he's done a good job of packaging that as a way that seems to be palatable at least to end up voters right now where he's he's got a an advantage in this race\nSome just doesn't make sense there Tom Bevan fascinating will talk to you again Thanks Tom start crying I when we come

never rendition it didn't deserve the death but this has been made not similarly would bite Turkey's decision\n... yeah uh but I mean it's still fundamentally it's Saturday decision that turkey is making the most of it might have a heads up that it was happening so this Saudi foreign minister who is a long time about ... to the United states ... friends who\nAre very capable diplomat very capable ... guy very highly educated\nLimit wrote them and so I Want you to hear what he said here's were ... when I asked him what would you just said cut Nineteen\nAnd you're saying that the crown prince rama building so mom did not know about this\nWe individuals with assistance is outside the scope with her so he obviously was a tremendous mistake made with components the mistake was to try to cover up that is unacceptable because some of these things unfortunately and who wants to make sure that those who are the ones who are functionally was mature the\nProcedures in place for them to come up with a gun\nI mean I think that's a very reasonable assessments a ... a a a different matter of Abdel ... stature which would be enormous\nThis happened oil revenue is down by sixty seven percent it used to be over three hundred billion dollars annually now it's barely scraping by a hundred and ten billion dollars annually I gave you population Bulger's modem Seventy cars tend to under the age of thirty unemployment is up to twenty\nFive percent of men and double that if women they cannot afford this so I I I have\nActually I I understand from prince Mohammed bin ... mom rounded up the most powerful figures in the Saudi royal family I understand he did that I guess what\nWe would not making an outcry of not even when I was very good Saudi friends were involved people the whole shows in your employer twenty first century Fox or in Twitter orange city group we did not complain about the\nApprehension of prints all where he'd been too long but he said but to think that he would have conducted such a botched operation on a journalist if such relatively normal stature it's just in conceivable and I do agree\nThat seems to be a lot of bad decisions in his operation a lot of bad cover up a lot of bad exit this is not how extraordinary rendition or targeted assassination is commonly carried out but the key is I still almost as if if there's a lot of history and the United states\nTo try and an economic sanctions Saudi Arabia to pull back from the U.S Saudi relationship\nWe would be shooting ourselves in the foot and I can't help the United states\nAnd kingdom is walking into a trap laid albeit maybe by Saudi stupidity but we just don't want to get into that kind of crisis on some of the loudest calls economic sanctions have come from the very members of Congress and Senate who I'm most benefiting not only by Saudi\nFunded Washington lobbyists to invest in last year alone twenty seven million dollars into love being\nCampaigns and political action campaign but the same politicians who are now\nPolitical full that what happened to our country with a combination of that and I'm a contract and remember that this eh they entire lens of what's\nGoing on between the United states and Saudi Arabia in our political space here in America is always plays through the prism of President Trump and Jerry Christian and it's been a huge attempt to vilify President Trump and Jared Kushner even more and make this all about them and that is\nUnfair and inaccurate any other time in history we will be thrilled that we have an orthodox Jewish men on a\nSaudi Arabian Muslim print so closely allied that they're planning to economic future of of the region that would be a course his celebration so there's this tremendous political capital in making this work than it is\nSomething of a modern so he said we have never been cage behavior and we will never going to be this is a French and this was a mistake this is a criminal civil responsible for us we'll be punished\nThat to him or he says he never being involved in this we'll find out who it is and there'll be a fall guy out there but are there are other American politicians who believe\nThat nothing is done without the crown prince and he's shown these he's he's shown a ham had in this in the way is conducted some operations in Yemen the way he jailed the Lebanese leader or and even would happen at the Ritz Carlton so maybe ... ... ... what about people who say there is somewhat of a pattern wellbeing\nInto this truth in what you're saying that nobody nobody has centralized power in in a speaker of the Saudi royal the white crown prince Mohammed al ... has now\nHe's deputy prime minister chief of economic development fund is chief of the royal court and now he's also head of the private investment fund which was the solving wealth fund that that that they front loaded but they want us to really build in order\nFor like power in Saudi Arabia so this guy is beyond imagination and to have the power he find that most of his opposition I agree I agree with that\nToo and I still don't you're almost speaking out loud to you know so much about and so many objectives in which in everybody's personal interest you still have dumped you're almost thinking and her son to shout out loud so much of this you know senator you\nThought of it is number one the

looking at his field\nNow these knuckleheads so well during this operation thought that they would not be saying I Want it to him and nobody would do you know I could understand the logic and I could understand the crown prince not getting involved\nIn those ... and ... dark dark but he also brought a corner with them to carve the who does autopsy who's good to get me to call them up we saw yeah\nThis is absolutely first of all it's up to a troubling decorative all the tapes the Turkish security what's already been released I haven't listened to them but they've been described in a ... it's like a scene out of reservoir dogs I mean really terrible so this is struggling but again\nI don't know that that proves crown prince Mohammed said do that with the boats or dismiss him while he's alive and make sure that you create a global political incident while you're doing I just cannot believe that\nCrown prince ... bin ... is so powerful\nThat I think he could still be doing

writer yesterday and the rush into thinking\nWell hypocrisy look at the accusations of the nova choke or a fascination in London and dozens of\nRussian diplomats expelled why isn't that happening totally reckless we must have been his side of the fact that Saudi Arabia is our ally even though we do believe this journalist was terribly treated as human rights were violated international law was

day\nSeven eight nine nine with zero is our telephone number that's AAA seven eight nine nine with zero let's go to the phones miss the Tampa Bay Florida welcome to the program\nHe's Han Hi Missy hey how are you\nBusy I'm doing well so what do you think should be should the president's and the care of a ... some of the military down through a to fight back the caravan\nAbsolutely tied everything you said is one hundred percent spot on I mean two words sums up this invasion enemy in that and I mean they're burning burning the American flag cursing our president\nCarrying a flag of the country that Ito allegedly a presses and and they're fleeing violence they're not fleeing violence they're bringing the violence with them to America and the only way to deal with that threat is with absolute military force\nYou know I I miss the ... it's it's time it's I mean how many more people do we have to let into this country um before we finally say enough is enough\nExactly and I mean when you boil it down to you know one point two million American children will go to bed hungry tonight and thousands upon thousands of our military veterans are heroes\nThe sacrifice are sleeping on the streets tonight it's America first period go home and fight your old country make your own country better\nNumbers he this was an interesting thing you brought up here because one of the arguments coming from some conservatives which is a shocking is that uh that we're somehow responsible because we haven't been sending enough money to Honduras and Central America to help those people out I mean I think that's just a load of bologna\nOh my gosh absolutely I mean we're just where does the money going that that we do that and then which really should be absolutely zero\nBut there okay tree fell I mean that's that's just absolutely depressed and they say\nWell I Know that I probably will argue about it and it is busy and I and I know the president I'm a little while ago ... mentioned that he was going to be pulling funding from Honduras and Guatemala because they have not stopped the caravan\nSo we'll see we'll see how that how that goes and I think that's a terrific thing the president is doing Betsy thanks for the telephone call I mean look if\nIf if hunt deer is is not using the money correctly that were already sending them go ahead and yank the funding that's what I say and the same goes for Mexico or the president's a little disappointed because of the Mexican set assured him they had all this sudden lifted the body here\nRegardless I think the best call is where the president to go ahead dispatched the military and um we'll see what happens or let's go to Henrietta New York Josh welcome to the program\nTodd how are ya I'm well thank you I think\nA larger this caravan grows more justified from that and stopping it with our military [noise]\nYeah what was already a weekend there was a bit I mean it was started at four thousand and now we're we're hearing up or to\nTwo thousand four thousand seven thousand I mean how they get us going to be\nThat's a good question\nThat and um I work with uh I wouldn't say they're leftist but they're definitely\nLeft of right and this type of stuff scares them you know it's not just illegal immigrants it's maybe potential terrorism and and things like that you know it's it's not just about illegal immigration that's there's a whole whole\nSlew of things that can happen with this group of people and like you said it's mostly men I've seen picture that's\nWell Italy Japan for impoverished people they're very well dressed up I've noticed yeah yeah yeah\nIn the program David [noise] hey Todd thanks for taking my call sure though ...\nI agree with you completely agree with your other callers that we have the right to protect our borders certainly I agree in theory sending a military down I have no problem with that but I'm worried talk is right now I'm more concerned I'm most concerned with the mid term elections are very important election that I'm concerned with the optics yet it's mostly grown men coming over\nBut the military goes down there somebody with a camera will slap a picture of a lady with a child in a machine gun military lied to stand in front of a block and I'm from coming over the Democrats are really good at it and we need to be as good as them and take more long term we need this midterm election\nAnd the optics of that I think will hurt us I think the president was on track right rights will be getting what he said I just think he should call the Central American countries and Mexico and say that's it the gravy train is over until the caravan stop\nGetting it together get it in order to stop them from up here or he's ever going to see the other guy from us that would be better during this time [noise] All right David\nGood good thoughts good thoughts\nAppreciate your calling and we got to cut it short there for the news break though a

it for yourself it's unbelievable but this is what it sounded like [laughter]\nSo this dog this punk won at Maxine Waters goons starts screaming at Mitch McConnell and end McConnell's wife Elaine Chao start screaming back she's not having any of it you could actually hear her voice\nIn the ah the interactions are but you've got to watch the video it's I mean the video is unbelievable\nAnd so the guy steals Mitch McConnell's to go box he had they had the food at the ... the Olympics the tacos I don't know whatever but I don't know what he was eating but it was in the box and I'm sure they threw in some uh some you know fresh tortilla chips and some some some salsa\nThe guy steals it and literally throws Mitch McConnell's food out into the road\n[noise] now there are a couple of things that that that I Want to say here that kind of behavior is unacceptable\nI don't care if you are a Republican or a Democrat and yes I Know what happened to Nancy Pelosi I saw the video over the weekend\nAnd I don't know who those people are if they're if they if in fact those people are really conservatives who were cursing Nancy Pelosi and heckling Nancy Pelosi if in fact those people were conservatives shame on you\nBecause conservatives renal act like that civil not silent civil\nWhich that's not how conservatives act but you know what what happened in that restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky that's exactly exactly how the Democrats act that's how they behave that's their DNA that's their genetic makeup\nTo act like a bunch of black holes in public\nBut here's what really impressed me about this there were people in the restaurant that were standing up to these protesters and if you watch the video again Todd Stearns dot com you gotta watch this video ... and and you gotta watch it for this\nThe people at the table across from Mitch McConnell they were standing up for the McConnell's as a matter of fact there were two grown men looked like one of the guys I couldn't make it out for sure maybe you can ... not as good as as yours\nBut it looked like one of the guys wearing blue jeans and a camera that\nCame rushing over and put himself between the McConnell's and this unhinged lunatic the police were not cold no one was arrested I mean this go here's what concerns me though where was Mitch McConnell's security team where where are the guys with guns\nI mean this guy I mean I'm not kidding when you watch the video it's this guy was clearly not in control of himself\nI mean he was almost as bad as this guy [noise]\nI mean it was that intense and honestly all the guy could all the guy had to have done was just reached over and grab the the knife sitting there on the table or the fork and he could have really hurt somebody\nSo I'm Wondering why our elected leadership especially we're talking upper leadership why they were not protected where was the security team protecting Mitch McConnell\nThey regret what happened to look at was busy on a friday night and you know how it is that these restaurants that they can't you ... once they figured out what was happening they went over and tried to fix it but I don't think the restaurant is to blame here I mean it it ... it just happened\nAnd I get that the ... but you want to know who is to blame I'll tell you who's to blame\nBut she always says you know when they go low we all know how they go low\nWe to your body that cabinet\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about\nI Need you to go out and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors I wanted you to talk to them whether they're independent or whether they're Republican I Want you to argue with 'em and getting their face off in the face of from Congress people\nWe talked with these folks because they potentially have the best answers so I Know whose ass to kick\nWe're not going to let these people go through life on skates these people are being made uncomfortable and I think that's a life sentence frankly\nThey asked me what I like to debate this gentleman I should know I should have were in high school I take you behind the gym and beat the hell out of\nTime and great I Am outraged I have an awful lot about blowing up the White House\nIf we're going to keep the prize is the son of a bitches and give them and\nI got to be able to go to a restaurant and I got to be able to stop at a gas station they're not going to be able to shop at a department store that people are going to turn on them they're going to protest that got a absolutely I read them\nAnd apparently you can even go to Havana rumble\nLadies and gentlemen again this is what the Democrats are doing so conservatives you got to be careful if you're wearing a Trump pat you got to be careful watch your back I could probably should this though on this radio program we've got your back\nWe've got your back America triple light seven eight nine nine one zero our number that's AAA seven eight nine nine what zero\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou know I really don't hold the the poll polling at or pollsters for that matter in in high regard um ... you know I just I just don't believe the polls but but there are polls out there that said there is a doozy as a gap or the Democrats had the edge over Republicans\nWere I'm not hearing that from from the callers that we're getting from around the nation I I'm curious so what about in Florida are you seeing Republicans or conservatives conservatives motivated to get out and vote\nOnly are conservatism Republican motivated but you that the effect that Kavanaugh had on the electorate really has helped move the momentum for Republicans in my opinion the way that the Democrats handled themselves during that whole process\nUm there is in in this this is a true story so in my district I drive home everything on a road called through the road and there was a man on the girl who built a homemade sign about how atrocious he felt\nThat the Democrats treated Kavanaugh and uh it's all in the main highway as you're driving back and forth so for\nFor general citizens and I have no idea what party affiliation this guy is but for general citizens to feel obligated to go and make a homemade sign and posted on my side on the highway road to ... ... ... what they view\nEspecially in this district um at least what I assume you certainly see people on the Republican side excited and I think those people that came up voting for ... you know you talked about polling give you an idea so\nWe did a poll on my primary and it showed that I was about ten to Fifteen your head and I ended up winning by forty four points\nAnd there is no doubt that I was the most conservative candidate in that primary and so well in kind of gives you an idea but I don't when when these posters and these ... groups are calling people their polling likely voters yeah those are voted for the last three or four election not only people who just registered to vote two years ago to go and vote for President Trump\nAnd so I think you're missing a lot of that demographic when you see some of you know she would rider statewide old\nOne or the other things that I'm fairly impressed with you about the ... you may be the first person on this radio program who majored in beef cattle science\nYeah I I joke with some folks who I talk on the campaign trail that there's probably no other characters men that may be set aside so my background ... uh my background is in agriculture I grew up working on ... on Tuesday a which speaks very relative this district is is one of the largest agricultural districts\nAnd the entire nation definitely one of the largest in Florida as large cow calf operation senior\nThis this congressional district is the number one ... producing district in the entire nation so they gave me an idea of the size and the size of act in this district so I certainly think my background on cattle will help speak to represent those folks from that and say\nWell Greg I just want to say I wish you the very best to out there on the campaign trail and and honestly it sounds like a Florida could use someone like you up on Capitol Hill a rock solid conservative who's going to help drained the swamp\nBut I appreciate it and I look forward to serving\nAll right Greg stew meat ladies and gentlemen from\nTo be a shoo into when they're um but uh it he his race his his district one of the one of the key districts that the Republicans need to um need to claim if they're going to um to stay in control of\nOf Congress beef cattle sciences major I Wonder if I get a barbecue minor that would be that that would have been caught cool I guess so good guy though\nUm hey look at the uh Ben Stein is is weighing in on uh what's happening out there we remember when we had ... that was a long time ago he was on the program\nBen Stein though he's a speaking out on this attack that happened over the weekend at the Cuban restaurant there in uh in law\nDisgusting mob rule and teeth are is becoming like the brown church in the early days of the Nazi Party very very disgusting shocking behavior missed dining\nLee are you can also say that this is non violent protests I considered violence ago somebody always having me on taking me away from the way I consider that as opposed to violence as I Want to go see this may be democracy it out and it'll it'll even ... no no no no no no\nIn action is voting not violence as I said you'd be able to move away from the way these people are gangster say our mob gangs or not\nThe other horrible human beings horrible and by the way I just want to throw this out there for you imagine for just a moment if you were um let's say you're running for your for Congress to Mississippi\nAnd you are a Republican and you're at the local Cracker Barrel restaurant and you're about to sit down and you're about to eat biscuits and gravy and maybe a side order grits some hash browns and maybe some of their delicious\nAnd grabs your biscuits and commit just to throw your biscuits out into the streets [noise] now what do you think what do you think might have happened to that individual and the great state of Mississippi had that happen [noise] [laughter]\nI don't think I don't think they would have been as genteel as they were uh in the commonwealth of Kentucky there\nI'm just I'm not saying what would've happened I'm just saying I don't think it would have gone down without without a fight because you just don't touch people's best gets in the state of Mississippi that's just ... toward behavior you just don't do that [noise]\nUm [noise] wow have you heard about this story this is fascinating from Daily Caller dot com

I've gone on record bought off\nAnd saying I've got a bunch of millennials you in the building and we have a bunch of millennials that come on the show when through their debt free scream and so I've become a big\nOf millennials um because the millennials who get it get it at a completely different level than other generations how they get on fire for something there on fire for something\nOnce they attach themselves to a cause they will run through a brick wall and so the sharp millennials are the sharpest\nObscene and I don't know when the dog millennials are the dumbest humans obscene and I don't know when the most shiftless participation trophy living in your mother's basement group I've ever seen and the good news about millennials is they're really only two kinds fabulous and socks\nAnd there is a bunch of 'em that are fabulous\nAnd so I don't know why I decided to take up the cause of bragging on millennials I think it's because there's a group of people my age and in the media and in some of these stupid books magazines and stuff that say all kinds of negative things about them as if the entire generation is living in their mother's basement collecting participation\nSo you know I I guess that's why and so I just kind of ... and when I pick up one of these articles now I don't know why I get mad about it I don't like it and CNN Money is a become a ridiculous publication it's just a ridiculous publication the reason it's ridiculous publication is they will print anything\nI don't know if they have an editor or not that\nActually looks over this stuff and goes this bull crap we're not putting this on our publication because they will print anything one article will make a lot of sense and be very good and the next article you would think the guy's parents are cousins that wrote it I mean dumb human beings writing articles and published in the CNN Money\nAnd so I've seen everything and CNN Money so I'm you know occasionally I'll quote something out of their positive but this one just burn me up\nMillennials aren't opening credit cards and that's a mistake\nFrom CNN Money\nMillennials don't use credit cards like their parents or ... or their grandparents less than a third of millennials say they have a credit card well more than half the people age thirty to forty nine own one and nearly Seventy percent of people over sixty five do according to a bank right survey\nFinancial experts ... love were those who those people say the it's the fear of debt well\nYeah that makes sense you stupid people that explains why young people are shying away from credit\nThe fear of debt is like I don't want to go in debt 'cause they don't think that's good yeah that would be a good reason not to go in debt and that's really where where you needed a financial expert to figure that out did you okay I'm Glad you found one to quote their vague we have no idea what the drugs were millennials had been stigmatized by dad explains Douglas\nBone ... president of bona fide wealth in New York\nAnd co author of the millennial money fix\nWendy is in Alabama I'm forty six years old and married but we do not have any children\nSixty the probability of staying in a nursing home prior to age sixty is less than one percent so much less than one percent of the approaches zero\nBut once you're sixty it goes up every single minute [laughter] it's very weird so I highly recommend long term care insurance for nursing home insurance for in home care insurance once you're sixty because Seventy five percent of your ladies will outlive your husband's so the typical scenario is\nThat papa goes in the nursing home\nFifty Seventy five thousand bucks a year corrections scrambles the three hundred thousand dollar nest egg dies leaves mama broke\nThat's a normal scenario had a decent retirement going into the scenario [noise]\nLittle bit of a nest egg there but it's all gone in nursing homes are not evil they're just have to be paid to operate the people that work there actually want to feed their kids so they need money called payroll\nSo they're not evil and they're not ripping people off at home mom wanted to go to New Jersey whom slug saying I Want my money to go to a restaurant even though I eat there\nWell that's dumb don't eat there then okay so but if you're going to need in home care or care in a nursing home you need to pay for it and long term care insurance is absolutely a vital part of financial planning but not until you're sixty when you have kids or not\nJ. D. is with us in Sacramento, California Hi J. D. how are you\nHi Dave I'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up in your world\nThanks for taking my call and I'm calling with a question about mortgages my um my wife and I are debt free and we've got baby step three eight I'm working on three B. and we just went through at the you know we coordinated it\nThank you and yeah and my ...\nIn there and says ten percent [noise] but I hear you on your show the twenty percent prefer a hundred percent but if we can't get there then\nReally really good question well like you said obviously a hundred percent down is our favorite mortgage okay not one All right ah the in when somebody's buying a second home\nI pretty much slap my fist on the table and so I don't buy a house unless you can put down twenty percent on your second because you've got the equity coming out of the first one\nRight in a normal scenario on a first home it's okay to whatever you can put down and get into the house okay here's the reason twenty percent is advantageous\nIf you put twenty percent down and you have what's called an eighty percent loan than or eighty percent loan to value ratio that allows you with a standard Fannie Mae conventional loan or for that matter with an F. ha loan to have no P. M. I. P. M. I. bans for private mortgage insurance\nWhich basically is insurance that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on you and lose money on the foreclosure\nThose rules for it so it hasn't zero benefit to you under any circumstance it's only because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio you see what I'm saying okay and ... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus\nA month per one hundred thousand borrowed\nSo you're in a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage he got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone\nIf you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we push people towards twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference versus ten percent\nAnd so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payments no more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down and you get you know my on your first time that's not the end of the world and you can get rid of the ... when you pay the loans down to eighty percent of value by buying an appraisal that the more get from an appraiser that the mortgage company ...\nIn fact in California where home prices are no fairly high compared to this country make any difference\nYou know it doesn't make any difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just 'cause you're in California they don't like okay you're on your map doesn't count\nYou know we don't do that so you still gotta use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're at the higher the ... market you're in the more difficult this discussion because I wanted to get all the way down to ... percent I'm not requiring twenty percent but you get you get J. D. how it's much to your advantage\nTo not have that stay that way I Am I\nYeah I mean because you are talking about three or four hundred thousand dollar loan I mean we're talking about some money per month to going out the window for insurance that's worth absolutely zero to you\nRight so that's what I'm trying to avoid here but it's not but so if you buy and you don't put down twenty percent than keep counting on that mortgage keep working your baby steps four five six simultaneous get that mortgage pay down and get that loan reset\nWith an appraiser plant that's approved and then get that PMS drop so you're not doing enough for Twenty years\n'cause it just sucks it's just a horrible you know it's just but it's part of the race and it's a it's a logical reason that they require it\nBut it's just super expensive\nAnd it just as bad so you want to get out of it as soon as you can because then you get to the business are really paying on your mortgage and not just wasted money but yeah I I you know we don't beat up on a first time homebuyer you're doing baby step three B. for not putting down twenty percent\nUh the goal always is to become a hundred percent that free as fast as we can and not waste any money we don't have to waste that's what we that's the goal we all have well those of us that are in tune with\nBeing smart anyway\nNick is with us in Chattanooga Hi Nick welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave it's good to talk to you you too man what's up [noise] okay so I'm twenty five\nMy ... healers cars have a car it's a a a two thousand nine Chrysler three hundred bucks to ask thirty eight model what the big game in it and it's a hot yes I paid well below Kelley Blue book value and I have\nAbout five to six thousand dollars worth of equity in the car mhm and up and listen to you and going through your baby steps if you want to be tough for me but I think I Need to sell the car I Know you're going to tell me to sell the car and use the money to finish my merger seats on what is your and without her car and worth\nA private market is twenty three to ...

take home now annually at sixty two thousand\nFour hundred ... if I continue going to school to get my ... nurse practitioner degree which isn't to hear programs um twenty sixteen thousand five hundred that Trump won four thousand dollars mhm I'm and\nI'm just I'm a little worried if I'm just trying to get on the advice if I should go into it or if I should wait\nAnd then I said are you single I'm separated shuttering and how old are you yeah I I just turned thirty okay and you're forty thousand dollars and no you know I'm sure I'm I'm a I'm a hundred\nAnd fifty five thousand dollars

all\nSeven or your family in the area I currently live with my life okay All right\nWell I think that the the great news is is that as a nurse there is the opportunity of mountains and on if you're going to go back to school you would pay cash for it as you go would be the only way you would do that and I would wait on ... at least a year\nI'd like for you to get well on your way to getting out

putting money away and trying to help and figure out what to do with all his actress\nOkay well I think you teach them how to do a budget and that's where every dollar has a name before the month begins right yeah it sounds like it's a fairly primitive easy budget\nYeah there's not much that there are and he'll like Thirteen hundred dollars only ...\nKnow and let's get the car paid off and build up an emergency fund and go that route I'm that'll make sense but but um\nYou know we're teaching these basic things that you and I both know about apparently you been doing the stuff that we talk about for a while and yeah we're going we're going to be on a budget we're going to avoid that we're going to build up an emergency savings and begin long term investing\nA reading we're going to be generous with some of the money and uh so the whole thing that you get when you've got someone that's living in a fairly primitive situation like this meeting no bank account\nYou know he's a young young guy getting started is that uh it's ...\nIntentional with every dollar\nOkay how many um ... she said yes we start out with\nUm I well I get a bank account going like you're talking about on a debit card for that and then you know I I think you just lay it out and say okay where do you want to be in five years and what other steps that are going to get you there and so you know how much are you going to spend on entertainment\nHow much are you going to spend on what's your take to keep your car running gas wise and your insurance and your car payment and then don't you take this income and give every dollar a name ride down the page I mean this is a one page budget you can do in about eight minutes you know\nYeah there's not there's not a lot to this deal is not like it's complicated\nOkay yeah we got some apple or set up for like I'm I'm ... and the ... like a car like emergency fondness for you or your car stuff yeah I mean these things we do have famous quantum by ten percent of marine home by we put in ...\nOkay well no I I Would I I Would work the baby steps I mean I'm ... cows in dollars aside as ... and then after that I got his car paid off\nAnd then after that I have a fully funded emergency fond of three to six months of expenses\nIn his case he be rich if he had no debt and five ... five grand and savings Whitney yeah it'd be really well off so ... and ... and then I then I Would start is investing long term start talking about a Roth IRA and\nThose kinds of things and even start talking about maybe some additional saving so he can have his own

how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I have a question about and inherited [laughter] my husband and I are small business owners and we have a significant amount of debt with a business and our personnel which I don't watch the to the dentist\nTents that we um [noise] my husband had to hope that we could use for the kids' college I have one daughter that's in her freshman year of college now and another one that will be starting next fall and then two other teenagers and a baby so I'm\nSo this business of making money it's struggling it it makes many now but we still have a good bit of debt from how much profit\nUm profit uh\nGosh probably\nWell I have to say probably it doesn't make enough to support us over the past few years but um\nHow long are you going to live in this mythology\n[laughter] um I don't know we every time he has said okay I Need to go find a job some there it's like that door closes and the business door stays open and I'm\nA business doors not open it's not making enough to support your family\nAnd so we need to sit down on this business and give it a deadline than in the next six months it's going to start supporting our family after all these years and making it up to start getting rid of some of his death or we're going to close it I get a job\nBecause I don't think you're making any money\nUm am I wrong [noise] well\nI mean we pay ourselves from the business and when I was bringing home about a hundred thousand a year\nBringing out you're you're taking a hundred thousand dollars out of business yep well that'd be called profit okay you can't live on a hundred thousand dollars well we can we have a lot of how much does have you done with\nThe business has got fit about fifty two K. and we personally have about um Ninety six K\n[laughter] were you in the business doesn't have any ... personally for it okay\nAnd that and you make a hundred thousand dollars a year is that all you makes a hundred thousand or the that's what you're pulling out and then you make a profit to\nNow that's all we make that's what I mean we are happening all\nIncome when you do your taxes is a ...\nIt has banned at Laramie like an account okay Jeff something there that we're taking it can be show a profit and that doesn't change it right now that how much we're ... we're paying ourselves from the business okay a year so you need to find out what the profit she don't know what I mean\nYou get back you give me three different answers you so you need to find out if you make if your business is making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you guys can't live on her does when I was here you got other problems\nRight now to ...\nAnd you can pay off that making a hundred thousand dollars a year and work your way through it and know the twenty nine thousand dollars is not need to go the kids' college fund it needs to go to clean up his dad gummed ... what might\nOkay but I don't ... the only way that makes sense is if you have a system in a plan where you actually know if the business is making a profit and if it is making a profit what the property is and it's all coming home to pay off these debts\nMhm or if you want to pay off the fifty two thousand at the business and call that business that I don't care but we need to be reducing debt\nRight quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars you you ought to be will do that but you guys aren't living on a plan to businesses not on a plan and your personal lives on a plan I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I Know and we just got ... in the mail today and where to start it [laughter] [laughter]\nThat's a good start and and I'm going to send you a copy of the book entree leadership on the business side so uh because here's the thing you need to be going no no I'm not going to quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business you know I'm not going to quit that but what we are saying then is is that we need to fine tune in give I think you're good at making ...\nBudget shut the business and so we know exactly where every dollar at the business is going and exactly where it's coming from and then exactly what's coming home and what is taxable income and then lay out a game plan to pay off a hundred and forty two thousand dollars worth of that\nBetween these two different sets of that and work your way through it you can do both and use the twenty nine thousand towards that go if you don't do that and you throw the twenty nine thousand that the goal and then you never pay off the debt it was kind of wasted wasn't it so I'm not asking you to blindly throw it at the ... the ... and throwing\nA system at your business in the system\nIn detail budget at your home and all of that applied directly on this problem solved the problem goes away\nAnd this went on thousand is part of the solution to that but the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the

took it took my blinders off and realize that a lot of people are OK with with being in debt and taking on that and I'm like\nWhy you know like when we got to the store and get it in the beginning but

four hundred thousand and four ones and Ross\nOkay good and uh what do you owe on the land and home\nA five hundred and twenty\nAll right well the income produced off of six hundred and fifty thousand dollars less just use it that's the two fifty and the four hundred you got those two numbers mhm if those two were invested in just rent round numbers just to make this easy if it was ten percent that'd be sixty five thousand dollars a year\nShe doesn't get to keep the land in the house in that scenario does she\nKnow camp for service for half a million dollar bet was sixty five thousand our income and raise kids right okay so you're under insured if your goal was for her to stay in that property upon you\nTwo hundred thousand dollar house has five hundred in her hand plus has two fifty plus has four hundred now she's got over a million dollar she's got paid for two hundred thousand dollar house and she can live on a hundred thousand dollars a year then coming off of a million one\nThat makes sense so if that's your plan you're okay but if you want her to stay on that property and continue to live there you don't have enough insurance do you see how I'm doing that\nYes there are there okay so what's the goal which one\n\nWould you want her to stay on the land I Want her to stay on the land where she wants to stay on the land but I Would rather she wouldn't be as

that's AAA cyber by two to five [noise]\nJason's with us in Detroit Michigan Jason welcome to the day Ramsey show\n[noise] [noise] Hi Dave how are you doing today better than I deserve what's up\nUh we'll just wanted to give you a little back story my uh my wife and I just moved from Illinois to Michigan a kind of be closer to all her family up here so uh you know feel a place for that kind of getting used to everything\nBut uh uh I'm currently unemployed I was just like go up in the past couple of months and I'm looking for a job now I I'm an accountant and my wife is a teacher she teaches special education I'm so she currently has a job um my question is we are living with her parents um for the time being until probably maybe next summer so until we can buy or on house\nUm we've got about eleven thousand dollars of student debt left between both of us and we've got about that that much in our bank account right now I'm I wasn't sure obviously once they find a job if the best strategy would be to try to\nKnock that debt out as soon as possible and then from there start to save for a house or what my wife kind of wants to do is just put everything we can toward a down payment to try to you know\nHas some sort of a decent downpayment either way I just didn't know how you would feel about that\nOkay I don't recommend that people buy a home when they're broke\nBecause it'll make you broke her that's why they call a mortgage brokers home is not a blessing when you're broke its curse and when you have debt and do not have an emergency fund you're broke\nBy definition so um my advice to folks has always been and it's not real popular advice and your wife's not gonna like it so you all may not do it but my my strong advice to you is to pay off the debt\nAnd save an emergency fund have three to six months of expenses above that save your down payment and then by you know when you buy a home and when you move in the house and there's ten thousand dollar still in your emergency fund after you move in and you have no payments but the house payment that houses a blessing\nWhen you buy a home where he got eleven thousand dollars in debt and you have no money left in your savings account 'cause you cleaned it out trying to beat pie in mind you move in a house broken and that Murphy will move in your spare bedroom and bring his cousins Sallie Mae and they will set up housekeeping and broke desperate stupid in your house will start looking like a country song\nUh that's what happens in the house is not a blessing it's a curse when you bought as broke so you guys need to slow down\nAnd do this right because you've been through some hard times here dude I mean you've been on and be a way I had to move to a different city you're living with your inlaws for God's sakes has an ... right\nYeah the I I actually moved up here in January and I had a I had to start living with them for a few months before my life become 'cause she had to teach until April you know on and then she she gave birth to her third daughter all in may so so that we kind of had a lot of ... going on right now\nIn what is going to face amount of this policy eighty thousand eighty thousand dollars and how much money do you all have\nHow much money that we have from\nYou how much you and your for one k.'s and you're now you're always\nWait we did have retirement account how much they pay total eighty four thousand ...\nUm\nWe have a ten thousand dollar emergency find we are dead prey or have to pay for good so it's kind of like so\nYou don't have that much is cash value is in this\nHow about you know six thousand okay so and you have a pension plans as well ... yeah okay\nAnd so you're living on Social Security and eighty thousand dollars worth of for my husband\nStill works his yeah he um had thirty six thousand and income ... any advice and Twenty one thousand in Social Security okay and that at all I I don't what\nGot you in the face of amount of this policy you said was eighty thousand dollars\nYeah\nWe did look into term insurance for him but number one it's really a lot like I said I get paid but number two he has battled cancer a couple of times yeah non Hodgkin's lymphoma and so basically you know but it was like yeah very difficult\nDifficult but we don't know we we can lower the death benefits\nSo what is the premium how much is that a year if you haven't got a much Seventy seven a month yeah OK\nSo eight hundred a year and you make thirty six thousand dollars a year\n\nUm\nWell here's here's the equation here's the way it works in your mind okay what's the purpose of this is to give you an extra eighty thousand dollars if he dies before you do okay and so is that war is eight hundred bucks at this stage it's there is no investment value whatsoever so we're not\nAnd the show to double it basically if he were to die would be very helpful mhm and so keeping the insurance sounds really good with that in mind\nYeah they they told us that would only last another three or four years anyway and they sent me want to make it\nOkay and they're going to make you stop anyway they're going to pull the plug oh yeah oh yeah okay and at that point you catch it out and whatever cash value is in there on\nThe ... and [laughter] my husband would like to get it out now\nYeah we're way to get it out no way to get out now as close a policy down\nRight which I mean like it at\n... which means that you would you know if he passes away you'd have the four oh one K. money paid for how somebody living on Social Security right yeah what'd you probably can make it 'cause I gotta feeling you guys were frugal people oh yeah and so you probably could make it on that but it's not going to be a dream come true um\n[noise] so they have given you notice that at I'm\nSixty two are are I'm sure I Seventy three or whatever Seventy years old they are going to shut the policy down regardless\nYeah well I Know I guess if we can pay enough that it would be over two hundred a month\nYeah I think we could have gone back okay right or we we could lower that that's an affair and keep it going they felt that we could do that which is what I wanted to go I went to the cash it out of them were doing nothing\nYeah there there's not a great answer okay and I swam him and hauling a little bit I'm trying to think through it [noise] um uh my tendency is at eight hundred bucks a year right now to keep it for a while mhm okay I'm Seventy seven dollars a month\nEven if you use the cash value you can have the cash value is beginning to pay the premium\n... and ...\nThe eight thousand dollars pay the premiums starting today and I'm probably going to leave it in place a couple of years when it starts being two hundred a month instead of Seventy seven months at that point I'm probably going to join his tribe and say let's cash it out\nAnd close it down\nBut I don't think it's going to make sense to keep this long for a long long time we're probably gonna keep a couple more years houses health\nLike that I was his health how um the first time I went to fade cancer free for five years and that kind of cancer free for two years good\nSo I mean it goes in and get a ... and every every six months or so to make sure it's not coming back of a lot of\nGood good I'm Glad to hear that ... ... ... ... I'm gonna I'm gonna let the a cash value pay the premiums for the next two years and keep it open if a ... and I'm going to check on his health at that time let's say that he's got another episode with cancer going of that time then you pay the premium no matter what it costs\nAnd you keep it open and if he if he's being if the cancers come back at any stage right to keep you keep putting open at that point but if he's doing really really good and everything's clean and two years from now you haven't seen a spot nothing's no problems anywhere I'm I'm probably drop and at that point\nOkay that makes sense to\nMe it wouldn't it wouldn't be insured so\nYeah you know but I'm not you but but you're also not paying you know three thousand two thousand dollars a year which is what is going to be at that point yeah which is starting to be ridiculous with that kind of money you could throw money into a investments and start having some money\nAnd um but but at this stage I I I'm I'm hesitant to cancel it it's it's obviously a bad policy so I'll be in a bad thing but it's your only option you're stuck with me now that makes it hard to discuss it hard to think about but I'm On a whole\nOtherwise I'm going to keep it if ... if you got a health issue at that time so good question thank you for calling in and I'm Sorry you had this problem folks you hear me yell and scream about cash value life insurance whole life life insurance universal lot verbalize rip off you just\nExperienced it usually comparing it to the\nBack end what happens if you buy one of those pieces of crap policy and you're sixty eight years old this is what happens because the money they put into that stupid but policy will be three hundred grand right now in mutual funds if they'd put it into the into good investments that are getting ripped off by this insurance company and\nIf she was sitting there were three hundred grand plus the other four O. one K. and I'd have about four hundred thousand bucks plus their house is paid for she wouldn't even called me\nBut instead guess who's fat sassy instead of\nHer insurance company\nSo when your whole life agent says I don't really agree with Dave Ramsey because your whole life I just trying to rip you off\nThat's why your whole life agency and that and there's only two kinds of whole life agents ignorant and crooked does if you understand these numbers and that story right there and then you still sell this stuff that makes you crooked\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself and if you don't understand these numbers and you're still showing that stuff that makes you ignorant\nAnd you shouldn't be selling this stuff and by the way folks in case you didn't know you'll get screwed up way more often by an enthusiast enthusiastic ignoramus than you will by a con artist so most people out there selling this\nAre enthusiastic ignoramus as they're not actual con artist mogul Charlie so with Israelis and enthusiastic ignoramus\nThat's all uncle Charlie we just nailed him right there\nDoes he probably not a crook if he'd actually sat down and looked and realize that share your\nYou know she's good at three hundred grand and mutual funds easy for them what they dumped into this\nProduct\nAlive life insurance the payday lender or the middle class aggravates me this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nHey folks just talk about finding a ride home for your family the amount of new homes built continues to trend upward year after year\nWhile this can be a great option it's not that simple you're just not picking up paint colors in an open floor plan there are many potential pitfalls you could run into is the process is not approached with expertise in caution\nThe builder has an agent representing their best interest not necessarily yours\nThis is why it's crucial to have a real estate professional guiding you through the process who's on your team\nOur endorsed local providers are in the top ten percent of agents in their area who know how to spot a quality builder our EL peas can help you navigate decisions wisely and get the most bang for your buck they have the heart of a teacher so you never feel lost in the process\nDon't take a risk on your biggest investment get an agent who looks out for you visit Dave Ramsey dot com slash E.

done I Love it\nSarah is with us in Ann Arbor Michigan ... how are you\nI'm great things for taking my call they sure what's up so I have a question about\nUm some of the movement tree the final parts of the baby steps we currently are added that um\n[noise] we are a we have our emergency fund that's fully funded we're currently cash flowing to kids in college and um so it's about retirement versus our house pay off we currently oh about I'm Seventy eight thousand dollars on our home\nGood and what's your household income uh just under two hundred thousand a year from them and how much is college on our kids are about forty\nDollars a year right now for the two of them no good health so doing all of that so my question as they currently have about seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars and our retirement accounts my husband's company doesn't match so we do Fifteen Percent not a problem mhm\nMy company I'm very blessed with 'em I invest five percent may give me ten mhm [noise] so that's the fifteenth so my question is is do I find a different way to invest that other Fifteen Percent or the other ten percent to make mine a Fifteen or do we\nIt's four thousand dollars a year and doing matter\nWhen you're either how they share it you know your act like that makes a dent in your mortgage it doesn't\nMake much better and retirement account you know\nSo I I Want you to put a baby step for Fifteen Percent of your household income you put Fifteen Percent of your household income in retirement it doesn't sound to me like you're doing that right now\nNo I haven't been really hot and then you know I think it's a little crying as I put my height and they kind of an amazing match you\nKnow wonderful match a love the Mac we're not going to lose the match we're going to do ten percent somewhere else like you said in Roth IRAs or you can do it during the four oh one gave you got good options if it's raw four one K. particularly I Would do that but I I I Will be putting Fifteen Percent of my income away in return to the point is you're going to pay off this house\nAnyway right at\nReally the exact same speed\nFour thousand dollars isn't what's going to get Seventy eight thousand dollars paid off\nWhat's going to get Seventy eight thousand dollars paid off when you got to concentrate on that when you a little bit of a bonus a tiny little inheritance or you just squeeze some money out of your budget but it does three hundred dollar deal here is not\nThat that doesn't move the needle towards getting house paid off the house is going to get paid off 'cause you buys you guys have been concentrating and focusing in probably what's going to happen is when the kids would get the kids off to roll you probably just going to finish up the house in that year a cause that forty you'll be down to about forty by then and then that year you'll just knock it out so\nUm you're fine you're doing really good you know obviously\nI mean you're doing really really good overall but I'm going to do ten percent you buddy\nSix is everything else we can find reasonably within the budget\nOne question I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen

millennials in the building and we have a bunch of millennials that come on the show when they're that free screen and so I've become a big fan\nCompletely different level than other generations have they get on fire for something there on fire for something\nOnce they attach themselves to a cause they will run through a brick wall and so the sharp millennials are the sharpest I've seen and I don't know when the dome millennials are the dumbest humans obscene and I don't know when the most shiftless participation trophy living in your mother's basement group I've ever seen\nAnd the good news about millennials as they're really only two kinds fabulous and sucks\nAnd there is a bunch of 'em that are fabulous\nAnd so I don't know why I decided to take up the cause of bragging on millennials I think it's because there's a group of people my age and in the media and in some of these stupid but magazines and stuff that say all kinds of negative things about them as if the entire generation is living in their mother's basement collecting participation trophy is it's just not true\nThere's a group of them that are but there is a group of them that are freaking rock stars too and so you know I I guess that's why and so I just kind of you and when I pick up one of these articles now I don't know why I get mad about it I don't like it\nAnd CNN Money is a become a ridiculous publication it's just a ridiculous publication the reason it's ridiculous publication is they will print anything\nI don't know if they have an editor or not that actually looks over this stuff and goes this is bull crap we're not putting this in our publication\nBecause they will print anything one article will make a lot of sense and be very good and the next article you would think the guy's parents are cousins that wrote it I mean dumb human beings writing articles in published in CNN Money\nAnd so I've seen everything and CNN Money so I you know occasionally I'll quote something out of their positive but this one just burned me up\nMillennials aren't opening credit cards and that's a mistake\nIt's less than a third of millennials say they have a credit card well more than half the people age thirty to forty nine own one and nearly Seventy percent of people over sixty five do according to a bank right survey\nFinancial experts always love where those who are those people say the it's the fear of debt well yeah that makes sense you stupid people that explains why young people are shying away from credit\nThe fear of debt is like I don't want to go in debt because they don't think that's good yeah that would be a good reason not to go in debt and that's really where where you needed a financial expert to figure that out did you okay I'm Glad you found one to quote their vague we have no idea who the drugs wary of millennials had been stigmatized by dad explains Douglas\nBone ... president of bona fide wealth in New York\nAnd co author of the millennial money fix\nWendy is in Alabama I'm forty six years old and married but we do not have any children should we get long term care at fifty cents we don't have any kids to help us or wait until sixty wait until sixty\nThe probability of staying in a nursing home prior to age sixty is less than one percent so much less than one percent it approaches zero\nBut once you're sixty it goes up every single minute [laughter] it's very weird show I highly recommend long term care insurance for nursing home insurance for in home care insurance once you're sixty because Seventy five percent of the ladies will outlive your husband's so the typical scenario is\nThat papa goes in the nursing home\nFifty Seventy five thousand bucks a year corrections scrambles a three hundred thousand dollar nest egg ... mama broke\nThat's a normal scenario at a decent retirement going into the scenario little bit of a nest egg there but it's all gone in nursing homes are not evil they're just have to be paid to operate the people that work there actually want to feed their kids\nGo to New Jersey who slug saying I Want my money to go to a restaurant even though I eat there\nWell that's dumb don't eat there then okay so but if you're going to need in home care or care in a nursing home you need to pay for it and long term care insurance is absolutely a vital part of financial planning but not until you're sixty when you have kids or not\nJ. D. is with us in Sacramento, California Hi J. D. how're you\nHi Dave I'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up in your world\nThanks for taking my call and I'm calling with a question about mortgages my um my wife and I are debt free and we've got baby at three eight I'm\nWorking on three B. and we just went through at the you know we coordinated it\nThank you and yeah and my ... ...\nWe in there and said ten percent but I hear you on your show the twenty percent you'd prefer a hundred percent but if we can't get there than them one of those too so I'm just wondering what what makes the difference between ten and twenty percent\nA good really really good question well like you said obviously a hundred percent down is our favorite mortgage okay not one All right uh uh the in when somebody's buying a second home\nI pretty much slap my fist on the table and so I don't buy a house unless you're gonna put down twenty percent on your second um 'cause you got the equity coming out of the first of all\nRight in a normal scenario on a first home it's okay to whatever you can put down and get into the house okay here's the reason twenty percent is advantageous\nIf you put twenty percent down you have what's called an eighty percent loan that are eighty percent loan to value ratio that allows you where the standard Fannie Mae conventional loan or for that matter with an F. ha loan to have no P. M. I. P. M. I. fans for private mortgage insurance\nWhich basically is insurance that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on you and lose money\nOnly because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio you see what I'm saying\nOkay ... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus a month per one hundred thousand borrowed\nSo you were a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage you got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone\nIf you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we push people towards twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference versus ten percent\nAnd so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payments no more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down you get ... on your first time that's not the end of the world and you can get rid of the ... when you pay the loans down to eighty percent of value by buying an appraisal\nThat the mortgage from an appraiser that the mortgage company approves of and then they will drop the PM I later after you get it pay down\nThe fact that we're in fact in California where home prices are no fairly high compared to this country make any difference\nKnow it doesn't make any difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just 'cause you're in California they don't like okay I'll only a map doesn't count you know we don't do that so you still gotta use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're at the higher the ... market you're in\nThe more difficult this discussion because when you get all the way down to ... percent I'm not requiring twenty percent but you get you get J.

else you're now worth hundreds of millions of dollars\nAnd everybody who's got a wacky idea a crazy idea or who's been there with you feel that you should invest and or do you owe them something so a lot of times what happens is\nPeople actually change far more than the winners do and it happens in everything look at sports look at people who've become famous\n... when it comes in the entertainment world they'll tell you\nThat it's a lot of times the people around you that change and then they're mad because you don't give in to whatever it is that they want\nSo you had to be
