the twenty first century it was called somebody's ethnic ideology as the or as a a cancerous tumor\nAnd no government around the world called Islam as a mental disease\nAnd also the Chinese government are\nHaving trouble to understand that their way of life to hunt Chinese people live their culture the language they called ah the truck sprints in life\nOftentimes the Chinese government um ... tried to tell the world that this was all about security social stability but you don't walk up forty eight a well known academics\nSoccer player religious figures\nBusiness leaders flying through a pest musicians are under the claim that you're fighting against separate there's almost three evil forces it does you know it makes no sense at all\nSo the Chinese government said this was about security but what'd you carefully examine their policies there'd be have years uh it it clearly suggest\nThat this is all about Xi Jinping is all about Communist Party this is all about China's a struggle to dominate the world and this is all about imposing Chinese language Chinese culture by force if you don't accept\nWill take you out and in addition to what we have been covered some heartbreaking heart wrenching stories have been told recently a scholar based in Seattle wrote a if a published and as long as the ... investigative report on foreign policy in China file\nThat basically suggests that

they just like\nI Wonder if I Want a garden on one cording to enter here Gordon is is this story challenge used to challenge Xi Jinping routinely\nWell no unfortunately not inside China that's just not possible but outside China yes of course it is because this is a crime against humanity and something's got to be done about it the officials who are responsible for this need to be sanctioned and that includes siege and pick themself\nSo when ... Xi Jinping or his lieutenant show up at international bodies to talk about global warming or some other utopian version of their reality\nThey they can be challenged by a the United states and its

and\nEverybody knows this Monica the puzzle is\nThe paychecks are stronger the job opportunities you can leave your job and get a better job does that get to the polls you think it does so why but these political scientists are telling us it's not it's a non starter because the Democrats so villain I Donald Trump people are going to forget why their money in their pocket\nYeah I I think that analysis is incorrect that people are saying you know are so angry I mean certainly there is a segment of the population that is I agree a trumpet hate his guts and are motivated to vote for Democrats simply out of that [noise]\nI also wish that the Republicans made economic messaging more front and center\nGoing into next Tuesday they haven't made some candidates have by and large national hold the Republicans haven't done that and it's it's been a source of great frustration for me but I also think that the American people a lot smarter\nThan than the press give them credit for they do the they're stronger pay checks they see the wage growth they see their job opportunities I think they see greater prosperity in every direction a stronger economy and international position for the country\nYou know who's responsible for that the president and the Republicans and they're likely to reward that I really believe that that is true and it's\nAnd for so long that people have now tuned it out and they're likely to react in the opposite direction\nThe production by Nancy Pelosi said she will be the speaker of the house again she guaranteed that on the Tonight Show out those are they on the Tonight Show without laughing that what we need is a leader who doesn't divided to bring us together she does is without laughing however political science says that there is merit to Mrs pillows these prediction\nThat the how wings to Nancy Pelosi if that\nHappens Monica the worst case scenario is that the house is still made it they promised investigation that guaranteed investigation subpoena power in all directions do you believe those investigations will weigh the American people to a turning against them and they voted in the end of the office\nNo in fact I think it will have the exact opposite effect the way the Republican investigations into Bill Clinton and the Nineteen nineties had the opposite effect on\nPeople rally around the president even one is polarizing is this one he is still the president of the United states Bill Clinton same thing and the other thing that the two presidents have in common\nIs a strong economy so they're presiding they both are presiding over big strong economy whether it was in the Nineteen nineties or today and a strong economy a knock elites presidents from a lot of nonsense a lot of investigations and a lot of ...\nBecause people are willing to overlook that when things are good for them and their families\nSo I think you know if we get a Democratic House yeah in my view this will be terrible we will have paralysis but I also think that Donald Trump is never as good as he is when he's got a foil no better foil for Donald Trump that Nancy Pelosi a Democratic House which is\nOverreaching every day with impeachment investigations and the rest so it's likely\nSenate or the Senate is looking very favorable for the Republicans it's a good map out possible pickup of too but I Want to concentrate in New Jersey you're a Jersey Girl Monica\nI'm Robert Menendez is a deeply troubled candidate a we know about the investigations uh we also know that the uh papers in New Jersey have acknowledged that there is married to those investigations and are recommending in a blue state that people hold their nose and vote for him and\nI'm told that late in the game the national Democrats panic a little bit because they saw him and then does his numbers were weak and they poured three million dollars then to elect him what is your sense Monica will will the liberal of New Jersey vote for a man who has such and such baggage\n[noise] you know I grew up in New Jersey John I Love the Garden State and my mother is still there almost every day she calls me screaming about Sen Menendez [laughter] their

the news always\nThe unhappiness between Beijing and Washington is obvious and is a driver for the economy of the United states and the economy of China we hear much about the economy of the U. S. and about the markets especially the stock market anxiety that test but what about China\nHow's it doing on the other side of the terrorists imposed and about to be imposed by the Trump Administration because of bad practices that would be\nGenerally understood to be piracy and I'm over capacity and subsidizing industries from the central government Gordon Chang the Daily Beast is here as my colleague ... ... the Chinese side of the story has lots millions of people at risk here\nFor a weakening economy in China because of the terrorists maybe tens of millions of people do they have a voice Gordon the way our manufacturing base has a voice and is a very loud voice these days in the Trump Administration did the Chinese manufacturers have a voice in Beijing\nWhat's a great question John and you know in the Chinese system um it is a complex series of bargaining among coalitions groups factions\nAnd political leaders so they do have a voice but it's very different from the voice that we have in our political system which is direct because as you pointed out we've got mid term elections we've got of course presidential elections they don't really have that\nOf course the report from China and these last hour than in these last days is that the purchasing managers index which Gordon has taught me to pay much attention to\nIs that fifty point too which is lower than the expected fifty point six and a Reuters poll down from fifty point eight in September whatever means it's weaker than it was so we welcome our colleague Andrew Collier\nHe is in Hong Kong and he watches the Chinese economy extremely carefully\nA Andrew a very good morning to you and Hong Kong these purchasing managers index is a confused me and there's another headline saying the sights in ... China many of purchasing manufacturers index\nIs in it better than expected at fifty fifty point one what is it pointing to what is the metric telling us good morning to Andrew\nA good evening John the metric is basically saying that the Chinese economy has weakened\nAnd why that's important is first of all it means that the China's gonna buy less goods from the United states which obviously affects our economy and second of all it means that at some point the Chinese leaders have to step in with a flood of cash\nOr are going to be tempted to step in with a flood of cash to get the economy back on its feet [noise]\nUm the question is they've been holding back on that in fact I've Meyer their strengths\nAre because they're concerned about too much debt and the economy and too many bad loans going out there\nSo so far we've seen a lot of a restraint on the part of the leaders are but now Bloomberg gets reporting or just I think this morning that they ... the central leadership said that they're looking again at stimulus measures and they may do something as early as next week Gordon\nWell Andy what we've got a situation where um they can have stimulus measures um by flooding the ...\nGone back to the garden Chang were very pleased to welcome Scott held for political scientist deputy director at the center for Asia\nGuide me immediately we are eager for your thoughts about the meeting between the prime minister of Japan all day\nAnd the prime minister of India no render Modi\nThey are to part of what is called the Indo Pacific Claude India Japan Australia and the United states\nAll day and an Modi both share democracies are they both have aggressive modern warships what are they what are they what are they looking to do with each other and how does how do they regard China collectively good evening to\nGood evening John and Gordon and to your listeners around the world John and very happy Halloween to all of you\nUm you know it's a good good point John the or the Japanese and the Indians share both a common values and also a common threat perception there is a view that is very widely held in both Tokyo and in India\nOr that China's aggressive build up its military capabilities and its use of both military\nAnd economic tools as well as its diplomacy are coming at these countries expense including the region in a bit of a danger where uh it's possible Beijing may use coercion and unto on toward influenced to try to put these countries\nNational security at risk so you saw the prime minister of Japan visit Beijing where he and Xi Jinping that late last week\nThe very next day he was back in Tokyo and met with prime minister Modi at the foot of mount Fuji where he invited him to his private residence and signed a host of deals in announced a number of other initiatives all designed to signal\nA very strong bilateral relationship between Tokyo in New Delhi Gordon Scott\nYou mentioned that a prime minister Abe's hosted a the Indian prime minister at his private home in at the base of it\nIt just seemed a little bit stiff of the meetings that he had in the Chinese capital\nBut to his relations with Modi were very warm and and this strikes me is is not just a personal relationship but as you point out\nUm Japan and India seeing a common interest um if you could talk a little bit about the the warmth of the relationships that has had with Modi and the significance of going forward\nYeah I think there is no doubt you know the\nThe Japanese generally and the prime minister in particular do feel a a a very strong sense of shared identity as a democratic country and Asian democracy that has legitimately embraced and built its own version of democracy\nUh and and that shows through in the personal relations between\nUh the prime minister and his Indian counterpart but also between other Japanese officials and their Indian counterparts what's not oversell this working with India is still recognized in Japan to eat or work in progress very promising but it has been very promising for a long time so it is not always easy and as you've seen\nThey had been negotiating arms sales and other types of a defense cooperation\nFor quite a number of years it's not necessarily the case that this confluence of interest in threat perceptions immediate you lead your results that one might hope\nBut there is a great sense of optimism that at least the direction is the right one and that they can build a closer relationship by contrast the Japanese recognize\nThat China's in a very difficult place right now I Believe your previous guest just outlined some of the economic difficulties China's facing you're also of course facing a difficult relationship with\nThe American administration and the recent election in Brazil is likely to put even further pressure on Beijing so Japan recognizes that China's outreach now is almost entirely tactical isn't it\nAbout the grand strategic relationship it wants to have with Japan\nAnd similarly the Japanese recognized that and say okay we'd be happy to work more closely with you on terms that we can accept but we're not going to wreck we're not going to believe that this represents any kind of a sea change or a permanent solution to the problems that led us to the difficult place where they were the two sides were in over the last several years\nScott were told there is a quad Indo Pacific region Claude India Australia Japan and the United states is that aspirational or is that actual\nUh I think it's a great question John you know I I Do think that this was an aspirational about a dozen years ago at that time a there is a four sides there was not entirely\nA confluence of a belief that China posed a challenge or a threat today I think that is much more strongly recognized and held as of view and all four capitals I Will say though that uh the or continues to be\nA need to build a practical need around the bones of the quandary lateral dialogue and grouping\nOf course do do some military exchanges of exercises and in fact the recent visit by the Indian prime minister to to pan has led to an upgrading in India Japan defense ties with\nMore regular rise high level contacts including a two plus two dialogue but from we've been announced where the Japanese and Indian foreign and defense ministers will meet and the two sides will work more closely to invest in\nCapabilities that are dual use including a code developing um artificial intelligence and robotics and working more closely or in male male exchanges but to be sure there is much much work left to do and it would be premature to say that the quad has reached its full potential Gordon\nScott you know I listen to you describe the relationship between Japan and India one could say many of the same thing\nI mean do you see any parallels there Oh absolutely I mean I think that the reality with India is it is a country with enormous potential\nUh and unfortunately also enormous obstacles to realizing the full measure of that potential\nUh India continues to have a large amount of attachment to its previous or and continues to have a non aligned policy or a policy that cherishes autonomy and devoid of any kind of a formal alliance relationship with any other country\nThat is in some ways quite limiting and of course India also has a large number of captured or vested interests in its\nDefense industrial base as well as the broader economy that kind of complicated\nBlock or at least make difficult any sort of a deepening of a really meaningful deepening of economic ties including defense industrial ties so I Do think there are a lot of parallels I think that the good thing here is that the U.S and Japan is very close allies are working very closely to try to encourage the Indians\nTo find ways to uh work within their system to try to put pressure\nOr from the outside welcome pressure pressure that new tally can used to say look we want to do this with the Americans and the Japanese and in order to cooperate more deeply we need to make some changes domestically in the Japanese context as you know Gordon this used to be referred to and is still referred to as ... or useful foreign pressure that kind of pressure can help\nIndia to make forward progress on kind of breaking up some of the cartel like structures and its domestic economy and opening it up so that they can capture some of the real dynamism that exist in India is highly educated extremely skilled workforce that is unfortunately still in some cases\nAre
