points to a couple of things that I have not seen acts located so I Want to feature them the first one that grabs me and it bothered me the whole time Dan\nIs that there's something of the anti

puzzle to me Dan how do you hear it you because you noted in your column in in one of the penultimate paragraphs but you didn't expand on the good evening to\nEither John while I was referring to the um the a relentless references to a\nJudge Kavanaugh attending Georgetown prop uh and the idea of being conveyed implicitly in some cases more directly and articles and places like the Washington Post was the Georgetown Prep\nIn suburban Washington and the Maryland suburbs was a a breeding ground in the Nineteen eighties\nFor a abusers of women that it was just a school for rich kids who got drunk and went out on the weekend and uh [noise] that did this sort of thing a Georgetown Prep in fact is an all\nBoys just what high school it was founded in Seventeen eighty nine by archbishop John Carroll at the same time he was\nFounding Georgetown University the nation's oldest Catholic university\nIn Georgetown Prep is one of many ... such just what high schools across the country who are in fact uh give young men are extraordinarily strong education rooted in Catholic ideas and\n... and um I think it was related as well to something that a Senator Dianne Feinstein brought up in the confirmation hearing for Amy Coney Barrett when she was being nominated to the appeals court\nAnd judge Feinstein asked a ms beret whether her Catholicism was dogmatic on issues such as roe v Wade and the idea that it's one son frequently hears that a a Catholic in public life is going to be a have their\nPublic views are directed by dog law\nOr the churches dog my is uh the sort of thing that

evening to\nHi John yeah it's terrific news for main street it's not great news for Wall Street and I'll explain that\nBut in terms of the street or we saw in ... in all the good sectors we sold job gains in the high paying energy sector we sold job gains and the hype in construction sector we saw John ... in the high paying manufacturing sector or where we did\nAre caused by Hurricane Florence a year over year retail has actually added twenty five thousand jobs and there are\nA this is a positive sign a there are close to eight hundred and fifty thousand job openings in retail which is a record and the reason that's positive is a retail job to is the next step up from slavery except if you are now at Amazon and getting Fifteen dollars an hour\nBut at the end most retail outlets or you're working at slave wages and people are just turning their nose up at their jobs because those jobs because they can that's a great a sign for the economy we\nHave some numbers here a gym that I Want to help you help me interpret I was always told that four percent was the lowest we can go but they're not projecting that we're going to get to a three point five percent next year\nAnd and I mean this is hard to believe that we'll have this uh at at remained below four percent through twenty Twenty one or we add up people I it's just some robots what's doing this I didn't think this was possible ever and what we've got it for two years\nAh you know what it turns out the birth control pill wasn't such a great idea yeah we are short of people uh immigration reform a is really\nA front

to the crackdown on your legal immigrants and stricter border controls now I'm not saying that's a bad thing but we need reform so that we can\nBut let's pay attention now to the part of the job and the part of the jobs that Dr ... the high paying jobs\nWhere the wages go up is that what explains the two point eight percent remember we complained for years that the wages were not moving they are moving now although we were not according to the wall Street Journal to associate the word spectacular with movement but they're still moving\nIt just because people are bidding higher for their employees that what's doing this\n... yes is throughout the economy I mean you can see the stories in the paper about the fast food\nFranchise owners who were offering a four year college tuition and pay hikes are offering all kinds of perks to\nA a common plane plane to play that I hear from people is a yeah I'm working I've got a job but I Would I really need are benefits so I think you're seeing more companies offer some benefits to attract workers in many cases benefits outweigh the pay increase so\nSo that you know that two percent might seem low but but\nThere's something else going on and it's a I think it's a a an employee's market right now\nIn other words the uh the employer has the employee has the upper hand\nThat would explain the Amazon although that I thought that was very short on their part because it forces the competition to match them it's a it's a good headline I Want to look at why it is the Federal Reserve thinks the economy's going to continue so well off aren't they in charge of the money supply\nThe Federal Reserve is a saying that there is no recession insight and one could show up we could have a set back with a catastrophe like an asteroid and they are going to continue to raising rates and yet the market is ignoring it so let's go from Maine straight to Wall Street Wall Street's delighted with this gym\nBecause what's happening is you know we talked about this in the past or the stock market was up in large part because it was being subsidized by the Federal Reserve\nThe Federal Reserve was keeping interest rates so low that the only in town if you were looking for a positive return was stocks which which is really outside the risk profile of a lot of older Americans but our interest rates are on the increase so you're going to see money coming out of the stock market and going into bonds\nAnd certificates of deposits which are offering a good returns so the stock market will pull back or you know a we'll have some sort of a a correction maybe it'll last six months or so or I'm not saying we're having this correction now but we will has money comes out\nAnd goes elsewhere but as the money goes in the CDs it gives the uh uh it's it increases our rate of savings so in the long run it means that banks will be able to offer credit\nAt a lower rate to industry so we'll have this transitional period where there'll be a ... an hour to the audience stocks but for the long run it's it's very good for the economy\nThe trade story we are at odds with China they're not talking about the deal is in place for\nWhat used to be called NAFTA now us M. C. A. the Europeans are looking for conversations bilateral deals our economy's doing extremely well four percent plus last quarter and protections the same for this quarter Europeans not so much\nChinese negative Japan is even a little sluggish so is the trade story hurting us or is this why is this why we're booming and they're not\nWhat are the ... story will hurt us going forward because really you know we're at China is has been waging a an underhanded war against the U.S economy we are just waking up to that Bloomberg\nI saw that ... that just just blatant piracy on their part caught yes\nYes so I mean I think this trade war with China is a long term if they are because of our national security and I think our manufacturers will be shifting to other countries are like Cambodia believe it or not and Vietnam a\nChina's going to be hurt in the long run because of their militancy or the United states at some point we're all going to be playing it taking more money for things we take for granted to being cheap like sneakers and T shirts and that kinda stuff uh\nBut I think Americans or whether they love ... a Trump or hate him will rally around the flag on this issue because again it's national security or the Chinese are trying to hurt us or they're shipping illegal opioids into the country either you know they're they're stealing our our stuff\nI'm so a short term pain or maybe in two thousand Ninety two thousand twenty or long term it's a good for the U.S economy\nJim McKay he's the author of the new book follow the leader murder and mayhem on Capitol Hill that's easy to imagine I'm John bachelor this is the John ...

the middle I'm not sure if they were in men\nCoverage more of the coverage but Keith say will stay with them in his hip pocket and make the tackled as you say [noise] just a couple of yards short of the first down so shallow force [noise] and two maybe three they're again they're going to go forward here thirty\nFive [noise] says [noise] bold six minutes and three\nSeconds then what are they trying to get the yellow jackets to jump on our side who are just happy to oblige [noise] yeah that's a\nGreat play calling by shell oil nap\nEncroachment then why aren't currently results in a first down [noise]\nThat that uh encroachment occurred on the edge [noise]\nYeah that is something obviously the you would think about normally a defensively you don't want to jump off no one got worse down regardless\nFor a six year again after that mountain a lot of glass first down nine to six Blue Ridge leading locked run into five minutes and forty five seconds and the cougars or again marching [noise]\nAnd again just the timing route to the outside finds Clarke\nGood low pass to keep it away from the defender playing over the top\nBut again solo definitely has the momentum here with five just over five minutes five twenty [noise]\nAnd the second McGinnis who's now six of eleven for sixty seven yards again comes to this here sideline again has Clark and this one down\nInto Blue Ridge territory down at forty [noise] after that fourteen your connection [noise]\nSo shallow definitely rely heavily on they're passing game here and it's executing well for them they're doing the routes

was going to find a man on the right side that pass\nIt brings out a real Bronx cheer from the show though faithful [noise]\nWell they've had shows that a lot of a long string of penalty\nOther way [noise]\nNow the cougars still have to time outs pass interference in Fifteen Years previous spot\nReally first rate John\nFor Blue Ridge but they've got a ton of yard it's you're not just for the first down but uh\nOne twenty two left\nAnd as you say solo with time out so they could actually they hold here they could put themselves in a position\nTo lead to have a crack it another\nShot up put points up on the board members were half time\nFirst in twenty five with Louis leading Ninety six and a half ago to us bars uh he's met in the backfield\nAnd the ball comes out but I think I guess he

feel that this was in play and interestingly the score and get begins because of the bill position situation show that puts themselves in Tibet snaps their jackets get on the board person with a safety interestingly that was the last we saw those snap what kind of adjusted do you think that the corps\nMade I don't know it's maybe just a matter of getting the quarterback and center together as a sideline and saying hey guys let's get this thing dialed in\nBut it certainly obvious in that first the first couple of his actions were so low\nEarly and it could just be nerves you know you never know but uh whatever they did it it ... it fix things out because the tail to tape I guess in general and the first out you know Blue Ridge came up with the momentum um didn't really overwhelmed solo necessarily but but certainly playing more consistent shallow you could see\nJust not really click and but ... definitely finish this second quarter with a lot of momentum going into halftime so it'll be interesting to see how the game starts out here in the second out\nYou have a jacket skipped upon after the safety and why\nPossible for almost every a play at that point yet going into that touchdown where it was his uh thirteenth Kerry when he was able to punch it in from one yard out and Blue Ridge kind of goes away from him a little bit there way what do you think it was inspiring that\nYou know I don't know it's a we we did see a show of defense tighten up as far as I was having a hard time getting a those\n\nWas getting better games\nAnd Blue Ridge you know their coaches they liked the mix it up a little bit they're not going to just come at you with the run and and and not be too creative I mean PJ London he can throw the football he's only a sophomore but he has a good arm and we saw that make that one deep attempt [noise]\nThat coach Maxwell looked like your your defense kind of field you're often there a couple of interceptions\n\nSurprises that we I we came out in the brief snaps I mean yeah that definitely surprised me or I think our deepens settled down you know above ... short fields right away and I think that's what gave up a point but\nNo you know uh it's everything what we expected expected once we actually started last year when the football I'm doing some faith though [noise] um I I think I Would look for something a little bit more on the second half are the ones I think is planned well we got to come and get a stop right now is we're going to be important and then I think often simply we just kind of got to keep doing what we do\n... ran and a lot first quarter second quarter came out and tried to pass what do you expect second half\nI expect you to do a mixture I mean honestly that's\nFor the most part that's what they've done for you know for Thirty years that's what they built the blue ridge program on and they're good at it they get off the ball well the other well coach the James Bond is hard to stop [noise] but I but I Do think ah you know we're going to see more of the same I mean I don't think they're going to change anything\nAlright coach good luck to you guys guys thanks Ron thank you coach Maxwell is this team's trailer nine to six but we talked about\nThe cougars was really I think owned by the cougars we saw the turnovers\nThat you know coach talked about really getting their off at the game going and then begin is really really seem to kind of settled in\nGain some confidence and\n\n\nThere's a couple of positions [noise]\nYeah I think you know definitely in a situation here where like coach backed well said you know the key here Blue Ridge is going to get the opening kick off if they can come up with a good stop against Blue Ridge to start the second\nSecond half a motive ... especially on the off that's inside the solo definitely went into halftime I think with the momentum on their side so this defensive stand to start the second half that's gonna [noise]\nYou know it's going to be important for them [noise]\nReally getting the feeling that both these side [noise]\nHad opposing viewpoint that half time coming when it did the cougars probably wishes that they could just go right into the third quarter or a Blue Ridge really needed to try to get their head straight\nOr they're going to get the ball to receive here\nAnd I would expect that or we can expect a lot more a chase as far as the last ... and even though the kind of felt maybe they're just running out the clock but there are certainly going back to that well he's a good runner I mean he's a he's a tough kid hard to bring down [noise]\nBut of course he needs he needs some space that we you know Blue Ridge is not known for breaking off huge run necessarily what they're reading game they're perfectly content just grinding out\nFirst down the in the process of getting lung possessions that eat up clock and uh [noise] they have no problem doing that but uh you know [noise] solos defense really got tough\nEspecially in that second quarter and did not get this ... much room at all so it'll be interesting to see ... Blue Ridge comes out with here to start to second house [noise]\nKick off [noise] is uh [noise]\nIn exhorted when it comes to kick onto college education choose the college\nWith the lowest tuition and Arizona\nIs back you're on the twenty five yard line or a couple\nOf men but instead it's going to clear them and get all the way back out of the twenty where it is received by one of\nThe other jackets and he's going to go right up the mental through all sorts of travel are being brought down by his shoe laces or forty five\nOf Korea field on the reception for the big tackle an open field as you say look like\nAnd field was going to\nBlow and dig up making the shoestring tackle trip or a great job by him [noise]\nAnd filled out but again great starting filters this here by ... gently there forty eight [noise]\nHere's a first possession of this third quarter as far as there is\nDeep in the backfield he gets the call coming toward that right side of the line but he has stood out after [noise]\nThey have his [noise]\nForward motion going down to what looks like one official had 'em all the way out to the forty six or seven but they're going to mark 'em down at the forty niners to your game\nSeveral solo players it on that led by Jack Barrett their nose guard or one of their defensive lineman for solo on that goal getting everybody\nReally close to the line of scrimmage here on second down in ... and again as far as it gets to call and again he has stood up but he's continuing to push his legs forward and illegal to gain one yard now as a result of that but he didn't do that [noise]\nThey keep those be moving good job I hear that just another wall of she'll do players not much room for as far as the [noise] to find up but the light and scrambled Anthony of ... a long with great and told her that company shutting down that gap [noise] really\nLondon rolling to his laptop he's gotta talk it runs through one tackle had the first down over to the forty deep into show territory down at the thirty seven [noise]\nThat's a good read good decision by London seeing the coverage you just go ahead go ahead just takes the road to the outside there's no it set up there for him to have to worry about Jacob Yeager ultimately making to tackle\nHaving to run across field to drag him down ... down but not after the game is that for that first down now\nTwenty one yard not just to carries for London that one was big\nIs it going to move to the show though thirty eight\nHandoff do as far as after the ... mobile glass first down is again is able to go forward after meeting contact inside the thirty five it down to the thirty four for a hard fought for your again now after twenty four carries he's up to Seventy five yards\nAs far as the as we say aggressive downhill runner and he runs into Keegan clerk at the [noise] in a big tackle big collision between those two but again just another [noise]\nDecent gain by as far as the for about four yard [noise]\nNinety six Blue Ridge leading now second down at for nine minutes and fifty seconds to play it looked like they tried to get that one to one of the [noise]\nThat's often liar on the head dolls for blue ... just completely blown up\nRigidly doing a great job beating the block at the line of scrimmage that play had no chance just outstanding by play by leave for the cougars\nWinds up losing a yard [noise] third down in seven were able to convert on their last similarly march third downplay this time it will go for the shock and he's got the receivers on the right side of his life\nI've got to talking and then he has a man opened inside of the ten [noise]\nAnd it's going to bounce off of infield shoulder pad that's amazing\nPlay by London if you look here but that little ... are able to get free up side the pocket and then to pull the trigger [noise] and that was a good path just unfortunate and feel instead of catching with his hands let's hit is the shoulder pads that bounces right off\nBut you can't fault mud ... tried to make a play out of the no\nThat was an incredible job there by the sophomore quarterback as he's also the punter\nBut in studies coming in and lining up under center on the spores down in seven way and they will take the snap directly now he's spinning around to his lab to get a hold up and throw ended a flat rate is taught by a man inside of the twenty five and brought down there than field making some event for the last one [noise]\nThat'll be Clark on to tackle along with uh [noise]\nWas it\nThat you meant well thank you all are\nThat's a deep secondary for the uh cougars making that tackle as you say are pretty narrow window for that pass to get through and feel does make the cats for the first down\n\nNow the left side and again spinning away from the initial factor and falling forward after a five yard game that was the first connection that London they'd had here now one for for for Thirteen yards he needed seven and he was able to almost double\nThat up on that previous third down lurid now marching deep British show territory as it is markets is sixteen and I think the cougars need to talk about this uh look I had the yellow jacket oh robes nursing their entire out there and a half\nAnd long issue situation but PJ London was able to run for the ...\nThe third leading nine to six on the show for presentation of high school football and I talk about a six point seven and I talked to one of six seven dot com\nIt's either winter Wendy season or when he sees them keeping your ... isn't as easy as it sounds up here on the mountain finding the time buying ...\nWas taken to opt to boost car wash the only full service car wash up on the mountain and with exterior watches ... just five Ninety five you can save yourself a hassle and\nTo Zachary Maxwell number nine linebacker that comes up as you say what the initial contact [noise]\nLooked like Maxwell might be able to drop the scars of the most part that just doing a great job of keeping those moving and actually pushes it back enough\nTo get the first down not mobile out of glass first down this time we'll go to hop Meyer on that Kerry is he crosses midfield in shallow territory he has a good eight yard gain as there's four minutes at Fifteen seconds left and after converting on third down ... mulatto glass first down it's going to set up a second a short\nTrip dealer on to tackle along with others for the cougars\nBut again blurry loves these kinds of drive there just chipping away getting their first down but more importantly for them with the lead sixteen to six\nHere in the third bluebirds is able to wind down the block [noise]\nAs far as I have him over the century mark on thirty carries for one or two yards and he's going to get the call falling forward very close to the show forty five which is where he needs to get for that first down but it looks like he's going to be just a little bit short\nYou know they're going to mark and looked like his knee dropped [noise]\nShy of the uh [noise] where do you buy those solo [noise]\nGoing to be enough it looks like they're going to call that changed about\nForty five we'll see what they do here\nIs the nose or the football looks like it is inches\nAway from that forty five by that I mean to [noise]\nThe changing has emerged and it stretched out and [noise]\nSo now just start the second half Blue Ridge is converted three times already on third down they have not needed to go is shorter distance that they do right now on that goal situation it was London on a key does that seem appropriate in this by well you know with that line surge he was able to score on the quarterback keeper with\nPlenty of room to spare [noise]\nBut then again as far as the [noise]\nTends to be there or go to guy in situations like this especially a third down [noise]\nLondon Under center the same going to go to half Meyer who is met at the line but he falls forward and he needed six inches he wound up getting a yard [noise]\nThey get just a basic die play up top of the middle [noise]\nOver fifty one first solo at the bottom of the pile rich leave but again as you say not after\nA hop Mars able to lead over him to enough to get the first out for blue or it's a good good long drive here by blur is running the clock down to almost three minute [noise]\nSixteen the stakes than carrying the football now is as far as they after that mountain a lot of glass first down he's gonna fall inside well right at the show low forties for for your again [noise]\nAs\nEfficiently as Blue Ridge is churning through the clock even though it's the only the third quarter\nShow down by two scores it feels as if the clock is becoming a bit of a factor\nWhy do you do we heard coach Maxwell you at halftime he ... he highlighted the fact that he would really like his team to stop Blue Ridge on that first possesses what they were not able to do since then Blue Ridge is that success and moving the football\nAnd six and again met in the backfield but again taking the taxpayer forward for another four yard game\nAnd Blue Ridge to come to the line having already successfully converted on for a third down place here in the third quarter sixteen to sixty yellow jackets are leading two minutes and fourteen seconds left and the cougars probably looking at a situation where they're going to have to get to stop shooting at the ball back and they really need to get his defense out the field\nLondon Under center\nPitches it out to the left going that way as as far as he makes it move to get further outside is it thirty is down to the twenty four yard line [noise] having twenty six yard and I never picked up still another ... mobile\n\nOut on the edge making attack a lot as far as the but as far as making a good move to the outside\n[noise] Trenton\nViewer as well out there to finish off for the cougars but ah those things are really clicking now for Blue Ridge is running game again we're not big big big\nPlays big running plays especially but they're just chipping away getting the first downs and more importantly down that clock\nSixteen to six is half my gets the call he is through into the second level is finally brought down into Fifteen but a flag is down in the backfield and that usually doesn't\nSmell anything good for the Athens\nThat's going to be holding it gets blurred rich but a good play by the jackets that time giving to hop or [noise]\nYou know after after a while you begin to wonder if these a shallow cougar start to key on as far as the given how many carries these ads that's allowed Hoff mar opportunities up the middle\nI think the defense not expect to hold a vote ball fan [noise]\nTen yards from the side of the salary the sit down [noise]\nThat was set up in the first in twenty [noise] and it was all the way back to the show those thirty eight but [noise]\nThe yellow jackets of had this football for pretty much the entire third quarter considered they've diverted for third downs here in the third cello was run three played yep that's\nGot an upset either backfield aspires again met this time at the line of scrimmage but this time he's gang tackled him [noise]\nAnd I think the first player their\nNumber one for the cougars Anthony ... of ... uh [noise]\nOne of their down lineman\n\nInquired coming in to make sure that a smart as it doesn't get away yeah that's a good defense there are good good response by the cougars that penalty for Blue Ridge\nThat's a big penalty set some back after they had momentum [noise]\nWe'll see if solo can stiffen up here to keep their words out of the yet though second doubts donate twenty less than ... minutes ago here in the third is London\nRoles to his left looking out and has a man in the twenty five and out of bounds that the twenty three twenty four\nAs catch in that one is the key say [noise]\nLearns putting two receivers on the same side what depot one in

get to the first down Thirteen yards on that reception\nAs far as they're trying to go over there right sightings again that by a trio of cougars you still is able to take them down to\nTwenty wine but it'll make it now for us down\nWhat am I going to college for and I don't know if the yellow jackets have to do anything about that until the fourth quarter there's twenty two seconds left [noise]\nWhere they're they're they're like they're just they're jackets are just going to let the clock burnt down to the corner here with the J London going over to the sideline to talk to his coach

straight play the game people arrested I Lived a smile love your smile punt biggest into early in the second half ... thirty seven PJ London and starts rolling to his left\nYeah leaves the pocket and I actually agree are read by him and he has not run he typically does not run the ... for Blue Ridge\nBut he does a knock off at twelve yard run and more importantly gets the first down to keep the drive alive which they ultimately score on and that's their first possession coming out of a halftime we talked about\nYou know what would the momentum look like between show low who really had the momentum going into the locker room at halftime and for Blue Ridge to answer quickly in that first possession in London to run for sure put them in a position to do that on that third downplayed so uh that that made the big big difference for the yellow jackets tonight\nSo that twelve yard run on thirty seven is it'd be worth it on a straight line play the game bill or is it on his smile love your smile and as you mentioned with our conversation at half time even though blurry tonight is actually was the cougars got all the momentum and that was the first of for their down conversions in that third quarter and had\nHe not done that it's difficult to say what was going to happen because of the blue ridge defense was coming up pretty stout only allowed show those replays but well we even her coach Maxwell for the ...\nKick off to start the second half if they could put a stop on blue or it's like they had been doing\nLeading up to you know that the first half going into the locker room I I think he felt pretty confident about his team and rightly so but ah for Blue Ridge to answer with that big long drive 'em and put points up on the board and really did change the tone of the entire second ... pretty much dominated the entire a\nSecond half literate gets that twenty three to twelve winter now foreign for on the year that we just do the ... glass glass shattering hit the game neat

fourth quarter number fifty four for a show low jak beard\nHitting a hop Myer right there just lit up of course he had helped\n\n\nLee put that initial hit by a beard on Hoff\nWire now is a critical play as well um you know you could hear it up here in the stands in a it gave that a cougar defense a little bit of a something to cheer about for a second there I mean literally ultimately ends up going down the field to score but uh that was a big hit there for beer\nIs that's a dangerous glass glass shattering hit of the game again call one eight eight eight glasses man for any quality glass an affordable price as you may need and that incidentally coming on a running late that did not featured chased as far as who I I don't want to\nRuin a lead but as far as our Honda outdoor skiing sports storm player of the game it's hard to go away from somebody who\nWhat was the big secret to his successor day well you know he's there go to guy we knew that coming in and he's been he's been their top runner all season long about forty five carries I mean that's crazy and it you know it's a matter of the coaches just reading the defense the shallow defense and feeling confident in what they felt they do often simply\nYou know London ends up getting a\n... as far as the scored their first touchdown London ends up getting two of the three touchdowns for Blue Ridge tonight but um yeah that running game and it's nothing fancy it's just good old fashioned three clouds in the earth three yards in a cloud of dust for Blue Ridge and they're perfectly content with that especially when they had the lead 'cause\nThey get those long drives a they can chew up the clock and uh but as far as to carry forty five times that's a lot for him that's a lot for any Blue Ridge back but that just tells you how much confidence they have in a\nWay and it's not every day that you get to see within the game the importance of one player because as far as they didn't get many looks in the second quarter and that's what it looked like show though was really taken away all that momentum come back in the second half not going to be the case anymore I think he carried the ball\nI'm almost thirty times yeah in that are in that second half so he finishes with twenty seven and a or beg your pardon\n\nThree twelve when foreign for over the course of the year and two in one region flavored showed at two and five and wanting to what's coming in this week I Believe Seventeen and the power rankings this is a pretty good performance for the cougars I got to be feeling pretty good going into the final few games in the season [noise]\nWell you know I I think coach Maxwell saw some things tonight you know again is I thought ... did a really good job once he started getting comfortable in the pocket maybe you know blurred says defense later especially knowing that you know there is passing downs and they're going to drop\nField but a leading up before that you could see McGinnis really getting in a groove and you know and when he has time to throw he can find receivers he's got a good arm through some really good tight spirals on target tonight or with just a few exceptions so that's something certainly to feel good about\nYou know the running game for so low that hasn't been a big part of their off that's where we could see how they struggled a little bit tonight with that so I think that's something\nFor them to feel more confident about where they're moving from here you know they're going to have to probably look at getting a little bit stronger with some sort of a running game just to give them give themselves more options with that what what clearly is a pretty reasonable passing game All right well last\nCall here at cougars stadium Blue Ridge breach the

still like them to win the series in fact I can see them winning the next three I look at you I pick them last night because my confidence in the Yankees' bullpen is better than my confidence in the red Sox bullpen and it almost happened tonight\nWell that was the advantage right if you're printing out are pulling off the fish wraps these six page preview section that was you know that it was at least six pages for this yeah for game on yeah not just for the series but I that's the obvious advantage right\nSale was great it was a ... game and okay if the Yankees can maybe squeak something out it's like it's a it's the\nIt's like the ah extended adult swim segment of the night extended adult swim for a while I agree [noise] ah but what happened tonight is what I expected to happen they got ...\nAnd they had bases loaded in the sixth inning with two outs and Leiber tours for some unknown reason after Red Sox pitchers walk to the two batters previous to him he swings of the first pitch which was out of the strike zone yeah but here's the thing is just off\nThe underbelly but instead of of slicing it and if this rating them they rubbed mhm\nThey robbed the belly that that that really the only did they robbed about yeah they got a couple of rounds you got the judge home run to make things a little more interesting\nBut in the end didn't take full advantage of the opportunities presented to them\nIn the sixth inning tours is up with bases loaded throughout swings the first pitch and then strikes out on a full count picture the ball in the dirt\nThat was the first missed opportunity seventh inning Yankees have bases loaded with nobody out and you're saying and right now Fenway as going oh my God this is really going to happen\nAnd then ... has a horrendous that bad for the Yankees and it looked like he was swinging for the fences what he was late on everything it was awful he strikes out they get a ground ball\nYes or run comes in but they get the second out of the inning then you get the ground out for migratory has to end the inning and the red Sox get out of bases loaded nobody out with one run\nI Can't get over how many bad at patch the Yankees had tonight with runners in scoring position it was awful and that's not going to happen again\nThey're they're they're not going to face Chris sell for a fee they may not face him again the rest of the series you know you don't know how things are going to go with Boston might do it they're rotation but you've got price you got poor solo in game three\nThat's not going to happen the Yankees will feast on this bullpen they almost did it tonight and our judges a solo home run in the knife had they just had one more run just want just getting to runs out of\nLaw there to see their their I Love it if they only had one more adjust to run so now you're getting a conga line a amaze you missed your opportunities just loaded bases loaded and ... and you get one Raj you don't\nOpportunity to see the gotten his team and take control of the Syrian\nCould be bought momentum is always as good as the next day's bullpen not the next day starting pitcher you see that as well there's always a ...

football mode\nYou've got the NBA starting up a little while you've got the NHL season back you've got major league baseball playoffs you've got a big UFC event coming up this weekend I mean they I every single weekend until the end of the year there's something awesome going on [noise]\nSo it's going to be a fun extravaganza we're going to get to all of it here over the next four hours here on Fox Sports radio but I Do want\nTo get to something out of the NFL that I guess it's going to come as a little bit of a surprise um but probably shouldn't come as a surprise at all so the New York giants are one and three\nThey are dead last in the NFC St\nNow full disclosure I picked the New York giants to win the division this year in the NFC used right not not looking like one of my better picks ever not that I've had that many good picks at all\nUm I also pick the New York giants to win the NFC East last year\nSo I thought law averages this'll be the year man if they didn't do it last year this year has got to be the year but then again I'm the same a whole who walks through casino sees the roulette wheel seized ... ten is hit it ... red ten times in a row it doesn't matter\nLaw averages there's no way it's going to hit right again\nMore often than not I lose so so take that take my prediction of the New York giants going into this year as something sort of along the lines of that I did like what they what they added in the off season I thought the addition of patch or um or what was going to a a a pay dividends at least early on in the season\nSay Kwan Barkley I thought they upgraded they're often some line\nI thought their defense is going to be a little bit better I thought the culture was going to be different with the New York giants because last year with Ben ... it was a disaster\nAnd here we are quarter market the season and they are dead last\nThey're probably not going to the playoffs but oh del back them did get his contract and the off season that was a big talking point that was a big distraction you finally get it done with it's like going to the DMV you know you've got to go and you procrastinate\nYou procrastinate you procrastinate finally you go it's a little bit of a pain in the ass and then you get it done and you realize man I should have done that a long time ago it's so nice not to see that registration on my counter top as a reminder to go pay my registration it's so nice to not have to deal with that anymore now you can just throw it away\nYou thought oh del back him getting his new contract day they got to taking care of we're good man moving on let's focus on the season\nAnd then or do back undecided yeah you know I'm not real happy with\nHow things are currently going you know I'm not real thrilled that keep in mind oh back in his fifth interceptions in the NFL but he's yet to score touched down where there's new contract and so I'm a widow back him in an interview recently with ESPN said the following\nLot of it has to do with it and then the though we have a very ... very over some of the um [noise] you know medium\nSome are like we we just need to play with them or we're only one in three you know we last year to year we want to live in ... we were two and three we ended up being two and three other five minutes [noise]\nSo you never know when you're going to run 'em but it's just a matter when we're all going wrong with what how can we can't go to vote for more than twenty hours how can we don't attempt to try to sort of off more than twenty um those are questions that we have to figure out but\nFor now I Would say is or energy is is what we bring ... before the game all of the house\nYeah that's going to uh probably not sit well with several people inside the locker and wouldn't you think when you when you gather I look I appreciate is honesty I don't have an issue with it the guy called it like he sees it he's got a point will will go through the numbers on this and show you that he is speaking the truth and he's got a point\nBut its head coach pat Schroeder countered that claim from ... here we are sure my courtesy of news that\nI don't know I guess you'd have to clarify that probably a better question for him what he meant by it um but I Do know that is our team has\nA heck of a lot of heart our team plays with a lot energy what we haven't done is we haven't really executed quite as well as we need to yet and that's really the uh instead of a energy it's more execution and I think that's what we're striving for but uh\nNow we got a locker room with the these guys got a ton of heart including owed out and a lot of want to and I I think that you know will break over here once we start executing better we as coach has got to continually fight to put them in the best position possible and then we got we got to execute\nYeah I'm so when the when the main word of topic there is an execution that is code for you weren't doing what we're asking you to do therefore we're one and three and therefore you don't have a touchdown that's what that means so a little bit of back and forth\nYou can't dispute\nRegardless of what you're looking at the one thing that you cannot dispute is that oh del backed him when he makes a comment that why can't we throw the ball twenty yards down the field Izzy calling out you lie maintaining his quarterback\nBecause it feels like years feels like\nHe's calling out he lie manning or maybe it's the play but maybe it's a scheme but we're going to go with you I'm Manny right now just because it would be better right it's better for the show and\nSince we have say over how we want to take this angle on the show the first way we're gonna take it is we think he's probably hinting at Eli Manning that's the more entertaining version right so\nHe like manning has been better the last three weeks he's struggled week one but he has been better the last three weeks I miss completion percentage is much better the numbers if you just look at him he's been much better\nIn the last three weeks heading into we five but clearly\nThere's not a threat to go deep and in today's NFL\nWhen you're watching the LA Rams when you're watching the Minnesota Vikings when you're watching the Kansas City chiefs when you're watching Tom Brady throwing the double coverage in the end zone to Josh Gordon maybe the leagues kind of change in a little bit you know what I mean like when Mitch Trybulski\nHas sticks touchdown passes that's when you take a step back and go\nWhat are we watching again or what what's going on here this doesn't really uh I'm I'm ... I'm confused or that one one minute yeah he he can throw to his left the next minute he's throwing six touchdowns I'm a little confused here so the league is changing it's an aerial attack down field it seemed like an every single game and you've got you I mainly who can't get the ball down field\nAnd I'm not just saying that to take a shot at him but it's the truth\nLie Manning's longest pass completion on the season is thirty seven yards\nGift advocate volunteer\nLiving on its good living on a daughter were brought cheaper United Way an ad council\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee I think that we talk a lot of damage to ourselves\nSeriously with no regrets superstars do say I'm Sorry I Know I'm Sorry we're giving you the war\nAnd that makes you\nWere doing it all for you it sounds good to me to me can you\n\nSee I Want to point seven mobile labs visit to on one of the same point seven dot com\nThat last one I'm your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for details in Rwanda [noise]\nMm\nFox Sports radio\nWhat do you live here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios\nCare which is a is vastly\nBecome one of my favorites segments on the show because we just sort of rattle off a bunch of things that are hot topics in the world of sports and I have found that more often than not I really don't care about them at all not even for a split second so we won't do that here I'm coming up a less than ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio\nSo I was thinking about this just in regards to an NFL team I'm\nLike when you ever met somebody whether you you start dating or you go out on a date for the first time or you say hey so well what do you like to do what are your hobbies\nLike you'll meet somebody and they go oh well I Love to travel you know I Love new experiences\nNo you just don't like your job okay [laughter] you don't like your everyday life see you escape that's what that's what you're traveling is you know I Love I Love to travel it looked to see different parts of the world\nWrong with that part of the world that you're living in and why do you need to get away so often we it's fine like there's nothing wrong with it but I I mean maybe I should travel more I have no idea but I mean new is good sometimes I get it\nYou know different is good sometimes I understand that but when I whenever I meet people and they say as yeah so what do you like to do I love to travel right now how about your job [laughter] [laughter]\nWell what are they they're just a little off like it's not like there's something wrong with that if you're always like my girlfriend has a friend of ours who always is traveling always doing something new some fun little venture on Instagram\nBut oh so she's in between jobs again oh is that [laughter] is that we're talking about here they just gave him another job so it it should but I find it funny and\nLike the one thing I'll say because I get the different is good sometimes try different things different experiences and all that but the only thing I can think of that's better than all of that is consistency\nRight straight up consistency it could go one way or the other\nInsurers any of that just give me some consistency\nSo if the Miami Dolphins lose on Sunday at Cincinnati they'll drop to three and two on the air\nWhich puts Miami in a tie for first in the AFC East with the tie breaker going to\nGet to the New England patriots and you can say whatever you want about the New England patriots and many of you have but at least they're consistent man a leash you know what you're getting\nSingle year time and time again the New England patriots show up clock in do the exact same thing and whether you like it or not you can least got a respected\nThe last time the New England patriots had a losing season Julian Edelman was fourteen Rob Gronkowski was eleven Josh Gordon was nine and Sony Michel was\nFive yet here they are about to go back in the first place in the AFC East just think about that the less sudden the New England just put this into perspective right the last time the New England patriots\nHad a losing season Sony Michel was putting his hand any ceramic plate and writing the year underneath as a Mother's Day gift in his kindergarten\nClass okay like that is how consistent the New England patriots had been that is how good they have been so Sony Michel at five\nOld and putting his hand printing the ceramic plate with his name and I love your mom and the date on it all these years later the patriots had been a winner every single season and Thursday night Sony Michelle's averaging over five years or five yards carrying scoring a touchdown against the Colts clockwork\nAll that but that's just disguised as envy because you wish your team was that consistent you wish that you you dealt with that every year you wish you did\nLike their fan base is out there that are miserable consistently or they'll have one okay here and then the next year it's a waste of time\nLike the Oakland Raiders a couple of years ago went from it was like Thirteen Windsor eleven or twelve when something like that like a second to last week of the season the raiders or back uh it's it's Showtime and Oakland Raiders are back and with the flip a switch they lost their starting quarterback\nThey started Connor cooking a playoff game and they were moving to Las Vegas that you could ... the patriots you don't have to worry about anything they're going to show up every single year no matter what and they're going to be in first place in the east\nEvery single year\nI mean I get the one for a change\nI I get all that like I said before age some vacation\nA get out a little bit experience some new things I listen I get all that OK maybe you want some new blood in the NFL maybe you're tired of Penn filling in the patriots and at this point it's in Penn and permanent bank maybe you're tired of of putting the patriots in the playoffs every single year when you're doing your pre season picks\nBut damn at least ... dependable at least you know what you're going to get\nI mean that that's the great thing about liking Starbucks I Know like there's some people out there it's very the trendy thing to do is to not like\nA chains\nKnow if you ask somebody um hey what's your favorite burger nobody's going to tell you oh man I really really love that thing at McDonalds nobody's going to say that best burger in towns going to be some mom and pop joined that's going to be like the cool thing to do that is going to be the cool thing but the cool thing about liking a chain\nDoesn't matter if you're at an airport a baseball game a badminton tournament if there's a Starbucks around you know what you're going to get every single time and if you have a favorite drink or favorite snack it's going to be the same thing every single time every time\nIt's consistent\nEvery time you go to the airport what's got a longer line Starbucks or will ease bean tea leave\nIt's ... you know you're going to get every single time you don't have to worry about it you're not not not concerned with it\nThe New England patriots won the AFC East nine straight years fourteen of the last Fifteen imagine being a fan of the jets bills or dolphins how annoying that must be but at least you know the outcome\nAt least ... there was no big cheese I mean I guess there was a tease for a couple of weeks with the dolphins but a real dolphin fan looked\nAt that and said yeah this is Dana happening [laughter] as a yeah there's not a there's a better chance of a of a re Finkel beating out a window Marianna kicking contest midway through the year\nUs beating the patriots and taken over the AFC is not happening just not happening\nLike there's something to it man as much as you don't like it everybody's got a friend who is always late but he was always showing up late is always late but you know what if you know he's always late at least you know at a time out for it hey man how long 'til you're ready or give me a half hour or so in our Fifteen\nWhat it is man that this is just you know this is the better they lying I support Carmelo Anthony because everybody else goes against him I support Jay Cutler\nPart I support Nick Saban\nBecause everybody else hates them\nI mean but to turn this into some sort of a story that it's actually making headlines I actually wish like some of these Web sites would come out and say All right slow news day here's what we got\nMeet you at least like a slow news day here's what we got some lying bad it's like a it's like you get somebody a ... a card with no cash in it for their birthday\nJust to me that says you\nWhy don't you just told me he ran out of money you get\nYou can't just suddenly you rented a money don't waste my

know trying to get into radio and doing some other things and it paid the bills and the money's good ... you know if if you're good at it but just the constant having to sell\nTo convince somebody

doing it for a living and they're picking Conor McGregor to win this fight on Saturday Night even though the conventional wisdom if you just actually took away the emotion and everything else to go along with it you would probably say yeah could be just got more tools in the toolbox\nThis feels like a yeah definitely it could be fight\nBut because Conor McGregor is so good at Disney such a good

that was all do better than junior\nOr calling out the often\nCalling out his team doesn't have heart energy now his head coach pat trimmer I'm also spoke sort of denying that saying oh it's about execution it's not hard but more of a politically correct answer so\nI thought there's there's a couple of ways that we could take this conversation right we we can take back on this conversation we could take it a couple of different ways now um we could go one way and talk about um the giants the rest of the season what's the future like in New York which will be a catchy headline for\nA G Men

I Want some new blood and now you're just pissed off at your team wasn't that good\nFor that long like it and and the comparison I was making like when I hear people talk about God I really love to travel or I Love new experiences no you just don't like your job you don't like your day to day life that's why you're always trying to get out of town\nJust say it\nWhat's your favorite day of the week friday why because the weekends coming up okay so you don't like your job it's okay but it's probably just said there's nothing wrong with it just say it\nLike it just you know I mean like the patriots there just consistent like you know you're going to get with them like they don't need new experiences you don't need any of that now you're going to get the same thing they're going to win a probably tend to eleven games a year\nThey're going to win their division they're probably going to get a first round by they're going to host at least one playoff game and they're probably going to the Superbowl\nDiminishing if you want hate on and if you want facts are facts they're better than you and they're more consistent than you are but I Will say this and this is the one thing that I Would encourage patriots fans to ... and a lot of people think that I'm a patriot ball washer I didn't grow up I didn't grow up in Boston\nAh I'm not a patriots fan I don't support the team that they're not my I don't I don't run around with\nA stuffed animal a ... that's supposed to be built ... face on a llama and pet it when I go to bed I don't do any of that crap I'm just calling it as it is they're better than you they're better than your team\nFacts are facts\nI Will say this about the patriots they're good but how good are they really\nDo we know that there are a good team they're always going to be a good team I mean you don't you don't have what I was mentioning that level of consistency unless you are a good football team but how good are they so let's take a look and identify their when so far\n... coming off a major knee injury first game back\nIt's also the first week of the season ah Jay Jay ... was coming back after a lengthy absence and dealing with injuries themselves and that is we come to find out Houston yeah they're just not a very good team just not\nThey shouldn't have a wind right now if not for Frank writes trying to set the tone and going forward on fourth down in overtime and his own territory you know to show the organization and the team that I've got confidence and you\nIf not for that Houston as a win that game if either finishes in a tire they lose\nSo New England beat a team that should be when Louis so that's one number one when number two they beat the Miami Dolphins I think we started this slowly figure out that the Miami Dolphins maybe aren't that great of a team\nMaybe they are the real deal like we thought they were there we are we're slowly starting to figure that out okay like\nIf you actually identify Miami's Lanza not exist you know there's a lot of circumstances in their banged up tennis the week one craziness rookie quarterback and Sam Donald\nThen you saw in Miami\nThe Oakland Raiders when the humidity was like two hundred percent and the raiders were wearing black jerseys and it's Ninety eight degrees out are\nYou starting to see okay well maybe Miami doesn't really now Miami find themselves atop the division you had almost a touchdown underdog on the road against Cincinnati\nAnd then the New England patriots beat the colds look the culture\nOr banged up they one of the game banged up but that shouldn't have been a surprise to anybody what anybody on Thursday night the patriots always beat the colds just like they always beat the dolphins\nSo now that we know all that\nHe looks the often looks different ... go to guy it's his boy they have instinct chemistry puts up some decent numbers first first game back Josh Gordon is performing well\nJosh Gordon a you know I had a couple of catches week one then he caught a touchdown pass second game with the patriots Josh Gordon is in the end zone Sony Michel look good\nI don't know the last Sunday that a dependable consistent running game like that Sony Michel with looks looks pretty damn good almost a hundred yards rushing on Thursday physical runner adds a new dimension\nRob Gronkowski was healthy enough to go on a short week which tells me that that that's a guy who you know is dealing with pretty good health considering all the injuries he's adding his career and then Brady is always good\nBut did that performance over a bang up cold cold steam on a short we tell us anything new about New England so you just got to ask the question yeah they're good but how good are they and to me if you want to get the answer to that you gotta wait two weeks\nThe next two weeks we'll give you a better reading on the patriots because you get Sunday Night Football against the Kansas City chiefs and then you're on the road against the bears\nThat's when you find out how good this team is\nAll acknowledge they're going to win that division they do every single year you can pencil in a minimum of five\nWins for the patriots every single year just based on their division they're going to go five in one if not six to know and they're going to lose one game and it'll be on the road and it'll probably be the dolphins because for whatever reason they get to South Beach and they just don't play as well remember the game Jay Colorado Monday Night late in the season\n... Fox Sports radio\nUp here just a couple of moments one of the most shocking moments in college football history\nThey are also uh ten minutes from now this is the dreaded double tease you never want to use too much kids never tease do much in radio but I Do need to let you know the ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio we will play match game after dark All right we dug it up grabbed the shovels\nDug up match game after dark\nLast week and we will have a back a brand new addition coming up ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio or last hour we played pro wrestler porn star I'm One of the guys who participated in progress or a porn star he is disputing uh one of the names that we used\nA Veronica vice\nHe says ah it's the name I found was a pro wrestler he guessed porn star he went and Google searched Veronica vice and he founded that's also a porn stars name\nSo look a little bit of controversy but I don't know what to tell you I'm In ah sorry I don't know I mean that was the rules them the brakes none I could do for you that's it\nRight you're going to try and also a dispute a senor surveys as to whether or not that's a pro wrestlers name come on man\nAll right so a lot this is a stunning absolutely stunning or what we've just heard um and then I Am totally taken back by blown away at what I heard earlier on friday\nSo Alabama head coach Nick Saban\nGuy or dude\nNick save and he's in the intro to the show love Nick Saban you can't stand him you think he's miserable I Love what I Love his success I Love that he's a red asked I Love that he would never do this show in a million years because he has no idea who I Am\nBut I still love him\nI I'm willing to put my personal feelings aside to show him my love I personal feelings aside over there\nI think he's entertaining I think it's fun and so Nick Saban ripped students at Alabama for not showing up to the game against a Louisiana laugh at the raging Cajun ...\nAnd you can feel whatever way you want to feel about it and say well he's out of line\n... ... you know don't schedule such a cupcake opponents\nOr if you want people to show up you know make a better schedule blah blah blah blah blah listen\nAlabama gets criticized all the time that they don't play enough tough ... non conference opponents yet every single year they open up the season in a neutral location against the big time powerhouse in every single year they blow 'em away every year\nThey also play in the SEC west south is division and football every year\nAnd for whatever reason people still pick on Alabama and it it's similar to the patriots talking about the patriots they have for the New England patriots Alabama's the patriots a of college football you can't stand it you wish your team was that good they're not Alabama's better than you are deal with it\nAnd so he ripped students were not showing up to the Louisiana Lafayette game\nI'm not one to tell people how to spend their money I'm not going to go all in on Alabama students maybe they weren't dreamland barbecue or maybe there was a ... some toga party the night before they showed up late whatever So Tim T.

things are better left unsaid or unspoken I think that that applies to a lot of things um I think it applies\nI had a a just an anti a grip of lotto scratch yours that I'd gotten for Christmas or holidays or or other holidays or birthday or whatever and I'd forgotten about him\nAnd so what I did is when I took them in I put them under the scanner dusty whether or not they were still good\nBecause lotto scratch yours have an expiration and like in small print on the back of a lotto scratcher and I'd forgotten describe I just forgot I forgot I had him and I found them in a drawer and home took him in got 'em scanned to see whether or not they were\nGood and then I found out none of 'em were good and I threw them all away\nAnd I had a buddy say why didn't you scratch him as a man or it wouldn't have amounted to anything I Would rather not know could you imagine\nScratching one of those off finding out you won like fifty thousand bucks and then you go take 'em to go cash in\nAnd the person at seven eleven says oh yeah sorry these are expired like I Would just rather not know like just don't even tell me like it's not just like don't you know I I Would rather certain things you just don't want to know I don't need to know it's fine\nLike I also don't need to know how a cow became my cheeseburger I don't eat it\nI don't need to be having boneless wings buffalo wild wings and have them show me from birth\nThe chicken and how it got to my plate next to my Bud Light I don't need it like I said there are certain things that you just don't need to know right like the it's the two minute review Indiana and the NBA the last two minute report dumbest thing they do first of all\nWhat's the point\nCan't go back you can't correct it you can't take back the points you can't pay back the when the last one\nThe game so this two minute report to the NBA does like just why we wasting or to even come out with that watch the games over toothpaste tube you can't do anything about it it's\nDone\nIt's just you don't need to know like I don't need to know what was on those waters scratch yours it wouldn't have done me any good to throw away the hell out of my face I don't I don't need to know I don't want to know\nI I don't I don't need to know what happened to the cow on its way to my plate before it turned into a cheeseburger I just don't need to know that stuff all the NFL\nOr has decided to ah\nWell they're going to ignore all that and they decided to come out uh with a a a little something on friday right so the NFL acknowledged on friday that there was an errant whistle and it cost the browns a fumble recovery and their overtime last of the raiders on Sunday\nNow if you remember there were a lot of odd plays in that game and buy on I mean crap calls in that game um you know the spot\nRoughing the pastor so on so forth very very bizarre game but the call came I guess there was a little under seven minutes left in regulation their car lost control the ball miles Garrett recovered it\nI'm\n... and and he was hit on the thirtieth yard line Garret recovered it and he became running towards the end zone but the referee had blown in errant whistle\nBecause he thought cars for progress will stop now the NFL comes out and says a as a matter of fact uh we ruled the pastor stop for forward progress than we killed to play this is not for progress obviously this is a fumble we should uh not blowing the whistle\nOkay why are you telling me that we lost the game like I don't need to know that [laughter] I\nYou don't need to release information that does nothing could you imagine if you're a gambler if you're a a degenerate slinky gambler and you're the browns and the money in line for like fifty Fifteen thousand dollars\nLike you're eating Rahman and drinking out of a coy pond\nBecause you blew all your money on that game only to find out that the Russian Blue the call late and I had an impact on how the game went\nI I don't like what what point does this do anybody any good I Would just rather not know\nIf your wife calls you up and said hey by the way honey I'm having an affair is your first question who give me as a measurement\n[noise] no I don't want to know man I ...

me great you guys for the call call I feel even worse about myself\nI I don't like I just don't need this nothing good comes of this stuff\nAnd the NBA does it and the NFL does or trying to be transparent no\nYou're trying to over correct in by over correcting it's a problem now now everybody feels like they got screwed now there's conspiracies out\nI just ban it it it's at a certain point I Would just rather like let's just move on man it just move on it just it it's over it's just like we just we just got to move on I'm like hey babe I I heard a rumor yeah what's going on yeah I heard

here I promised that are coming up here are just a couple of minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio\nA pretty good little uh Saturday of college football we got ourselves a pretty decent little Saturday of college football a number nineteenth taxes number seven Oklahoma noon eastern time on Fox you got LSU Florida\nAnd listen I I Love Fox Fox college football I think those are the best job\nOn my radio ... when a calls games for Fox\nAnd let me tell you something man when at CBS FCC music comes on I don't it just does something to me I I I don't it it just you start thinking back you start all those it just feels like Saturdays\nIn the fall twelve thirty kickoff out here in Southern California FCC covering college football in the south you hear the music you\nJust it it just\nI don't every single week like that it seems like a damn good game I don't know if it's just an FCC or whatnot but every single week the SEC rolls out a decent games you can criticize Nick Saban and you can criticize the SEC and their non conference schedule and all that stuff but when you hear the ah\nAh SEC music on CBS damn\nJust do something to ya um and I was talking about this last week now I think\nAbout the Big Ten like traditionalist college football you know sometimes you think about man things are so good back when you were a child or I used to remember this place and I was younger and everything seems like it was better all these years later when if you really think back and maybe it wasn't even that great at all you're just sort of romanticizing your youth\nUm I did that\nWeek I was talking about man I Wish Big Ten football would have their best games on earlier in the day and then a few hours or a few hours later one of the ...\nI grew up on Miami, Florida state\nHow many people actually realize the Florida State in Miami were playing this weekend\nI grew up on that some of the great games you could ever imagine\nIn a college football season we're Miami, Florida state and how awesome they were and every time those teams played it went down to the wire there was a wide right wide laughed incredible play's incredible players I mean they're playing on Saturday and I don't even know how many people even know or care\nAnd yeah it speaks to Florida state's not well everybody thought they were and you know Miami football isn't what it used to be but damn man I I remember those were being some of the great games in college football\nSo All right uh and by the way a ... I mentioned my radio ... will be on the call for eastern time on Fox a number three Ohio Ohio State and uh and Indiana so\nOdd ... do you guys have CBS or is that what you're getting me to uh being yelled at and the other studio or so I'm\nAll right Jonah socks Fox Sports radio comedy live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios alright so piece of trash talk here on earth us our we have a a piece of trash talk here on Fox Sports radio so\nSeattle wants to NBA team right Seattle wants to the NBA team and daddy preseason game in Seattle on ... on friday night so they went back Golden State playing the Sacramento Kings\nAnd so it was the first game at the ... in Seattle since the sonics last first or an NBA game\nPre season or not since the sonics less Seattle to moved to Oklahoma City so Kevin Durant showed up to the game he was wearing a sonics Jersey old school I Believe is Shawn Kemp Jersey um\nThey played this game on friday night and everybody's all about man let's we got to get a team here there's talks about hockey team going there gotta get basketball in in the city of Seattle you know it's a shame that they left they went to Oklahoma City look what they could have been\nLegendary franchise so many great players what a bummer and see you see all this you know man this is just just great great great stuff in the city Seattle\nAnd while you're thinking about how wonderful it was ... basketball back in the city of Seattle you fail to realize what happened in Seattle earlier this week now Mike the nightmare is our executive producer here at Fox Sports radio Mike mayor\nOkay um first of all I'm not surprised that\nMBA players have wives and girlfriends or professional athletes have wives and girlfriends that I'm not surprised be surprised if they did know yes I mean everybody knows that\nYou you've you've heard the stories I actually remember the Steve McNair order this on our fortunate murder or who I mean there's that lab murder suicide ... there's a lot of details that that don't add up but I remember\n... and if you talk to players um they'll do so yeah I Know guys who completely shaved up after that that scared them in thinking man I I'm I'm being foolish I'm fooling around them going behind my wife's back\nHow do I know I'm not going to burn a bridge and something like this could happen like that scared a lot of guys because that was the guy\nWho was fooling around on his wife and she got attached and he's sleeping on fourth of July in his you know a bachelor pat\nHer house you out on the side some in apartment he out on the side and

a good idea to see your wife and your girlfriend in the same arena not that far apart from each other\nI mean like somebody's got to know something right they get just man that's crazy\nWell the thing

going to go that far to to just to showcase what it is you're working with you know I mean at that point you may as well just having sitting right next to each other\nBut it's just even get away with it right honestly I Wonder if I Wonder if guys have done that just to see if if there's no way that they'll know anything or maybe the girlfriend knows about the wife but not vice versa and then

decent games for the most part you know they were they they were good and then you know for ... it it seems a little bit um\nI guess what is what's the word I'm looking for ... it seems like it doesn't have a lot of inspiration his first couple of games because like I watched the Milwaukee game yesterday and it was good for a couple of innings and then\nYou know Colorado kind of lost it you know the sort of a and their guys weren't hitting you expected I expect to see a lot of hitting from Iraqis especially when I was one nothing ... yeah yeah yeah so you know I I understand the purest out there that like you know good defense good pitching and all that other stuff I'm\nI'm I'm just one of those I I Want to see you know I might I might ladies chicks thing alone ball so do I want to

Martinez who has been you know the to me\nThat he was the signing of the all seeing home and if the difference right yeah and he has been all year long he eats a three run Homer to get it all started there were all five nothing yeah\nAnd then they have to hold on it gets dicey\nArid judge lead off home more than nine to make five four but ... and she changed three straight pitch it yeah this second pitch was a cookie right\nDaddy daddy chopped for a strike and then he ... then they get them on the on the ... on a curve ball that's\nAdam right after when he took that oats that the older ones fast ball down the metal that four\nSeam or I was I was shocked and then you know then he strikes out in the voice out strikes out then the red Sox hold on to win game on\nIt's been well you know what is a great time of year you know hockey started when I landed in LA I think the kings are playing the sharks I saw that on the TV or watch the end of the Dodgers game I mean those are so ... it's it's a great time of year we talked about October is a great my\nBeat out and that it's it's the best the Dodgers the Dodgers where ah are dominant right the Dodgers just started just another class with the Braves Shaw was ridiculous last night and talked about you mentioned him at the start yeah Clinton curse Shaw\nMeant eight innings only three strike outs but he was economic what his pitches ... eighty five pitches\n... eight innings is shut out ball just chill hits he gives up a lead off double to cool the and then that's it other than it than to and they feel the hit yeah the rest of the way man and yeah\nAnd they didn't get it gave me you know reassurance at what an ace is supposed to look like I mean and it doesn't always have to be\nThe caves up there when you talk about but you talk about a true ways as you mentioned managed himself for all those innings you don't see a lot of that in these days you don't have a lot of pitchers going distance because they are to be the way managers or treat them with ... and all this other stuff but he was a true ways last night\nMatty would hit the big home run yeah\nAnd that gets started look I I don't know how I don't know how they [laughter] I don't know how to breath rages can't compete against no I ... yeah yeah and I was wondering I I'll be honest I was curious if it land that could give them a series right Dodgers series because they're the\nEven if you are right well you know like if anybody knows\nIt's freaking me out the guy was should the third base out of home plate next to this blond he's got to put on and like links said\nOh a fencing type of mask\nHe looked like James and know what you look like it was I don't we like ... ... [noise]\nI did it look like each he was sitting in the front row it ... it looked like ET was sitting in the front row\nI mean it was crazy I Would like I couldn't I couldn't catch the only game I could watch you to do that oh my God\nThe things that things that people do behind home plate like I was I was saying that there was um I was watching the the bird game because the umpire Katie is a good friend of mine who smoked cigars go used to live in Phoenix um uh and he was when I was so proud of your mind home plate and then and then and then to the left of him\nThere was this blonde lady had short blond hair and there was this guy I think he was wearing them\nI think it was when it ... or something he where he he stood out but the reason why was the ladies stood out short blond is every time she wanted to ... to do something\nYou know like get a strike out or hit a big hit it hit a deep ball she put her hands together remembered I Dream of Jeannie away Jeannie blinked yeah yeah yeah I imagine she would do that every time one for every pitch and he caught my eye was like\nWow really you think you think you have control over it and so she kept going up forever [laughter] and that's the one that's one stood on the Milwaukee oh\nMy God oh that's great yeah I mean yeah you're right that this one just just got me a you know I was damn or five sound engineer so I Would say did did you see the video\nA of the the ghoulish a narrow [laughter] I just dry you you didn't watch the game live\nUh no I didn't catch that one like that is\nYeah I like I don't understand I I don't say worn out there yeah I don't know if it did you watch it do you where you distracted by did you see it\nI honestly did not see it to be honest with you I miss that you don't want to make that part I watch the game I was in and out I was doing a lot at once I was working as a game you know how to lose\nYour I well I Am the fake I'm watching the game and like all of us I Can't stop looking at this thing [noise] so then I started to wonder so I was getting my friends have Bob them like you do you see that's what's going on then I start to wonder what's that Tom Brady at the game\nRight like Tom Brady that want to be seen so yeah the ... at the fed and I think bad at all I I [noise] the bigger the bigger\nQuestion who's the blonde you're sitting next [laughter] 'cause the ... which is the [laughter]\nYeah right right right yeah but I don't even know when she was whether\nWell as they were close enough you know given by association [laughter] couldn't have\nBeen Brady was like this during the past ... says I Want to go see these vendors sat Jackie's\nHe's big time and he's got a couple of boxes probably for himself now\nWell and this is creepy yet linked just sent it to him here I'm\nLike a man without a face [laughter] going on while that is really creepy\nSee first I thought I was wondering is is the network\nBugs and the guy I think so [laughter] because they look like it may look I'm I'm right now more than a front row behind home plate but I don't want to be seen so cause you block my face out here [laughter] ... yeah well it was somebody like Mumbai it was somebody of somebody\nWho's ... ... ... I don't know I I I didn't I wasn't sure the ... winter yeah there is if any body\nI Need to know what the deal is it's not [laughter] or their theories eight seven seven nine ... Fox by the way I read just\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox if you had theories you have a right is\nBecause he'd freaking me out man it's freaking me out man it's freaking me out like you have no idea it's freaking me out that title year out by that time it is I Love October I Do I Love it I Love October I Love October for one reason\nAll the sports ... mine's right it's a great college in of all the sports my favorite month\nOf the year October isn't yes nice my love and I'm and I'm a Halloween fan so obvious to go and do what they were driving up as when he when he was on his I dress up every year by what are what are you going to tell you that they do I don't know whatever hits oh well I I let the kids choose my costume right okay\nSo whatever they want I last year I was a a\nSome sort of the dinosaur finger and something I had some craziness going sometimes or\nThat that that the the the big one wanted me to wear so I go wherever they like what's your day Lincoln is a big\nJay of college football huh and uh just just to get you up a little bit of it it's gonna be fun because there's some really good early games obviously Texas Oklahoma Red River rivalry yeah and I'm I'm curious because Texas once you'd come football man surprising\nSo I didn't think Texas out of them are especially when you weigh they've started against Maryland but since then they have played some good football in Oklahoma for what it's worth with all the talent they have and of course they have some injuries is issues as well\nBut for all the talent that they have it seems like Oklahoma has a net terrible knack of letting people hang around or just make things interesting at times they're not as lights out as you would think that would be ...\n... ah in especially in this series yeah\nLook you know we all saw army and army hang around push Oklahoma overtime yeah yeah\nSo I always stayed hung around on them\nEven usually early hung around bell or for up until the fourth quarter yeah ... was in the game against Oklahoma so I'm curious to see if taxes could keep ... I I'm I have my doubts but I'm curious to see if Texas can connect\nWith them well of course yeah I mean I I think we're right now to this point the most impressive when is the ... win over TCU right yeah I'm In you know and and you look at them and they're having a for a four game win streak says they drop that want to Marilyn their hot or do they have enough to to stay with them for four corners that's that's the big S.\nIt's a big question\nThe ah there's some there's some good games today though uh ... again ... Texas and Oklahoma we talked about Ella shoe and Florida number five dollars should I still think that's too high for him against the twenty second ranked Florida Gators\nI [noise] I'm\nTraveling trouble reading this game Florida and LSU yeah well\nFlorida has a hard time getting her off and started sometimes and you know LSU has their issues are scoring so expect a low scoring game if that if that's the case then it definitely favors the the tigers\nThanks so absolutely you think it favors that the if it if it if it's a low scoring game I mean it's it's it's a big if in which team's going to show up 'cause I I like ... defense but you know it all fits that some some some trouble guards on hard time getting\nThe ... and ... and looked forward is often says no Joe ... is is no juggernaut either ... right right you know aren't learning\nYou know and they\nI'm I'm ... I'm curious because I all those quick\nTight there on the receivers that I I'm not sold on Florida's off at some line and whether or not they can handle that to me is the difference maker for hours yeah yeah yeah you and I ... you like kind of see that the same way Miami, Florida state's is always a fun one chains they see for forty states used the\nMask one yeah yeah yeah for the state's struggling I I think Miami I think Miami mainly for for the fact that it's that in state rivalry that takes over there I think I think we'll see it a good game out of Miami Today yeah yeah I think you're right\nOr burn Mississippi State tonight when now but good game are you waiting for all burns it really kind of flex\nI was thinking would sooner or later you're gonna have to find a way to separate themselves before they get ready for the big game against Alabama right I mean because you know as dominant as Alabama looks you know you're trying to figure out who can possibly challenge them who's going to make things interesting how the less I in in you know be\nDavid unimpressive I I look they beat watching right start the season which was a good when right then why she came back and became much we forget\nYeah yeah yeah they came back a little bit of a Washington had their problems in the red zone and three trips down there and I think I like humor with nine points so they lose to LSU at home and an end and an a game I went back and forth they beat Arkansas and it was not very good and uh\nThey uh the the against other Mitt state eke out a way mhm there there are fetches is like sleeping in the game yeah and I got to go play Mississippi State I don't know I'm curious to see what what they're all about\nOffensively they could move the ball Penn State's defense we all thought it was going to be an up and down shoot out like the big twelve it was it was a competitive it ... it wasn't even really competitive\nAnd then all of a sudden in the fourth quarter penalty ... one of the quarterback was horrible yeah yeah yeah Haskins horrible yeah Haskins just got ... there was pressure does face every single a bright lights yeah he yeah he melted and one of his early now did everything he possibly could end the biggest problem\nYou've got a trace makes ... it was putting out like a Heisman level performance like he was doing everything and the decision was made read option and they hand off the ball it made zero sense to me if you're going to find your they're fed worked we wouldn't be talking about it\nWell I mean that's that's all right away but ... but I gotta do what they do call it was a horrible cough your hair back all your words\nYou have that out so I but if it works it's still terrible call ... ...

I think there for ... I I look I Love Phillip Rivers no one there was more crossing Patterson the chargers they've got an offer that's just starting to use Melvin Gordon like the rams are using ...

[noise] the Vikings one show\nIn one of the night do real I don't think that gays knowing what happened and what is this what this level that they're playing I expected this deep and let me more better than it has been\nI mean it's probably in the lower and lower third of of the league as far as ranking statistics [noise] they're they're porous on the second it on a second level the secondaries given up way too many catches a difference makes it catches on the game\nAnd I just I I'm I'm On the fence I don't know how much I Believe in them because if they can snap out of it\nThey're going to lose that they're gonna lose this isn't real fast [noise]\nI still think there are there any\nDo you think this you think this division sense three teams of well\nI don't I don't well look you know again to me it depends on on Atlanta [noise] [noise] right [noise] I don't believe in Caroline and we'll talk then we'll talk about those ... those guys coming up [noise] but [noise]\nYou know I don't think it's out of the question they got to start when\nIf you look they've got a tough 'cause they got to go to Phil without area Philadelphia Eagles\nNow ... from the damage to juggle game but\nWhen you go one three in one now you're probably right well I mean look the only gratifying failing is on the backside you've got Arizona and you go to New York\nWhich shouldn't be winnable games for this but then you've got New Orleans you got Detroit and you get to see the your schedule I just don't I think they start off so far behind it's hard for me to believe that this the business is one of them really no way that you are so remember that but they're going to have one more I I I don't think they'd be the [noise]\nI was just going to say the thing that I've noticed a two week its point the defense has been playing awful I mean it was like attract me in that game on Thursday night but the biggest thing is jumped out to me they were going to ... well the rams or jog or not but it's\nThey've completely forgot how to run the ball like her cousin is having to throw in like forty fifty times the game and he's been playing was that there are parts of the other officer blinds is is not what it was but I Will say this and I work with her her cousin is playing out of his mind right now and he he's playing he's been awesome\nLike even even in the exactly yeah yeah it's that's the biggest thing that I've noticed that if they can get it together they add to your point I I I Know you you're not the biggest fan of case Tina and he's a big upgrade over case Tina and you could even see what he was he was going toe to toe with golf in that game\nAnd they could have won the quota so step on the star oh and the and the un can catch anything yeah but yeah that's it's it's

I agree with you but I Do think it's\nGetting to the post season I don't know if it bodes well for the Dodgers if they get into a series with Milwaukee or possibly even deeper into a World Series once again against the American league opponent regardless of who it is\nYou know I just growers man oh she'll be entertaining theories are showing it I think it's a great series\nBut you get into a battle of the ... I just don't see the Dodgers one and then gained Kelly Jansen hasn't been himself all season long either you know not withstanding the heart issue has been dealing with but since he came up the deal from dealing with that just hasn't been the same picture\nAll right let's look at the American league for second Red Sox Yankees or you know this is going to go five has to write model they want us out of both thinking am I wrong and boy yes\nOh yeah you can only hope you only hope that that's the way of looking and you have that high power ... from both teams obviously right but the the Trump Card for me at least and other guys can chime in is that Yankee bullpen and they keep all the completely agree is what makes the difference I there was like this\nAnd and this is this goes back to its point this is a theory that need seven games like I think it didn't and I think\nGames or or the other American League is that oh I mean these two series like every everybody's talking about Red Sox Red Sox Yankees I was telling people I was a man and and this is of course I'm putting a little bit of my bias in there but people are forgetting man\nIndians Astros it may not have looked like it yesterday but that's going to be a great series like you look at some of the pitching match ups yet Cooper didn't have his best stuff in her later was awesome now you've got cookie cutter Roscoe against\nA Gary coal and then you've got Dallas Tyco against my club and during game three you've got so many great pitchers in that series it's like an old school thing where as some of the other series were teams are going full petting the starting pitching is so good\nIn the Indians asked her series and its relegated being played during the day\nSo and you're just forgetting how great those two teams are\nThe no it is for me to go on to that it really is I still like I I'll tell you what I still like the Yankees and Mets series I Do I Do too I yeah 'cause 'cause the thing is like do you really trust David Price\nI mean I don't yeah I I I mean yeah you really do you really trust David Pryor watch David show you something yeah I mean well I have well is that like four or five years started it and he had a yeah ... ... out of the\nPIN he's amazing in the postseason right as a starter his horrible\nAnd then if you get new bullpen game as Figi alluded to they they've got so many artists like you can throw Britain and then like the sixth inning you could you could put out a ... Chapman you get all these big names in their bullpen that they could just roll Roberts and they could just roll all these guys out\nAnd like if they get a lead and you know they can bomb the baseball if they get a lead it's over like that game against that game against Oakland on Wednesday night like the second judge at the home run you knew it was over but he was it was over\nBoth men and it'd be something nice I like I like the Indians today too\n[laughter] okay I liked the interplay better they\nThey better play a lot better than they did yesterday 'cause that was a ... I Know that was a complete disaster America it was a complete disaster that and the only two runs they got wears off a wild pitching if it was bad like Hoover I I I don't know what's going on with him\nHe's got maybe a case of like the Clinton cursed shot thing where he can't come up and big games because pretty much since game seven of the world series and sixteen\nHe is sucked\nIn the last four starts that he's at and he gave up three home runs\nLike it velocity was down he just he didn't have it\nAnd then you go to the bullpen Cody Allen doesn't have it you're bringing Trevor Bauer he gets lit up it's just the answers are so good but if there's one picture that I can count on on the Indian staff to right the ship it's a Carl's Roscoe like he he's always he's been kind of a good customer on the road\nAnd I don't know I don't know about Garrett call I don't know I I don't know he's been great this year but I just don't know so\nI Know a lot of their their bad side to come alive I mean that's about oh yeah and ... they got to come alive\nYeah they're the ones that are going to win the series are going to win it bigger than what it was their backs looked at ... ... ... the Astros were sluggish combination I don't know if if you do you remember yeah a lot of talk about that line all\nThis you know stronger did not have a good second half used bag da you did not hit well it said they were ... uh same thing with email to ... did not have a great second half\nAll those guys except for Korea always deep in game one so all it takes is just you know one snap and there's often says we saw all last postseason uh making just ignite and you know again to line up can catch fire and the last line up you want to catch fire of any team in this post season I think it's used in because\n\n\n\n\nAre you in the water you know twenty four seven three sixty five\nWere that stress voices they make you smarter feels like when you're wrong doesn't tell your friends\nYou listen to the right here clock horse rainy days yes Fox or something like that was more sway the attitude\nThe two twenty four hours a day sailing when we lived there all the old arriving ranges of an accent and takes on a whole lot more money in the red river showdown [noise]\nCovering Saturday a Lebanese every game these athletes they\n\nDiscover become a new car member discover car we'll all look as you've earned a dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more and discover dot com forward slash many limitations do a blonde we ought to do was to get them like you know that would be allowed to provide\nAbout sports radio studios Abu fun as we get to prepare for all those words so that you got everything on the doctor or you got pre season basketball but you have a base\nWhen I look at the top ten I think it might be sort of business as usual for the most part of the top ten not a lot not a lot of three match ups but should be some some good games I think it's always first the first Saturday in October is over some good games going on\nFirst things first ... rather\nThan other ugly week a triple em um it was I mean we were under five hundred and ... me and Sam we're all seven and ten but link ... ten and seven no and I and I got to give credit to link he was the\nOnly one of us to say Penn State with a point and it was Ohio State might have three and a half the only one by one so linking you were the only one to nail always\nJob coach thanks for the great coaching and forth and six great play call of you and I got to give a shout out those I think the being the only one to call floored over Mississippi State than that just ...\nWith their energy job yeah gator air jaw shot yeah it was Thirteen six men around six riveting reverting riveted football\nYeah yeah very good very good\nOur boys let's let's get to it [noise]\nCollege selections for this week [noise]\nWeek [noise]\nFive of college football first Saturday in October here we go\nYour child right side [noise]\nArkansas all you need the project is the perfect his name was ...

I'm furious\nTo what you think when we look at this at this season so far and it's the height of pattern right you got when you when you think about where you're at right now the way you have if you have\n... you have the shanks yeah who are on beating and then you have the cardinals who're when Lewis and the rhymes on the right show only chew on being teams and won the women's team\nAfter four weeks\nAnd yeah we can all say we like ... cheese but you know how the league is rightfully turns on it it always does\nAnd flow when you think things are great and you you hit a couple of hurdles and and for what it's worth you know going into this weekend I think I mean of course we'll get into more of our picks but I think that Kansas City coming off a short week going up against Jacksonville I liked the jacks\nThe team that gets hot\nWhich ... where I'm looking at this look Kansas City and the rams\n... they're they're right there are there hot right now right\nBut do you come November December there's going to be a team or two\nThat get really hot and in our ... it'd be the vegetables Super Bowl champion like you could you stretch I dunno I mean it's you know sometimes teams go wider wire well I I wanted that sucked away this week is big yeah I I think\nI've got this uh Kansas City Jacksonville game tomorrow yeah so uh I couldn't get it couldn't get to where they want to send me to Kansas City type games so I see I'd want to miss this one yeah\nBut we want to see him again when you're ... [laughter] ... what what do you make 'em all homes I look I follow yeah all everybody's a foul ball the men ... when it comes to breakdowns he is the king at both the NFL\nWhere do you make ... homes man where you make it his kid that Monday Night was ridiculous\nWell like you know what it's like playing that mile high you know what I mean I I remember when it came up to you I mean people that altitude will jump on you\nLike nobody else now he goes up there and by Miller and jade way they chased her for what sidelines of the other side like all night long and that that was the only guy on the field that there will ever get tired yeah\nUm I ... in that game they were out ten or twelve forty seven to go that fourth quarter and I said this is this is how we're going to measure patch but home right now we're going to find out\nYou know it was just a pinball machine off that's right you're a kid he really play and leaders team well you know to to fourth quarter drives you know the overcame secular thirty I mean they had all kinds of obstacles and you know he did was just make one throw if you just look at the throws from twelve forty seven the courts the end of that gay guy\nThat was the highlight reel all by itself forget about the beginning and the first three quarters\nCan just make it off as he goes on I I think she does the wow\nWell you know 'cause I I just said look you know there are so many people out there in the world right now they're trying to take the game of football away from us\nThat guy when I watch him play he makes it like I was ten years old play football in the backyard and my brother because that's how it plays well he plays with just me first of all the talent is the talent but it just plays like it's just a game and it's just fun to watch it makes it fun to watch the game began\nYeah do you think you learn the you know there's been times where we've seen especially the chiefs last year I came out hot than kind of hit a little some black one when I thought they might have got a little too cutesy with any reading the play called\nSo a couple of flashes of it are on Monday Night but they were able to overcome it um do you think sometimes that Andy Reid becomes his worst enemy when he tries to get a little too creative with all the time when the U.S\n[noise] well the only thing about that so far link is they they they're not turning the ball oh yeah I mean they've got one turned over right now the first four games you know in in homes\nHe's touched it two hundred fifty two times ... away and he has had an interception now that might turn your those things kind of colored Chuck sometimes but he's got his\nAbility to kind of just moving the chess pieces around um [noise] yeah with the different motions what they do a tie reek and all that kind of stuff I mean it can get too cute except that it's working right now and so you can't do it until it stops working I think yeah\nA ball the link and I were just talking about these two teams were going to bribe balding or our ... ball the ah we were just talking about the rams and the chiefs obviously look to dominate teams for the journal\nTeams that you might have an eye on that come you know November December through the teams that all will could ultimately challenge Kansas City in ...\nWell I mean the patriots on Thursday night that's two weeks in a row now they put it together and that often looks like it's going to be scary good because\nThe speed that Gordon indoor set have are just makes that often I mean Edelman will do what he does and the ... with the speed element and then the running of selling the shell the last ... brown I mean that officers coming together pretty fast and we've seen this before but they're going to be\nA top five officers not hire before it in the next too much\nAbout the hatch now how about the catch ... that he was like ... it brings you know ... not a gap between the two of them\nWell it it I mean he was probably mentioned by choice but I mean it it is reminiscent of Randy Moss\nBecause they're together like that a true extra seabirds that can just out jumped people an outlet for them and you could throw the jump balls and you know I mean he's he just hasn't had that type of player\nSince Randy retired so I don't know it's it's early you know what Josh Gordon is bad and we know the demons if he could keep those in check because it looks like right now it's just too short weeks\nThat brainy does trust and he won't talk to guys he doesn't trust I mean it won't even their their physical out there but there is some sort of trust already that exist between the two of them\nWell let me ask you this and then the movie so we can get off the Kansas City jaguar how do you think this one plays out some gotta give\nWell look outside my window in Kansas City right now like you know and it's raining and um it's supposed to you know the weather may impact distinct heart now when I watched

good analysis there is that the reason why these quarterbacks we're doing so well because of the callers\nYou can't be a really good play caller I have a good quarterback or quarterback I'd have a good play color the good court you know if they work hand in hand I think that's the thing that people need to understand\nAndy Reid is one of the ... the top five to seven ... and the national football they ... what what the term that personnel executives used Jason is is a space creator he makes\nTime here and you're gonna throw to this guy right here it makes it easier for the young quarterback\nYou now seeing what Sean McVeigh the head coach who supply color for the rams what he's done for ... for you mentioned I don't want to take anything away from Jared golf but\nHe's had much easier time throwing it unless they occur cousins has had ... played football\nHe's been under dress because her off at the wind has been so bad but because of great play calling by John ... coordinator he's been able to play well probably at the highest level he's played that before so not only is it the great quarterback play but I think the caller is also deserve a lot of credit\nNo doubt about it we're talking with Adam Kaplan NFL insider Adam or if we give it away from quarterbacks real quick I gotta say\nWhat on earth is the latest was levy on bell the Pittsburgh Steelers running back\nAllegedly they had put him on the market they were absolutely no takers because nobody I guess nobody has an idea what he's going to do like like who's more this isn't an NBA trade you know where you're renting a guy or you know with the option to buy at the end of the season\nBut now all of a sudden it's the Steelers and loving Ballard talking turkey and maybe he comes back\nThey seem like they need him I mean James Garner look good against the browns but he hasn't been able to run the football since\nYeah I think let's unpack this ... a little bit here so my understanding has been for a couple of weeks at the Steeler still want to move him and the trade deadline isn't for three more weeks so the typically as we saw the late ... with the call max situation we compare to\nOther this with with bell there's not a sense of urgency 'til you have a deadline well the urgency for the raiders to move Mack was the start of the regular season or the herbal to do that whether you could argue whether they're good enough value but the fact the matter is they had a deadline hanging over I still think that there'll be more teams ... wall Ventura or get a list of\nProbably half a dozen teams that are very interested in Libya\nFilling in but he's not bell bell is the NFL's best running back he wants to pay like a receiver\nThat didn't happen [laughter] unfortunately yeah\nUnfortunately um ... he sold the tide girlie contract come down and after July sixteenth or if you remember that the Steelers were prohibited\nFrom extending bells contract that's the real problem here that they can't do anything with it until after the season so there are a lot of issues complicating this and I like your comparisons NBA deals NBA deals or or or certainly a lot different contract shortcuts structures different the guarantees are different\nMBA veteran contracts almost fully guaranteed all no matter how high it is where we know especially running back contracts\nThey're typically a two year structure and the rest of his non guaranteed money so this is what he fights\nIs flooding uphill battle than the issue with his teammates I still would argue if what if and when he comes in if he doesn't get traded\nThey're going to welcome and with ... with open arms I was going to apologize for leaving his teammates on remember they thought he was going to be back that's got to happen but in the end with Les beyond bell or ... this thing is going to be very interesting as we get to where the trade deadline of an late this month\nWe're talking with Adam capital in NFL insider Adam even if levy on bill returns I don't think it's a lay up that the Pittsburgh Steelers are going to make a run tonight the AMC title game this team had massive defense in the ... or ... holes all over the place they just haven't been able to rebound since that Ryan cheesier injury last year\nYeah I think you're right shaves years probably one of the better inside my back to the national football league I don't think the is impact could be a just\nTalking about the positioning place I think it's on the football team on the defense of one of the best defensive players they have maybe the best defensive player\nAnd the the the the thing that they're giving up but it's like with the falcons to the eagles and the Vikings they're giving up so many big place that's been a problem you Joe hymns that all the quarterback ... cornerback good player but he's not what he wants was the problem is that\nWhat we see the national football league there's surprises I Would put the Steelers are my top five disappointments a season or certainly the game and I'll be out to bar the Vikings at eagles both teams will qualifies disappointments after the quarter mark\nYeah Adam let me ask you about that Vikings eagles game do you feel this is a you know quote unquote Superbowl hang over or is this just a situation where\nListen the eagles have had a litany of injuries both sides of the football\nIt's going to take some time to get back to ... in a you know the timing on our fence but also the secondaries getting shredding I mean fitzpatrick lift them up a market scenario that had almost three hundred and fifty yards passing and now as you said you know current cousins goes in there which I think the best receive pretend them in the league\nYou know they do the eagles have major problems minor problems well how would you characterize their situation\nI think that talking to them they're pretty confident they're going to get this thing when we say short around the two into their own for\nBasic of it and get this where they need to and the and the ... you know it's not really good it's one of the worst divisions the national football league\nBasic they're going to get it back to where they need to get it now they're going to be as good as last you're probably not I don't think they will adjacent Peters left tackle at thirty six you've looked like a thirty six year old ... doesn't look the same he's got this linger quieter subs injury course wants his back for his third game is really good last week against Mario\nAnd the titans did it did a good job that was a really good game ... terms a quarterback play\nI think with the Vikings the striking is is you never look at the Viking stick they don't have a great defense but what has happened with the big players don't ever see in Griffin their star defensive and his out well he's got his personal issue\nThey may right now believe it or not the only have to help the defense of and so that's gonna be a problem going up against the eagles in Philly where they play much better the eagles defence of the road historically on a gym shorts at the ... not been very good or there's been a drop off the air at home this week I I think this will be a fun game\nI don't know if I was yelling that on air but that Alabama play that just went down with bananas so it's the tide and the guy breaks for tackles maybe five then he didn't find the tent and you get\nThe touchdowns on the board but I think they'll take it off and put it like the three what a crazy place Alabama member I gave out the first half tied favor by twenty three of my luck of the week\nThey're currently up Thirteen nothing after five minutes and yeah the touchdown is going to stand we didn't know the rules Steve Hartmann and also to me I I thought they would put it to three but it's a touchdown Pamela oh my gosh look at the stands there's nobody in Arkansas for this game\nThere is no home field advantage or the stadiums empty five minutes in Alabama fourteen nothing that first half over is lock city baby a quickly Texas gave up a duty to Oklahoma on its first drive\nUp the longhorns are back they're inside the tent about the score again\nCollege football I'm telling you great sports weekend today is going to be popping nine minutes you can't wait the super contest I reveal my picks on sixteen and forward tied for third\nMy man TA comes on your weekly he is sixteen three in one he's in second half a point Adamy he's got a really sad story I told you at the outset I lost out on Fifteen thousand dollars because of\nUh Jason Garrett just unbelievably bad play calling in the red zone\nWait to hear TA story he was even closer than I was we'll get to that in eight minutes now or what does it mean one guy goes says just fifth team minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance\nMeans you probably should have gone to Geico dot com Fifteen minutes ago right here we go every Saturday\nWe do my twelve pack the J Mak tool that we have a lot of changes that twelve best teams in the NFL now if you'd tally them up it's actually kind of a closer than we thought the AFC remember coming in was\nStart at number one we usually like to count down starting number one there's no doubt folks it's the\nRams are the best team in the NFL\nThere is no narrative here it's the ramp number one in the NFL number two\nIt took me a while but they are here\nThe Kansas City chiefs porno after that surviving\nA Monday nights scare in mile high they're cheap [noise]\nOr if for no I don't think there can be any debatable\nRams number one she's number two now will the chiefs last I don't think so but right now they're number two number three\nThey're back New England patriots three in one showed everybody the first three weeks was a glorified extension of the pre season\nJust just remembered the dolphins last week\nAnd there's a third of the NFL three in one number four New Orleans saints [noise]\nHaven't looked at impressive the defense is getting shelled\nI go see with the force but even the NFL three in one number five Baltimore Ravens number one in defense of New York for a play I Know the running games have been slow but they win it special teams every week I mean it's a good Baltimore Ravens team I think\nThey're going to be so good to moral against the brown [noise]\nThat I Do believe we're going to hear some or the ravens go into the AFC title game\nThe chiefs are patriots so I get the ravens is the fifth but even the NFL number six Philadelphia Eagles\nHasn't been pretty we talked about what that that with a Adam Kaplan [noise]\nUh an NFL insider recently it hasn't been pretty for the eagles but they're just getting healthy the secondary needs work\nFor now I got the eagles is the sixth best team in the NFL number seven the Minnesota Vikings\nKind of a last chance to write for the Vikings last stand one two and one haven't looked in ...\nThis is a really good team\nThey did when they need to look competitive eight they need a winner a ... year there's no doubt about that [noise]\nI bet them as a seventh best team in the NFL number eight to Green Bay Packers\nAnother team as it looked pretty [noise] they've got a\nDicey game with the lions here the receivers are banged up but\nThey got Aaron Rodgers he's breathing\nSo I got the Packers at eight number nine the Panthers they're coming off the by two in one don't sleep on the Carolina Panthers that ten best team in the NFL right now Chicago Bears\nUp folks I said there would be a playoff team\nI did this big video for Fox Sports\nLaugh at all what are you talking about Kennedy bears [noise]\nBears are legit that defense is real deal they are they tense best team in the NFL number\nEleven Jacksonville Jaguars three in one three in one jags go to Kansas City you're possibly the best game of the weekend um I Know is it the jags\nDid lose head to head to I'm going to say as a tool that seeing the titans\nSo why do I have the jags ahead of the titans\nIt was a bad spot for the jagged\nAfter their went over the patriots I Believe the jaguars or a better team\nThan the Tennessee So there you have it my twelve pack\nRams jeep patriot [noise]\nState that for ravens five eagles at six Vikings seven [noise]\nEight Panthers nine bears ten jags eleven titans twelve now if you're wondering where the dolphins and the bangles or had the dolphins high last week they just ... but I actually the bangles Thirteen\nThey've got an interesting game and we will be talking about that in super contest picks next jolt I mean this weekend has some good gate and then you could say that about the NFL\nTV ratings in four weeks\nI mean really this is a strong start to the NFL season now if anybody is near a TV I'm sure they are seeing\nA that there is going to be some Supreme Court news here coming up and that's gonna I think that's going to mess a little bit with what's going on and in some of this momentum simply because it's such a big story we're not going to get into it here\nI joke about getting into it but I'm telling you it's just not a topic that you want to dive into to talk to your parents about it or you know\nYou talk to your friends about it but I Would I Would advise for Thanksgivings ways yes this is David for the Thanksgiving table so you can link food at one another or but this is it's just a story there's no winter here there is no winter either side I'm Sorry\nI Do consider myself a bit of a centrist I joke that I Am fiscally\nTo the right of ... or you should be able to eat what you kill and uh I I I'm kind of a centrist when it comes to the social issues so yeah I Know that's a popular and everybody likes to say they are that well you know when it comes down to voting it's tough but uh\nYou know Ninety seconds is enough on that nonsense so back to sports after this my man TA joining the show we'll do super contest that's\nAgain we're hot this the only radio show in America where you get to top five super contest guys talking about their process in their picks that's next\nBut first good Isaac low income on the latest import\nJason exciting start to the red river showdown first it was number seven Oklahoma getting on the board\nThe corner of the buyer Hollywood behind the bank of profiling\nGame on Fox TV Texas and Oklahoma tied at seven exactly six minutes into the first quarter number one Alabama ran its first play against Arkansas and here's what happened\n[noise]\nThe venerable Eli Gold with the ... field is the number one Crimson Tide leads Arkansas fourteen to nothing midway through the first nice link West Virginia fourteen to nothing lead over Kansas with the five Twenty one more of the first\nNumber twenty Michigan State and north western or scoreless midway through the first quarter an update on the situation in Ann Arbor number Fifteen of Michigan in Maryland the kick off of that game scheduled for noon eastern was postponed because of lightning\nIn the area they are now planning to kick it off at one Fifteen east in the forty five minutes from now there was a ruler out there that they were considering eliminating all commercial breaks except for injury and coaching time out in order to fit the game\nAnd ... and ... they're not good so uh I was closed on this deal it didn't take 'em who your final two\nLatitude because you're going to be surprised that this one because it's not something that typically do but I'm taking the rams minus seven\nI'm In Seattle and it's funny Seattle's a very popular a sharp play you might actually see them in the top five a consensus we'll see you know I don't mind backing a big public favorite like rams or the patriots because there's coaching incidents coaching is so good\nAnd their office is so good and they run up\nYou've got the rams off a XO rest because it was that Thursday nights game um obviously they lose their heart and soul to defense and Earl Thomas and kind of an under under the radar lost and Michael Congress who played very well as linebacker for them Cajun rights so out so the completely decimated on science\nAnd that's not that's not the situation you wind up being against this war and often\nAnd the rents are scored thirty plus in every game this year which could mean I don't think this is gonna be any different this week\nTend to Seattle often score twenty three plus\nUh I I just don't see it the office of wind is still a major issue the rams defensive line puts more pressure than than any other team in the NFL we saw what happened last year in the same almost the same exact spot a St Louis went or the rams went to Seattle and put your forty forty three points on that ...\nI I just don't see any way that the adults in either a stop them on the fence or even score enough on office to keep up and I think this is a two touchdown winner here for the I\n... I agree with it largely my only concern was you know this is a one afternoon game the books are going to definitely needed Seahawks because all the money is going to be on the rams tied to parties and teacher so I just wonder those games you know went to Vegas badly needs aside\nSome how big it always seems to win at least that's in my ... but not so I didn't take the rams but I I have no problem with that pick tell me your final pick is the Redskins it is\nI remember I said I was debating between the dolphins than in others it was a red skins um you know I hate going and the reason the things on a primetime game but to me the spot was too good\nUm look you've got you got ... or uh you got a Washington coming off the awful by week extra rest here and I just really liked backing Alex Smith as an underdog and almost four hundred pound under dog he's twelve and eight against the spread of the road dogs\nAs an underdog like this is the perfect quarterback he's not going to turn it over he's going to move the move the chain\nAnd I think you know we're the same type of the worst pass the plants in the NFL I'm Out with him you know the fact that you can run and pick up first down since it's going to keep moving that change sea breeze off the field and offensively you you'd be surprised but the skins are pretty underrated defense the number one in the fall and allowing the few with\nA explosive plays through the air and number two in just overall cost offensive efficiency and they know they based their Rogers was a couple of weeks ago so it's not like they've got a you know ... or so I think they can do just enough to slow down breeze a Z fence and you know I think often those will put up to snuff points to cover and knock them to win\nBut I think it can be a lot closer than the six and a half\nRight so the only two similar we have our jets in red skins my other three and I'm regretting one of them now Vikings plus three against the eagles how happy you didn't look at that one huh\nYou know I've seen people talk about Minnesota is a hot it's pure tossup game I I understand that you know Minnesota needs the\nUm you know needs to win so to Philly and we certainly hasn't played grace\nI just like for the eagles at home are completely different animal than on the road I I tend to see last week against them so I'm just totally different different that defense or at home\nYou know the office of line from Minnesota to southern travel well they they really struggle and that's not the eagles defense of funk and really put pressure for look I get it uh eagle secondary hasn't been great so cause it might be able to move the bottom it to me it's just like no play I just didn't really high angle on either side\nAnd then uh I uh I took the ravens favor by three against your browns and the final one I'm kind of regretting only jets dolphins ravens Redskins Vikings yeah where are you on ravens rounds real quick\nSo I you know browser mighty and my idol I actually agree with you on this\nAnd the last uh Eighteen years if you look at the pro football or football outsiders Eby away metric of the worst special teams right now in the last Eighteen years they're horrendous from that side of the ball and that's what you know all the more special argue that so I think that could come down to to you know special teams play\nAnd you just get Baker baked or going against the ravens defense\nWho is getting Jimmy Smith back which is a huge factor so I I personally I think if I were to take that side I Would say for more I think it will be tighter game than you know blow up but I think it's one of those things that those those hidden or that in the ... and ... to play a condemned back like the ...\nIdea good luck man I Will be in touch on Houston art about air it is our super contests picks a you know I'll go on a rant here in a second about sports gambling and where I think it's headed a as we wrap up the show I just wanted to say I'm I Do

into that we've got the NFL we'll talk about a bit even the NBA but even the confirmation vote yeah I mean what do you want whatever you want we got him\nWell that confirmation vote which is going on right now or at the Capitol course protesters were outside we already know how this is going to play out uh it's going to be a fifty one forty nine votes and Kavanaugh is going to be the uh new associate justice on the United States Supreme court so uh we will watch\nThat it's it's been quite a while a show that I've been rebut it I really have I mean I I'm watching sports about Ninety nine percent of the time but I have to admit I I definitely\nDelve into the political scene and I'm very interested in Washington politics and just watching the extremes on both sides of the aisle is been a quite a circus\nYou know it has been but also it has been meeting that's just the way politics\nHave gone at least for the last forty years is yes it is I Will say this so obviously we were going to get into sports\nPointing in what you just said in in partisan yes where at no point our buddy Mike he'll who's part of Fox\nAh I Know Mike extremely well a very disappointed giants fan yeah ...\nYeah that's true but my God my kids weeded out something and I don't have a tweet in front of me but that just was\nYou know do we feel as though politicians are doing whatever's best for us the people are serving their own personal good or trying to get reelected and I said like two of them are the same you know they're trying to re elected so they'll do whatever it takes for themselves to win that\nAnd I said in a sadly no I don't feel as though politicians are doing what's best for us I ever and that's and that's troublesome because what you find yourself in these these crazy to base it left a writer writer left and this is like no how 'bout do what's best for the people I'm Sorry\nAll right well and and just to follow up and then close this out on our founding fathers would be spinning in their graves right now if they saw the makeup of Congress there's a reason Congress the city is at an Eighteen percent approval rating if you originally congressmen\nAnd senators senators were voted on by state legislatures they were never intended to be a popular vote in other words they would represent the state legislators are in each of the states\nThe idea of the house of representatives was they were the elected by the people of their ... they were absolutely representing the people but originally members of Congress all of 'em got nothing more than a PR damn\nIt was never meant to be a career right right right here was is that you got a local person representing the local community and they would come to Washington every once in a while and they get their\n... their covered their any expenses we've covered right so this idea of these career guys I'm they're showing a Senator Grassley or has been in Congress since Nineteen eighty one this was never the intention of our founding fathers with our federal ...\nThese people year after year making money salaries over a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars a year plus pensions for life and all of them have already intention of the federal government's\nAren't about eight or twenty eight to seven why did you tell me that gathered as if that\nWas a surprise is due to anyone but the rest of the time to be a producer here will do well first let me get I have a dream that one [laughter] okay so let's\nGet you a little update here we do have a lot of college college football going on we do have one upset brew in right now the ... Michigan State is down for teens three\nOr ... you could say coming in right number twenty they haven't been the same last couple of years I Know you're a big Michigan guy and\nThen telling you he's in trying to get to Michigan State back in the conversation but Louisiana home two oh one in three northwestern team is not the right trend right now we're also waiting for this Michigan Marilyn game to kick off\nThey'd been delayed by whether Michigan you're a wolves right now\nUh you know coming off and nice to win against a bad team but uh\nAgain and this is a Maryland team that beat Texas which right now is leading over Oklahoma in Norman by the way so Texas looking pretty good they sort of got off the snide when they wiped out USC and suddenly it looks like Mr Herman has got that program a trendy and the right direction and\nFinally I like what Tom Hartmann is doing and I I feel like I'm saying this week in week out I like what he's doing with the team I like what he's doing specifically often simply and I and I think\nHe's implementing his game plan has often said of course as we know it takes some time so they're getting stronger and I will have to say going back to Michigan I think they've gotten stronger than what we saw week one as well I think they've gotten better I think uh the quarterback play has been much much better um but we'll have to see once they start playing some some better teams I don't think Maryland is going to be a real contest\nYou can easily come on and get some Alabama in them where All right if it's ever seen outlets making twenty five but go ahead and boom I was going dominated by the way you see that part right there they always do the the go blue and they jumped that in a club supporter to um I got to hold that that flag day last year last ... years ago yeah I I\nI covered the game there are I guess UCLA back when Charles Woodson was a sophomore\nThis goes back to Nineteen Ninety six it was a thrill I mean any any time I get to go I've been kneeling stadium and Knoxville a hundred thousand plus I I look I I could live and breathe college football twenty four seven to me there's nothing like it I mean again\nYou see the NFL teams are packing a hundred thousand for every game no I mean it's it's unique to college football the pageantry\nThe history\nAnd the constant revolving of faces ... to me I look I I I obviously I follow the NFL I Love the NFL but to me in college football just rules the day always\nWrong what we asked me rest in peace that or the Dave Chappelle skit wrong um no I I thoroughly enjoy college football you want to know a true story the other one that\nWe do is coming from a bitter Michigan guy that realizes Michigan is no longer really relevant in the national scene but go ahead\nThat's coming from UCA who yeah let's see if you have the same last week I didn't use the LA and they get wiped\nOut by Washington and what time it will be a little bit or that I I actually have some a buddy of vitamins to the game normally you are oh cool he's got some extra tickets are so so your bitter about Michigan not being really relevant and as you want to do shit I I Will tell you this is the true quick true story of why so college football my love let's say you know Fifteen\nYears ago with equal to yours so it all in writing\nI Will say this is what happened true story\nSo I went to I have to start today I'm a mom of eastern Michigan\nSo while takes like Twenty years to get to get these um but\nSo during college after parties and not through parties or Michigan campus

Oklahoma in Norman we got about three minutes to go on the first out there so\nThat's what a turnaround they were ready to fire Tom Herman when they lost at home to Maryland in their opening a member of that some Maryland team was coming off all the controversy the kid dying and everything\nElse and completely the shoveled and since then a\nA tough one against San Antonio and then the blowout when it gets as sea so a Texas is trending well and now at twenty four to ten sooner is with the ball trying to get back in this game\nSam ... is he and your husband watches the one of your candidate you will find out later I Will but he's fallen out right now he's out playing Marie\nI'm when you're you're talking about passing yards and also on the ground and that's the thing of course that kind of Murray respected him to do and not that he's having a horrible game or anything but a ... I mean he's looking at a hundred and sixty one yard touchdown is run the ball thirty six yards that last such that was him running it\nSee right Texas up twenty four ten and I told you I told you and everyone else may look\nTom Hartmann has had success everyone was gone it often gets rolling they'd been explosive\nGive the man some time it's not fair in any walk of life where something has been either\nMediocre or really bad and we're like hey magic man or woman in any sport or any walk of I pay or maybe even some political office come changed everything and by the way you got two months to do it so give some give us some of these coaches some time now your guy I don't know what to say about to\nIn and I apologize right away I'll get sidetracked for one second and chip Kelly ... who used to be my partner here I talked to him yesterday and the reason I was speaking to him will NFL talk but he's also very close the chip Kelly and many of the people associate\nJust two and twenty he lost his last two games in Philly was two and four team with the forty niners Owen for UCLA ... says\nWhen he walked in gym or completely wiped out that program like they had nothing in return it their all freshmen right now so it's almost like a do over like you're coming out the death penalty would gym more as your head coach who helped\nTurn things around for well first of all you can't get any better you know it's obviously not gonna get any worse than what it is right now so he'll turn things around I'm I feel confident in that it's a matter of\nHow long will fans allow it how long will\nYou know the UCLA alum and everyone would be a patient but one of the things that the lesson learned and all of this and this goes to anything in life is the first time we see you\nWhat did you do for me uh and I think that lesson if you look at chip Kelly\n... now for the rest of his career we think of what offensive genius and we think of\nWhat he did it Oregon even not even did a however see before that I'm a he was at a new ... New Hampshire and he was ... wherever he was I remember he was six that's how I got the Oregon job successful there he goes to Philadelphia in the ass excess and so all we think of is\nHim and being so innovative being in our fence of mine that guy\nGreen smoothies that practice\nYou know and and and having this fast pace off as well because of that now all we think of him is in that realm so he's always going to be able to get a job somewhere because someone's going to go to Kelly Kelly they're not going to think of two and twenty his last one to as you mentioned\nUm it was a hamster by the hamster get all good call so it goes through first impressions\nAnd we see that all the time if if you the first time we see a player\nIn east clutch yes he has a player to you know whether it's Jordan whether it's a Kobe where this uh Derek Jeter something you know and and your clutch there were like oh that guy's clutch and they can miss shots he can strike out with you know you're you're Alex Rodriguez and you're not a couple of times now you're no longer collect\nMandy office of genius well get a job no matter what even if this UCLA thing doesn't work\nNow it will work at UCLA okay you go in and they gave him a five year contract he now believe me they have way too much money invested in chip Kelly better work\nOr in a sense of that evidence that have worked though 'cause like well I mean I'm ... I'm not talking about twelve and no but\nI I Am talking about respect about I'm any given time I'm patient I think most UCLA fans are patient and by the way the patients with Tom Herman paying off for Texas fans right now but they've been Jones III and they fired Mack Brown background had like what ten straight ten when seasons\nYeah you know obviously in contents were national championships and then he leveled off like at that age when plateau Lloyd out any harm Lloyd cars same thing in ... when Lloyd car you know and you know I'm stoop Steven\nOh I mean it it goes on and on and on Philip former at Tennessee we have another one I had already won a national championship or the national championship let's be realistic\nI wanted to switch gears for a moment here just to\nSee your interest okay and America has your interest right now it's called the baseball playoffs yes in the midst of the football season we got a little abroad talk we're going to get too as well as the NBA season was right around the corner\nWhere do the baseball playoffs fit into your October sports calendar\nGreat question ah I think baseball and most times hockey have the most exciting playoffs I won't necessarily say my favorite because I'm a I'm a I'm just I'm a basketball junkie right I mean I I I'll\nWatch a pick up game if I'm driving by I mean I I'm a basketball junkie so I'm more personally invested into the NBA playoffs I'm just because I Love it you know the and you get to see it and it's obviously see the same thing in baseball but you get to see I Love to just see the or how is this team that a comeback none of this guy came into the\nI don't think there's another disparity between the regular season greater disparity in in the postseason nature I look at I Would\nEnd the NHL there's even a different sport I mean they don't play the game the same way in the regular season you were on the same page as far as baseball postseason the very first game the wild card game or you know with the cubs and the Rockies was a classic example of why baseball is so unique\nNo one's complaining about five hours when you're hanging on every pitch that's that's true and and that's why all these people are constantly trying to tinker with a game and make all these changes of the game\nThis is the beauty of baseball in October because the seasons endless hundred and sixty two games blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd then we get into the postseason I mean the last two World Series\nI mean you you know you got seven games between the cubs in the in in seven games when the Dodgers an Astros and you are just you can't wait for that next game it at the end but like why baseball is great\nAnd then all of a sudden the pitchers and catchers in February like man this is a marathon so I don't know how baseball\nCan hold the kind of interests that I think most people have in the game in October for all the reasons you're giving that it is a different sport there's just a a a sense of urgency and also points out what makes baseball unique works in the month\nOf October I think some of it they can't change in the sense I mean where they could I don't think they will and that is the the amount of games I mean when I Know that you have a hundred and sixty two games\nThen game forty eight doesn't matter right which is where obviously we know college who what matters one day like today of Alabama was a slip up or even if they won but they only won by three that that matters to them I'm here we're looking at Oklahoma down fourteen obviously there and the red zone ... well that's why we don't really say red zone in college do\nBut we don't really say that ... it is yeah but technically they're red zone here you know look they're five and oh but you know hey last Texas\nUh because it matters um in baseball you could miss three weeks and come back and just say All right well hey my team lost a few games starting pitchers maybe one of them's hurt All right but I'm back in higher plenty of games to go\nOut and I think once you get to the post ... obviously it really truly matters because your team could eventually be eliminated a you start to see guys step their game up you start to see the pressure of of starting pitcher you started the relievers starts the the pressure of managers you know how long do I keep a guy we see that are obviously we it here in LA we see that every year the Dodgers\nWell how well he prepares I'm a short weight right and you know but I Can't say that I I don't know what you know when it's going to stumble I mean I think that's the big question now we all we know that can make rose and any sort of way now we know that he can lead to come back\nIn a pretty ethics passion I mean think about this the Broncos when leading by seven or more points at home have long since two thousand and ten while they hadn't squander the fourth quarter lead yeah I mean day close teams out there on thirty seven games\nWithout allowing a three hundred yard passer that was the longest strictly NFL by far\nBut you know what my home state it was amazing I mean how do you ... your ... second away quarter second away I mean you know just just an I told him\nAway from making a tackle and the guy and that he gets rid of the football makes a big play it was a remarkable performance by him but obviously the mattress watch Jay Leno Ramsey anti retail these guys have been chirping at each other a little bit and ... just a personal challenge because the cheetah\nTo me the most exciting player in the NFL\nI don't think you're alone in that one brother I mean unless you go through my homing that's what I call him he's my home [laughter] uh I mean I like\nThat by the way to Brooklyn yeah I thought there especially this week that she slept tackle right and so as to what was that there are parts of the fourth quarter that game was she able to put it away they just start slapping go Patrick my hopes like why are you asking me this question\nYou don't want to be it's remarkable in in a tweet out once actually he's making it this is like two weeks ago I said that this was his first real yes\nLike oh this is just what I Do you know he looks like how Aaron Rodgers looks now where oh we we know this is what he does he we expect great things for him and we can we got and I'm like this is only twenty three years old it's remarkable hey last or his\nArms his arm talent otherwise just ridiculous he told me for a fastball Ninety six miles an hour that the fastest videos that were clocked it had a chance to play baseball I'm Glad he's playing football go ahead\nWell he may do what we always want to look around and do maybe he'll quit his more to go play another you know because we all ... go blue choked\nUp no joke keep dry and Russell Wilson ... going to come into play I'm telling you I think at some point that the sea hawks team is headed in the wrong direction and remember he's got a contract coming up with the Seahawks he's already made a ton of money but I Believe that for twenty nine came his deal is up to like what he's doing and just think about it right\nI mean he doesn't want to have been the actions and all that kind of stuff yeah why\nHe's already got a Super Bowl he's already got tons of money doesn't you know obviously wouldn't sign for maximum contract but think about it I don't think the Seahawks from competition and creates ... Will Smith teacher I think there are a couple of other league\nThat's an interesting point not to mention you know as he just said no concussions in less physical a non factor when your body him more time to spend with Sierra whose wife ... days well I'll sign up to that old [laughter] on the Internet\nAnd honestly it honestly and their challenges well right I mean you've done this much then you can never missed a start in the NFL\nIs I mean think about it the guys but unbelievable until last year I mean five straight playoff the parents just simple title wrong into a great guy oh in every Tuesday you know where you find Russell Wilson and throw easy the children's hospital I mean what a wonderful person I Am so happy for his success and listen whatever sport it chooses to play in two

and at the memorial they had this great photo of him he was a scratch golfer playing with the great George Allen the former coach of the rams and I just said Hey Steve you remember George Allen look at this photo and then Steve went on for about five or ten minutes with numerous ...\nExactly thank you Steve ... they'll they'll jump in okay don't interrupt me as I tell people how ridiculous you are with your rain man sports knowledge\nOkay first of all they have sports jeopardy but you're allowed to participate and you'd doesn't have to be for charity because generally you know you're an on

are some listener who is going to eventually beat you because there's always the guy and you know from being in his business who ... who runs up on you when he does every single thing ever every stat since like Nineteen Fifteen but you're ridiculous your sports almanac and it's I'm going to be honest\nI I have stats\nSee I'm I'm not a trivia guy and and back in the past when I first came on the scene they did have these challenges against me and I always felt like they had to be somebody right right because usually they're experts in certain sports but not across the board\nAnd I remember one time it was a local sports brothers like Twenty years ago and they got their best trivia guys that like ten guys there and they had twenty questions he had to write out the answer\nAnd I got sixteen out of twenty I'm looking around the\nThe second place guy got nine so I was thinking\nThere's got to be somebody out there and I know there was guys on TV and everything else but I also knew behind the scene what was really going on there it's not even that I might think about sports and how I really got involved in sports was numbers\nI just was fascinated by numbers when the time I was a very small child and when I got my very first baseball card by accident just said baseball bubblegum that was a big piece of gum\nI flip the cardio I didn't know the players but when I saw those comes the numbers\nIt was love at first sight and this was what I Do\nThis is pretty much with everything else going on in my life um I work in my family and everything else this is how I passed ... is creating statistical\nPuzzles for myself did you have a girlfriend in high school and college I Need to know these in high school no\nCollege yes once I got the call us and the all had real clear that that that that makes sense okay good yeah than I Do I Do feel better than you know in high school\nYou know I uh you know I enjoyed yeah a little bit yeah not as much college but my point is okay make said no but it's it's it's a backhanded compliment what it is a compliment yeah once I got to college and realize there was an alternative okay that's good that's a good alternative it's ... and and someone a somewhat I heard someone say\nThey said they were talking about some and I can't remember who\nThey say super smart he's actually as smart as the other person I Know and they mentioned your name\nWould you like real ... who is that a former co hosts of ...\nHe's a he's smart you know the other smart person I Know is the apartment and I said Daggett now tells\nThe mile out well I I I tell you what about Michael Thompson who I Love dearly\nYou you would have if you heard some of the conversations that Michael ... and I would have all fair it would just blow your mind in fact some of them were so bizarre Michael and I were somewhere on the road we're sitting in an airport\nAnd we're getting into something about it you know Michael yeah he loves to make his points back and forth and back when Michael became my partner a number of his former Laker teammates warn me like Michael Cooper Kareem magic ... do you know he's a pain in the ass you do know that right\nWell I actually I'm sitting there with Michael and all of a sudden there's a woman sitting next to me she's got to be pushing eighty raises this old woman sitting next to me and all of a sudden I feel are like hit me\nAnd I I turned over she goes can you guys shut up\nI almost fell out of my seat I mean there's always see Barry ... would you guys shut up\nA while I was talking to other people are eligible for another touching going around it and again and now it's thirty one Seventeen wow and he is out here looking like he is going to make your husband watch lists next week may maybe next week well my my list each week is for the previous week\nI because we don't have a full slate again so I don't go mid game and suddenly move so let the games play on a update my ... my ... going last we may may be the exception to the rule but anyway go ahead you're right\nI Want to talk a little MBA with you right now All right 'cause I Know you're a love of the NBA uh uh my love of the NBA again I have a twenty year old son that's all he thinks about twenty four seven is the NBA\nI'm so I'm I'm really fresh in my mind the liberal on Iran with the Lakers as off and running and the returns are good uh Lakers having play defense yet\nBut at the same time Lubrano looks engaged\nAnd the staples for his staples debut and it was interesting about that game a number of my friends that were at the game they're like they were there early\nThis way I Want to your general you know we'll do I laid out on you know everyone was in their seats to get that first look up all of brought out a staple center he seems engage everything seems to be training well the big question is\nWho are the players that are going to be on the court most of the time\nWith LeBron and I've been watching you know some of the list out there of projected starting lineup for the Lakers I let me throw I'll give you a wind up okay and and see what you think\nSo I'm thinking right now for the Lakers this is my own line I'm going to have Ron\n... Ingram\nCaldwell pope Enron do\nThat is my starting by now you say well who's the center and that's something you have to play with\nHim even veil muggy has said look they're phasing out centers in his legs so defensively I might have coups ma but I ... I might actually have liberal but again centers or not what they used to be it's another thing we might get into a little bit later on but that to me will be the right combination on the floor when you say\nHere here's the pros and cons their line up the pros are of course you have a lot of position let's guys around we know could play one through five who's looking play pretty much to through for\nA and obviously five if they start right center in St Brennan and probably could play one through four and blah blah blah we we we get that so that's that's the pro is that you have a position was guys can switch defensively the issue is when you see it develop muggy if you saw the first couple of games\nHe gets some of the easiest points you'll ever get because he plays with a number on in Iran do and those guys are setting them up and even a brand and anger because it's so easy you come up a bit\nThan seven days for a a yard sign\nSee the car you know especially when a lot of guys are Patty I'm On the helmet that's usually even worst sign right there now the Oklahoma Texas game very entertaining right now thirty one twenty four Texas or Alabama scored again however the big story there is\nHagel by law he started the game ten for eleven for three hundred and thirty four yards and for touchdowns since then ... over to [noise] oh wow that's it that's it that's it didn't take him on the higher layers guy come out the eyes of magic is gone\nUp there and then other game right here we were talking about uh it's it's really close fourteen and twelve northwestern up to on Michigan State never who twenty ranked Michigan state's right a West Virginia is struggling against a Kansas that's games only Twenty one for teens we a lot of interesting games finally hasn't been the most simple lady in\nCollege football season a lot of domination early in the year and of course coming up kick off in about an hour Florida will be hosting LSU\nOr LSU one of the big surprise is this your rank number five of the country undefeated orange runs crew with a quarter back to a lot of people are talking about quick question to run a quick question everyone should I go to the\nWashington UCLA game obviously UCLA a terrible well should I just go just because that\nIt's the rose bowl that that's why I'm asking Rose Bowl how many how many games have you seen at the rose bowl a baby's three three years maybe three every time you were at the rose bowl it takes hours they get home I'm Sorry I don't need this I mean you obviously you know the big house you know a lot of great\nWhen when you see the rose bowl at night with the lit up sign there's there's no better shot and football there really is not\nHow about the fact that it will no ... no shot at all for you won't feel later line UCLA just you're you're at the rose bowl I mean there's so much history ... here you go ... here you go to Jay Leno horsemen\nMaybe you don't want to break down to twenty seven ten victory by Notre Dame over Stanford and then they own twenty ... earning ... alone should I go pop Warner going against the new ... alright\nGaskins I listening to me [laughter]\nI I wanted to ask you about\nA trend now we we have to admit sports aside\nWe're in a very divided country right now which really came to head once again with this confirmation of a new uh associate justice and the Supreme Court very divided right now so\nFrom the sports angle if you enter the political arena you're automatically cutting your audience in half ... there'll be half of the people not only rooting for you but jumping up saying thank you thank you\nAnd the other habits like shut up and go back and do your game right don't care what you have to say if you're not agreeing with what I think\nLeBron James has shown now moving to the Lakers more than ever that he is willing to take that risk and he was seeing the other day wearing his\nShirt and you know partly obviously some people were talking about well how sincere is that he's with Nike cap or next with Nike the cabernet Nike commercials are working uh they're they're getting business off of it so maybe he just wearing that as a favor to Nike I don't think that at all\nI think that it's about politics and you have all brawn James saying that I Am all in right now I Will not be silence and I don't care if you agree with me or not I'm going to make my thoughts known because I have the platform I had the name recognition and these are causes that are near and dear to me and I will not back off\nNow again I asked you form a Lakers organization standpoint because I guarantee you not everybody that's going out for those Laker games is in locks\nOur number one I think you have to know\nThe lay of the land so you're in LA are pretty diverse city ... I'm very liberal city um you have a lot of different things you have ah people are very much focused on the rights you know a an uplifting Hispanic community of\nAlgae Beatty communities um we've already had so many issues with the African American community here and obviously in the police department so there is always trying to mend ties there\nSo I think this is a community where people are trying to say let's come together let's be inclusive so therefore if you're saying he has a ... point is hey they're just injustice is going on and gets people of color\nAre and that's all these saying that I think people are saying that's not that big of a deal even if they don't necessarily or like the message the way that it's happening or by the way touchdown again Texas this is I mean all these little home and has no defense\nAnd its LAN gr yes I I lean gr yes it's\nMario they're not marry oh to its ... hari and its Ellen gr and not Ellen ... I mean he's out here doing his\nBest to empty impression is just getting ridiculous I'm taking no for next week's Heisman I ... and and now Tyler Moore if you can respond here you're down Thirteen I don't know if they get their point that I just looked up but um\nI mean he's got plenty of time he got sick it only one left in a third and then obviously the fourth quarter as well so there's plenty of time we'll keep an eye on that game but getting back to the point um\nAnd then you look your Magic Johnson and we know how so many different areas of his life there he cares about people he's doing for a ... you know he's talking he's helping the HIV aids community I mean there's so many different things that he's doing I don't think they mind specifically the Los Angeles Lakers\nIn LA Los Angeles California but I Will say this\nHe better when with regard to that I don't think it matters\nBeing politically active will ignore that if he's winning or winning cares All right we're we agree on that um but I just don't think it will it will rub but most people the wrong way here now if he were playing for all of a sudden\nThere's a team the are making it up the Mississippi Nights\n... that's going to go I don't think that's going over well [laughter] I don't think that's going over so well but I\nBut to your question of of of corporate leadership\nI think you need to have a\nRules and regulations set in stone this is how we operate so that there's very little wiggle room but you leave yourself just enough that\nIf it's near and dear to you you know the organization that because obviously the certain times where you need to that's why we have amendments right okay something needs to be fixed something does need to be change you allow yourself that I've always said\nWith comic happening obviously I think he was black but I think he should be in the NFL he's talent wise he's better than you know the sixty four quarterbacks give or take he's at least top twenty five and a great sign a contract or he was at the head of the snake it's much easier to bring him back and not cat but he's not the we call the cap Bernick protests\nBy the way Reid says he will continue to pursue his collusion charges despite the fact that he got sign on what\nI mean if there was the point was it happened I could see that it happened it doesn't mean that has happened so you do believe there was ... at the ... that never blinked and absolutely so you think there was an agreement of thirty two NFL no just outside the guy or the only has to be two teams\nSoak it doesn't make a losing doesn't mean that has to be a hundred percent of the teams\nDo I believe that absolutely there was a man we this is bad for business we definitely don't need this right now look at the numbers in the ratings are down and this and that is absolutely I Believe that are a few teams you know ... looted or do I think again I think it was thirty two teams no because we've had some owners at that time it came out of the owner and the Miami Dolphins we had the forty nine\nThe minimum if that's the standard than yes I'm\nNot the way I have a little sneaking suspicion that share about behind the scenes and maybe it's actually that was taken by the players association the NFL that I was screaming\nAbout we haven't heard anything about the at near all\nI mean absolutely this is a non conversation right now and maybe the president will fanned the flames coming election time right now it's a non element I said all along because this was a big concern or the owners\nAnd the TV networks and if I Am divorced Smith head of the players union I'm saying look you guys were looking for a little leverage for that next collective bargaining agreement here's what we do that just play along with his anthem thing honestly it's not that big of a deal any way but there's going to be something coming back\nTo us now a lot of this had to go behind the scenes but this I Do you remember the idea was either you were going to stay in the locker room or if you're on the field you're going to stand it I mean we haven't heard anything zero about\nThis can I add or here's here's why do you just mentioned it I'm\nThe president has been preoccupied with the cabin are confirmation yes so that has his attention he's been very much involved in a obviously he has to choose as his choice of ... and so therefore he this is where his attention has been and maybe a couple of things and maybe even his own issues with similar things I'm\nSo therefore it takes away I don't know if this is a lot of touched on is that a lot of tests are Michigan just scored a touchdown there is a flag on the play we'll wait to flag so I think that has something to do with it also keep in mind I have to remind people just regular was the\nHe's saying that just to get a shot in on Alabama sure your college aged students if some person about forty is suddenly calling you out\nWhat do you think your reaction is going to be that will screw you I ain't going to show up to any games do you feel about that well it depends on the person we're talking\nAbout college coaches they lowered over states yeah they are the highest paid state officials there the kings of those states you know you can be obviously they said there would be an example of that so I could see them saying he's right what are we doing he caught a slip and less step our game up um if this were\nYou know it is worth ... hermit right now as a ... hold on buddy ... you know yeah we're we're beating on ...

I haven't heard about it for the for\nYour good run ... other than my Antonio I mean um\nWhere they were able to to do have some successor a beat Michigan and so this season was kind of a bounce back seat and getting back to what they were used to having a under him and and now this will be a horrible last but it's still funny I mean there's still have time to pull this thing off line by the way home and I do as time as well they do\nAnd this is well coming up here in about a Fifteen minutes I mean even update\nOn my Heisman when I read in a way how excited them I I Know you are by the way it is not there's too much the apartment in my life how is that ah I'm at home ... enjoying what I Do which is watching a lot of sports documentaries and I even go back to one that I've seen a million times like one of my favorites is the bad boys I watch the the you know how that was great\nAh I'm with you I Know why there's so many different water yeah\nAnd all of a sudden I forgot the straight out of LA\nYou add to see your face some I got to see this guy and a couple of days now I got to see his face I'm a TV [noise]\nThe way let me give you the story that this was a ice cube directed this\nBy a producer TV producer and he says we are doing a documentary you didn't say anything about thirty and thirty or ice cube or anything else we're just doing an interview or doing a documentary on the LA raiders ... would you\nParticipate I said sure why not\nSo I just go down there's you can see there is no make nothing you just brought me into this cavernous room they just sit me in this chair and they're asking me questions about my time with the LA raiders back in the mid eighties I don't think any ain't got it I didn't know that there was ice cube I didn't know\nThere was an E S I didn't know anything about it and then all of a sudden I get contacted by this producers said hey we're having a a a premier showing up this documentary okay and it's going to be in Hollywood he wanted to come on down I said absolutely\nThat was when I first found out when I actually sat there 'cause we had all these former raiders were there my buddies you know rod Martin was there the late great talk christiansen Marcus was er everyone's there al Davis wasn't there and when I started watching the documentary\nThere's ice cube and I'm like I\nDidn't know he was going to become a big bills was ice cube because the thing about ice cube was and I told you the story when ice cue came into the radar offices during the late mid to late eighties when I was there\nAnd he was he had his band that we never heard of and he wanted some writer gear and so we were handsome raider gear and were like what's what's the name of your ... and there'll be away with that and you know and then um\nAnd he also wants to my high school he went to Taft high school so that easy they bought and they were being bussed out to ... so anyway if I had known the ice cream was involved with this but here here was the real killer this so they actually used a few of my clothes I have to say I had some pretty good statements\nThere are right up but a lot of the flights your head a little bit there are right\nBut here's the thing I'm sitting watching the premier this I'm sitting next\nWow why are you up there and I'm not and I'm oh yeah I just have more interesting things to say I don't know I did pretty much always go from about ... I mean you know he ... about a punk\nYou [laughter] get flustered why are they using your sound but yeah so the point is I just had to\nFace days earlier and I wanted to so well every once in awhile pop up on the screen for you All right so we got a big day in college football we got baseball coming on a little bit later on the Astros trying to extend their lead to two oh against the Indians and Yankees\nRed Sox what are your thoughts about this a series between the Yankees Red Sox yesterday was enters the red Sox jumped up to that five ... Chris area was sailing along and all of a sudden here come the Yankees and they pushed it to the limit end up losing five for do you get excited about Yankees Red Sox\nOr do you think in some ways it may be the most overhyped rivalry in sports\nNo ah I Do not think it is over hyped up because of what it's been the last say Fifteen Years it has been worth the hype for the most part you have some of the bigger players in all of baseball playing at the point and and generally going for a plane for what it really matters you know to get advance to the world series so no I don't think it's I think it's\nYankees Red Sox I think\nBut maybe do North Carolina still\nOkay All right well first of all I have to agree with you that before the red Sox won that World Series in ... when they finally broke through the window research\nI used to say how was this a rivalry one one deems one twenty five World Series over a certain you know five deck and the others one zero that's not a rivalry I mean a rivalry see I'm I'm partial to dodger's giants\nBecause both of them have had moments against each other to me it's always that east coast\nBecause with the red Sox and the Yankees greatest rivalry eyes so you you mentioned rivalry so you you think it's up there with Duke North Carolina ... especially the last like I said fifty miles away with Michigan Ohio this is Alabama Auburn as you just may Notre Dame Michigan Ohio State I think it's in a top three Lakers Celtics\nLakers Celtics why did that die off though even though they just had one in what twenty two dollars and then I was there for a while and something ... I don't know what it is I don't know if the Celtics they maybe it's because they're coming back the Celtics didn't live up to their part for so long but if they have an amazing it's potentially or they didn't win for what for like\nEighty right six to like two thousand eight right from post bird until they got the big trio take it actually so maybe that that that has a large part to do with ... everything's perspective time\n\nYou'll mobile we'll see where do you think one of the seven mobile labs they dont want to point seven dot com or\nYou can make [noise] ... end up going down to well [noise]\nMid America about ... usa [noise]\nAll of your goals are wrapping right here\nIn New York [noise] more training\nIn yellow Jeff nice one or in a relationship will I don't want to run into with max it takes a whole lot more\nMoney and the red river showdown\nEvery game these families say\n\n\n\nThat's a ... by the way you see what's going on here is Oklahoma Texas okay what about you know\nIt's a gay man column or he's going to get an opportunity bring it back\nLike I Know ... it's not about how many stops you as a Kansas little piece of show you it's when you get 'em and it can use scoring by the way look how fast you I Would imagine he's still on your ... and watch\nAll right well we are going to give you a little up there I don't know if you notice what do I know of all what does it mean we've got to go so it's just Fifteen minutes 'cause they'd be fifty percent or more car insurance means you probably should have gone to a guy go dot com fifty minutes ago I don't know if you know this but I have a Heisman vote\n[noise] really I didn't know that is in fact I Will take you through the process later this year\nAre you how it plays out I Am interested I I'm not going to hold on look oh oh\nOkay we got an Oklahoma surge going on in the meantime it's that time\nThe high ...\nIceman up tight survey we want to get you updated and then ... thoughts as well and where I stand allies and raise this was through last week's games here is my current number three\nWhite House rose middle appeal caught by Dobbins according to the parents take them down and go goes down parents play but it's the talk of coming out of the backfield and he went twenty six yards into the end so\nThat was an amazing win against Penn State let's face it when I ask is bringing Ohio State back at three touchdowns on the air leads the nation when night team touchdown passes only to fix that courtesy of Ohio State I Am gee\nHow do you feel about doing asking\nAbout I told you I I really really like what I see out of him and you're talking about an urban Meyer offerings that they say he's the best quarterback that Ohio State that I ever had at least under urban Meyer and he's had some quarterback so he's had a lot of good quarterback had\nThe ... Jones exactly and this kid is always up touchdown Oklahoma\nAnd that oil is on cue here's my number two\nNine fifty one to go thirty six Baylor showing blitz ... standing in the sunshine here comes the twist ... throws caught\nCheating we're down to\n\nRemember last week ... didn't start for disciplinary reasons or he was Seventeen of Twenty one for thirty two six touchdowns are again he gets the not over a Haskins because he's also doing it with the legs and I'll tell you what a book laments a winning this game he might go even higher on my list\nHere is my current number one here\nNow on the snap rolling writers to fade round corner of the end zone\n\n\nI show that you like old remotely or feel they're entitled by law continue to be my number one I don't think that's going to change next week the question is is it ever going to change I mean Tyler Murray\nDwayne Haskins will ... obviously doing great things in West Virginia ... any of them up yet\nAnd I'm going to answer that based off real time right now what what do you always tell me Mr Heisman vote yet it's not only about when it's about ... absolutely an empire Murray wins this game\nSomehow let's say they score here and they're going over time and he has an amazing player that say they say screw it and go for two here and he pulls it off and he went to the game yeah these are the types of moment I agree because Alabama just keeps deemed Rowley people that it almost becomes boring you almost take it for granted you know who have that\nKind of a steam roller season where they were never challenged was James Wednesday and afford to stay varies a red shirt freshmen we knew about him\nListen to that he got my number one vote on my final Hudson Valley at a hardware but really that you did he have a Heisman moment was there some big comeback or something like that so you're right if if cholera Murray brings them back and again that seemingly was watch this game was forty five twenty four\nAnd now they're tied at forty five ... I'll tell you what to ... and if if\n... was able to pull this off\nYou know not that I mean 'cause it's kind of ... of such a roller coaster game because the one hand you feel like we should have because he was up by so much right but if you want us out of the game where you beat in Oklahoma was five and older their ranks seven in ... in a rivalry game [noise]\nMaybe he jumps in the mix but I'm but but back to your answer to your question collar Murray if he can pull this off in spectacular fashion some thirty are touchdown run or ... you know bomb and they win this thing\nBelieve it now goes the number one\nFight to here's Murray's numbers today and again it's not just about numbers not even close to my book but\nThe numbers do sort of help ah Eighteen or twenty five three o seven for touchdowns he did throw a pick earlier in the game so Scott eleven curious or Ninety two yards and a touchdown because he's a candidate for five ... yeah I'd say that's those are the Iceman type\nNumbers ... I haven't really asked you do you put any legitimacy to the Heisman I mean what when I say Heisman Trophy to you you know where it stands\nWith me but does that have any meaning to the Heisman Trophy\nTo elaborate on the question\nThat I mean does it is it relevant in your I mean are interested in is it relevant or are you anticipating the fall of the race I mean it's just a Heisman play into your sports\nBond lexicon it's fun it's great to keep up with as you mentioned the guys who were on the watch list uh and and it's all it's a cool it's a cool tropical ceremony\nHow does that translate to the NFL it means nothing to me being goes rarely\nThe answer your but I'm answer your question as far as me so I go wow that was fun that was exciting but you better draft players some you know play rex who may not even remotely in a high it's been a watch\nI Will say this about Heisman winners in general and I know a lot of them some of them had great success in the NFL like the markets challenge to the world others not so much Danny Werfel\nDanny Werfel I mean there there's a long list I mean think about think about from the two thousand so in the late nineties you had Ricky Williams and yet Ron Dane back back running backs Ninety eight\nChris winking in two thousand who air crouch in two thousand one Carson Palmer in two thousand two had a ... white in two thousand three never played in the NFL then he had wiener and Reggie Bush and by the way I always ask this question of Heisman winner is about Reggie Bush I asked multiple including Barry centers\nI played a long way of Barry centers on this I said ... let's say you're hanging out the Heisman house right you know this this yeah\nAnd there's a knock at the door and its Reggie Bush at the door these slammed the door in his face or do you let 'em in the house and he goes let me make this clear\nAs far as Heisman winner is a concern he will always be\nOne of I die I'm Glad I ... say that\nThat means a lot that he said that by the way this Michigan State northwest of games going to go final here there as soon as northwest Neal's or twenty five seconds hello Troy Smith how his career\nTroy Schmidt oh I'm not sure right away one by the biggest margin ever in the high school\nYou know what Troy Smith\nHad more of a career than you would have thought in the NFL I'll say that for\nThe ratings are what yeah I mean he he played some games yeah I mean he ... I'm not saying he had a career you'd want\n... I think the floor ... more Heisman winner is Reggie\nBush Reggie Bush has the floor I think he's the guy would you go okay it wasn't great\nMedical buddy ... thousand yards with the lines you had a a nice season with the the couple to see what the safety worst looper both the same\nSo you go he had the minimum or you go at a career\nHe also had the worst season in history that last year you remember this last year of him Reggie Bush is last year and the NFL he did something that has never been done in the history\nOf the NFL he carry the ball twelve times for buffalo for negative three yards their you he's the only guy ever to a running back to have a season which he cares about ten or more times and actually end with negative yard itch see there you go you want to be negative\nAlabama's even is not great collide with the fact the teams are getting more opportunities because Alabama's often scores and lassie because Alabama's player's number one fifth string players are in and last week\nThey're looking at the girls I shoot ... seats and I would probably call her they're not paying attention they're fifty so yeah they get a little lax because they're thinking about they're doing and I\nHold on we gotta we gotta ... coming up right now ...

forty seven mobile apps that I talked to one of the the explains Kevin I'm lucky for us [laughter]\nYour second half coverage is going to the [noise]\nFrom the way it goes over the middle you gotta maintain their coverage they do have you [noise]\n... last Saturday Night live from the get go walk sports radio studios here's Marc ... and ... year NFL veteran clunky\nOkay block yeah once you what's your four O. one K. hat on right now okay let's talk this out live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios fifty minutes because they just ... percent or more on car insurance guy go dot com for free re quote you can pretend if you want\nA than I Am your accountant your advisor if you want you can use me you don't need to get your\nHey I'm going to give you five million dollars so I like five million a million dollars will be five million dollars it will be no worse than five million dollars but it might end up just being five million dollars however if you make it work for you correctly\nThat five million dollars could turn into two hundred and fifty million dollars why didn't might end up just me and five it might it might okay\nThe other option is to give you twenty five million dollars ...\nOkay and it might end up just being twenty five million dollars and if you work your cards right it could turn into\n[noise] fifty million dollars could okay so you got a minimum of twenty five they could turn into fifty or\nYou've got a minimum of five it could turn into two hundred\nAnd fifty ... what is it shows\n... I like the twenty five right now like twenty five twenty five right just to twenty five right now right today ... ... ... the the Nike\nAnd worry about what it would I is a little bit lower it's a little over but that's okay I got a twenty five right out the\nGate let me add in as a another piece that life like if you ever seen the movie sliding doors right now your life can change completely based on one decision so it just so happens that that twenty five million slash fifty million dollar life\nIt's also a little bit shorter it's a little bit more dangerous or are you okay with that I Am okay with it because I think\nSome of those risks um academy and mitigate\nMike the five and it's funny because the idea of what the safe play it safe place to take the twenty five ... write the other play as well like I've got five million but I could turn it into two hundred and fifty and it's actually a motion ally\n... a city for life for you to live\nI yeah I mean it is\nMan it takes you a long time to get it at you\nTwenty five fifty there might be a five you're it might be a five year play\nOkay so what we're talking about a year a scholar Murray oh yeah this is what we're talking about and I have two huge points that I Want to make about ... Murray who just lost for Oklahoma\nTexas one on a last uh last seconds not last second but with about ten seconds to go\nOn a kicker with the last name of decker which is just a ton of fun for everybody I think are the kicker goes in there and uh any boots it through in fact we have that call I think forty five forty five is the score Oklahoma or raises a Twenty one point deficit with about nine minutes to go however\nTexas gets in position to break a forty five forty five time with fourteen seconds on the clock\nTwenty yard field goal\nStamping Obamacare on its way\n[noise]\n[noise] okay\nThat is a I Am gene longhorn radio network taxes wins the game forty eight to forty five\nTyler Murray on the losing side but he did absolutely everything he could do and here's why we asked the money question calamari is already signed a baseball contract it is worth five million dollars to go play for the Oakland A's\nWhen you get drafted in baseball and somebody gives you five million dollars that means they're expecting you to make\nThe major leagues and they're expecting you to not just make the major leagues but when you get there will be really good but we also know baseball quirky\nYou have to work your way through the minor leagues even if you are a top pick and so who knows where that will end up however if you make it good\nIt's yours you simply get to adjust lollipop through life might you know show up once every five days and go do your thing on a baseball diamond and made guaranteed money however uh this guy is so good Bucky\nYes it's amazing we have never I Can't remember at least you tell me if I'm forgetting one at least in recent memory\nLooking at this going on a football field and not have any designs on playing football at the next level\n[noise] no I haven't seen anybody like that I haven't seen anybody who has been this successful who is head I'm the kind of immediate success only really really good team\nNot want to play in the national football league now I can go back when I was laying Charlie Ward was the guy that had success like that but didn't get an opportunity to play in the national football league in the plane and then in the NBA for a decade or more\nBut no one like a column or a calorie is spectacularly when you look at what he's doing he's leading Seventy percent of his passes Seventeen to to touchdown interception ratio and so the guy who was the number one pick last year Baker may feel\nBaker may feel completed Seventy percent of his passes and me finish the year with forty three touchdowns only six picks one Heisman Trophy let's just say they Keller Murray matches or it is in that ballpark and he's only a junior right now right man\nMay feel was number one overall number one overall pick the things that we talk about hindering Baker we worried about his height but I mean is is that really big deal ... I mean they can maybe it was\nA sixth quarterback that went number one so yeah tell them or is it six feet he's more to the five ten and even maybe even shorter\nThe game is changing no doubt that we're on to these quarterbacks come right in and playing college ball um basically in the pros having success I think ... Marie\nTwenty six three hundred and four yards four touchdown throws today did have one or they pick eleven carries on the ground Ninety two yards and another touchdown their\nCollar Murray is absolutely fantastic but now let me answer my own question if I'm Charlie Ward I Do what he did and and if I'm Kyla Marie I'm taking that Oakland A's five million dollar contract\nAnd it really comes down to your body man like yeah so like oh it comes down to your body and it comes down to the players association bug you anyway\nSo you see because see here's what you see if ... was a wide receiver a running back a db then I'd be like yeah you know that baseball money that life is different but you know we get paid as we saw Jimmy go ... you know you're one thirty two\nOr three games ooh three games yeah so one day\nHe proves that quarterback and get hurt too yeah but but be I understand right now what you're saying is that the NFL is in the process if they haven't already of placing pillows all the way around every quarter back in and we are going to be find all the\nMoney is the money is longer a quarterback them like top rated you know you're Eighteen no doubt Drew Brees fill the rivers ride those guys are playing a long time and so now you're looking at the quarterback money so\nThose are the quarterbacks that popped though\nForget we got plenty of first round with the quarterbacks you automatically get plenty working here with this this network ... liner immigrating Quinn and other first route quarterbacks\nWho don't ever get that twenty five million dollar a year contract and oh by the way in fact even with their rookie deal with take a look at the same as Winston right now number one overall pin we don't even know if he's going to get an extension yeah made some really nice money out of the draft but I'm going to look at both players association\nThat was like oh Michigan stays on Ohio scheduled there right why are they right they're not three ensue just lost in the home today northwest or can we get this elite Fort Michigan State do you mean you are not what we thought you were\nBasket today I mean it's\nHas the only turn over prop that I like\nThe turnover thrives are getting played out but Boise State has a really cool and they just got a formal from San Diego state\nHave got to turn over thrown like hey room it's a throne is there a white share with all kinds of glitz and glamour on the outside of it\nIn the middle of the bench and if you get a turnover you get to go sit on the throne and they put they put the crown on their porch crowded crowded you the trail and you're going to cry on them and then they wave at crowd them [laughter] and they have it around them and then they wave at you and every man when something you know wants to go sit on the throne\nSo that's what that's what you get to do in Boise so I dig that All right Jay Glazer ten minute mark weather bug your drugs vice versa yeah you're the crowd them\nUm and so um that's a that's what they get to do with boys do you want to go out on the ground [laughter] I'm here's my other ... deal\n\nI Would like to speak face to face to every single Heisman voter across the land\nI Know that's a lot of people\nBut\nHang a loss on an offensive player when they score fifty points\nI Know there's only three real candidates right now I'm you know I Know West Virginia is running backs out of the really nice year but let's be honest what we're talking about right now is to a\nColumn Ari and Haskins at Ohio State that's that's that's what we're talking about right now ... and I know a lot of ... have been voters will walk out of the day like today and say well we can now knock collar Murray down a little bit because this team lost\nNo his team last forty eight to forty five\n... he's going forty five points he did everything perfectly he counted for five touchdowns he'll raise the ...\nLeft on the clock Texas gets in the field goal rains they win the game water column or do wrong [laughter] what did he do wrong you should you should you should have found a way it was just one more point she'll go fifty instead of forty five times you get to do with you gotta do come on man how can you hang that on an often supplier\nYou can do is just like it's just like a pitcher in baseball the same deal\nBut we don't hang out on a pitcher in baseball if a pitcher in baseball throws eight shutout innings and then leaves the game at a reliever comes in and gas cans the baseball game we have the wall son the reliever\nNobody's looking at Clayton curse on being like you went to a shutout innings but you should have gone nine they will only get mad at the closer\nSo to me we've got to do a better job of spotlight even what the job is of the player that players job is to go out there specially if you are in the big twelve your job is get over forty points today\nAnd he did you did you have to do you\nHave to do anything so I salute Tyler Moore today a day like today ... either stays exactly where he was or quite frankly goes up\nBecause once again three over three hundred yards passing four touchdown throws Ninety two yards on the ground a touchdown run he was his team's leading Russia or he sort of for over three hundred yards based on forty five points that's what you ask a big twelve quarterback star to go do any debt it\nHe did do that in a big game in the beginning but still a little more and you know I don't I don't want any more I actually don't\nBig twelve gives us planet I don't want more often it's in the south\nWho just make you happy what happened in\nOklahoma State I thought it was Iowa State of Ohio Oklahoma oh no oh like sixty seven other oh someone you know so if you don't have a board\nYou know my rooting interest whoever's play or\nEven left on their schedule missing ... yeah the but the ... that's ... that's Thanksgiving will have already happened so like I've just put it on hold I've already wrap my head around Ohio State is ten at all and they're going to play Michigan after Thanksgiving so I'll read to gauge on Ohio State schedule that they're not going to lose any of these other games\nAlabama is not going to lose any game so I'm like I I've just done\nAlabama Ohio State of Notre Dame are in the playoffs there may have to really it's a race for the fourth spot\nThey may have been the Georgian a championship okay so again Iran gauge at the end of November ah once Alabama gets its annual game against the citadel out of the way on Thanksgiving weekend [laughter] I'll really engage with Alabama but other than that Alabama to Ohio State have already done what they needed to do Alabama or did they play LSU in a few weeks\nYes I'll check that one out there between those duties that's the only game left\nOr before the holidays that's the only one that is it like a vague interest at all other than metal downtime they're gonna they're gonna and they will [laughter] damn tide is going to roll rung all we do have some type of stuff to get through but but anyway I like\nI I firmly believe that when you when it comes to has been voting the one thing that to me is really missing is context mhm and it's hard\nBecause these players are spread out all over the country and you see 'em all you can't watch I I mean we always do that we rip the husband voter for being like you don't watch 'em play well what do you expect them to do\nI never leave their home\nYes vote taped games the DVR games and watch all week long so you can check in on every good play around the country yes it's not realistic that's what I suspect it's not realistic I don't have a vote but if I had to vote that's kinda dedicated with with what I don't want them to do is I Want to do well Oklahoma last so called the Murray goes down\nWhat color dead in the fourth quarter which was amazing\nYeah I see you I see you're saying there [laughter] I said he goes I see that ... did not last long for all the oil you on the blue oh man I mean\nThere's nothing why yeah holding company back it's coming back with San Diego state a real briefly on this one is a fourteen for the underdog on the road at the blue turf they don't have their quarterback\nThey don't have their tail back and they don't have their fall back and uh they're threatening to take the lead right now still late first quarter though it's a it's it's quite early in this game I Do love San Diego state plus the points if you're a you know so inclined\nRecreational activities recreational activities this is a this is a little bit of a rivalry game a little bit of a rivalry game\nYeah big penalty they didn't want it in this state took it out on took took a touchdown off the board um it's funny actually to I was speaking of rivalries I was out on the way and I was listening to Calvin and Steve talking about rivalries what do you think makes a rivalry\n... because they were doing all Auburn, Alabama in North Carolina do long Michigan Ohio State and they ... Red Sox later today they were talking and what makes the rivalry\nDo you like to have a long history of competition between and you also like to see too successful squads going at it mhm I'm having a meaningful games with big things on the line so when you go North Carolina do because I've been a part of their rivalry obviously not into basketball ... going to those games\nSo about two programs that one a lot of national titles in fact they were all listening who was winning and so because of the proximity only eight miles apart you see those guys all the time you want to have bragging rights I'm I think his success you want to have\nSuccess with two successful franchises going against one another with everything on the line to me that's what the robbers for because there's not a rivalry if the other team doesn't win like that well\nSee that's why that's why I I every answer the reason I ask what makes the rivalry every time we did we talk about that like what kind of success if they had or their wings on both sides to me a rivalry has nothing to do with the teams at all\nIt has to do with the fans are rivalry is not about how the red Sox Yankees were rivals for years and the red Sox never did a thing and the Yankees did everything most successful franchises in history a sport why is it a rivalry because one fan base hates the other one\nWhat what is their fan base ate him just because you can also join in New York because because the Yankees\nOr where to go standard they won on the\nHeart of it I mean the giants and the Dodgers are are rivals out west neither why but because it's San Francisco and LA like the two teams haven't even been in California for how long have you been you know now it's like fifty sixty years but I mean they've been rivals forever\nTo San Francisco jealous of LA you actually think that's what it is yeah then why is LA hate the giants on a day to day they do they\nGet they refer to them as they hated ones that's what they're actually that's the nickname here in LA they hated ones\nThe ... you're talking about is the ... Dodger rival right that's not or a pie I Know the partner is that all wrapped up in ... I like I'm Sorry we're re introduce me to you I mean I don't see what what are you wearing issue here is usually that's the one that we all do Dodger\nJohn rivalry go that goes both ways especially this decade because the giants now finally done some things\n[noise] no I mean I I think that they were they were very high it was so high on them guys that a team called them after they selected them and try to trade it for him which I've never heard before and I was there was alive they called the like and we want to trade for petty after Seattle took\nWas I've never heard of my life I'm ... I'm Out there every day one\nUm you know who was it'd be better fit for each week I think we're all looked at ... ... if he's gone and more practice they see it every day they see it more than we do\nKnow Jay in thinking about Seattle or their Osama situation or him throwing up the middle finger on his way off the field you think there's any way they can pass that up and maybe are Osama's goes back and finish his career this you\nKnow no I don't either\nI just think it's one of those things were [noise] um I think both sides are kind of like you know we talk about for its merits it other

All right Nick Saban deal with it in a certain way or the fans in Alabama the customers\nNick is a he is tasked with winning football games and by the way does it well it does it better than anybody in the country right partially because he's really good really smart runs a great program the other part is because the citadel is on the schedule every year\nDo express frustration directed at these students of Alabama for not showing up of games\nI can honestly say I was a little disappointed that there weren't more students at the last game and I think we're trying to address that uh I don't think they're entitled anything either and me personally I think it ought to be first come first served in the ... I don't want to come to the games I don't have to come but I'm sure there's enough people around here to like to go to the games wind like for him to come to because they support the players\nYou know when I first came here used to play that tradition thing up there and everybody was cheering and excited and happy and it was great spirit\nHigh now they don't even here they introduce our players nobody even chairs so you all can beat me up for that if you want but look our players work too hard\nAnd they deserve to have everything and people supporting them in every way and have tremendous spirit for what they've done you know to see half the students sex and not full I've never seen that since I've been here before\nAll right so we can all be yep if we want to guess what I Do so here's the deal [noise] um when it comes to sports\nThe fan outside of attacking violently other fans and throwing things onto the field mhm\nCannot do anything wrong period don't talk about the fans\nThey can show up they cannot show up they can boom they can cheer they could watch the game with their back turned they can stand or sit down go get a damn beer go to the bathroom leaving the third quarter show up in the second and that is none of your darn business\nYup and is always right right always write\nThis put a bad taste in my mouth in a big way because number one mic is suffering from the fact that they've become incredibly successful it's kind of like for years remember Maddox gladden\nThere was no champagne celebration you know I mean I was I wanted to visit like Thirteen Years in a

division\nKind of like I don't know beating Mississippi State in September nah what the hell do you want everybody to show up and freak out about that for and oh by the way high horse Nick\nOur players work too hard and they deserve and yeah ... okay okay so Nick go ask your players if they would like hey all the fans to show up and cheer yes or be a couple of bucks out of your salary\nOh my gosh wait a minute they work so damn hard they deserve every things in the world don't they they\nDo they do they do that they deserve all that and a full stadium Alabama's fans are entitled they've they want a lot so they think\nThey can just pick and choose and come to which games that want to go I'm just gonna come to the big games they can help you than if you're a\nFan if you really if you're really down with Scott I Know ... style have you all the way down and they do to be there\nWhat does that mean if you're a while but weighed down show up if you're real real if you really roll tide okay I Need you to be there for all those games and what are you getting rid of them and when you're given a European you didn't want to say you ride a waitress inside\nThe late ... let me get to do whatever you are you on that and not only are you not incentivizing these fans in the show up you're out there with their own money\nYeah oh okay so we're going to give you nothing you need to give our money\nI Am given you so what are you giving me give you an opportunity to be like we\nOwe still be friends oh stop we we we we I Love it here when the national championship we we did it the ... the players and the coaches love we when it helps them and then and then they spit out the idea of we when it does it or we need we need\n... you get a ring I bet you ... if they win I bet you clean Kurdish I Would love to see me there in a moment to understand you're saying\nSo long to do to him what have you not been to a baseball game in Fifteen Years\nUnder state under serious under stakes however there I was there when that was Angel I love to know a lot I Love it when they do that but I don't ah I I I like the six dollar look on the dollar bleacher seats back in the day you I'm\nAll about that you cannot well the fans what to do is I Know you cannot ... how are we going to have a white out when no one showed up\nThat work I'm Sorry if whatever you're doing is not spinning my entertainment I or\nIf you are even suffering from your own success he seems like Alabama has become the Golden State warriors of college for no it's different and so around ... no it's not different at all people are already here going look we know you're going to be there in the end so all waiting now my dollars until the end\nGoing to be a house there is not going to lose that game or they're down Seventeen fourteen with plenty of time to go on the second quarter than others and that football game so I'm however I also think I got you stay in two different things at the same time you're ... the reason I brought this up\nTrying to say oh you got a ride or die you got to root for whoever you're born next to Susan the matter is you don't my whole point is as a fan you can do whatever the heck you want to do\nSo if you're saying I Can't judge your fandom then Nick Saban cannot judge the Alabama students fandom you can't do that as a coach or a player\nYou can't tell fans what to do or how to cheer how invested to be how much to care how literally care yeah they get to do with their way like in this instance Burger King I think we're going to have at your way no no yeah yeah that's the deal\nYou have it all mixed up you haven't made up the colleges different no it's not different it is there is college football and entertainment entity are not partially religion than in the south okay no no no but that's that's speaking about the way people care about it\nItself as it is developed and offered to buy all the other way you know here's this an entertainment entity or not\nSay I'm a performance of the lion king is happening mhm and all performers come out and they performed the lion king met at the end of the show or in coal they there's a curtain call but then they look up\nAnd in the balcony there's ten empty seats and instead of taking a bow they start pontificate in yes screaming at the crowd how disgusting\nThat there are more you're showing up that you're not sharing louder for the performance that we just put on\nCan you imagine yeah you can I Can't imagine that I ... on your land isn't it yes\nAnd the more you see people all the time on the more the more you know any more and more noise more volume\nThe whole idea of entertainment is it's on you to entertain me no this is not on me to cheer for the ... for you whether I like it or not\nNo but I mean even if you're not anywhere in work if you're a fan then why wouldn't you be at the game why wouldn't you be there early because their level four lanes\nJust thinking like like thinking about what we're saying right now Alabama which is like for all the time they went all of their football games you just called it\nReligion in the south which it is very much so so now that's the standard the fans have developed the idea that it's religion and so now that they've set that standard now if you're not religious to the point of their every game you're bad fan\nI mean maybe they got something to do that Saturday ...\nHe makes sure that shows up in ... school or something like that you make sure someone else shows ... [laughter]\nOh no and ah here's an analysts you may have heard of\nWho agrees with Nick Saban his name is Tim ...\nI agree with that and I love it I I think the fans are getting stolen title\nYour daddy's money didn't show up at a game and to go to school there you say you're the best fans in college football what you need to show up I don't care if you're playing Louisiana whoever you're playing Hoover high school\nYou show up to the game you support your team because if you want to say you're the best fans in the country you show up every game no matter what coach ... Alabama students you need to show up for your team\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] somebody gets [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n... I'm so excited to have to be kidding no he gets he played down there to see you understand what it's like you can't because you hear the fan bases always get a bass man in\nThe country we're right here nobody's like us roadside and that every ... every plant said that out and not show up\nHis you can you know yes you can you\nCan but you got to be a real daddy's money now see so you're jaded dad you know what you're jaded money you're jaded by my J. J. to because of the whole LA thing you know LA thing I mean here I Know but the LA thing is oh USC is playing at five o'clock will show well we'll get into our sea\nSaid six oh you mean I asked not how it goes down like\nThey should be out there early you tailgate you get there early you get into the stands you make your presidents no if you want to be considered the twelve man or part of the squad you got to be in the stadium\nWho they how sad that they wanted to make an honor that got that knows that like that the other thing\nLike okay sports talk radio in Tuscaloosa some callers like\nWearing a mask around on America ... and now that\nMeans that every single channel of am a student is beholden to the statement yeah because one guy made it yeah school sphere sure this is absurd\nNotice authorization we're having right now is they're not\nI'm telling you you're jaded because you've been out here jaded I ...\nGo to the game and they have a picnic before we get to know Saturday you know Saturday you\nKnow I I Am forty three years old or I was up at six o'clock this morning because my daughter has an eight thirty soccer game and everybody needed racked west and you're going to tell me that might have rightly hold on my priorities should not be that\nWe should not be being at my daughter's soccer game they should not be making sure everyone eats eggs instead of doughnuts what my priority should be used to put all of the outside and get my butt over to the rose bowl or the coliseum\nSo they could pull in my family were oversized Jersey ... three on top of that I can scream and yell and had attached to my own self worth\nKnew what some Nineteen year old kids are doing on a football field yes that's what you're saying you're saying [laughter] than exactly what I'm saying\nThat is what I'm saying I'm saying you can do all that you can you can make breakfast or okay or you need to give up or you need to give up your seat to somebody who's going to make the sacrifice to be done when he was out\nThere no that's what I Do look no no that's how it goes down there and there's a reason or down in the south here\nThat's the way they do down there and that's where he's talking about and there's nothing else to do right\nAnd that's why you're saying what else are you doing in Tuscaloosa, Alabama what else\nWhat are you doing who knows what the hell they actually do you and may very well get get to the stadium and support the squad there's nothing else that's going on there is bigger than the game on my body\nI that's what I say like your west coast in you're out here it's not it out that you're eating your avocado\nTacos says you can't have walking into the state level yes so you just kinda like chilling whatever you're not a my viewing it might be America all day like all that other stuff\nYou know you're like a pink he's up dude [laughter]\nYeah what ever drink you have your pinky\nYeah like it's got a little half and half in it so you never know what's so that that's why won't resonate with you but if you talk to people from down there yeah calls we have people calling for a Nobel they would tell you that you have to be there you\nHave to be at the game of course get a hold on a second that's not the conversation we're having you know early sitting here talking about whether folks in the SEC are phenomenal fans of course they owner yeah and I'm not talking about whether or not LA or Tuscaloosa has got more to do I mean\nThat that that's all we know the story on that here's what I'm Talking about\nI'm Talking about the highest paid state employee the highest paid human [laughter] me either state of Alabama is wagging his finger\nAt at teenagers yeah for not behaving the way he wants them to behave\nSo that what he can make more than that he's not going to share you know they get out of here you listen if this had to come from the mouth of one of the line backers I'd be fine and\nThis is disingenuous this is selfish this is misguided this is a bad sound no from Nick Saban and by the way\nHe's usually got something like that for us every week [laughter] gee I have never ever view of the more self important human being yeah\nIn sports then Nick Saban\nHe's doing it for ... sure he is\nDoing it for the call yeah there's not a bit of ego in this at all it is doing it for the culture\nOkay no ego right\nI mean every but we don't have a you know but it's got an everybody some people have been more than they even you know have any I got plenty yeah I have what I refer to as a healthy yeah he'll

Murray is doing sort of\nGives you momentary pause about what Baker Mayfield achieved at Oklahoma\nUh I think you have to take into consideration I'm after a while you you begin to look look ... tremendous don't tell them or has tremendous don't um but when you do see these numbers the numbers are kind of parallel you do wonder how many how much of that is due to a system maybe elevating the plate\nYeah Jenny ... was there she joins us now live on Fox Sports radio with the latest\nAfter sexism Oklahoma Jenny so great to have you and I I don't check this one but we got to start with cholera Marie are did anybody\nYou know check in with it and say are you sure you don't want to play football at the next level or are we sure about that\nOh boy this kid is impressive I I think that's what's crazy first of all thanks for having me guys I'm you know Kylah or was this storyline heading into this one and unfortunately he's going to look back and think of those\nCritical turnovers any gonna think twice about this performance but what we saw from him in terms of his athleticism liked that Seventy seven yard\nA touchdown pass the Hollywood that was incredible then we saw that sixty seven yard run for the score and the fourth quarter that was I mean the guy's an athlete and you know we talk so much about his future as a baseball player but\nYou know how can you not look at how talented he is as a quarterback in the football team so it's really something he's going to be thinking about the last I checked with him personally baseball was all\nPerformance night in terms of those turnovers\nWith a flip it on the other side with Texas Longhorns do this I I knew that it could be close but I don't know if there are many people that do judge who could really knock off will go\nWell what's cool about this Texas team 'cause we've now been around them for a little bit and you know you look at that first law against Maryland which that was a\nVery interesting game Maryland was playing for a a falling teammate they had these horrible weather delays there was a lot of interesting circumstances to that match up in it you know the first the first weekend for for Texas but since that game\nUm I feel like they've just found their identity in a different way and something coach Herman said to me when I interviewed him post game he said\nWe figured out how to finish and we finished today and yes they did allow Oklahoma back in the mix and that fourth quarter but this team is playing inspired and the players all week you can sense the confidence that is what I got from them they were saying we want to play this\nGame we'd been waiting to prove what Texas is about and I didn't really get that in the last couple of years with the Texas football\nTeam and it just proves that over time and ... what ... is doing is working for the program\nJimmy they keep surprising us you know you mentioned that ... but we've also we've learned over the years in college football but\nIf you make your mistake really early ... there's time to recover from that and now when you don't wins over us here in DC you in Oklahoma\nAnd uh you know some other interesting opportunities Oklahoma states still ahead on the schedule or the Texas Longhorn your ... for the national championship\nWell boy I think that if we asked them that they'd probably say hold up let's just wait to see because there's a few other big games they've got coming in terms of the conference but are they you know taking the driver's seat in the big twelve absolutely\nLast year and this is a player that not only is respected by his teammates and coach is just the confidence he's playing with five total TD today three hundred and eighty six told the arts I'm pretty sure that the career high for the guy but just\nLet us as always thought from Tyler but the guy was moving we saw the legs get going and\nUm the way he's been able to kind of command the often is something that has really been a difference for the team and I think that they're responding well to him as the leader and they have high expectations of the group\nI'm over the last few weeks it seems like there's been a little bit of a change in terms of the office of political retirement maybe injecting himself more into that is this something that is true is he taking more ownership or more controlled office and bruised and we've because it appears that the audience was playing better\nWell he you know what he did say in last week he had to take over some of those calls which did happen last week the office of coordinator was set cans of a fluke kind of\nA visit to the hospital so he was not I'm with them but he said he was a bit too conservative and a password Sam and at the two of just kind of developed a different kind of trust\nThat they feel like they equally are good to each other and just are feeling more comfortable together so I think a lot of ways it's just a more comfortable often as a whole and they're willing to take some of those chances that maybe they weren't able to do before and the damage showing that he can be that guy for them\nDuring the did you get a chance to talk to any Texas fans who sort of a I think now feel like the program as a whole\nHas turned the corner you know I I'm always interesting when you and I'm a ... a real blue chip type program like this I Am a fan base has gone through a few years of feeling like this is not up to our standards\nAlways aware of like where was that moment that they sort of feel like we're back is today it\nWell you know I got that sense\nFact that it was forty five twenty four heading into the fourth and\nOklahoma called their way back into this I mean it was we uh we were down to the very on there and it could have been a very different outcome ah and I think that's the that's the one place where the fans are going to fear\nThat they still need to be better but light coach for him and said we found a way to finish and that's what they're going to build on after this but the fan base was excited and I mean just the\nRed River came I this was my first time first time covering it just to see the Oklahoma fans and the Texas fans were at the Texas state fair\nAt the cotton ball I mean I don't know if it gets better honestly this was an instant classic that I'm Still kind of coming down from because the energy in the atmosphere was something I have never experienced\nYou know Geneva will Oklahoma's someone else's loss do believe with ... employees are ... and\nYou know I talk to their us id post game um and he said that Lincoln had some really powerful words in the locker room he said he handled it really well and this is a team that I think it in two thousand Fifteen when they lost to Texas the last time I think that is the team they ended up going on\nTo the playoffs I Am I saying I ... I'm pretty sure if that number sounds\nRight I I I Know that they've rebounded posed this and look at this team could went out and meet taxes again in a championship game which would be pretty special so\nI I don't want to doubt Oklahoma I think unfortunately defensively that spend the question mark and it's going to remain when you allow it seemed like that to put up forty eight against yeah that's going to be something you're going to be thinking about and they made a lot of improvements there I Know the the the leaders of that defense\nGuys like tennis Murray they're not going to please come up man with that performance but there's a lot of good guys in that group and I I can imagine that they're going to come back and the scene is going to be just fine\nFor your weekday you know I agree with some wonderful things are you with us they watch sports radio sports\nOn us twenty four hours a day do you believe what I Want to see the\nSuper Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles take on

still ten minutes to go with the aspects of just taking a Nineteen does that leave that number twenty four\nBoise State don't call the Boise Boise bushy\nI used to live there for a couple of summers that some a minor league baseball broadcaster\nOh did you local knowledge Boise yes one of those things everybody called the Boise a and that's the that's the locals way of knowing what an outsider is and you know like oh you called the Boise I'm\nA we call this guy Bill Hancock is the executive director of the college football playoff\nKind enough to join us today bill we really appreciate it thank you so much I was really struck by uh the interview and quotes that you gave about a week and a half ago with regard to\nFor instance some of the group of five schools like central Florida and you stated that in your opinion they do have a path to the college football playoff I I'm not sure I really see that can you explain what what their past might be well\nYou know to see in Boise\nThat's right oh high as ... as well or you see there you go for him was come on really was funny because I when I moved there I'd never been there and I get there and I'm watching the news one night and and the the ... says Boise and I go [laughter] what she's talking about like what is not\nAnd and so [laughter] and then the next day who did it again and they did it again and again and so I started asking I'm like how to add the rest of us all just been doing this wrong and they're like yeah pretty much [laughter] okay I Walk anymore\nOh that's a theater and I'll tell you that one on\nOne of my favorite places actually when I was directly in the tournament teams would get assigned there and they would complain about it until they went there and they would come back and then they would say wow what a great place\nNo doubt about it when I found out I was moving there I ended up getting paired with a guy on the golf course one time I told them I was going to do and at the time I said Boise and uh he goes oh boy who goes that's kinda like Bakersfield\nAnd not nothing against Bakersfield but when I got to Boise I'm like yeah that's not like Bakersfield at all that there is nothing similar about those two places except for the beat in front of their name\nI'm not sure that guy had been to\nEither more or less All right All right All right well bill thank you for doing it so so yeah ... could you please a ... yeah and on that idea of the group of five teams\nYeah happy to do that frankly when your game play a good schedule when your games and you're going to be in the hot\nUm and there is no better example than Houston two or three years ago they had it all to eat up they had a great victory over Oklahoma they were they were rolling that they they were all set and then of course they had the unfortunate last at navy and then I think they lost to SMU later on but it can't\nSo early to speculate but right now it seems like the usual suspects are in contention Alabama Georgia Ohio State Clemson I'm for you guys when you look at the ... does it ever get boring potentially seeing the same themes in those force but\n[noise] [noise] oh my goodness not not for the committee now not for us or it's just a matter of evaluating the resumes evaluating the games that we watch on on video\nAnd now it's not boring at all it's it's it's exciting actually we're we're in a phase there's no doubt where\nAlabama and and Clemson are in a very positive cycle so it was Ohio State so as Oklahoma up in the ... college football college football so I worked in cycles and and that will be that will continue to be the case\nBill Hancock executive director college football playoff joining us so\nA bill ... let me let me continue in fact and and ask about a team why central Florida which is you said you know play good schedule with all your games will be in the hard\nCertainly people could ask you about the teams that are on their schedule although there's only so much that's in their control they did with all of their games um and and I look at them and what happens is the following year for instance\nIt feels like the polls at the beginning of the year certainly take into account what a team did the year before because what else do we know when teams are zero in zero however central Florida\nAt the end of the year last year they they win a game like all burned and then they came back the following year and dropped about Fifteen spots in the pre season polls and now have to climb their way back up again so what's the deal there\nWhich is why the committee doesn't use ... to the polls that all we don't pay any attention to those calls a ... and you always talked about that at this I Know those polls are great for promoting the game they're great to get excited about their teams before the season but the preseason\nReturning that we just don't pay any attention to them\nYou know in in thinking about quarterbacks I'm looking at a team of Notre Dame who's made a quarterback change in book they're more exciting obviously when officers because there are a little more balanced but they're sitting at a nice position right now when you look at a fighting fires in the fact that they're playing an independent schedule where does some of the things that you're looking forward to separate them from a team that plays in a conference\n[noise] hard for me to talk about specific teams I I don't usually like to do it but I I I Would just say it it's it's the same way we evaluate all team's strength is scheduled do they have at at games against the other teams that are in the race\nWhat about common opponents and and none of them will be evaluated the very same white you know the comment about Notre Dame reminds me of something if you went on the basis of returning quarterback look at the teams as last year that didn't finished with the same quarter back they started with\nUm and I would say Alabama and Georgia did pretty well\n[laughter] a Bill Hancock a executive director college football playoff joining us a bill I also want to ask this just because I Know a lot of our listeners feel this way at all can only tell you I Am as well like I'm I Am one of those fans that holds\nOffer more teams being in there at the end of the year whether it'd be eight whether it be like what used to be called one double a in has sixteen or anything like that when a fair to ask you that what are the chances of that sometime soon what's your answer\nWhen we created the play off we evaluated a whole spectrum of different options including [noise] go back to the way the football used to be whether it was had a chance for number one or two to make all the way over to sixteen team tournament\nAnd we settled on for because we wanted a brac we wanted to play off one of the bracket but we didn't want to take away from the regular season\nTake away from that I read an article last week that said a bigger playoff would change the culture of college football I I happen to believe that and and I know the presidents and the commissioners did when they when they set up the playoff and when they set it up\nFor twelve years of

twenty twenty three is the time that that you know you might reevaluate are or who knows what will happen but I mean I ... I I don't know I I Wonder about this though from from from this perspective I mean did you look at other sports even for instance the NFL um you know\n... you say it might lessen the regular season I I Wonder about the idea of ever having a way to finish the season where guys like you wouldn't have to necessarily sit\nIn a in a board room somewhere and decide who's going to go where in other words is there ever a way where college football simply sends people to a playoff based solely on whether they want a division or a conference similar to the way all their sports operate\nWe had a conference a winner oh six or seven or eight years ago that was ranked number twenty two in the country is that what fans want maybe I I don't know ... we've settled on best fourteens\nIndeed knows

I mean it's just different well this is why go to the hall of fame this is why and you know that the hall of fame that bother me they inherently bother me because numbers do lie and numbers lacking contacts yet people will use them like\nTerrell Owens earlier this year that called for all kinds of context is ... ... I agree with you get your popcorn right but if the numbers and never live and then why wasn't Terrell Owens a first ballot guy\nHe really likes personalities that every that's contacts Mm right you should have been in there OK agree with you but it wasn't too bad yeah but everybody's\nDifferent Randy Moss is different than Marvin Harrison\nTerrell Owens is different than\nYou know whatever art monk our ... our monk\nWhat I mean is it so the numbers are now officially all out of whack there are a lot of what their ... what listener Richard Sherman off for like the eighty seven times so far this season Richard Sherman has publicly ripped the new rules\nIs what we want it though you know they want record passing numbers you know you got average quarterback the average quarterback\nIs pass for ratings like Ninety two and and I used to be hall of fame numbers but now you know the whole fan or just average quarterbacks you can't touch him you can't tackling against it um high can hit him though\nYou you can knock them down to the ground hard as he pushed into bed you know all that together you can't hit a receiver high you can't hit them though you can't push 'em you can't you can barely pressed him you know it's it's been really difficult on teams to to combat it because it's that every rule and in the book is inside to make sure you don't get himself\nAnd ah strangely only a few\nOf them are in the hall of fame why do you think that might be [laughter]\nGame is different now have is different now hall of fame as a Judge Snow rains in titles that those guys are getting that no\nThe reason most of the top ten or not in the hall of fame is cause they're still playing [laughter]\n[laughter] but when\nPeyton Manning Brett Farr drew raised on ready to Dan Marino Eli Manning Ben Roethlisberger Philip Rivers on our way Warren mode they're all still playing or they just retired a second ago\n... what do you think's gonna happen to that list by the way different game what's gonna happen to that list Matt Ryan is Fifteen all time all time using many ice is great you couldn't get most people support them as a top ten quarterback currently in the league\nYou know like maybe I I Love ... am I wrong with my statement and I think\nHe's a ... you have seen all the time or is he a top\nTen quarterback now currently active [laughter]\nWhat's your last I'm looking at let me hear your list I'm looking I'm looking at I got to get some numbers or you know you don't need numbers oh my God I think from your heart man\nHave you been Pena says what many actually doing good quarterback Medi ice is averaging nine point one yours for Tim okay ten to ... an interception ratio mhm one fourteen pass a rating completing sixty eight point three percent of his pass hell of a show\nYou know whose numbers to pass that though who have pets\n[laughter] look out a way it's about ... wait a minute like all the way it\nIs ... ... you should have been he's\nHis pastor rating is one fourteenth for mhm home with his seven completion of forty yards or more but I thought now numbers never lie the numbers were in line there were ... stop anybody on defense that defense of given up all those for\nNothing to do with anything if you believe on the numbers and Ryan Fitzpatrick is the future hall of famer based on what he's doing this year yet that future all they still got benched you don't then ship future hall of famer the numbers are all out of whack look you you want to talk about passer rating let's go ahead and talk about passive rating for a second I'm\nYou know how many quarterbacks right now and the NFL have a pass rating over a hundred\nOver a hundred ... is bananas that would be like I'm the MVP of the\nLeague I think Aaron Rodgers has a career high he's right at a hundred over a hundred correct\nYou\nKnow mobile will the icon six forty seven to one of those things are going to have a dot com for details you know it's not changing Smith dressed up like Lady Gaga for Halloween [noise]\nOfficer [noise] with only one to call them so [noise]\nThe world [noise]\nSeason MLD coverage is right here on Fox Sports radio\nA lot of eggs and car normally hear I saw one of those things I\nDon't mind that last one I'm your television showed a Fox Sports ... details mass Rwanda [noise]\nMm Mm Mm\nGreat news corps where someone is what's the guy to go to guys that are common in Fifteen minutes because they're just there for several moral car insurance\nWait a minute what damage got overtime all four weeks they really going to overcome every week now I there was one of the game the game Baker one on Thursday night when he entered the only one that's the only one I didn't realize that they'd been overtime in I ... I was going to say all three of their losses one of them was a tie\nWow so they want they they they beat the jets\nThe last of the saints and raiders both on the road in overtime and tied the Steelers\nLike a breath away from being undefeated\nThey realize that they can and to me they are still go to beat the saints missed it they had a field goal to beat the Steelers missed it\nLast of the raiders except for the NFL's already come out and said we messed it up on officiating\n... they could be they can be far at all I mean easily could be for no believer in Baker\nI think you bring some juice I think they continue to build it\nAround and they started doing some of the quick rhythm stuff yeah yeah I think a human being when significant or they\n... they are a different TV product I Would say I will say that that's what that's what I've noticed so far I have no idea yet\nOr what kind of long term winter or whatnot is going to be I mean how can you guys played six quarters of football yeah but it is a different TV product that works that's the only decision I can make so far as as a TV product the browns suddenly work\nThey're better product ...\nOh my gosh I mean the Thursday night game which nobody could turn off and then I imagine the browns playing in a football game where\nA there was a total uh let me do quick math here\nI'm eighty seven points scored in the game\nI mean look this is a good product and people like to see points scored you want to see people put it in the ...\nI talked about this a little bit with you last week um you know when you talk for a moment ago about what Richard Sherman has had to say and uh unfortunately for him this works\nAnd it does I mean ... there are two things are in an entertainment world I Would say it's okay to be not fair as long as it's fun yeah because that's that's where we are in ... and what people are acting like what's happening in the NFL is some new thing\nAnd it's not it's gone on in every sport except for baseball\nBaseball's the only one that hasn't quite gotten the memo yet they're about to them but they are about to you're a hundred percent right no one wants to go to a game and see to shift well I'll tell you what you want to know when that this will forever in my mind be the moment the moment the baseball realized that did you see the playoff drama\nYou know he's a play on me for a more with Ken griffey junior um is that you you missed it All right obviously on radio we can't share the video but we can show the audio which will do coming up in a little bit 'cause guys I'll send it to you and you can put it in the system and you can play it for everybody you can hear the the major league baseball playoff promo\nWhere Ken griffey junior or not only appears in it but I think does the voice over for it\nAnd he's essentially saying to everybody who's criticizing whether it'd be bat flipping weather all the personality that comes out of these players and they're always announcers and writers and even fans in some cases and the players themselves and we'll throw a ball at their head on the next time they'll play they're there to squash that personality\nAnd Ken griffey junior like let's talk\nOr let them play\nThat was the moment the minute baseball green let that promo videos let me know that they know they know and it took a freaking decade but ... baseball so okay you\nThat is an exciting brand of Beijing as it is when you watch the teams playing for their country you wash the players it's a little more the more juice the more energy more bad flipping a little more you can use these players in their\nElement yes for me I'm like okay I can watch their ... I can watch this it reminds me of soccer and what did he intends alert came out and said why did he come out and say after World Baseball classic this was disrespectful to the game what these guys do in other countries nature racism goal [laughter] baseball is way way better with personality\nWay better way better it is it like people like that except for the traditional and old school like they don't like is that part of it but yeah like that to me that is fun when was it was nice to hit a home run a couple of years ago\nThat oh I Love that I loved it amazes me through a take your time because to me if I can do one thing and I can do one thing and athletic I Would love to hit a homerun\nI've always wanted to get on a that's I mean it's ... it's a I Would love to hit like are you talking about I mean we're talking about maybe a two minute tried it for two minutes [laughter]\nLike you're crawling from second discern your moon walk in front of third home [laughter] you're doing ... well the first is good\nBut I grew up again that I Love ... so ... so I was a kid that war back in ... in my pocket\n[laughter]\nBut to me like that's what it is like celebrate like all of this\nI don't understand why it's ... oh you're listening there is there are moments when you know when someone has officially rubbing your face in oh for sure the example I was bringing up his win Tio goes to the star yes that was in celebration\nIt was interesting junior say how may rest in peace acts the quarterback and it gets up and has a dance with a specific name on it and nobody ever I never heard anyone be like [noise]\nIt's kind of this was like one of the quarterback you're standing over the quarterback who's still lying on the ground in pain and you're doing the ... the lights out or whatever I mean you're doing this dance ... nobody would ever say oh that's disrespectful\nBut if a baseball player gets happy about is home run as you've shown up the pitcher\nI don't understand we ... we had it ... ... ... you bring up Cindy heavy mud\nTumbled can block you were shot and literally take his finger\nNo no no no no no no no no no no point in your now with the port is being your in your nose in a way that around no no no no no nobody's got an issue so\nI I just sports I mean so so yeah it's funny that you say culturally alright so everyone probably to a man loves Steph Curry right\nStiff cherry is more than ... did anybody on the planet Steph Curry made it famous to shoot the three and not watch it go into direct\nAnd if that was going to he ... he ... he ... he throws a three out everything\nSee bodies the littlest guy in the court on a number one and number two do you want to know when for me first of all I mean that's my squad that's my guy but beyond that you want to know one for me it became okay Chris Paul did it back to him oh I Love in the playoffs the your loved it when it's stuff do\nYou laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh\nBecause there is funny it is funny what as long as you laugh it's funny long as you laugh\nAll good it's funny I loved it dishes\nCan't take it as if I don't have seven hundred we'd just like yours every single day the other ones just don't read my family had ... ...
