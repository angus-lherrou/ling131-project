of the few people in Hungary a small country of ten million people who could help explain what this says\nTo the Hungarian view is because we turned on the Hungarian television and they had the two most famous talking heads the equivalent of you know Walter Walter Cronkite and into a Dan Rather and all they were doing this was the coverage national\nTelevision is they had CNN playing on the green screen in the back and the one anchor who spoke English was literally doing a synchronous translation of the CNN coverage that was national coverage in central Europe\nAnd so uh my wife's

no apologies what is fresh here is that there are two new follows that through the Obama\nAdministration and the Bush administration and the Clinton Administration it was not clear to those of us who watch national security that the U.S what's going to focus on ... threat we're now focused let's start with Russia\nOr your experience with Russia from your dad and mom is that no matter how they dress it up their aggressive\nAnd they're aggressive especially along the boundaries at the empire\nIs it your opinion that the Trump Administration is addressing it adequately now after the failures of the Obama administration to see what Ukraine represent\nThink sending traveling entertainment solves to Kiev instead of socks and blankets is is a very uh\nNot just in the White House but elsewhere for example the gender the joint chiefs general dumped it fully appreciate that uh\nUh KGB Kindle is always a KGB kennel and the the important way to look at Russia is not as the Soviet Union of you'll\nBut at what I like to call them and the status quo actor constantly looking to destabilize but we we tend as Americans I Love my fellow Americans we tend to posit good faith on behalf of the other\nRight I'm okay you want to be oh yeah I I say something and I'm a maintenance and and I'm not a lot to do business and that's the best yes the Kremlin has\nNever work like that whether it was run by a song whether it was run by Stalin or by KGB colonel so we now have the requisite knowledge and understanding that these are bad actors not the Soviet Union this is a nation in a in demographic an economic collapse\nBut a nation that will constantly endeavor to create Eddie's will that will will wins and we'll tools which will destabilize certain regions after which they can do was exploited to their own\nBenefit and there's a there's eight phases and then we won't go through the details there in the book but right now I Would say all those eight phases are present in a number of geography is across the edges of the empire from Syria\nTo the Baltic states including Ukraine so the eight phases of Russian doctrine today\nA I credit to the Latvian ministry of defense that defense a Institute that wrote an excellent English wanted targets well one of the primary ... of the Baltic region um they wrote a wonderful English language study that I pray see in in in my work\nAnd [noise] it's nothing very new that there's a lot of in the beltway people\nWhat is different is the combination and the serious ... the seriousness with which they apply irregular warfare\nEverything is in direct the focus is on the will on the non kinetic they'll send in a little green men eventually but we now know unclassified open source that prior to the Crimean intervention\nRussia had been undermining the Ukrainian nation state for a decade\nWith sub Bush and with uh other means of ... they were ... they were so they say yes they were preaching propaganda millions of dollars worth of propaganda being pushed into the region into the Baltic region as well right now\nSo it it is it is the comprehensive this of their understanding of irregular warfare that is the danger\nWhen you got to the national defense university ah as the son of a man who fought the Soviets did you perceive that they saw Russia and Russia's action Russia's very good at this and always has been did they see it I have to admit\nWhen I arrived a there was that you could take many courses on two cities right you could take many courses on Guadalcanal\nAnd and the ... the most bizarre thing you could do the most relevant thing you could do is take cost is on the Balkan Wars of the Nineteen nineties so it was it was an aspect of the the syllabus of the J shape you meet the

consent\nCapitol police were less forgiving\nAnd drug out the doors and down the hallway\nMental hospitals for these seriously mentally ill and the streets from this woman whereas odd and an earthly as anything I have ever heard inside a mental hospital\nThey echoed off the halls and ceilings outside the gallery in decreasing astonishing aptitude [noise]\nThen the role was called [noise]\nAnd it sounded like the gates of hell opened up\nNearly a dozen woman interrupted in unison shouting towel and screaming and an unrecognizable venomous whale they wouldn't stop\nThere was a fury a rage uh hate a poison and the noise\nThat wasn't pros it wasn't strong it was just warming frills swirling\nLeaned over to someone and whispered\nPay attention that's what the left sounds like\nNothing they were yelling and howling could be heard\nIt was the sound of all of them\nIn discordant ranged fueled the wild theory that was so an earthly\nI have never heard of sound like it before\nSenator Dick Durbin said a few weeks ago in response to the committee that these were the sounds of democracy [noise] no they weren't [noise]\nThese were the sounds of hell these were the sounds of a group of people Pickering was madness they were the sounds of an irrational unhinged and on more debt lunatics these people these were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination they were in embarrassment\nAnd now we leave the EU\nSo there you go ladies and gentlemen\nYou thought that zombie hordes were just in video games and movies no\nThere is a Democrat events\nAnd Democrat protests\nSo that's what you'd get\nNow when\nWe come back on going to go to all of these calls\nAnd I've got a ton of news that we're going to get to before the end of the broadcast to we're going to be taking your calls all the way up to the conclusion of the hour show today at three o'clock central\nWhat do you make of President Trump after his meeting with roses scene which was the biggest story two weeks ago then the Kavanaugh circus happen and the road is seen meeting came and went and anybody and nobody barely blink an eye\nBut then Trump said after meeting with rows and saying it's clear to me now that the Democrats glued with Russia of course we all knew that already\nThat was already news trumpet already said that\nBut what happened in the meeting with rows and stay in the Trump flip Rosenstein\nRosenstein and Mueller always working with Trump as he went on has said if that's true was it so deceptive that they had to pretend to go after Manafort and Flynn ... it's really just all crazy what do you think happens next\nBecause here's the craziest part about this\nWhatever happens to the deep state here whose names we now know\nWhat happens to the mentally deranged protesters if this goes down\nObviously it would be the greatest thing for the world to see the likes of Hillary Clinton\nAnd the members of the Obama administration's crimes exposed and perhaps them put in jail\nThroughout the world needs is what this country needs but then what happens to these mentally unfit\nUnhinged lunatics that are just getting more violent and more riled up by the day you know that's like\nThat's the challenge behind the challenge\nLike yes the real talent is challenging the extra central threat\nTo America and to\nThis Republican to world democracy which is the deep state in the west\nThat also works with deep state or is over in the UN and all that you know whatever goes on over there too but if it all comes down if it all is exposed if there is justice in this country\nWhat do the shrieking zombie demonic hordes do next because reality\nAnd facts don't influenced these people's lives\nThat's the challenge behind the challenge that we're probably all gonna have to face but you know what that's why we sell emergency food it into a store dot com but\nWe have massive specials happening\nFifty percent off the entire infowars live product

Party\nTrying to get Hillary and\nNow I'm not sure if Obama was part of that curve ball or or as much\nAs as Hillary definitely is I think Obama had his own stuff going on and then because he became so popular to the Democrats had to work with Obama but\nAnd so maybe that's why Obama could turn on all of them but I I don't really know if that's the case\nBut the point is\nAbsolutely one hundred percent Joseph it was the Chinese Communist behind the Democrats and still to this day are behind the Democrats\nAnd on college campuses about Trump's trade war is unbelievable I mean this is again Chinese propaganda and then I've just sitting here I Know oh\nYou're going along with a false dichotomy between Jews in China it's like no you don't want obsessed with the Jews and and whatever the designers are doing which is fine that's out there I'm looking at what China's trying to do the communist to my country right now\nWhich I'd rather have free market\nIf you want to blame the free market on the Jews fine I prefer the free market then the Chinese Communist market\nBut just look at Hillary Clinton's private server server owned by the Chinese look at Diane Feinstein having a Chinese by underemployed for Twenty years and look at what President Trump is doing to China they say Trump has started a trade war with China okay fine so so what has been China been doing to us than trade rape\nTrade rape\nBy China and so Trump gets into office he says hey look I'll get on with the Chinese\nI respect the Chinese leadership I mean they are much smarter than our leadership look at how they stole our economy right out from under us that's dumb our leaders are so Trump said okay\nWe're not going to let China steal our economy anymore\nAnd we're going to have fair trade\nAnd we're going to bring manufacturing jobs back that's what we're going to do\nSo of course China and the Democrats would do everything they can to try to stop that Joseph so so yes we've got fifty seconds left here or go ahead and close up\nWell at the end of the day or you know rebellion is against a revolution is against those this belief in God or less the same as a civil war coming I don't think that's the case I think it's going to be a revolutionary\nWar again these banks are local industry against\nThe entertainment industry and [noise] you know that that that's where we're directly my

hurricane Michael right now\nWe are directly in the path we've been on the edge of several over the last few years this one we're right in the past so my advice to the people that are are now staying that uh you know once the\nWinds get over fifty miles an hour our first responders or police fire they're not going to be able to get to you so hopefully you've got enough water and uh\nIt's like a you know it's it's headed right right towards and the developments if\nYou want out of the developments over the last couple of hours the uh ten pm a National Hurricane center\nOr update shows it now at a what a hundred and twenty five miles an hour the women's rights and expected to be right now over a hundred and thirty which would make it at least a category for hurricane that when a hit the um pan handle Gulf\nRight they're they're talking about the storm surge being a a a a really strong storm surge in and talking about how the the potential\nUh for a life threatening conditions is really great with the storm a everyone in this area needs to heed the warnings and and listen to officials and and those directives given by officials are in the coming hours if you haven't already because\nAh you see the pictures and videos of the people in that area I I'm getting ready evacuating a boarding up windows and everything else this is a major storm already and has the potential to be ah in in most believe that will be a historic storm\nA in terms of the damage and the size of the storm\nOr it will then move inland with a ton of rainfall we were talking during the pre show meeting as it moves through\nUh the uh the the panhandle of Florida and then goes into north north easterly direction toward the Carolinas that's going to be dumping a lot of rain the Carolinas ... they're saying it will move faster than Florence so it won't present the same problems\nBut the problem is with the areas affected by Florence that are already saturated the ground is already saturated then of course any rain at all is going to cause problems\nAnd they will be getting rain in those areas in the coming days uh but uh more immediately we're looking at a at a the panhandle\nAnd when you see wins over a hundred and thirty miles an hour if it's a a category for they say would be the biggest a hurricane ever to hit the uh uh panhandle I'm a ... when I when I Lived in a ... of our Florida when I Lived in the Fort Walton Beach Pensacola area back in the eighties\nEverybody's still talked about Camille ...

with meteorologist Tom hale he will\nUm a joined us but uh you you know you make a great point when you talk about the fact that\nWhen you're talking about you and I think both of us may I made a fair point you made a great point and ah but you really don't know what you're going to get until you see somebody sitting in front of the un it's almost like a presidential spokesperson for as making the analogy of you is almost like an NFL quarterback you'd wrapped in NFL quarterback\nYou have no idea how they're going to perform you'd have no idea right and all the time they get on the field unions like oh they stink I really really good and we I'd mentioned Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nThat that you know most presidential spokes people I don't like but if you would have told me when and I probably made the comment I don't remember specifically making it\nBut when she came aboard I probably went [noise] no I just don't think she has it right away was I wrong\nYou know and and and she has been very she doesn't even flinch anymore\nOr ... if you look at the nature of the ridiculous questions thrown at her every single day now it's just it's more like a game\nAnd that's the way she plays it but at first it was not a game and and it it's not an easy job\nIt's not a job that anybody would want but she's been very good at it and you're right with few exceptions like a John Bolton you know you pretty much know what you're going to get the John Bolton but otherwise ah there are a lot of people on that list and and and we'll see but clearly again going in I think they know what they're in for\nA not only internationally and what we're dealing with at the un but of course a what the president expects\nA drivers for cobra electronics you should be aware that there are parts of ice Seventy five and also I tend there in the Florida Panhandle\nUh that are going to be affected by this storm a you as you can imagine especially everything pretty much east of mobile on I ten is going to be affected ah ah and it could be for a number of days to know that ah when you're going in there is going\nKinds of supplies that will be going into Florida when the storm passes and the conditions are safe to get that stuff and uh but uh we just want to remind you that er that that is going to be\nVery treacherous for the coming days and the foreseeable future at least I Would say over the next several days [noise] and she was a weekend we'll talk with meteorologist Tom hails get an update on hurricane Michael next [noise]\n\nLife threatening situation start what is that timeline where is that window and and what should we expect during that time line\nOkay when it comes to the timeline or what you should expect 'em by tomorrow morning it's still should be offshore\nAnd it will be probably still a category three but darn close to a category for it I wouldn't be shocked if in the next ... in in a in one hour from now I may be upgraded\nBut by Wednesday evening it should be on shore and so that would be in line with Tallahassee it would be coming across Tallahassee by Thursday evening it shouldn't be\nEntering the Carolina and cutting right across the middle of the Carolinas\nAnd so the eastern side of it will be the onshore winds and rain and the storms so Charlotte and end up the coast\nAnd then they don't need any more uh destruction or anything now wins are going to be around forty five miles an hour or when it gets to the Carolinas and that's going to be Thursday morning but on Wednesday\nToday or we're gonna have winds in Tallahassee tonight of at least eighty miles an hour and a and a probably sustained winds up to forty or fifty miles an hour going through Tallahassee um we're looking at wins that are going to be up to a hundred miles an hour\nOr when we get to a coming onshore and the storm surges the other\nAnd among city six to nine foot storm surge\nAnd that's in part because their shoreline faces a little more to the southwest and so uh when it comes in if it comes in to the east the winds are going to be backing so it will reduce that effect\nBut you get past that to saint Joe which is on the peninsula they're swinging around toward Appalachia cola\nOr we're looking at a storm surge that will run all the way around through the entire big band that doesn't include cedar key um\nOf nine to Thirteen feet\nWow yeah\nNine to Thirteen feet um obviously once your past three feet cars float\n... yeah and and and so we're talking about a ... again in terms of that immediate threat really the greatest threat right now in those areas along the shoreline we're talking storm surge correct\nI storm surges is clearly from the you know there's a storm surge warning in effect from Panama City past crystal river and and so as an example um we're looking at Panama City tonight they'll start seeing wins moving their way up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd all the way through an average fifty miles an hour through Wednesday night they are going to have Gus Wednesday night or as this storm is coming ashore of a hundred miles an hour and a storm surge of eight to twelve feet or excuse me rain I'm Sorry of eight to twelve inches a foot of rain and\nSo it inland and even on the coast flash flooding is going to be a common event and that range got to go somewhere and uh and once you start to inundate the water starts to rise under a storm surge um then from there then you start dealing with you know the ...\nThe storm came in in the Carolinas the winds were coming out of the southeast and blowing up the Neuse River New Bern is at the end of the Neuse River and they had a water rise of ten point two feet\nAnd and we had the um we had a a lieutenant I'm dropping his name but the lieutenant of the police department there the following day talking about the\nUh friday night rescues which were over three hundred and fifty boat rescues um that night while\nWhile I'm ... again ah the you know I this this should go without saying but but certainly we want to repeat it as often as possible\nThe people that are are in the path of this storm need heat all of the directors\nAnd warnings given by local officials do not hesitate a this is this is going to be a life threatening storm it is already a life threatening storm and it is right now you have time to get out of the way of the storm\nA Tom ... in terms of uh the the rainfall you mentioned a that we're going to see in some places maybe eight to twelve inches\nOf rain um the flooding potential though won't necessarily be like it was because of warrants because of the storm is moving faster is that correct\nYeah to some degree that's correct but still I expect many areas to pick up anywhere from eight to twelve inches as we move inland through Tallahassee\nAnd then from there when we move across the border into Georgia we're still going to be looking at five inches of rain or more in many areas and I can pull up some maps and break that out\nUm next time we talk but really the the fact of the matter is that it only takes you know it doesn't take a lot of water if the ground saturated fats\nThe difference here is that this storm liked the Carolinas along the coast are going to cause flooding in the places that are not the usual places and\nYeah All right and ... and when when you expected to

water and a and food and stuff to take care of yourself\n[noise] ah that's mayor of Panama City Greg ... bread Nikki uh uh yesterday evening we just got an update from the national Hurricane Center and from what we can see with the sustained winds of no a hundred and thirty miles an hour it's up to a category\nFor in fact the national Hurricane Center is saying it is now a hurricane category for a hundred and thirty miles an hour\nThey are that again do you look at the strength of this storm and and the history of the storm over the weekend or the protections being anywhere from a one to two and then late in the weekend a more uh closer to a two and and pretty much everybody was calling that by Monday morning a change\nAnd they were saying that it has the potential of being a three and now it is up to officially a category for hurricane or a hurricane Michael\nA it is a set to come ashore uh sometime in the afternoon three or four pm there near Panama City Florida\nSame thing throughout the day uh yesterday they were saying uh you should be aware that a first responders are going to be limited and being able to get to you and in in many cases especially while the storm is at its strongest in that area will not be able to get to you so you may not have power you may be in a situation\nOr that or you will not be able to again I get to any kind of a ... assistance or four hours\nAnd so uh it is best to get out of the way of the storm as soon as possible\nUh get inland go somewhere where you will be safe and where you are with others especially if you have an underlying medical condition or anything else that might a warrant or that kind of a of a need so\nUh we'll see here and a little while we're going to talk with meteorologist or John trout I get caught up on this latest update from the national Hurricane Center\nAre meteorologist Tom hale was with us about a half hour ago and we were talking about this in fact he predicted that it would become officially a category for hurricane but Michael or will be officially the strongest hurricane to ever hit\nA the the coast of Florida\nAnd a while you know you you go back to a a a Camille a I was looking over the the stats from Hurricane Irma last year um\nIt is a ... I mean you talk about the the the destruction or that they stormed does and and some of the things I guess if you've never been in this situation\nThat you might not know I have never been through a hurricane I've been through some tornadoes\nIn my life but I've never been to a hurricane so ah especially for those people who may be new to that area I think about you know the area\nIt's coming out ah maybe here in the next couple of days or early next week and as we get closer to see the effect that that that has had there there are a ton of these races that are a statistical tie with even in a statistical tie\nDemocrats maybe up a point or two and a and so this is something that I'm sure as being very carefully watched\nAnd again when you go into and we're not pollsters you know we're not pollsters we can read them but I mean the methodology\nOf of each and every poll has different nuances and it it all depends on you know what the sample is do they interview more Democrats than actually are in\nA you know that normally vote in a particular race or not or did they over sample Republicans ... and and so you look at it but overall when you look at at the the generalized polls are a ton of these Senate races\nThat are extremely close and so\nA lot of eyes are watching to see okay what's the excitement level of going to be the voter excitement level\nOut of the cabinet and hearing which I Do believe will have an impact sure\nYeah and so there's are we are right now looking at some of the the\nRaces up uh you you look at the the race with Rick Scott it's interesting dynamic and and and frankly hurricane Michael [noise] uh and how it's handled will be part of that discussion and campaigning\nOn both sides uh uh you know for the next few weeks um it it may seem like an unfortunate situation to many but that's that's how politics runs in the United states and it may it can make or break a candidate depending on how it's handled and while you know a senator or isn't going to have\nA control if he were to become a senator or over what's going on in that state necessarily um ... like a governor would during an emergency situation how he handles it\nSituation I'm sure a many from his camp will tell you well we're not focused on that right now nor should they be but people outside that a camp are focused on that\nAnd will be one of the reality is that if\nFlorence was handled properly by the Trump Administration Democrats would be using ... yes and and you end up being that is used in political races yes and and as you and I've talked about from the very beginning and I watched a lot more\nOf the of of Florence are coming in than I have so far of of this particular race\nBut when you watch on the weather channel you came across with a great opinion of the federal government and how they were how they were handling it yes it'll be interesting to see at the same thing happens you know here because it will be used yes no doubt eight six six

era and every girl you've talked about everything from ... news of the day whether Europe wage for your job story you're the one ... radio\nAll across America eight six six Ninety red eyes are currently and uh I'm Gary McNamara hurricane Michael now a strength for a hurricane here's Appalachia cola Florida mayor ... junction [noise]\nWe'll have a handful of people who have chose to stay and ... and I'm I'm really dismayed at that because again this is a life threatening storm if anything I can get across the league\nPeople that didn't have the warning\nPossible loss loss of life [noise]\nAh so the latest National Hurricane ah advisory was a just a little over an hour ago\nA and the wins the sustained winds went from a hundred and twenty five miles an hour to one hundred and thirty miles of a per hour making it now an extremely dangerous as the national Hurricane Center calls in an extremely dangerous hurricane or if it hits as a four would be the strongest hurricane to ever hit\nThe Florida Panhandle in modern times in in a recorded a record so this is a very very bad storm we're being told a flood surge anywhere uh depending on where you are a along that portion of the Big Bend of of the coast anywhere between eight and a even twelve or fourteen feet\nRight are extremely dangerous storm here that is a again not to be ignored the the uh the you know the the idea of\nOf uh staying where you are a ... again is ill advised by the authorities talking about the loss of a power and who knows how long that power could be out of the inability of first responders to get to you\nUm and and then if if the last minute moment\nYou were to try and decide\nA get out of the way the storm then of course that would be in in in some cases possibly\nAh impossible you could you could be in a situation where you were trapped in in that uh uh in that home or in that building and can't get out because the roads are filled with a water debris or all the above\nAd is going to be again a situation that where you start seeing these stronger winds uh later this morning and then the guy anywhere between ah most forecasters saying anywhere between a three and six PM\nBecause you mentioned Gary the the the rainfall potential you could see eight twelve inches of area or a a rain in the area and you could see it you will the likely flash flooding and some of those areas\nUm and that will that will cause again uh those problems where you know you're going to have people flooding a and a storm surge being the deadliest part\nOf any storm like this are not just the wins with debris and checking out structures but the the flooding where people just make a decision to try and and drive through the flooding or get through it um and and that becomes deadly and medications\nAnd look even you know Tallahassee that's a little bit to inland they're expecting you know eighty mile an hour winds yeah still at that point and a and a ton of when sort of a bunch of problems\nOr could be had there as we uh go through a Wednesday it it ah when when it ... and it's interesting because it's still the movement is still ah from what I can see dead north of twelve miles per hour and but at some point it's going to start taking that are easterly bent and then when it hits\nOf of uh of of innocence I don't believe anybody just because they say it\nI Need evidence and when somebody stories change\nI'm suspicious those are all rational critical thinking\nCommonsense arguments and the Democrats if you believe that way are now calling for instability to harass you everywhere even invade your privacy where ever you are and it's\nNot just the uh the old guard and Maxine Waters or he'll know Clinton is Cory Booker\nPeople that are called the future of the party it's ... it's now Hillary yes well and and you know that you can easily just minutes Maxine Waters in the Hillary as the old guard\nBut the future of the party is this so if if Hillary jumping out well and by the way Hillary's jumping on board as you mentioned because everybody else's because all she sees this as the future of the part ... and she and she also believes it's the mainstream of yeah already\nThey should have been it sends a preponderance of the evidence to decide somebody whether you believe somebody is guilty or not\nYou went from week to go people talking about John McCain and we need more civility to the official call for instability in just a matter of weeks I\nYou believe in due process under the constitution you believe in uh the presumption of innocence you don't believe somebody just because they say it that the evidence has to prove it and their story should remain consistent you believe those kinds of things which are embedded in the constitution of the United states\nThan you are a rape enable us to get a rapist enable is that what you are right and because you are no stability towards you that is their opinion\nRight now I have to ask you is that insane or what\nWell before you try and dismissed Rand Paul and his concerns you have to remember on the day that the school he's got shot that was an attempted multiple yes assassination that's what

meteorologist Tom hale will join us\nAnd we'll get another one a little over a Ninety minutes from now and and see where that goes but certainly again or not much is changing in terms of\nThe fact that this is a a life threatening storm a a major hurricane on its way to uh Florida so uh we'll we'll talk to Tom here and just a few minutes and follow the story of course throughout the morning this morning and\nAs well or the rest of the week as a Michael continues its path or through the south east and then back out over the Atlantic\nDid you see where uh where are some you Senator Tom cotton said that he believes Schumer's people leaked before letter really yeah he was on with on Hugh Hewitt show yeah instead I Believe the Schumer political operation was behind this from the very beginning Mm well\nI mean if because that would it wouldn't be a totally unexpected ride it doesn't seem out of the realm of possibilities because if you're Feinstein you you don't take it is the chairman Grassley you take it to sugar party letter right and and have him deal with it right for video robot here's your forecast\nFrom air force reserve and know a hurricane hunter aircraft indicate that the maximum sustained wins have increased to near one hundred thirty miles an hour with higher just possible as Michael becomes a category for hurricane Michael\nExtremely dangerous life threatening storm surge hurricane force winds and heavy rainfall expected\nAs well as the potential for tornadoes to spawn from the result of this system will get nine to Thirteen feet of water inundation along the coastline and as much as twelve inches of rainfall from the system for areas just inland from where we expect Michael to make landfall in the big band\nAware of winter weather advisories from the northern plains answer Colorado on the eastern side of the Rockies you're national forecast from red on radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nThanks so much John ... if you'd like to get in line to robot now eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\n\nUm tomorrow evening because we're expecting a still a landfall sometime around three to four o'clock and that means that it'll speed up a little bit before it comes to shore\nRight now it's gone gone to the north of twelve so\nAnd of course ah you know it's been pointed out time and time again not just the wins in in the destruction of property and and presenting a danger to humans but\nBut really the flooding in the storm surge here the water that comes along with a storm like\nThis ah being a potentially life threatening in fact it is life threatening and is often deadly um and and that\nSomething to be aware of it is not just the strength of the storm in terms of wins but also the water that it's going to deliver\nLightning was like the number one whether killer and you know why lightning isn't the number one whether killer ... because we convinced everybody [laughter] not to go out and the lightning\nAnd I write [laughter] okay yeah indoors it's\nLightning right but you know we've done a really lousy job of convincing people to use common sense when they're on the road and they're driving\nAnd and we had over thirty people in the Carolinas drowned because they decided they were going to be tougher and they knew what they were doing better than the people who are telling them to stay off the road right now and and\nAnd and so yeah a a storm surge is usually felt along the coast and let's say maybe five to ten miles inland wherever there's a waterway that that water from the Gulf of Mexico can move its way in\nAnd so whether you're an Appalachian cola or you are in Panama City\nOr you're swinging around uh uh toward the the coastline just south of Perry and the Big Bend that you're looking at a storm surge that's going to be easily nine feet ...\nCould be less right can be up to nine feet or even Thirteen actually the weather service has got a plot at nine to Thirteen feet in that area\n... for those of us who have never witnessed that first and I just described the dynamics of a storm surge especially one with the potential of a nine to twelve feet or more as you mentioned\nThat because you know we've seen the recent video from the the nominee in Indonesia and we know so we can see that kind of force in terms of a storm surge I mean one of the dynamics of that what I describe that to us what takes place during the storm yeah because I'm looking here I'm looking here\nIt's right there what is what is the fact how far I mean that goes in a pretty long way doesn't\nIt oh yeah yeah when you go into the west bank or the East Bay um\nAll the way up through um what they called dear point lake which is is is really an extension the northern extension of the north bay a or the grand lagoon\nThis entire area from the from the lower ... which is which is basically where the beach is uh the the bridge that goes over to the over to the beach I'm\nAn inland all of that water rises\nUniformly pretty much it's kind of like turning the water on it's not like what you see in the ... like ... turning the water on and watching your bath tub Phil and except in this particular case as the storm gets closer in the last uh\nHour and a half to two hours or so the bath tub spill and so in the Carolinas the the I I don't know if it was the record but it's darn close to a New Bern North Carolina\nUh picked up a storm surge a that was at least ten feet I'm there may have been a higher storm surge\nA further around the point I'm at that sticks out there if the Carolinas um but this water just keeps rising and and as it starts to rise three feet six feet and so forth you need to be able to get to a place\nThat's higher than the storm surge that is really simple as a gift and this water is moving and and so the water has motion it can erode stuff um and when I say it's moving it it's it's\nNormal current and it's moving because it's also got winds blowing it at a good speed\nThat body down but it's still moving so I the the place that I recall and I drove through this area a couple of times [noise] um\nBecause it's just a beautiful ride in your in your\n... you know if you've done this if Germany for East Point Appalachian coal a cute little town especially when you're coming across the bridge and they're looking at Appalachian coal ... down to the south and East Bay on the other side [noise]\nUm then you notice is you're looking off along the water all these nice homes but they're on stilts and they're they're all stilted easily at about ten feet [noise]\nUm well Thirteen feet would still inundate those homes wow\nYeah that's that's that you know that that puts it in perspective for anyone who's gone to a beach and seen these houses in fact we've stayed in one uh in in in Texas and the and the Galveston area over the summer and we've done that many times but if you've ever been to these are areas and you see in these houses on these still\nUh you're right those the typically there are about ten feet high\nBut add another three feet to that potentially and that means even on still you're going to see destruction and flooding of those homes and that is very very powerful and and sobering frankly\nWell you've heard the terms high profile vehicles right okay well this is a house that's a high profile house and once you get past the stilts now you've got three feet of water going into a more solid structure and so that's going to be a lot easier to topple and destroy yeah\nSure and wildlife got great point of the higher center of gravity yes I Am that situation which becomes a very destructive very easily um ... and so again or the timeline here we're looking for the eye to come ashore sometime in the afternoon\nAnd and and right now it depends if it\nTo the north northeast\nUh it wouldn't get there 'til six thirty eastern time um but if it picks up some speed or even a couple of miles an hour goes from twelve to fourteen and so forth [noise] ah we could anticipate the same coming in a little bit earlier than that around four o'clock and that's kind of what everybody's betting on right now\nThey're getting rain right now mental cola has just had the light and rain and not in fact all of this is very light rain tropical rain starts off his little find drops in than increases from there [noise] um there's a couple of thunderstorms that are running anywhere from\nAppalachian coal up to Pensacola Beach so this is the eye opener hey notice it's raining idiot real it's coming your way\nRight how far inland can we can we expect those hurricane force winds anything from Seventy five miles an hour and above a two to sustain a how far inland and and how long do you expect that to be the case\nAll right let's assume that it it comes ashore and we'll just simply call it where it is right now for all right forty five miles inland ... is what you would be looking at her and forty five miles inland would make those winds go to Panama City at least and possibly a little further out\nAnd it would take those wins back over to probably not to Perry but at least to St Mark's ... National Wildlife refuge area which is to the just south or just slightly south east to Tallahassee but\nNow remember this this right now the location is a hundred and eighty miles to the south south west to\nPanama City or a hundred and Seventy miles okay southwest of Appalachia cola hurt a tropical storm force winds thirty nine miles an hour and more are extending out right now as we speak a hundred and ...\nAn hour winds at the extremities Appalachian coal uh and and possibly you know and the ... and an hour or two by morning for sure when the sun comes up they'll be feeling the thirty nine miles forty mile an hour winds or even then it may still be possible for you to get inland\nMeteorologists Tom hale a Tom we'll talk to you at the bottom of the next hour on the following me our

what a radio [noise]\nAll across America eight six six Ninety right ideas are entirely and uh I'm Jerry McNamara hurricane Michael has increased its strengths now is a force to spring right now of hurricane for category for storms which means winds over one hundred and thirty miles an hour\nThis storm is not weakening factored still strengthening I mean this is the real the all the law to drill a this is going to come in hard it's going to come and powerful and you do not want to be on the immediate coastline and building\nA that's a storm chaser Mike these in Panama City and that report there for a to a west on Westwood One the news\nYou know you watch the storm and and and look at how the storm is strengthen over well just over the last twenty four hours really are but from the weekend where uh somewhere predicting a category somewhere between a category one possibly a two and then by Monday morning\nA it of what the what that report early Monday started to change and they were saying possibly a three now officially a category for hurricane Michael is as you mentioned Gary\nAnd everything that comes with it I mean if you look at the the the winds uh that will be a danger to two people and take out power lines no doubt\nBut the storm surge anywhere between nine and twelve feet or higher\nOr the water from this storm not just from the storm surge but the rainfall that will come\nIt is going to be dangerous it is going to be life\nStorm if you're in this area uh I Do everything you can to get out of the way of the storm as it continues to move inland it will dump more rain and we also have to keep in mind that it will spawn tornadoes coming up here to about thirty minutes we'll get back with meteorologist Tom hale\nWho's been without a been with us through uh the morning and and uh and and also did some outstanding coverage on red eye radio for Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Irma as well\nUh so we want to get back with him and find out the

ashore somewhere between three and six PM on a Wednesday afternoon\nImportant to understand that the hurricane is strengthening overnight now a category for maximum sustained winds of one hundred and thirty miles an hour still moving north hasn't made the move to the uh the east yet at the twelve miles an hour but the all but it seems like it there's a it it there's\nA almost unanimous ah from the

remained\nRely in the ... ... ... when you look at normal hurricanes as to where they go and still this thing once it hits\nA around a Panama City will be going a ... an northeast and then even takes more of an easterly pattern as it goes through Georgia South Carolina\nAnd the southern part to eastern part of a well central to eastern part of North Carolina right and then we'll be out and that that will be a let let's look at it here it will be um it it's\nBecause politically the effect of it is what it's what we've said I mean 'cause I could see the scenario although we haven't been told is because nobody's talking about it or speculating about it\nExcept us\nWell this is something real because we know the role of the inspector general's office you know we also know a Michael Horowitz

now\nThan sometimes that again it it only slows down or slows down temporarily\nBut doesn't really a handwritten much but we'll see uh where where they are they were typically in the season where a lot of you know\nA home buying is not done because families especially I don't want to change a school ah right here in the heart of the school year so they'll wait until the spring uh to to buy but we'll see what that does typically\nGot a great job if you if you believe you got a job security and good pay\nA you know for example looking at the two year treasury bills because when I see the interest rates going up on that that means the interest rates going up on the debt two year treasury bills last year one point for nine percent now too pointy double yeah right yeah\nYeah that's going to mean a lot of very bad things in the future because the fact that we we quit a caring I Know our our listeners and conservative friends still care about the debt and the fiscal policy of the U.S\nBut the the people in Washington and don't be caused by and large because most Americans don't\nIf we were all screaming about it in unison than they would be the number one concern over there but it's not the by the way that's on both sides of the Iowa\nRepublicans are willing to spend just as much as Democrats you know you look at the spending bills now there's really no debate is there now there's I mean the only thing the only issue with a spending bill that that pops up [noise] is the wall\nBy the way did you see in the house they're introducing a bill that would fully fund the wall [noise]\nYeah they're trying to see if they can watch try and get that done before the end of the year [noise] interest\n\nAfter it is passed by right um but I I think our prayers need to be with all the people\nWho are up and down that coastline that are there because they realize that even though the majority of people have a vacuum wait it out of a given area that there are still some people behind and while they're not going to be able to go out and do anything once the winds up over\nForty miles an hour and they become tropical storm wins um\nOver with they're going to be in there in force I Know a surrounding a Panama City they've got I think six hundred staged power company people were going to swarm in there the governor of Florida\nHas called out I think it's fourteen hundred a National Guards uh guardsmen or guards folks ah [laughter]\nAnd uh the same is true\n'em up and down the up and down the coast three states of of basically um declared a you know a disaster urgency\nRight let let me let me just ask you this because you did you had predicted a before the last ah advisory that showed it went to a category of for you predicted that would go up a couple of ...\nOf a of a more miles per hour from a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty and you hit it right you expected to get any stronger or do seed weakening as it gets closer to shore\nAh no I don't see a weakening as gets closer to shore in this particular case um the uh the water hasn't been touched so we're looking at eighty five degree average water temperature\nUm the other thing that's going on is that unlike a lot of these storms where we've got a cold front that might come in from the continental United States bringing in a little bit drier air\nThere is a cold front out there but it's it's moving through the Dallas area right now it's it's nowhere near this and so uh in in terms of what we know in the United states and in in the mid west and so forth we call it the warm sector that's the area ahead of the cold front\nThat warm sector is a couple of hundred miles long and they're in the heart of that warm sector they have all the fuel all the moisture and\nEver it gains it will carry to shore and then once it hits the friction of the shore and then it will start to degenerate a little bit so Tallahassee could be seeing routine I'm\nEighty two maybe a little more than that mile an hour gusts with sustained winds of fifty miles an hour while Appalachia cola and Panama City beach will have one hundred plus mile an hour winds as it's coming ashore or this afternoon\nAnd and and they'll have periods where those guys drop off to Seventy five miles an hour ...\n... so you know ... this is this is a fascinating point um you you may not realize that savannah you know is way out on the on the coast here or north Brunswick and and Georgia coming out of Atlanta on sixteen uh savannah\nBecause of the wind field is going to have wins that are being gusting up to twenty five miles an hour with some isolated Gus tomorrow night up to fifty miles an hour ...\nAnd the entire coast from the Georgia toast up through the south Carolina and North Carolina coast\nUm all of that area um potentially is far up as Morehead City um is going to feel the force of this storm on Thursday as it moves its way out of\nOut of a Florida and process Georgia across Valdosta and probably somewhere between savannah and I'd go to a south of making\nAnd eventually comes up across Florence\nKinda young we're looking at I'm looking at the map right here and a tropical storm warnings for all the Georgia coast and looks like about three quarters of the south Carolina\nExactly exactly and I didn't even mentioned Virginia but yeah it goes that far north and uh and so we can expect forty plus mile an hour forty five mile an hour winds all the way up that entire stretch on shore wins because this is a this would be a a nor'easter\nThat the Windsor gonna bring onshore flow and it's still relatively warm along there and whatever rain has dropped and rainfall figures for that particular area\nOr are still pretty significant and I'm I'm\nWe're looking at the Florida Panhandle 'em and mid Atlantic and all the way up to New England at one to three inches of rain and as for the Carolinas southern Virginia Georgia three to six inches of rain with isolated amounts of eight inch rains\nWow wow uh and and\nThat causes life threatening flash flooding\nYes yes and as people often do not heed the warnings or ignore high water areas and believe that they can get through those areas that's where it becomes deadly\nYeah let me give you another one of those little analogy is like the bath tub analogy I gave you earlier um you go to the grocery store and there's a gallon of water you pick it up and you go oh this is kind of heavy but it's cool [noise] well that gallon of water weighs about seven pounds\nOK Now let's take a thousand gallons of water per minute rolling over a road\nWhich is not an unreasonable right amount of water going across something even if we brought that down and have we're we're still looking at you know thousands of pounds two three four thousand pounds it will be as if a\nA ... ton pickup truck we're at Rhodes level pounding on the road back and forth just kinda bulldozing it and so forth\nSome level so it's going to look nice and flat and smoothing all across it it's probably not going to be you know perfectly clear so you are not going to be able to see what's under it\nAnd and so just imagine all those containers of walk gallons of water on a giant entire I all of the grocery store rolling across continuously every minute across the road what are the odds is gonna tear up that road and you think you're just being tired enough to make it through\nRight and and the fact that it doesn't uh it relatively speaking it doesn't take a high water or in order to move a vehicle I mean it it has that forces you read six inches ...\nSo you're talking about uh you know again all these all these threats that people cannot assessed possibly assessed properly or in that situation and again he those warnings are there is absolutely no reason\nTo go through all high water or a a low area that has high water in these situations and heed the warnings of those local and state officials\nIn the ...

update here from the national Hurricane Center what the first thing that hit you\nMiles an hour wow wow that's not and us no\nThat's the sustained wind speeds or in the center of the storm to a hundred and forty miles an hour now Ken this this cat for category\nGoes up to a hundred and fifty seven miles an hour a hundred and fifty six miles an hour after a hundred and fifty seven I I don't expect it to get to that point right okay but at this point all bets are off I'm ... and it's now it's now increase speed by one mile an hour now that's kind of significant I said it was wobbling and I\nAnd as has started to pick up speed and as it gets closer\nUpper air wins will start to turn it off in a north northeast direction and it will speed up and we'll see that in the next advisory but probably what caught my attention even more than that was what the Tallahassee weather service National Weather services just posted on their website okay\nIt says unprecedented event unfolding\nFrom the national weather service office in Tallahassee\nWe search the history database for a category ... storm and landfall in the panhandle of the Big Bend area and the map and they show this map it's got just a giant white circle around that is blank\nIs never happened before and so then they put their advice this is your all words you know screaming and text Las T chance to get to a safe place\nAnd get there in time and the storm will bring deadly surge and to the Florida Panhandle and the Big Bend coast and this is not comparable to anything you've ever seen before\nAnd so if you've been told to evacuate\nLeave don't say don't risk the life of your family\nRight right uh a dumb decision\nTwenty five miles an hour to a hundred and forty does that increase the storm surge the height of it\nYes it does and there was a small pressure fall and the pressure fall also has an effect on the ... you know the there's less pressure on the surface of the of the ocean\nAll right ... ... and so in terms of the I guess the arrival of those dangerous elements we we talk about the eye of the storm coming ashore\nOfficially but what about the arrival of those dangerous elements and as the winds start to increase too dangerous levels the rain starts to increase and the storm surge begins\nWhat kind of timeframe are we looking at you believe\nProbably about three hours in advance and K O and other words three hours and not from here at the time I read it three hours in advance of the fall so sometime around noon is when things are going to rapidly terrier eight yeah\nYou cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate ... to ... you can start again\nSo we're not going to be civil until we get our way\nIn fact the instability right now if you look at the uh the level of it it is about them not getting their way they're not winning and and we said this I don't know it was a couple of months ago and we've said All right imagine that that there's not a blue wave imagined that the Republicans maintain power in the house and the Senate\nNow the polls are you know all over the place and we're not making productions were just saying for the sake of the conversation imagine that happens you know how insane it's going to be imagined that Trump wins again and twenty twenty\nThere there's no sign of letting up in fact what you just heard by their former candidate for president of the United states is we will not be civil\nA and look the I I a\nHer for being honest\n\nThe room that you got me on that you know I I guess my point is they really think this is going to work and they really believe that the ... the if you're a Democrat you really believe\nThat by intimidating and in in a mob rule because you won't do it individually but I don't do that you won't you won't do it individually in a place where there aren't TV cameras right you're not going to confront anybody you only do it when you've got a group of people behind you\nAnd you find a singular source there when you get when you have when you've got the crowd power over someone\nWhich again is cowardice in in in in my book\nAnd when we saw you know the whole Ted Cruz thing and CNN was talking about the whole mob think well it's not ... it's not as if they're discussing what\nWhat the definition of mob is ... but the fact is we know what we know what they're trying to do when they're being much more clear about what they're trying to do\nMy point is they think they're going to win over the American people are that they think they're going to intimidate conservatives or Republicans on this I'm Sorry I got a failed policy that is just not it's not going to work it's a wrong policy but the fact is they're doing this why because they can't win the debate eight six six Ninety red eye\nHurricane Michael is forecast to be the most

we've been told here since a mutt hurricane Michael is hit a hundred and forty mile an hour winds now and it's well into a category for right that well built structures can be destroyed yes they can offer on\nAttracts drivers we want to remind you that of course I ten right there in the entire panhandle of Florida or it's going to be affected by this and how much of it or will likely be\nOr as a as a ... and and fuel in that area of course we'll be scarce so just be aware that like Seventy five as well in Florida or will be one\nTo make sure that you keep an eye on ahead of time with your attitude that area but uh the best advice as to avoid that area if at all fossil\n\n\n\nYou can share it with any of your friends in Florida you can share with anyone you think know somebody who might be in Florida because they need to hear this message the banner heading says unprecedented event unfolding and then it goes on to validate that by saying that we search the database for a category ... storm\nAnd to make landfall in the panhandle big band and this is what our map showed a blank it's never happened before\nSo this is your last in bold letters chance to get to a safe place and the time for that is closing\nAnd so within the next five or six hours if not already you may be in an area where the water started to rise up and you may not be able to get out of there [noise] okay\nThat time is closing and so they the weather service because they've never seen anything like this before long that coastline ah they're bleeding and saying if you have been told to evacuate leave and don't stay and don't risk the life\nYour life or the life or your family\nAnd you also have to include the thought that if you are in a situation and it becomes an emergency if you can't get out of there that means first responders can't get to you\nExactly right and and they've heard that message on their local television stations or radio stations and everything else but the reason people\n... says and their own personal bias is limited\n... yeah ... ...\n... really that simple when no nobody ... let's put it this way the vast majority of people who live there are mostly nobody but the vast majority of people that live there have never seen anything like this and let somebody might have gone through hurricane Camille\nWell ... and you mentioned bill when you mentioned you know the nearby air force bases and military personnel and you know I mean just any transient population\nMaybe some tourists that are there people that just haven't lived there and as as that or even if you have for a long time if this is an unprecedented event that means very few people relatively speaking had been through this if any in that area have lived through this kind of storm\nIn ... those those damaging when's the water and everything else that becomes a threat very quickly\nYes and and and it means that the people who are in charge of predicting that are now in a situation where all bets are off\n... ... is that printed yeah I mean\nWe make for addiction and and and you normally say this about us whether guys well that they get it right fifty percent of the time and they still get to keep their job well maybe we are better than that but it doesn't matter because\nIn this case this is what we're guessing it it gave us fifty percent of the time and if we're wrong by fifty percent then forget it right\n[laughter] exactly and and and that's again\nYou look at it to what you mentioned earlier it bears repeating here in ... in a well built structure a well built home new construction up to code and beyond that these high winds can rip a ... roof off and will do so in a half a second\nAnd that debris goes flying again you know into I enjoyed it and it goes in and do your neighbors structure and we're\nHaven't even talked about the uh any given possibility and the potential at any moment for a a tornado\nOr out of it but this is just one big tornado rhyming winds up to a hundred and forty miles an hour we just got a big tornado ... right\nWell let me ask you this because you know since we've been on the air it ... it was a hundred and twenty five an outside for a hundred and forty as it gets closer to the shoreline and I asked you this after each and every a new update ... is there a possibility that it could even get stronger\nYes yes\nYes because we're we're talking about a hundred and forty miles offshore and I can say this first hand of three or four weeks ago I went down to Pensacola and I I spend a couple of hours floating in the eighty five degree water ...\nOkay and so this water is just prime the atmosphere the air is moist and humid and it's a rich deep moisture that stretches well up into the mid level of the steering currents and the latest meteorologist discussion that we read and breakdown\nShows that the serious layer above the storm has become more centric and has become more organized into the flow\nOf the jet stream that's carrying it away now if you've got a vacuum cleaner and it goes into a container that you can't evacuate the your your plug the blowout and\nThen that vacuum cleaner eventually stops working but in this case the what we're saying here is the outflow of warm air evacuating out of the top of this storm what we would call a thunderstorm anvil okay is well\nOrganized and attached to the jet stream flow at mid levels\nThe storm ... as we wrap up this segment and we thank you throughout the show you've been with us and we expect to be able to talk to you or tomorrow and go over and maybe we will be looking at a you know the again all the conditions inland and and what to expect\nFurther but uh give us a run down on the timeline for Michael when I get the shore all the way that you know going into back into the Atlantic what what should we expect to in the coming hours and days\nOkay um first Michael is going to be coming ashore it'll be just offshore and about eight o'clock in the morning\nOr I Can't tell the exact distance because of the predicted speed is going to change and it'll increase heading into shore [noise] but let's say it gets to shore and about three o'clock or two o'clock in the afternoon from there\nTwenty four hours later I'm Michael is going to be passing underneath ... or between Valdosta\nAnd making a in Georgia a from their um by the time we make it to tomorrow night it will be crossing the Georgia Carolina line\nAnd it will be moving its way in between savannah an Austin or Augusta I'm Sorry and uh and and and so it'll be basically following I Ninety five\nAnd it will be just or maybe twenty five or thirty miles inland divine Ninety five probably crossover Florence in Fayetteville as it heads up the coast\nI expected to get off the coast somewhere in the Carolinas or the edge of Virginia\nAnd then stay off coast by the time we find it friday night it's going to be offshore and it will probably be offshore of um of Boston ...\nAs it moves along as it gets caught up in that jet flow that I described that's a vacuum waiting the heat and making it possible to be a giant heat engine\nRight right right now right\nOr a wealth of information very valuable and you didn't have to actually live in saving information from meteorologist Tom\nHale and we will talk to you a tonight as we start the Thursday morning program and all our thoughts and prayers are with those folks there and and those first responders and officials there in those states and areas that will be affected by hurricane Michael thank you Tom and we'll talk to you on the next show thank you\nLook forward to eight six six\nNinety read on the Detroit power train offers a fish and sea through innovation Detroit's Brad Williamson has all the

Lee dissipate by then\nThere's no chance ... by that time this cross the border and goes in Georgia and gets into places I'm In south Georgia\nAnd maybe within two hundred and fifty three hundred miles of Atlanta this will be down to a category one storm\nAnd probably by the time that it gets to the south Carolina border probably a tropical depression we would expect that to happen about uh twelve hours after landfall\nAnd so about eleven o'clock tonight at low tide\nWill probably see this cross over from the Georgia area into the Carolinas and probably be out to sea hard to say it depends how much turns to the right\nYou know when it got his land you will see this thing make a band it makes a very big band\nIn might hit like Savannah Georgia with a lot of rain Charlestown against South Carolina Myrtle Beach ... than those areas ... that got hit by Florence very heavily will be hit again but the problem ... of that happening is not likely at this time\nThis is a rainstorm that will probably go right through the middle of Charlotte\nSo then we have seen something interesting in this ah this presidency and that is that somebody can leave seemingly under bad terms and then you'd still be around and still be a friend\nI I Would be interested in knowing Donald Trump to know what that magnetism is that brings people back into the Web\n... and we're talking about the former governor of New Jersey were talking about the ban and we're talking about uh Sean Spicer\nI think for ... for every ... Republicans and wonder what difference is that election was going to make her wondered how Trump would govern\nLast night you saw the sixteen nine\nA judicial nomination under President Trump this second Supreme Court the twenty second the twenty sixth circuit and dozens of appeals courts I mean this president's legacy will go down as somebody\nWho has reshaped the judicial branch too strict construction all is this is a huge huge win for this president and it is galvanized Republican headed into a key mid term election what the president\nAnd Kavanaugh did was galvanize Republicans there was a massive enthusiasm gap favoring Democrats\nThirty days out this has made sure that every single Republican understands the difference of a Republican Senate and a Republican House versus one controlled by Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi this has tightened the gaffe Republicans are now out they're not as much we've got close races in places like Indiana and\nFlorida and Missouri Montana we need to get out there but Republicans have now understood what that fight means and and the need to get out\nThere and vote with weeks left\nA really is going to be a different looking court system\nIn court justices yes on one point mhm oh within a fairly short period of time and most of the man\nStrong\nGo to this guy went down now to do is not to run and this is the brings us [noise]\nWhat would you can sit in the end you say there there's low pressure low where a metric pressure and yet I ... and what would you consider that what would it be and what would be considered low\nProbably right now where the category for hurricane you're probably talking barometric pressure in the eye of the storm itself at about twenty seven point five three and that's middle of bars\nOf mercury as opposed to the barometer were just inches of mercury so you have to do that\nHoly trying before when he was you know I don't want to get the math for that okay ... so that would that be considered low pressure\nVery low about literally about Ninety\nIn other words your body weight would change about ten percent\nThat much yeah because that's quite a bit because literally the pressure on you is about ten percent less\nThan it is normally like I said the average barometric pressure in the United states I Believe it was about twenty three point eight ... each relieved no I'm Sorry twenty nine point eight three I'm twenty\nUh it goes as low as maybe twenty nine point five may go to thirty points to or thirty points to a very early small window unit so when you're going down to full points down to enter drawn literally talking about\nChanging the force of gravity\nNow obviously the wind is blowing a hundred miles an hour or in this case the hundred and Seventy miles an hour so the gravity field is going to change any way but there's less gravity literally kind of makes\nSense okay now in the storm itself yeah is it possible because it's moving changing the entity\nIs it a ... is a is it possible to measure the air pressure within a storm sell like oh yeah yeah they are even though it's moving and changing and is there a higher or lower pressure the lower ... in the rye\nThat would be the lowest part okay because that's literally this cone ethical shape that everything is rivaling around oh okay and so it's swirling around once again instances yeah enter and it just the lowest\nPortion for for the lowest relative humidity also because of the draw\nA storm is wet center dry okay so you're talking about the eye of the storm probably being right now I'm looking at the latest radar\nWhich was as a ah twenty minutes ago looks maybe to be the eye of the storm maybe five miles across\nSo in the dead not the center because it's not actually in the dead center because this storm the forward edge is much bigger than the tail end yes but at the I\nMiles an hour right now mhm so you're talking about even if you were in the complete bred up that high you would only be in it for about ten to twelve minutes and then it would move on\nIf you were traveling it if you are standing still oh okay right it would move fast based on the rate at it we didn't have his own now you and about ten to Fifteen minutes I had most okay and that would be at\nAbsolute most and even at that point you would begin to feel wind on both ends I'm a man and when it came out yes but this guy is probably about five to eight miles across interest which is\nPretty concentric circle that's a pretty tight I I Would imagine Florence when she hit land was probably twelve to Fifteen miles across\nWhich is much bigger but she was a much bigger storms ... maybe ... storm of about a thousand miles across every one is allowed and re hundred and fifty miles across so everything is small or certain\nStay out of it and drive carefully or don't drive at all you can leave the area now it's too late were rod and rainy and this is a very us [noise]\n\nIndividuals and businesses with

about um how he governed and how he treats people\nWell I Can't disagree with anything yeah only one problem she kind of does believe and what she says she kind of did give bill another chance [laughter]\nOkay but first of all there's something very apparent there\nAnd that is ... makes me very glad she was not elected president what because first of all I don't think that you can harbor such negative feelings and be a good functioning president\nGrudges can Reich you dysfunction we talked about the fact that the one thing we have seen about Donald Trump as he be may be mad at you today\nBut he'll forgive you know are given and be your friend again tomorrow and disagree my problem with Hillary was she assumed that because she just assumed that every woman was prepared to vote for her and I was afraid that she would just bring us more of the same and uh\nYou know what right it was such a bad assumption and it was yes well first of all it was a bad assumption mathematically because if in fact and she had a lot of people in the tech and helping her campaign out if they had gone through the records of the last\nFifteen presidential elections that sixty years they would\nVotes in sixty years in other words the last time more white women voted for Democrats than a Republican was John Kennedy\nIf you want to know that your party's weakness has been white women then you wouldn't have taken them for granted word you yeah\nI just felt like I said yeah exactly it I was taken for granted I was just loader I'm\nAnd I'm Sorry I think the Obama administration of wasted almost two years on putting together a terrible health care bill and now we are worse off than before Obamacare was put into Las Vegas for the most part and there are certain ...\nGo ahead no you know the biggest problem I have with that health care bill simple he never mentioned that before the election that that was going to be his baby\nThey wasted a lot of time we had a not to say that we don't need comprehensive health care in this country we are behind the curve or in any industry of any industrialized nation but ah\nThe ... some of the provisions like be pre existing conditions those kinds of things has to be in place were only as strong as our weakest link\nAnd win the majority of the people begin to become the weak weakest link and only the wealthy survive well it's it it it was our nation becomes intrinsically weaker and the saddest\nPart about that bill was first of all that middle ended up being two thousand pages long here's K. and the fact that the fact that the senators and the representatives never read it themselves\nViolence on the head of the worst thing or the worst part of Obamacare which that\nBasically the legislation was handed over\nA to the health care industry to make the rules it was the you know the or a wolf guarding the hen house so of course they were going to make provisions that that suited them that benefitted them the most it's worse now we have healthcare then it was prior\nTo the truth is once again I said there's a thousand times on the show probably since that that was not a health care bill it was an insurance bill yes yes and those two things are not the same\nAnd it's so sad that we have to make some of the most important issues of our time into political footballs I it's it's such a disservice and the American people when we need a\nI don't see something or as as much of a commodity as health care should be banned heard about and just kicked around\nIt would get over here and\nThey like to eat and once again the fact that the decision was nominated by the people that I like that but that's why people with higher rate of recent paint or [noise]\nI'm not happy about that and I think that's where all Americans or [noise] and why Donald Trump became president of the United states and re and this is a break us\nAh there's another hat that is the ownership tapped which means you have to deal with the banks for loans you have to deal with the landlord you have to deal with all the things that have to do with owning a business and and and cash flows as well [noise]\nAnd there's obviously a third hat which is the operational half which actually the day to day operations of the business the customer service the human resource aspects the hiring the motivation of staff a so wearing all\nOf stress for the business owners themselves and their business struggles\nThat used to say that a Ronald Reagan was the great delegate or is being a great delegate or one of the most important business trades Abbas can have\nIt is it is true in delegating is a is a tool to be used by managers and leaders and owners obviously as well um but just delegating is not as simple as just finding a person and giving them a task\nThat person needs to understand how you as an owner would like that particular task to be done a lot of\nA trust needs to be built with those employees or key employees that would um but you will delegate to otherwise those particular thoughts are not going to be done\nThat way you wanted or you're just going to double check and triple check up on them and kind of micro manage them which leads to a slippery slope [laughter]\nYes yes yes here's I Would think in this day and age though one of the hardest things is has got to be finding people you can trust and do you have a way of kind of leading out the ones you can from the ones you can have you been successful with that\nI have but it's it's not as simple as you mentioned ah I think there's a yeah I think the first step in\nIn any owners or or any CEO that leaves the company or you have to take a personal journey with yourself to understand\nWhat is your purpose in this whole world ah both personal and professional men you have to build a company or work in a company that has a similar\nA ... as well as motivate existing employees\nIt's all about referring back to that particular purpose this is the the why it's basically why we do what we do why do we come to work and you know and I think the reason the sorry\nNowadays with the age our directors being so prominent in most businesses I think a lot of good boss is don't even get to talk of the best candidates because they'd been weeded out are tossed aside by the HR director\nYeah I you know in bigger organizations are now the HR director is taking more and more a control and and has more influence uh but the reality is these people in most cases have uh the biggest experience with a selecting the people\nAre that are a good fit to the organization I Would I Would like more and more organizations to be purpose driven a rather than you know just driven by their their products or services or or or revenues\nUm and if they are driven by their purpose and or a charge directors they're able to to leverage their purpose to find the right people we would have way more fulfillment in the world and people would be much happier and less stressed\nLet's

mature adults why don't we screaming people in elevators and follow them around cities\nThat's the mature way to do things Hillary Clinton gets you needed to reinforce the decision America Made not to make or the next president United States and so desperate to matter unbelievable\nNumber I think the Democrats are pretty maxed out on motivation and they've been raging for two years they're eager to vote so I think\nAny additional motivation to get out of the cabinet or fair is likely to be only a modest increase Republicans on the other hand looking pretty sleepy but Kavanaugh case clearly has changed the equation there and the polling evidence we see shows that motivation among Republicans is up\nYeah so what does that mean for the ultimate class where they keep it up for the next three and a half weeks ... human Tucker last night the Supreme Kavanaugh era has been done by the way what now for Republicans and Democrats both sides both sides are ... was just telling you why I think

added inauguration a vote because of that in his speech which I thought was\nA defiant defensive dopey and it wasn't me to bring together people who had not supporting him but in that it was and as I say in my book what happened at the you know the white nationalist got who\nWhat is with her why she allowed to get away with it anyone who voted forms of white nationalist he she he got elected because white nationalist what is wrong with it I mean I Can't get over that she's allowed to get away with it and nobody follows up and says well I think it's wrong Hillary Clinton to label Donald Trump supporters as white nationalist\nAnd he has done better for minorities in terms of economic benefits I think the whole Charlottesville thing was a travesty so easily avoided a easy to condemn any didn't he blew it you asked me and he says\nIn the Woodward book it says he's quoted telling people you're screwed that up I get that but he has not shown a white nationalist tendencies nor do I think it's correct\nTo tell the tale supporters that they're white nationalist\nHere's Jeffrey tube and cut thirty seven who thinks that by the way\nI think Democrats are pathetic\nThey are afraid of everything it's like oh we can't have Hillary Clinton talk because it'll motivate the Republican base we can't have Iraq Obama talk 'cause it'll motivate their base we can't talk about impeachment or to motivate their base you know what\nHillary Clinton got three million more votes than the other guy in two thousand sixteen I don't see why she shouldn't be campaigning around the country I don't see why Brock Obama's shouldn't be campaigning\nShe is an enormously important figure in American history she got sixteen plus million votes I don't see why shouldn't speak out a ...\nA ... but I understand where you're coming from you so you've got to be more aggressive I get that Trump is showed everybody that but Hillary Clinton is not your answer\nHillary Clinton didn't get elected twice Hillary Clinton with LeBron James couldn't fill up a theater or excuse me an arena in Cleveland Hillary Clinton got more because she got more in the west coast in east coast but not in the middle and the states they have to be delivered in\nSo she can go to certain people raise some money usually though it raises for herself Brock Obama does the same thing to think about ... track record he can get himself elected but he can't get anybody else selected that's the problem\nAnd therefore people see and they'll say well I don't want his policies they respect the G he can speak you know if you if you look at Bill Clinton say I don't like I'm fine but you can't say that he can't motivate and connect you could ... I don't like his policies you can't say that he's not a great speaker\nI said there's nothing authentic you know maybe as secretary of state she was affective because she doesn't have to tell anybody on anything it's out of the political arena she is not a good politician end of story she reminds people of losing that's it\nAl Gore got more popular votes than George Bush but Al Gore's not asked to help out John Kerry because you looked at as a loser who couldn't motivate and execute and produced when you had to listen to this more from Hillary Clinton's ranch cut thirty two\nI Want to stop the degrading the rule of law the dealer ... one of their priorities to me that protect\nOur election let's make sure that ah we had electrical security let's end the precedent voter ... very big agenda at the Democratic takeover\nListen number one there is a movement\nOr to protect the election and so for the big story I think in the Washington Post no sign the Russians are metal him in the midterms they are concerned about what's happening with China\nAnd the president called about specifically and they are much better hackers sadly then the Russians and a much bigger economic and military threat\nThen the Russians so they are concerned and the Russians got so much blowback after what they try to do in the election from Facebook adds to the people\nThat is really hurt American us ... a Russian relations to a point with all these individuals sanctions on rich people and now the fortifications of our our defense of Ukraine with lethal weapons that we've given them a missile defense system that's been implemented now they're realizing all we did\nWas make it impossible to have good relations so the Russians aren't playing a role we should keep everything else in mind but we're not the ... elections what are you talking about because elections you didn't when you've got three million more votes because you maximize votes in Los Angeles and you maximize vote in San Francisco\nThey said that every year when there's intellect or every election year they say they look at the polls and they're wrong and that's what we saw in the last election\nSee people say well Hillary Clinton in jeopardy tube and we just played you know why can't Hillary Clinton go out there she got more of a three million more votes than President Trump no Bill Clinton won ... liberal state a for her but that's not how you do it ... electric ... what do you think when\nI talk to those points on TNT I find to I'm going to teach me the gas station [noise]\nOf what I think is a she's not getting out but we both agreed on television today they're waiting six years as much and we saw that Rudy Giuliani there's because Rudy left and Bloomberg mayor and then he waited and ...\nWhat about what if she moved back to South Carolina and takes over Senate position there and then Lindsey Graham they've moved to a different\nPosition that degree point but Lindsey Graham says I have no interest in during the Trump Administration here's what she actually she said that now\nWell I Want to say on that first of all I Want to paint\nJust you know allowing us to come out and possibly the way it has been an honor roll I I you know I that I in fact a lot of the girls that were to leave this stay that way and to serve a country I\nHas really been a blessing and I want to thank you for that\nAnd you said her ... her son was in high school yeah he goes to a high school here where a lot of the un kids go\nAnd it's very eclectic he has friends from all over the over the world and she said she was hosting a slumber party the other night for his kids and there were kids representing so many different countries that was really fun and she said her son loved it\nHer daughter's at Clemson University her son um is in high school here in New York and he was really excited about it and she said I'm not going to\nTake that position because I don't want to pull you out of high school in South Carolina he said no mom you've got to do it you got to do it and I'll be fine and she said they moved here and he loved\nIt and now I Know that the husband is in the military yeah is he still stations so\nI don't know the answer to that Brian I Believe\nMan with power and before right okay wrapping that again or do you know if ah her husband is in the military yeah see that shy air force base in Sumter South Carolina great and I believe you write I see I don't even know if that's the branch but not an air force no I Believe you the first time right you're right yeah so he is in the air force\nSo Stephen Harper is the former prime minister of conservative who isn't that what the name is Stephen Harper okay okay I could do you let me go well he's the former Canadian Prime minister okay so he uh he was asked you know how effective is this Trump foreign policy with Nikki Haley in George ...\nShe was very effective in communicating very different American approach to foreign policy you expand unorthodox one also one that\nYou know was not an easy one to deliver what she did it in a way that I think got her respect and was effective and\nYou know there's there's often a it's often position that the president to take the stronger position on foreign affairs must somehow inherently disagreeable and I think she showed that you can be respected and be very effective well delivering messages that a lot of people don't want to hear\nThat was even operate led ... the president got an unorthodox style and people just can't handle it instead of just saying well it's still different ways approaching things they just say it's so wrong ways approaching thing they said and just being open to it you know when things do have to change they just say well you know he's wrong to be doing this 'cause that's not the way it's usually done she was\nGoing to arm I think to the president because she would walk into journals are to the un building and stand in front of world leaders and she would continuously continue his message America First and we're not going to stand for that and we're not going to be bullied\nThink about this Indian American that's a positive right number two ... husband's in the military that's ... ... email number two female who has come out against a strong on raising in South Carolina she took on him Confederate flag shooting as well ... she has stood up strong a very ...\nState experience at as a governor which is huge if you're going to run for president one day and then also she had global knowledge because she's trained internationally and domestically she brings a lot to the table her resume strong\nBut it's just so bad that we agree on this was so much better when we disagree well you know\nShe really I've always followed her career being from South Carolina and um there was some controversy when she first took office of some people that didn't like some of the things that she did so I wasn't really sure [noise]\nUm and then over the years she's just sold every one and the way she represents South Carolina at the national level and or international level it's pretty impressive and we've met her and honestly on a personal note when my mother got sick\nMy mother had a stroke in February she wrote me texted me and said I heard your mom had a stroke I'm praying for there are a lot of people in the Bible and your mom Bible study that told me that your mom was sick thought that was very impressive came on our set the other day we interviewed her in at the end of the interview she said by the way how's your mom doing you know the special touches it ... it really matters\nYeah ... years were to Nikki Haley said about this White House in this policy which is America First which in a international body might not fly cuts them\nMore than what has happened in two years with the United states on foreign policy [noise] now the United states for trees may not like we knew what they that's what they know that if we say we're going to do something we\n\nHave to pay their fair I mean whether the training of what you've been amazing they have higher than that and they follow through with that\nUh [noise] do that job as we respected we might not have that many friends but we respected and people are going to walk all over us anymore thank you fair fair charade Ryan why are they like what are you\nAnd unless you're in that unless it really matters unless you're a farmer and you're talking about corn crops or whatever you got to take it right people you've got to tell them why\nAnd when he retired problem this is why you don't hang out with me this was the type of stuff we we talk about and the other question I checked please\nNow that now we would have an interesting conversation I Would say OK explain it to me why in layman's terms is that important to them and when you start checking your watch and staring a praying yeah I'm ready to walk over\nNow that's what I

she is not in the left you know when she was a moderate I think she'd be more open because you know everything's so predictable the reason why Democrat or Bill Richardson so interesting is\nWhen I

I mean you know it\nIs president Donald Trump is a very good at kind of the reality so elements of the presidency which is to say he's good at kind of you know to the next week so I wouldn't be surprised if there's a name we haven't heard\nUm and you know somebody without a sense I think we're now would be very good although I've heard you know settling in Germany right now we're

don't know I I I Know that the use of interest obviously in the larger political stuff\nRight let's move on to talk about ah you say America's opportunity in Iraq\nWhat is our opportunity now in Iraq I Know that they liked the world with us as opposed to with Iran because our when we we became clear to them we weren't going to destroy their country and take their oil we actually were giving him a shot at freedom things or do whatever we might have a window right now you believe right\nWell I wouldn't say two things about this because I'm Glad you brought it up it doesn't get enough attention\nYou know a a constant refrain but let's look at that Fifteen Years later there have been for success of national elections\nThere is a constitution there's real politics and free media in Iraq there are a lot of problems in Iraq there was the rise of ice and they're still the real threat of violence sectarianism similar kind of a weapon on but at the same time\nThey are further along now and they are now used to regular elections having a constitution and they are demanding reform and here's another interesting thing about the moment\nThat we're in right now the person that like the slate of candidates the one the most votes in the election in may that finally resulted in this government that was formed last week was led by somebody who is the probably the fiercest critics within the Shia Arab\nMajority community in Iraq and looked at an outsider of the Iranian influence in Iraq so that data point number one data point number two is that over the summer and it intensified in September\nYou saw real protest serious protest beyond just you know marches and and and ... there was you know the Iranian consulate in Basra which is a traditionally very close to her on a since the fall of Saddam was burned by\nProtesters people are furious at the influence of Iran in that country ten years ago boss for what\nYou know seen as almost a sort of colony of Iran ten years later in twenty Eighteen saucer is maybe the ... center point of the new Iraqi resistance against Iran\nThat is something that I think bodes very well and we should not just assume that Iraq is going to always be uh the Vaseline of Iran which is pretty much just some ... under Obama and I think\nYou know even at the end of bushes\nSaying at all but it is an opportunity for the kind of diplomatic\nEconomic engagement I Know that sometimes foreign aid seems dirty work but it shouldn't be in the case of Iraq where if you can choose that investment um to support\nThe politicians that need to show their own people that their independence from Iran America can really play an important role there and that is the opportunity that we have and it's especially as the Iranian economy itself is about to pay these crippling sanctions and here's a chance to really\nYou know potentially make it a a difference here and that and to prevent what we thought was the fed a complete with that Iran takeover I mean how many times have you heard that in the last one of your rights well not necessarily selling a lot of Iraqis really resent Iranians right now I spoke to prevent it\nYeah I think it's a it's quite interesting we need somebody like Ryan Crocker who thoroughly understands rocket and understand to the power players are and have to be an ... where he right now like random liberal I have an investment banker river yeah we don't have an ambassador there right\nNow we do have an a bass or I'm I'm I I'm Sorry I'm not going to get the name of my head but I but you know Crocker ... I think was a terrific ambassador in and he understood he he by the way he negotiated times of the Iranians you have to negotiate with people not a an argument for completely shutting\nSomeone diplomatically but it's understanding that it is that what we thought was inevitable if the Iranians were there forever and we would have to leave in which it's not that they're going to basically be controlling the political process they didn't control the\nPolitical process the timing the permission to the government their candidates did not do as well as they would have like in the election and now that we have the beginning of this new government in Iraq lets you know work with them and show that\nWe can be just as good a partner to what they want 'em and not that it's just a back burner issue and that we're trying to even you know it's yesterday's news\nAh he lasted the Washington Post or the Washington Post writer there's the turkey believes he was\n[noise] All right so a couple of words of caution here um I mean\nWhen it was just Turkish officials I was more skeptical they have put out more evidence the Saudis story looks less and less plausible and we should brace ourselves for the worse this has very significant implications because\nThe Saudi Arabia the United states of an ally since you know Nineteen thirties and the strategic rationale for that alliance is still going to be there even if it turns out that they get this horrendous and horrific crime but\nWe also have an interest in any rules based international system\nAnd that means that we cannot allow countries to\nKill Washington Post journalists were even abducted Washington Post journalist the way that the Saudis have just done they have if this is true this is what the Iranians do this is what the Russians do this work the ropes of the world do the people who have an interest in undermining that liberal international order and in that respect\nSaudi Arabia does need to pay a very significant consequences detour them from doing that I Do not think that means that we we think the fundamental us Saudi alliance as bad as this particular thing is\nAnd it does not necessarily negate\nThe reforms of their younger crown prince who was finally doing a lot of things that we've one of the Saudis to do for decades which is allowing women to drive allowing malls have movie theaters are allowing some private investment and their oil companies and finally doing something about the\nRadical hate filled Islamic fundamentalism that comes from a lot of their mosques and they're kind of clerical establishment so all of those reforms are a good thing but it comes with a really ugly ugly side as well and this is not the first example of it\nWe've seen a number of crackdowns of of of this\nAnd you can say you know we're usually between some bad options but the Saudis to understand that they've really cross the line here somebody who was an American resident wound American citizen wrote for the Washington Post ... I mean as a journalist I'm ... by it and we can't happen\n[noise] yeah I think the president's got a step it up and get some answers because uh you know\nHe's been attacking the press ... he's got to go to bat for him here I'd like to see them get more aggressive he certainly has a relationship you lake great work thanks so much she's with a Bloomberg View like thank you thank you when we come back to the latest on hurricane it's a monster it's slamming Florida back in a moment\nGiving you everything you need to know Brian killed [noise]\n\nIndividuals and businesses with tax problems listened carefully\nDo you feel like you're losing control over your finances if you owe over ten thousand dollars in back taxes arrive on file tax returns we can help you take back control the IRS is the largest and most aggressive collection agency in the world and they can seize your bank account garnish your paycheck close your business and filed criminal charges\nI'm Sherry ... than it is a monster storm hurricane Michael just a few hours away from hitting the Florida Panhandle dot says the time to get out of the way you have\nThe worst thing you can do now is leave\nPut yourself and your family\nIn danger ABC speak combs has more from Panama City beach\nAlready the most powerful storm ever to hit the Florida Panhandle hurricane Michael continues to grow even stronger\nThere's no concern Michael might become a category ... storm and they're very top of this average Simpson scale that means when speech topping one hundred fifty miles an hour coping with the storm surge between nine and Thirteen feet in some parts of the pan handle\nThe picture governor Rick Scott and others are painting is one of widespread devastation on a scale that perhaps no one in the panhandle has ever seen before\nRigs across the Gulf of shutdown ABC's Tim Ryan one upside to hurricane Michael is the speed with which it's tearing through the Gulf of Mexico that should head off any long term just\nPrices will rise fresh questions today after the ... crash in upstate New York that killed twenty people\nThe driver Scott ... who was killed in the crash had been cited in August for operating the same two thousand one Ford excursions stretch limousine without a proper license\nAt the time state police set a trooper told the ... and the company that owned the limo he could not drive it without an additional license less than two weeks later the limo lumped in inspection and transportation officials ordered it off the road\nAnd attorney for the company insisted all the violations were fixed by the time Seventeen passengers climbed in on Saturday and were killed when the little crashed Erin ...

going to be very interesting and I never begrudge the drug companies for making money because my my thing is you put the risk out there and the cost of doing business the cost of getting\nThey're not
