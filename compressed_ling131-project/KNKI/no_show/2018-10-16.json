Benson shows your Twitter you can tweet at us\nFor all the talk of we're going to get into recession we're going to have these things this is going to happen I'm like you guys know that's how bad our recession will be I don't know but I Will tell you one thing what's coming in the future\nThat isn't being talked about needs to be talked about you know twenty thirty forty years ago you come out of college you have very little if any debt whatsoever\nYou could start to get on with your life you could start making money and you could take that earnings that you had because of that college degree and you could put that back into the economy we live in a different world now kids are coming out with hundreds of thousands upon thousands of dollars\nOf massive debt that is turning into hundreds of thousands of potentially millions of dollars in debt over years and instead of putting that money back into the economy like buying homes and things that come with homes what they're going to be doing\nIs essentially trying to survive and that\nIt's going to put a huge dent in our future economy\nOn student loan debt I'm I think it's important that people will be able to borrow to make what maybe the most important investment their lives which is in their education a so overall I think borrowing it to invest in yourself is this something we should we should foster subject to a couple of important Covey as first\nIt's very important that people understand the nature of the nature of the borrowing and the risk that they're taking in in ... and the possible payoffs and that sort of thing so that they make informed decisions\nInformed decisions are huge and there's a reason that they need to make informed decisions because I've got friends who graduated college twenty plus years ago\nThey're still paying off their debts\nAnd their debts are nothing compared to their kids debts and there soon to be kids get to I mean these debts are massive and when you're the government stepping in saying we're going to guarantee all these loans you can't get rid of these laws all of a sudden you\nAre making a house payments\nRight\nAs we try to grow our economy your kids coming out with three hundred thousand dollars in debt\nAnd they're looking around and they're getting a job and they're making a thousand dollar month payment or eight hundred dollar month payment on some of these things and they're gonna be paying these things off for years and years and years and money that should go into the economy because that they would become a a productive member of society it's going to be tough\nBecause that's going into education\nAnd when you get the government of all the way it is the kind of money that they're guaranteeing these kids they're taking it out willy nilly and on top of that they're taking out other debt\nTo be able to live\nWhile they're trying to go through school and it is going to eventually explode\nThe second thing is um I think alone among all kinds of dead or we don't allow student loan debt to be discharged him ready to young I'd be at a loss to\nTo explain why that should be the case so it's something and this is fiscal policy that says something for you and not something for the fed but we do see is instead of research shows another research shows you do start to see\nLonger term negative effects on people who can't pay off their student loans and it hurts their credit rating in it impacts the entire half of their economic life\nAnd that's something to think about where you may have a lost generation or two\nOf people who are going to be able to afford to live the way that their parents lived at even a fraction of the way that their parents live until their parents eventually passed away and leave them stuff to get themselves out from underneath this giant enormous burden of debt now granted they took it on themselves\nBut do you think about it if an Eighteen\nYear old comes due today and says give me a hundred and fifty thousand dollar loan you're going to be like shut up\nNever going to have\nHave an Eighteen year old comes you did say I need a hundred fifty thousand alone because I Want to go to school you get a basket weaving liberal arts degree from some college\nTo pay for these kinds of things of life that I wanted to lead just to survive you're going to be like oh that's fine but what it does long term and when you think micro right now it doesn't affect them at think macro\nSo that's the that's the public policy argument for us to do something about student loan debt and the and the way we structure a higher education financing my question for you is do you see this as a macroeconomic risk\nIt will over time it's not something you can pick up in the data right now but as this goes on and a student loan continues to grow and becomes larger and larger than it absolutely could hold that gross\nYeah and I think it's going to and I think for all the talk of the new housing bubble that's coming and a lot of these other things over a trillion dollars in debt the kids and and young adults and even older adults boomers have a ton of it but it's still sitting out there that is not going to be able to be discharged nor should it be because why would you let somebody do that\nBut the fact that you're willing to go out and say you know what I Need this degree so bad\nThat I'm willing to spend three hundred thousand dollars and even if it's a hundred thousand dollar loan think about how long it's going to take you to pay that off heat is massive\nAnd what it's going to do for us in the future I don't think we're talking enough about it but it's coming it is three two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had mentioned shows your Twitter you can tweet at us

the national security report is brought to you by scholars scholars a leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital signs around the world\nLeading the wave of retail transformation visit scala dot com today\nTo modernize your digital experience\nTom they report on Somalia is dire\nThe U.S has a hand in air strikes and you add long war journal keep a map of the airstrikes and the frequency of airstrikes throughout the coast of Somalia cheaply in the south\nYou ever reported this past week the Shabaab is ...\nCan you compare it to the Taliban well you know the like like the Taliban Shabaab is principally insurgency organization which is seeking to\nTake over Somalia and parts of East Africa to build their own emirate their own Islamic state in East Africa and they're doing this under the banner of all kinds of the Shabaab is part of ... and has been part of all kinds of for ... for very long time um\nAnd so way all kind of looks at this is the Shabaab is is designated as the organization rates representative in East Africa to try and build an Islamic emirate there in the U.S is propping up the a nascent federal government in Somalia which has a lot of problems in his sort of very\nMuch an upstart effort is trying to prop up that that government as sort of a bulwark against Shabaab\nUnfortunately Shabaab still controls are contests a large portion of Somalia just as a tall blond does in Afghanistan\nAnd should Bob's roots are very much a local they have a lot of local strength a of a lot of tribal relations and other parties that are sort of bought into Shabaab scheme in some areas in Somalia where Shabaab provides better governance on a daily basis um even though it's ... governance\nThan the actual government does and this is a big problem because what they're doing is they're trying to actually build the state slowly and so the U.S has expanded its air campaign against select individuals in Somalia the train we can or should Bob's hierarchy and to try and take out certain operational commanders who were thought to be especially problematic over the last\nSince really early to thousands Seventeen there's been an uptick that my colleagues at long were journal have been tracking the number of American airstrikes in Somalia against these sort of\nA well defined targets um and you know these are the some of these airstrikes of course controversial and some of them are not really all that effective but um but there's this air campaign has been going on for some months now and it's intensified for some months and it's still ongoing\nReport you file is the execution of spies one of whom is linked to the U.S Abdul\nA mud Mohammed this begins to feel like the Cold War Tom the ethics and the CIA recruiting men who have been executed by Shabaab\nYeah well actually Shabaab executed these guys who were ... they were allegedly recruited by the U.S\nBritish Intelligence and smiling intelligence to spy on Shabaab or to cause problems for Shabaab\nAnd Shabaab like other all kinds of branches does this fairly regularly they have a campaign to take out certain alleged spies to try and show that they are you know have infiltrated the ranks and that there's going to be accountability for that now what they're trying to do is tie this back to both the air campaign uh that we just we are talking about with the U.S has been watching these drone strikes against targets\nBut also to the Islamic State's president so\nThis isn't Shabaab Shabaab of course opposed the Islamic state just as all of all kind of does and in Somalia the Islamic state has an upstart presidents that trying to basically carve out a niche from within Shabaab to try and challenged about first authority\nDoes far Shabaab is is the far stronger ... player and I don't think that's going to change anytime soon Islamic state presence is much smaller but Shabaab is part of its information campaign to try and undermine the Islamic state is accusing some of these spies including one in particular who allegedly worked for and my six\nOf taking money from the Brits and giving it to the Islamic state in Somalia to try and basically a build up the Islamic State's presidents and sort of strengthening al Shabaab expense I think that that's probably more propaganda or information warfare and their part they're trying to undermine the Islamic State's legitimacy but you know the details all get very murky very quickly\nUm we just have a minute to your knowledge is the U.S seeking to negotiate with Shabaab the way it's negotiating with the Afghanistan Taliban\nKnow John that's a great point you know the tall blond what's happened with these negotiates with the U.S us the same as the tall blondes Islamic emirate is somewhat legitimate in Afghanistan and of course the top honor Maine's cool see out while I was kind of the day on the other hand Shabaab which is part of al ...\nIn the same direction under al ... is a mantle and the U.S is negotiating with one part about ... linked but not negotiating with the other part yet yet we can't rule it out in the future talk\n[noise] yeah I mean nothing can be ruled out at this point I I doubt Shabaab would ever agree to any sort of overt negotiations with the American side um because America doesn't have substantial foreign over there and in Somalia that doesn't have guessed\nI'm just like who keeps the long war journal he's a senior fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracy\nThis segment national security report brought you by scholars scholars a

Iraq right now it's very very good so John\nI go to you again on this ABC poll about sixty nine battleground districts these are the ones where the Democrats are ambitions to pick up seats against the Republicans because Mrs Clinton did very well in these districts in sixteen though they have a Republican\nCongressional member right now and what is the generic spread John and what does this tell you about the paradox of a good economy and democratic momentum\nWell I Would make an amendment to your statement the economy is good but Donald Trump is still a drag on Republicans or he has a lot of suburban women having said that the ABC Washington Post poll I ... I mean it's the only one poll but it's a solid one or the Democrats have a generic lead of almost ten in that poll but\nOn the sixty six swing districts twenty four which went for Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen the Republicans are hit by one point the Republican now other polls don't quite show that but they show that the swing districts are much closer because Democrats are going to waste a lot of their enthusiastic\nAlso believes that if the election were held with normal turnout today they will be a two hundred and Eighteen two hundred and Seventeen split not clear which party would have a majority I think we're heading to a much closer house a result than people anticipate because the battleground districts are not the country\nThat if you had an institutional memory because you wrote for the title wave for the blue in two thousand and six and you also saw what a block Obama as a candidate did in two thousand and eight how do you read how do you interpret this it's one poll I understand that it's moving story but how do you interpret this\nThis unusual facts at the battleground districts the Republicans do well in\nMuch better now than it was back in those six and a weight as Mr funds and tell you and I made it exceedingly difficult for the Republicans and majority in two thousand six and for Republicans in general in two thousand eight because we've already lost the majority in\nIn the prior election uh my question for Mr fund is you're talking about the house what about the Senate\nWhile the Senate is very interesting because there's poll movement and places you didn't expect\nA there's a new poll out a conducted by a democratic for that shows the Minnesota special election for the Senate to be competitive in clear single digits New Jersey there's a very hard hitting ad out attacking senator Menendez the Democratic incumbent for\nSex with teenage prostitutes are quoting FBI ... reports from the Obama Justice department um I think that the Democrats are now defending more seats than they expected and if I had if the election were held today I think Republicans would gain Senate seats\nAnd gain that clear advantage it can vary more judges including a possible another Supreme Court appointment next year\nFund the Democrats were doing very well talking about health care health care health care I saw that an ad for the last two weeks and yet these other issues\nIn two thousand and fix the Democrats in the house had the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and as far as I can tell she's completely disappeared I Can't find her\nWell remember about forty democratic challengers have said they're not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi should they get elected\nSo the last thing that she wants to do is remind voters that um she's there it is trying to become the next democratic speaker even though many members of her party clearly recognized she uses liability on the campaign trail\nThat is made me realize as you well know job when they get there and they start getting shall we say acclimated to their ... those votes can change camping\n[noise] well yes but what if you have only two hundred and twenty Democrats or two hundred and Nineteen or two hundred and Twenty one you know Thaddeus it has been since Nineteen fifty two that we had the congressional majority that was less than five seats\nAre from two hundred and Eighteen we've never before in our living memory had an extremely close house where every member counts because the speaker has to be elected with two hundred and Eighteen a majority of the entire house\nI watch Tony clips from CBS the sixty minutes interview between the president and the correspondent but I was struck by one thing John and I'm puzzled whether this is too late or too little the president is acting very presidential these days he's quite\nHe's quite clear about its accomplishments he's expansive about the policies that they've initiated there's nothing hesitant about 'em at all is that is that showing in the polls job\nWell actually Leslie stall who conducted the interview said I've interviewed the president or three times as a candidate as president elect and that was president\nThe the change in his level of self confidence and assertiveness is dramatic\nAh she says he's he seems to have grown into the job\nThe country may not be comfortable with him and the job but he's comfortable and and I didn't\nOut of his fingers when he's confident that the man I saw in that in that interview\nHe's on this message discipline I think through the election if it stays that will only help his party that is\nMeant just got a counselor Mr fund that's the greatest thing I heard tonight the country may not be comfortable with him he just comfortable in the job [laughter]\nWhat what do you do you think that this will translate in the next couple of weeks the the messaging the tight messaging the president and more parents whose because he's not going to stop campaigning for the rest of the Republicans\n[noise] no but I think that the Democrats submitted enough mistakes he's just going to remind voters over and over again that\nEven though they may have difficulty with him look at the

politically correct\nElizabeth Warren ladies and gentlemen understand anyone with an Asian blood is also a match for Native American you don't see the average Mexican walking around saying I'm a

a block traffic and beat elderly people's cars with clubs screaming at the white people\nIs all coming up the bottom of the hour then doctors deeper China joined us\nOn what's really happening in Saudi Arabia to give us his expert take on that a lot of evidence points towards this being a false flag\nBut inside job\nA and the president has come out\nSaid that he talked to the king this morning he didn't want to elaborate on wanting shed but they're basically he said that he believed that this was a ... group of sailors clearly meant to shut up the Saudi regime\nJust spoke the king of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge whatsoever may have happened to our Saudi\nArabian citizen he said that they are working closely with turkey to find an answer I Am immediately sending our secretary of state to meet with\nWas buying hundreds of billions of dollars for mush but more importantly who's a liberalizing for women to be able to drive women to be able to be have jobs out there really moving in the right direction and they promise to stop arming al Qaida and ISIS will break it down next hour but here's the president I before I took off in a in the helicopter this morning\nI just saw with the king of Saudi Arabia\nDenies any knowledge of what took\nPay out to immediately get on a plane go to Saudi Arabia\nWith regard to the go to turkey is set to\nSaudi Arabia are working\nOn getting to the bottom of what happened\nSo we'll see what happens\nWithin an hour or so\nFirmly denied any knowledge of it\nReally know maybe\nDon't want to get it in mind but\nIt sounded to me like maybe they\nWith the news talking sports for the white mouth ... I saw one oh six points chef [noise]\n\nSays that Africa is now the epicenter\nAnd the French speaking world\nTwo hundred million African migrants\nThe next Twenty years or France\nThat would mean that France was\nTwo thirds African\nThat's called economic cultural domination using a third world weapon that's an enforced dot com story next segment we're covering it\nThen speaking of the devil\nMaybe I'll just immigrate to\nWell the communist leader their vows to take more white farmers land even people that recently bought their land\nThey're just gonna take it\nBut that's okay 'cause only white people can be racist or tribal\nCourse that's a total lie and when they are led by multi national corporations any group becomes lawless and evil when they're told to behave like that very very deadly dangerous with the global if you're doing that's the start of the next segment right now they're talking about it but here's a video\nEven variety magazine got it right sixty minutes was out matched by Trump\nAnd the article goes on to say\nThat Leslie stall\nInterview with Trump was an undeniable get he'd been\nScares the mainstream media since around the time\nHe appeared on tight with NBC's Lester Holt\nAnd then it just goes on from there to say that he bulldozed\nHis enemy and chief the mainstream media\nNow why is that because I Know for a fact ... says you're not going to substantially edit me\nAnd if you do I'm going to counter you just like NBC got caught lying saying he hated the north and Haiti Ulysses Grant budget trip\nYou believe it none of it is true\nBut because he's able to counter lives he got a straight interview\nShe asked me much hard questions but still he dominated or\nBecause they know he can punch back if they edited it for everybody else so you can't do interviews with mainstream because they will edit you until it's on recognizable\nThe full interview on enforce dot com\nYou're not president but President Trump is president and he told her I'm president and you're not ... mocks CBS anchor intense sixty minutes interview let's go out and go to the first clip that is the most important\nAnd then I've got some very important words to say after it here dish\nPotent yeah okay um [noise]\nPeople don't understand why you never\nHave a harsh words for ... year I don't understand it but you don't know what I talk about was posting in the meeting prior to the primary publicly you never say anything harsh gives me hope I didn't\nI'm the one that gave Ukraine offensive weapons and pain killers Obama didn't you know what he says he said\nAnd blankets I'm the one and he's the one that gave away a part of Ukraine where Russia now has\nHim personally glad I mean I think I'm a very tough with him personally I had a meeting with him the two of us yeah there was a very tough meeting and it was a very good me do you agree\nThat ... involved and assassinations and toys and ... probably is yeah probably I mean I don't believe probably but I rely on them is not in our ... Wyatt but why not\nThey shouldn't do it this is a terrible thing to do it over the hill believes that the Russians interfered in the two thousand sixteen campaign an election ... they ...\nAnd as an adult because I think China metal also and I think frankly China are probably going to we're diverting the hall rations and killing airline saying Russia but I'm also saying China\nChina has a billion three hundred and fifty something million people they put spy chips and all the apple and other platforms they're open like bought Hollywood and our debt they're trying to overthrow our country they censor everything\nGoogle and others are helping them censored\nAnd then President Trump talks about it and he's the writer Russia is a red herring Russia wants than alliance with us\nThey would take the alliance then we would control\nCentral Asia all the way out to East Asia\nThat borders with North Korea South Korea we would control into Eastern Europe it's the perfect alliance the global is don't want that they want the stabilization\nGoogle CEO tell senators\nThat censored Chinese search engine could provide broad benefits that was testimony last week\n[noise] and they say the head of Google contradicting or the person that I testified a week before for Google or spokesperson their head of global policy and privacy\nSaid yes we are building a censorship engine and it's good and you want it to\nSo said this is getting sick\nAnd then there's another one China is low key taking over the world\nThe earth minerals the ports the infrastructure and are all eat have allowed them to do it on\nIt's called treason the Big Mac how China used a tiny chip to infiltrate U.S companies the U.S government in your home\nOr the other tips they put Chinese appliances all coordinating tracking you stealing the data\nAnd big U.S companies use China as the fence so they can move there becomes Chinese companies\nIt's the base of operations of all this criminal\nAnd that's why what Trump is saying is so central so important he's pointing out the elephant in the room\nAnd not the red herring of Russia\nNow let's go to the next clip Trump I never knew how dishonest the media was he tells Lesley Stahl I'm president and you're not\nThe other thing I've really learned\nIs I never knew how dishonest the media was I I I really made it I'm not saying that as a sound bite\nI never I never knew how to change the subject to get to know what even though when you ask me questions about separation yeah when I say Obama did if you don't want to talk about I Know I don't I don't know where I was gonna run your answer but you did it for time I'm just telling you\nThat you've created me much differently on this subject I disagree but I don't want to have that fight with you hey All right like you're not if I had okay the nighttime I'm president and you're not\nLet's call them ... somebody\nHere's Trump getting into\nPolitics it's vicious fault lies deceit deception\nI always used to say is a tough as people are Manhattan real estate guys involved but now I say their babies\nWho did that has the political people this is the most deceptive vicious world\nIt is and vicious it's full of lies deceit and deception you make a deal with somebody others like making a deal with that table give me an example I don't want to give you an example I'm not looking at in the meantime nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do remember that\nWhen you look at taxes you look at regulations you look at uh making deals with other countries\nNobody's been able to do anything like this actually most people didn't even try because they knew that didn't have the ability to do it but it's a very deceptive world\nWhat he said there are so critical\nThey like do you might actually they lie about everybody's going to\nShow leadership going over the delivering now\nIn the stock for which we can add up\nTo ... you know there was there helping the original\nWe planted the are the ones

motivate other people want to inspire people that's why we do that and so I think that there is a a a movement especially in Portland\nPeople are starting to understand that we don't have to sit around anymore we don't have to sit around and allow whether the antifa or the mayor or the lack of police response you don't have to take it any more you can go out on the streets and you can measure your voices heard and you don't have to hide anymore I don't care or conservative libertarian monitor it doesn't matter\nYou're doing it because you're learning about this now there's another just

acting like Trump made it up that they're acting like mob rule\nI think that you know it's just another times where you know we're living in Arab deception I see it all the time you know I get so much hatred of people say that I have I don't know it's so everything's flipped upside down honestly I think it's a good sign I think they're on their last legs there are so desperate\nLessons are coming out you know the advantage you they took off of all the social media just because they're losing a culture where the dean destroy finally conservatives are getting involved in the culture war\nConservatives libertarians are finally starting to push back and so now they don't know what to do because\nFor the longest time we just took it and to get into care while they just slowly took way this country whether it be the schools\nYou know the um the media Hollywood all that stuff and now they have this weird\n... movement for freedom that's completely taken over especially the use and people are loving it and people are inspired by one thing I was talking to someone at all the other day you know violence is one part of what's happening on the streets\nBut you can kind of look at the violence and you can kind of a one or something from that if you look at our people\nWere willing there's a lot of people that are willing to believe for this movement they're willing to leave for freedom um but the other side they're not willing to believe because it's for selfish reasons why they do what they do that's why they're so selfish they're not even willing to ...\nBleed and that's why they're going to lose\n... because if you got spirit and you know you're doing it for the right reason you realize blood means nothing\nBut if you're not willing to sacrifice the blood

talked about if you didn't hear it and we talked about the civil war we're now are experiencing in this country between the left and the right\nIn my opinion for the soul of our country we also talked about how Justice Kennedy hearings were really not about his qualifications but a continuation of that battle when when you understand that\nIt puts it a little better perspective it didn't matter who President Trump was going to nominate\nAnd they were against them in fact they asked if you remember the placards of the protesters I don't even think they had a name on it I don't know if they had an extra what they have but it didn't matter it was all about making sure that the president couldn't appoint a ... his choice let alone a conservative\nAnd the chief aim of that battle\nIs to remove President Trump from office the left and the Democrats and the media\nThat's all the same as I pointed out before never accepted as victory\nAnd they're doing everything possible to undermine that seems pretty obvious so in this segment I Want to talk about what I said this last night what a great job President Trump has done during his time in office despite the best efforts of the left\nKnives set for months now I could care less about what he says and much more than what he does and in fact but that's I guess it makes me a behavior list that's how I feel about people you know they they may say awful things about you or to others but if they treat you well\nI think that's what counts now his tweets of not always helped and he's answered people shouldn't that seems\nPeople that's what I Do and I think I'm right I Know are people that aren't worth my time what what's the point you're not going to get anywhere anyway\nBut I never expected him to govern in such a conservative way in fact I think he said I'm not a conservative I think he said that at some point he's far surpassed my expectations for him\nI must admit he was not my first choice in the primary season I gotta I got a ... or do they call it full disclosure I was a Ted Cruz delegate and I I was pretty sure he was going to make it or at least ... a lot of his people told me he was and show ... all the numbers while I guess that didn't work out\nAnd in my initial judgment I thought Trump was only better than John Case like no that's not saying much because your case it was really a Democrat and becoming more so I think what time\nIf anything there was a soft coup to get rid of President Trump perpetrated by the highest ... or our government at the Justice Department and at the FBI and

that he did when he was asked a lot of those hard questions along with the first lady\nThat we can overlook a lot of these things despite his personal shortcomings of infidelity and such like that he

facts\nAnd look up out of this country is falling in eight years we had we had a leader previous ... presidents so called president take this country down and I believe you set the racial relations and in our country back fifty years\nI I don't know the number of years a peep but I agree with you totally I mean saying if I had a son the Trayvon Martin whenever he looked like me are always assuming that you know that and what was the guy's name and then the other state I can you know hands up don't shoot all of a sudden that there has to be believed\nYeah Michael Michael and he sent it back\nIn a lot of people who voted for him because he was black thinking he was going to show we're not ... and so on and yet he he ... you're right it's worse now ... animosity in this country is is worse since he was president\nAnd you know the the most disgusting part of the Michael Brown incident in ... was a simple fact that if you look back and look at the history of as as the events happened as everything went down\nHe walked into as I recall to convene a convenience store he pushed the owner around as a store or the Senate and the store knocked the attendance down walked out with a budget goodies and then one on down the middle of the street looking for trouble that guy was wired for sound so\nAnd in the minority it only as yet yeah and it was over minority leader\nSays that said it was the way the police officers simply look you are right on all counts or member Obama what was that I don't know how many days before\nWhen we get married I'm going to fundamentally change you\nKnow it's it's it's insane and this was the guy we ... and the president\nAnd at the end of the day as far as the Ferguson isn't it ah it didn't take very long for them to ... to ... to respond and I'm I'm Talking about a ... a Eric Holder and Jesse Jackson and al Charlotte and it didn't take a ...\nWas it a matter of a day or two and they ran to Ferguson to to to to to stir up the eight and discontent as usual and you know the what the amazing part of it was as they grow that Michael Brown and got into the the officers patrol car to retrieve the officers gun just showed him\nNo matter\nSo so exactly but but so where so where are we as a country now the racial racial division in this country is incredible and it needs to stop\nBut they keep talking and driving home all this crap as nothing more than a damn smokescreen to make us look at the next issue that pops up and whether we like it or not the mainstream lame stream media is running this country\nAnd Pete I Want to have their or they said it triggered a point that I think is very good on your side the left just goes from crisis to crisis to crisis right and most of it is nothing writes the the collusion with the Russians and what what do we wait two years on this stuff\nOr you name it and it's a crisis right now I don't want to get into the global warming that right now although uh it became climate change\nAlways from crisis to crisis in the world is falling apart but as you said you've got a president now who's not let him get away with is in fact my loved what he said the minority community he said what do you have to lose about what's been going on in the last twenty thirty forty years\nYou know mark ... another thing I knew he was going to win at ...\nBeen known to be wrong we all we're all human but the thing about it was a he ... his debate ... including Hillary smoked every one of the smoke them off the stage basically well and there's this guy\nBasic political affiliations he had never dealt in politics at all\nWell thanks Pete I appreciate your call very much yeah that's what I said in my opening monologue kind of the people respect the fact that finally you got somebody who didn't care about how you came across just said what are your thoughts over the top sometimes uh you know I Wish\nHe didn't say some of the things on you know right some of things on Twitter that he does\nAnd I wish he would I say that I Wish you wouldn't respond to a lot of people but he ... this guy you know you get the whole package\nAnd as part of the whole package I think he's done a great job I just listen to it gave a partial list and far better than George W. Bush\nAnd in certain ways we compete to one of my heroes Ronald Reagan because he's he's done so much he doesn't even get the credit for a lot of stuff he's done and as I said I don't care what he says I care what he does\nYou know Rob I'm I'm just thinking about a on a personal basis what kind of surge and do you want someone who does a great job for you or someone I you know has a great disposition ideally you want both but he's been terrific in office and I think he's grown into it even better than I expected\nUm and here's someone else who agrees but I'd go to disagree to Marcus in broad run Virginia you're on with mark\nOh yeah [noise] yeah I'm Arafat you more and um [noise] I agree with your last caller\nAnd President Trump did not need this mess he did not needed at all he

know I even love his style he sees President Trump is pretty funny says you're going to get tired of winning so much I mean who would say that yeah he goes over the top uh as we said you know and as a Twitter his tweets I should say\nBought two would ever say something like ... he's a character\nBut he's growing into the job and I think he's doing a great job I Can't wait for him to be re elected as a a ... although I shouldn't say that can you imagine their reaction I'm Talking about the left and the resistance\nBecause they're trying to get rid of him right now that's why the young man who

you explain to me the difference between socialism and capitalism\nSure in terms of capitalism you have a free market system that's what it's called sometimes where businesses and you can start a business thinking closed down the business that can make as much money as they possibly can and government mostly stays out of it and the very\nYou know you have a like the anti trust taxing makes sure companies don't get too big and under socialism the government controls much more the means of production and they're making the decisions for the people and uh and not only making decisions for the people they control the economy to a great extent\nDo you think most of your listeners understand what top a little bit of a\nCouple of the worst of socialism and I really don't think a lot of I don't think many Americans\nReally know what social I mean what's what's got a got what socialism is I think they they think they are for them it's all isn't so it's communism it could be they they have no idea in detail what it is so for them it's a bad word\nUh-huh and how do you feel you get what a well I live in Toronto and I'm a little bit of social\nStates the only difference here is that we are a social severe it's a socialist society like you said the government's part of what goes on more than ... would be in the capitalist society but in terms of Medicare in terms of policy and in terms of health care\nIt's a lot better than the system you're living in I don't know how it would survive what a a big scale you up through their fifty million people I'm not saying that at all how we would do with those numbers but the numbers we have here as it does it runs well\nIt's I and I had a question for how unless I'm wrong I've heard from many many years that many people can come to the United states for health care is adding correct that's not the case\nLaw it's that's accurate that is correct but that's because of the weight in time because remember you have so many people who are on assisted is overweight entirely different versus you in America where you're just you're paid and you get to the front of the light\nYeah well the women ration care when yeah when you divide up stuff when the government gets involved you find in social societies people I think it's an MRI heard I don't know not too many months you may wait many months for an MRI whereas here in the free enterprise capitalism you could go the same day you get an MRI I agree I agree and yes you\nCould wait sometimes but you could also like I said get to the front of the lines of pets are urging it is I think what some things like kidney transplant liver track but that's a totally different story but I'm said on the general stuff it's it's it's not as bad as everyone thinks it and I think\nYour listeners have no idea what ... what socialism is a lot of people out here to talk about it on the radio over there in the states and they have no idea for them it's such a bad word but they\nBut so I don't I don't know if your brother is from a I Love to take the optimistic view I don't know if we're going to pick up tendencies for maybe he's right maybe the a blue wave won't materialize and it'll

it to fill you in if you're just joining us we've been talking about in my opinion I I started off I think President Trump has done a great\nJob is going to be reelected I Know he's got some shortcomings but you take the whole package on my shortcomings I mean he says things he shouldn't say it may be tweaked sometimes things he shouldn't tweet\nBut overall and I gave a list I'm not going to go over to game the he's done a fantastic job and I want to talk about the last caller um I you know I'd rather clarify differences sometimes asking her she was a Democrat that and we finished with her saying that uh\nPoint to her was well it's all I didn't get a chance we're hitting the break it's pretty sad I didn't get a chance to see that her but if there are no witnesses you can't do anything otherwise people could accuse all the time like\nA ... I was going to measure we didn't get that yet you know Stormy Daniels a loss and he's he's a lawyer and he brought out the sweat Nick or I Can't even if that's her name\nAnd she thought what did she accused him of the you know they were part of this gang rape or at least they were there and it was so postures they actually hurt the case\nThe other ... case for its case against a judge Kavanaugh because it you start getting ridiculous accusations so [noise]\nUh that's how it ended in ... for those who didn't hear it and the answer is you you can't in this country you're innocent until proven guilty and you there was no car operating evidence against the judge\nAnd that's that's the way it goes sometimes you you know you don't have a perfect society but it did start out with her saying I Can't understand how you guys like President Trump and they're trying to narrow down and find out what she didn't like about him and it looked like she did believe that it was rush inclusion but there's been no evidence of that\nAnd I'm going to predict now a ... not going to come up with anything on inclusion the only thing left now is obstruction of justice and even that doesn't seem likely and then she you know she mentioned the thing I Wish I had her on to you know but I think I'm expressing it pretty well\nThat of all the people around him that we're a guilty and something to do with clues and but they weren't they had nothing to do with collusion\nOr whether it's Michael Flynn horror Manafort there was other stuff and ... cases in really egregious because\nThe FBI interviews him he doesn't even have a lawyer with him and they get them on line to the FBI which is a great point I Would never go through an interview with the FBI anymore ... yeah and you don't have to uh in in most cases I guess in Los Angeles they have court documents\nIt was uh your your memory was lacking or the other person was wrong\nThey want to say you were lying to the FBI and good luck to you and I have a case now in court against you for lying to the FBI so a lot of the people around President Trump or at least the numbers that they mentioned thirty four they Leslie stall I think in the interview I don't know how many she said to the president\nA lot of them were Russians that had nothing to do with him they were they were indicted in something in terms of uh I guess election hacking or election fraud I don't even remember myself but it had nothing to with the president\nYou know these people and this idea of closure by the way when you think about it I remember President Obama saying off Mike He thought that you know when I get reelected will you know how I'm paraphrasing it will you know working out or having a reset uh maybe that was Hillary's that re said yeah she talked to the Russians to\nA they don't believe in global ism but where do they think that we're going to get the money to pay for their basic universal income the free college housing the health care uh the Alexander ... a cost of your Cortez from New Jersey Joe she wants but overall\nAnd oh yeah and she wants to care for all and they've proven that would cost us thirty two trillion in ten years I just

Bush called for\nA some kind of a new immigration bill to clean up some of the mess that Ted Kennedy left back in the sixties we essentially had an ad in the ah any immigration reform to speak out\nFrom that time and uh the Congress drug defeat in ... on on this thing until I actually after Brock Obama had already been elected but it hadn't been an R. Rated into that\nPast than immigration reform act and uh as it went through committee and in the weeks prior they just kept piling more and more and more garbage into this thing and George Bush signed this thing it was either eight hundred or twelve hundred pages I read the entire but [noise]\nAnd I read all the documentation that goes with Diane Feinstein had slipped into their section to always somewhere maybe uh three\nQuarters of the way into the bill\nOf the problem is it that we have now they've created so many of the problems that we have now\nAnd what it is is they can't just automatically send these kids back they can send their parents back up prior to the passage of this legislation of their mind I live uh in uh the the town where we trained most of the border\nOf told people okay the federal law enforcement training centers right here where I live so I take great interest and all this stuff oh in in the past prior to that two thousand and eight bill almost everybody who came to the border and made any kind of claim of asylum or anything like that\nThe border patrol agent on the ground than his supervisor and in extreme cases the supervisor above that supervisor made the determination\nWhether or not that person got the state it was never prior to two thousand an issue of deportation from the federal courts or any court to become involved with\nSo George Bush signed this thing or as a lame duck leaving and you may remember George W. Bush was very soft on immigration I don't think he specifically like this legislation\nHe felt it was better than than what they had prior to that that circle certainly accomplished many of his goals are in Iraq are so many up this country tomorrow ... so that means sad uh the regulatory environment\nSo for ten years we've been dealing with is the way it's probably going to get solved this for the courts to\nRecognize that not everything years for education that that at some point they're going to take the spirit of the law rather than their own individual feelings or into a\nInto effect and start past the roles they regardless we may be able to do that now that we have some members on screen court but I'm not even sure about that it may take another piece of legislation to solve this problem Marc\nWill also rubble all back I'll probably I don't know if we are I Hope Rob maybe during the week so I did invite him and Bill thanks\nSo much for clarifying that for us or in your hope as you said at the end you're not so sure when it comes to the courts and they're not supposed to be involved in and making laws and the first place and let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye markets filling in on a red eye radio\n[noise] ones over your goals eight six six months he wrote on ... on the radio [noise]\n\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Richard can't too\nThere are a number of reports that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia will at some point announced that Washington Post columnist Jim ... a critic of the getting them died during it into interrogation inside the Saudi constantly in his stumbled turkey\nSo now the kingdom has denied any knowledge of the show gets fate secretary of state Mike Pompeo is in Saudi Arabia meeting king Solomon and the crown prince\n... him just to find out\nReally firsthand what ... what they know what's going on\nNot wanting to spoil a one hundred ten billion dollar arm to deal with the kingdom the president suggests road killers may be responsible and it's already for President Trump calls it a total victory a federal judge in Los Angeles throwing out Stormy Daniels\n... says threatened her to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump in that tweet the president called it a quote total ... job the judge called the president's tweet a hyperbolic statement against the political adversary Daniels' attorney is vowing to appeal ABC's\nAlex Stone in Los Angeles it's up in ministry should unveiled a plan to force pharmaceutical companies to disclose prices for their prescription medications in their TV advertising\nPrince George's County Maryland police suspended six year veteran officer Ryan ... after he was charged with sexual assault sexually assaulting a woman after a traffic stop spokeswoman Jennifer Donald ...\nLast Thursday at one o'clock in the morning there was a female driver who knew that she was sexually assaulted by one of our officers that officer was in uniform that I was an enlarged cruiser and that officer was on duty Mac\nWhen facing five counts the county's police chief says this may not have been a first time thing you're listening to ABC News\nAdmitted you probably want to eat healthy but getting enough organic fruits and vegetables into your diet every day is not only time consuming and expensive that's why in Texas super food we've created a blend of the best USDA organic vine ripe and fruits and vegetables\nPowerful enzymes in probiotics and energizing herbs all in a convenient capsule or powder we call it\nTexas super food complete organic high on natural pathway Dr Denis black and I invented Texas super food almost Twenty years ago with one goal in mind\nTo help people like you who really busy lives get the all natural nutrition that every one of us needs and deserves so if you can't Walter don't eat all your organic fruits and vegetables everyday Texas super food complete organic makes eating healthy easy\nSee our full line of quality nutritional products attacks as super food dot com or call us at eight five five Texas fifty\nLet's see we have had driving while black we've had the campaigning for political office while black from St Louis trying to get into his house while black\nThe Aryan tolls was returning to his apartment friday when he was confronted oh I live\nI don't need to tell you that information you want to come into my name is natural building you're not the owner millions watched ... you\nKnow you're not security and not the property manager\nHere and I live here too I don't like the bank has their own and I said okay I don't like the fact that sort of locking me\nShe gets in the elevator with him\nAnd follows him just solve all the way through my door\nYou see my season that\nMueller has now been fired\nABC's Lindsey Davis and elsewhere that Britain's do can Dutch ...

when people on the other side do at the same way you know he was my point of view is yours let's let's see we're agreeing where we differ that tends to be liberal people by the way I don't think you can talk to the left\nI I think that's hopeless say I don't know if it was this week but people have asked what do you do with the mayor was on a different show what do you do when people had to try to convince someone you're not going to be with someone on the left you probably won't convince someone on the right although I think it's more true in a less where they're not going to let you speak\nBut that's my bias let's go to Phil in Ocala, Florida failure on with mark\nLaw English to the first time I've ever go there but I think if people would list or or school on your own facts instead of just taking orders ... the ... street\nTrump has tried ... or as a cop least ... people do want to see it\nBecause they're too busy not following the laws and the constitution over you know ...\nMile I liked that because I'm a I'm not only a conservative but unconstitutional is\nI I think that's made a big difference in this country and\nYou're right they may not know the constitution they may not know our laws right that's one of the problems by the way with illegal immigrants they haven't signed on to our laws are way of life and all the constitution are it's bad enough our own students don't but they certainly don't know what made him are exceptional and what made it so special and that's part of the problem\nWhy people like me pose allowing unfair illegal immigration let's go to Christine in East Lansing Michigan\nYes I Want to say that one of those things that kind of covers Democrats is that they feel they are superior [noise]\nUm we fought the civil war because Democrats with slavery their superior no proof mated paying somebody and I feel this is a reflection of the ... theory already complex\nThat they believe that and it threatened salmon great detail if some inferior people have any power whatsoever or can change life is a terrific threat to them\nYeah I I see it all differently I see them is very insecure not superior that may be a cover and I think when you use your motions all the time right just everything emotionally instead of some of our callers that logically and with reason let's figure this out at a ... you may not have heard a we had a ...\nWitnesses and emotionally she feels and I understand it hey yeah ah this perpetrator needs to be found guilty and face the consequences but logic and reason might ... leader to understand that you can't do that you can and just allow people to accuse\nAs with Kevin or anybody else without having witness or evidence or we'd have anarchy we're hearing loss\nTo emergency services and the mental health system for ten years and once you get a delusion it's a delusion it really isn't just an opinion or emotional action\nIt becomes almost it delusional disorder and I noticed any yes if somebody came in with a delusion you know changing their mind and I mean and\nI feel like this it's a delusion not just an emotion um they have the delusions and sit there your aid and I don't mean to be selling Sadek about that but I have seen the results of ever getting anywhere but somebody who's got loose you know\nGotcha but now you're national forecast for Romney tracks\nSeen the past couple of nights some freezing rain and the area of western Oklahoma northern Texas north eastern New Mexico and south eastern Colorado but that will likely not be the case today because the moisture source providing that freezing rain\nHas moved off to the east and warmer weather for South Texas will see heavy showers today those looks down through the architects region down into New Orleans areas hard hit by hurricane Michael\nNot necessarily going to be associated with any rain from this front but could see a pop up shower or to looking for rain for the mid Atlantic today all the way up into the northeast for New York city in Boston so that leaves a good portion of the country dry today\nHigh pressure it's clear skies today there is a look at your national forecast Retta radio I meteorologist John trout\nAnd on march I sort of taking your calls at age six six Ninety\nRed eye [noise]\n\n\n\nShe once you get here as long as you get in and then you don't break any other laws\nToo good to go that this has been this is the new law that you didn't know was like rewritten into the constitution and it is the most ... upsetting a\nCircumstance and you'll also notice it's gone from illegal alien which was the actual correct term to illegal immigrants to undocumented now you noticed the left they don't even say illegal immigrants anymore everyone's everyone's an immigrant illegal legal doesn't matter everyone's an immigrant\nThis is what are ... ... has a has become yeah I didn't do that but the left certainly has a\nThat is done very well with the language we and we lose to them all the time I don't know if you know but I Do live in Los Angeles in Los Angeles area so I Know just what you're talking about and for people who don't know there was something on the ballot to secede\nFrom the rest of the country and I I was saying that I'd be one of the first to sign it on my way out to Texas and made a lot of sense to me\nFor new become its own state a lot of course I'm never allow that to happen because Democrats would never win another election a nationwide\nBut you're right you're right about illegal immigration you write about the fact that we used to be illegal alien but they win the battle of the language right pro choice for his pro life a livable wage I got to talk about that some more that you know our business over ... livable wage no it doesn't always have low wage\nCertain times they they're really good at winning the battle of the language and when you could define the terms you tend to win\nYeah I did see making really good point yeah they're always moving the goalpost because it's a it's it's how they operate so\nSo I'm going to ask before I let you see before you go I got to ask you this why are you still living in Los Angeles\nYou know I still love the lifestyle and like yeah you know here here up up up paint a picture for you and you'll notice very well I I have family in North county San Diego okay and you're probably going to go down there for Thanksgiving through what's November\nIt's Seventy five degrees you hit that stretch where you are or get you know around um [noise] oh with the ... nuclear reactors are where's that\nYeah I don't know when I was ... I I have not asking data wherever yeah we both lost a good idea\nI Can't can't think of the name right and you hit that strip of of the Pacific ocean and you're in your car and you're going to sixty five and you're listening to great music you can't beat it it's still it's still the place they come here in droves it's still the place to live\nSolve finished with this so my brother comes out from Texas and he says there's only one redeeming value left to California and that's the weather and that's kind of what you say yes thanks thanks for your call I sure is very much\n... San Onofre oh ha ha I beat him I should have had him on the phone that's where the nuclear power plant a ... I live in Southern California where that's where he is and speaking of San Francisco you been waiting so long march in ... I mean speaking of California margins in San Francisco Marge Iran with mark\n... ... what is the taking my call and one\nConstitutional conservative to another I Want to say that um we are a nation of citizens or not\nCouple times um you agree with that yeah yeah you know make sense\n[laughter] anyway um my point was is that what I wanted to comment on about is the caller that called before Rico that said that Donald Trump up said that he was an atheist he was a very smart man and that he was an atheist and that was banned and this is now he's a Christian now\nAnd there's a lot of evidence to prove it um you know he he speaks loves\nYou know which um you know Jesus spoke of love God is love 'em he also um you know heat up this tablets our embassy in Jerusalem which is the apple of God's by truce alum is uh\nIs is where ... king David is is is from you know where his throne as you know the everlasting thrown will be in Jerusalem and\nI'm not I don't I don't want to give I don't want to do religious stuff but if if the president professors\nChristian faith that's fine and we don't have the gift thanks for the call by the way we don't have to guess what it is but that's up to him and his beliefs with God or or not with God if you wind up being an atheist I don't know if that's true or not let's go to Janet in at water California I Know where that is Gena Iran with mark\nHey mark how are you know well\nIt's a great show but what I wanted to say was that mayor of port land that the police should go and arrest him\nBecause he is violating the constitution by allowing\nThese people that take over the streets and the traffic and President Trump as the very best president and my entire life style\nAll that's all I wanted to say all that\nYou know he takes it's like the

I'm a why bother now and people have made up their mind the truth the matter\nIs everybody that I ever spoken to that gets involved in local politics says the same thing there by both both out of reach\nBy out of reach well I've heard three different radio show hosts on local talk radio say that they have asked to have them as guests both of them yes yes\nAnd neither one of them have time to go on any of the ... you can't do that what what are they running for national office\nNo no they're running for the state of Arizona you can vote for them in the state of Washington about they're both of you know you are not then you can vote for them out of the state of Arizona no but that is I Would consider that to be a a national office\nYou but you can only vote for low I Know that so it was so why wouldn't you want to tell a vision and radio coverage absolutely absolutely trying to win over a guy that's in Washington does you know good he can vote\nYou so my question to you is this morning we've talked\nNumerous times about term limits\nWhether or not they're good or bad mhm we've seen some guys who have been in the house of representatives for twenty four terms forty eight years\nWe've seen guys are like Harry Reid six terms in the Senate ... strong Thurman I Believe was nine I mean I Can't and he was there forever you know so we always talk about term limits but have we ever talked about money\nWe've never had the discussion and I mean should there be an amount of money that can be banned yes\nYes and I know people will say it will probably accused me of being communist\nUm but uh I did\nThe money in politics is the sole reason\nThings are the way they are I'm afraid you're riding Schumer be damned\nAh people feel and uh uh this isn't just me talking but I Know a lot of people who say why vote why it doesn't matter why and how those to connect with go ahead only that the people feel as though their vote doesn't really count\nSome people actually and this is fringe but some people actually wonder if their voters even counted well money from\nFrom lobbying uh uh efforts\nEh you know about campaign money yeah campaign money to it I I think the way Great Britain does it is a regional cramping money limits and Great Britain well that's ... yes but the aside the fact of term limits\nUm there's a particular set amount of time that people can do that run their campaigns and be done with\nThem I'm a ...\nEldest pac money for that brought to you by citizens for pen pals I mean you don't know who those people are unless voters go to the Internet and look them up\nBut what I'm asking is should there be an amount of money that you're allowed to spend the campaign or should they just be unlimited\nIt is an ... isn't it basically unlimited now yes this is why I imagine well as his going well well that's\nI'm asking but there is no term limits either except you can only run for president for two terms other than that yeah\nConfidence and then three days later there's an election\nYou know like sometimes I Wonder if that if that's a precursor or if that stipulation was held over their heads they conduct themselves a little differently I let me say this though\nWe can't compare ourselves a Great Britain no okay Great Britain is about the size of California and it's a yes completely different systems but let's come back to America now made us okay let's come back to America I think the money in politics is why we have what we have\nWe are the freest country in the world\nAnd we've been we've allowed ourselves I think to exercise the extreme in this case and here we are\nI think that uh the money or races a lot of ethics the money or races I Try I'm a lot of uh um uh things that need to be taken care of and in moral ethical I Know you can't legislate it but [noise]\nThe money has has really really before you can find things to the money is a campfire agree with you and I agree with you that there should be a sixty days campaign but what I'm saying is in the United states is fifty times bigger than Great Britain ... green for out of it I\nWas like because the comparative in this case [noise]\nOkay we'll talk more about that after this on the phrase you [noise]\nAnd how many times you can keep your job but instead worry about dollar limits\nSo far in this Senate election ... in Phoenix these two women that debate last night have spent two hundred million dollars for a job that pays two hundred thousand\nWell first of all\nBad economic yeah second of all I don't want to talk released\nStations and they shouldn't have to give away the advertising we understand that but the fact that these two people for one job have spent two hundred million dollars\nIs disgusting yeah it is and and\nYou know every day our our home phone number somebody else had who I don't know if he gave to every charity or knew them or what but every night we get it at least one call asking for donations\nAnd during the day it's almost non stop running as a um a answered the phone call hoarded right yes but but for political campaigns oh yeah\nYeah you don't even have to say hello the recording just starch and I vote

because you wouldn't put his job in jeopardy\nYou would turn it over to the CIA you would turn it over to the FBI you would turn it over the military but you're surely wouldn't go to the president or

you like one right well there's millions of other people out there that like other things are okay I may be completely wrong about this re but I see more and more stores going out of business\nThen I see going into business and it's because they can't have an inventory of a hundred and twenty different kinds of cigarettes of forty kinds of soda\nA wall of milk wall of the wall oh\nDear I didn't even mention goats smell ... hawk milk ...\nYou know I mean it's you know it's on the grill hot it is it is retailers doing their best to accommodate everyone there but they're not that's what I'm saying they are you in anything you wanted door now okay\nIf you had to go into business right now would you buy a brick and mortar business no oh why because I Would during the ... too many

the percentage of the strip malls we know malls have gone by the wayside in a lot of communities\nI Wonder what the percentage of strip malls that have in the stores in them because people shop online look it just take the holiday is Christmas Time uh or Hanukkah\nOr a or any other holiday that that big gang busters shopping experience takes place\nAnd I wonder what the latest percentage will be because you know it started off as maybe twelve percent and that was done on the on the road I I I'm Wondering if it's not a ... if it's not higher than that\nBut you know what people still see what people are still at the same necessities I Can't tell you right now and I guarantee you if you walk up to fifty people you you find tools that can tell you you know where I get a pair of shoes repaired\nDoesn't exist now we live in a very good and for every society everything's throw it out by guy\nWhere I get my TV [noise]\nSilly now [noise]\nCompletely out of business\nWe only [noise]\nWas right well I mean this is state\nIt is a lot of\nA lot of it on the value that we put on money\nYeah you're you're you have it exactly right and you think about um tickets will come into marriage the separate money values and their own unique family history so how their own family approach money whether that was like an approach like all we can buy it now put it on credit hat off later and then uh\nIt seems as though with the wages not being ... not keeping up with the rate of inflation and then you have kids and financially it just becomes harder and harder\nHow what would be a good approach for your average working class couples to bridge the gap in a philosophical way when they have opposite spending habits\nYeah I think it's really coming together and\nAnd getting some shared goals but some goals for the future or maybe it's false or the or the kids have you bought another good point is that you think about our own money values and how are trying to influence our kids really need to come together with a charity money story that we can act on it\nAnd so you know I often say let let's start with having some regular meetings you know we get so busy with Iraq around town and university or financed us together so editor at minimum quarterly meetings are getting better monthly meetings\nThat I think is a very good oh do ya it really is it keeps everyone at the table and on the same page\nBut you wonder how many people in this day and age would have a family meeting and they do it on the Internet or they do they do it on the cell phones you know I mean it's that ludicrous of ... as long as it gets done but you know also a lot of it as family upbringing now\nI don't know how your family was a [noise] but my mother always\nWrote all the bills mhm my

takes them you're hurting responsibilities around the money and the other one might not necessarily know it was happening and that again I think that's okay if they you know\nPay to their strengths and have different roles and bullshit and knowledgeable about what's happening on the finance says\nSure and also and and we've become a more sophisticated in what households by um there's insurance to worry about their uh you know there's the Internet built our our um\nBottom line expensive expenses rather\nA really exploded\nIn our new way of life and I said this just because I'm not a young

companies here in New York where he feels very comfortable center ...\nYear he's got one of the most intriguing books out in quite some time even though his knee deep in politics and policy and he knows the the amount of emotion out there he's looking at the big picture he's written a new book called them why we hate each other and how to heal senator welcome thanks and good but I also like the ... you also um you're the book the extreme\nTribes that were used to as the place that you find happiness we have a collapsing nuclear family structure we have fewer deep friends than we've ever had and statistics on this stuff we have declining local worshipping communities and we have shorter duration jobs so political tribalism is ramping not because it politic politics matters but it doesn't matter all that much it's not the center of life\nBut politics is trying to fill a void as people's neighborhoods that are collapsing and we should be attending to the first things first which is not\nPolitics or if I'm In for a bomb in the house uh watching and ah watching on my Apple TV and then I pick up my iPhone on taxing a bunch of people and interacting with people that don't exist yet they don't see you said that the stats one from\nAverage amount of Americans with friends have three friends three point something it's down to like one point something now ... is it because if technology it's a huge part\nOf it so I thank you for reading the book by the way a we have half as many friends in America today as we did twenty five years ago the average American is three and a half friends in Nineteen Ninety today one point eight as you say\nAnd so the smartphone is great lots of wonderful economic things come from her smartphone but make sure you turn the dang thing off tonight and have dinner with your kids because it turns out that matter so much more than your smart phone if you go from two hundred five hundred and social media friends you're not happy are statistically if you know the neighbor two doors down you're happier\nBut you're just saying the right now America is for the most part a lonely\nVery lonely you talked to researchers at the national institutes of health they think that loneliness as the number one public health crisis in America it drives most of obesity for instance being lonely for a day is the equivalent of smoking Fifteen cigarettes I Want people to read them because I Want him to be healthy or not just physically but in their neighborhood\nBut we can't do a you know it's very frustrating to hear well the nuclear family has gone away and we hear a lot of the minority communities that's part of the way I Do about that makes me want to throw in my hands and say what am I supposed to do about everybody else\nMaking decisions not to have nuclear family yes so the first thing you should do is invite people over in your neighborhood you got lots of listeners who are blessed to have a stable nuclear family there are a bunch of kids who don't\nJoin co want us all that stuff is more important than who you're angry at in politics again politics matters but it's way downstream from the stuff that really matters which is probably within five minutes of your house so that's very interesting thing we\nCould all do but here you are a knee deep in Washington the big policies the emotion ... Lindsey Graham says that was being spit on two weeks ago being spit on by people I've never met before Senator Jeff flake is being accosted in elevators by women he's ever seen before so how does someone look at that and think ... book really spells out how this happened\nYes so I've had those experiences to we I mean I may have anybody like life gets death threats now I my kids I have three kids aging from a ranging from age seven to Seventeen we host water stations that local marathons and people come up and\nAnd screamed that when the water when I headed to a twenty year old woman running by and the marathon they'll scream don't drink get it's poised and he wants to kill you\nThey think they're doing that because we differ about legislative issues there is something much deeper wrong in their life if they're willing to scream that I'm trying to poison somebody when I'm volunteering at a water station\nThe only way you can make that stuff's better is in the neighborhood where you live that can't be made better by legislation in Washington you can't pass a bill that mandates people become friends but your listeners need to become better at being friends in a world where the smartphone is telling us we don't have to live where we are\nSo if you have an example of Washington and working across the aisle or with a buddy let's say shoe movies more likeable and he felt like you could work with him I'm so Jeff Flake said this on sixty minutes and it I think it applies here\nSenator Flake you've announced which are not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running or not ... not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp to ... there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nWell that's the problem that's the identity but is that the reason you shouldn't\nCERN back to your political future if you do it\nNo I don't care about that stuff I Want to eight people out of a hundred and the Senate has never been a politician before and when my wife and I decided to run\nWe said for four and a half of the next six years will act like we're never run for reelection so we're due to\nPray about it and huddle and I've talked to some wise counselors in July and August next year and make decisions about our future but I don't worry about political incumbency has a core motivator for me um but the problem is Washington DC is filled with political addicts those are not normal people people who want to go to Washington DC instead of their whole life\nThey aren't good representatives of the people listening to your show we need term limits we need people who want to be from a you know all the communities Syracuse a New York and in Fremont, Nebraska and want to go back to those places because that's the place where you love those are the communities that really matter but\nThis does is also the fact that we safe spaces at colleges or the fact that they sent therapists to dorms after the election does that play into why you wrote this book\nYeah that that's a mess we do to touch on the sex based movement in this book I was a college president before I ran for Senate\nAnd one of the reasons moms and dads should be writing checks to send your kids to college is so that you encounter ideas you didn't already know if you want to go to a college where you know after ... never have to encounter any idea you didn't already know I don't know why you'd spend any money that's called education\nI don't want my kids to be safe from New ideas I Want him to encounter new ideas but I Want to do it in the context of human relationship where after you argue about philosophy or politics or whatever you want to go get a drink with somebody and have dinner with them\nBecause they're actually still humans created an image of God\nSo when you decide for example I think you might be a good example you just told me something I did not know you've been critical of the president not at his policies but a lot of it is is uh his ah his demeanor a lot of the way approaches do things but you do still talk to the present oh I Do\nI I like talking to the president and I'm grateful that he's willing to to take my call so we wrestled through issues I think he's done a great job on a bunch of cyber issues\nPresident does which is new that a lot of people are just having to wrestle through and make sense of\nMy my their issues where I agree with the president on policy their issues where I disagree and he's grateful I'm grateful that he's willing to to wrestle with me and have a conversation what I'm really worried about though is not this president or the election of twenty twenty I'm worried about what kind of country we live our kids in ten and Twenty years\nAnd we need to be having long term conversations about what America's about why we have limited government why we should do entitlement reform and the kind of stuff we talked about in them which is America believes in limited government because the center of the world is your community not\nD.C Suzanne or you live in a state that likes to ... days like Fox it what are the so called fly over states if people are ignoring before Fox came along I Would argue that Los Angeles DC and New York\nOr just would program every single a sitcom and every news broadcasts we didn't try to do that or an audience came from different what do you know in Nebraska that New York DC and California doesn't\n[noise] uh that even though we're in sex right now the Oscars are still the football team in the last ... years in every state that are getting ready for the best of luck fifty years now granted we were really good from fifty until about Seventeen years ago ... will be back yeah go to Ross don't lead us back to the promised land right but\nFootball side do you guys are you guys are not caught up in this in Nebraska you're not in the play by play you're not into the palace intrigue\nNo I think the vast majority of Nebraska and know that the really important things that happen in the world are what kind of character your kids are going to have two months and two years from now right it's about whether or not the people in your neighborhood want to go to the same neighborhood gym\nNext Saturday Night and share on the same team even if we differ about politics politics can't be the center of your life they can't fill the vacuum of the worry we all have in our soul who's going to comfort us on her deathbed\nThat's going to be family and friends and coworkers is not going to be some politician off in Washington\nYeah I agree with you say the iPhone also has some things in it now the lead they will tell you how long you been looking at it what you've been doing\nThey could tell you about your iPhone yeah that's exactly right again the iPhone has lots of benefits but the average Americans checking it every four minutes and it's not healthy for a Fifteen year olds there's a whole chapter in them about how to think about the right and the wrong way to use technology in your family the name of the book is damn why we hate each other and how to heal\nBen Sasse wrote it Center for Nebraska said oh it's great to have in Studio ... Iran [noise]\nTrusting challenge [noise] I talk to one of those points a K n K I find that station [noise]\nSome way some for some reason in today's world it seems vulnerable to admit weaknesses in the earlier days certainly for Abraham Lincoln when he runs for office the first time it's a wonderful statement he makes every man has it's peculiar ambition monitors to be a steamed up by my fellow man\nBut I'm not sure up you'll understand me and I'm not sure if you vote for me\nAnd if I Do lose I won't be too chagrin because I'm familiar with disappointment but then he says but I'm going to try five or six times until I'm too humiliated and then I won't try again I promise\nBut he said in that opening statement if I don't know something I'm going to learn it if I say something wrong I'm going to correct it right from the start he comes out of the gate with those qualities of resilience humility and empathy and they stay with them the rest of his life\nWill tell me if this was a a leap that you could take run sure notice book on grand talks about how grant ruin the slaves with after the emancipation was issued more and more slaves were deciding to run for freedom\nAnd when they were running to grant grants idea to say let's give these guys some uniforms and let them fight and he sees how the fault they got together and the galvanizing came to a unit and that's when we can start getting an idea of how what the world with this country is going to look like when this war is over\nYou know I think that's right once the black soldiers became part of the union army as they did when he finally opened the door to the black soldiers they fought magnificently and even the generals who've been against the idea of bringing them into the army began to see that\nNineteen sixty three because he feared that the whites in the army weren't ready for it he fit the north even the north wasn't ready timing is everything he said so we watch the changing sentiment he watched what was beginning to happen and that's another quality of a leader\nYou can't do what you may want to do unless the timing is right the timing was perfect for the Emancipation Proclamation and for allowing blacks in the army\nEven though it was driving Frederick Douglass nuts that he was waiting so long right exactly\nBut Frederick Douglass said once Lincoln takes a stand on something he'll never go back maybe slow getting there but it's true I mean it when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation there was a lot of low back in the north northern ... legislatures passed\nRules saying or a statements saying we're not for this we didn't fight for this we're just for the union and some of them were threatening to secede from New England and yet Lincoln knew that the timing would be okay that they would come around and they finally did and then Douglas finally accepted yes you are right on timing\nWell Doris Kearns Goodwin two years so if there was a natural leader even though we started off grew up sickly and he was somebody had to be home schooled it had to be Teddy Roosevelt it seems he built up his body because you couldn't early he did lady became physical way because he couldn't early right\nNow you know what's so interesting about that is that he made himself a strong person and that became an example are for the rest of his life he said one time there are two\nKinds of success in the world summit when somebody has a talent that nobody else can develop no matter how hard they try like cheats for a poem or Lincoln at Gettysburg but most people have said like himself\nHave ordinary talents that they develop to an extraordinary degree too hard to sustain before he was he wasn't a good eyesight person but he was a great bird or he wasn't that good of a shot but it became a world class hunter\nUm he wasn't a good boxer but he somehow lost an eye at one point but he became a good boxer everything came to hardworking made himself who he was boxing in the basement lock me by a White House ... wrestling matches boxing the his favorite thing was taking ...\nIraq if you've got to go down people were falling by the wayside if they're trying to find him in the woods two hours he would exercise every day it's one of the things I think about my leaders which is that they are able to figure out how to find time to think and relax and replenish their energies we think we don't have time in our twenty four seven world they had pretty important things to do the civil war World War two\nAnd they did they surely did write a doors or when you talk about to Roosevelt he took on the monopoly he felt like be there too much power and they did maybe perhaps he would control too much of the economy and if you want to take on the uh the big guys the bullies\nMaybe it helps that you were a hundred and ten pounds suffers from asthma your whole youth and maybe would picked on yourself and maybe you don't lose that ability to try to avenge it\nYou know that's really interesting I'm not sure I fully thought about that but I think you're right I mean he was bullied as a child\nAnd he felt that some of the big companies were bowling smaller companies and getting them out of business and he was going to defend the people who needed to help the people who win that's independent companies and and wanting to have their own life and their own sense of accomplishment and they were being taken by the big hand of these monopoly is I think you're right and thought about that well I I Want to\nTalk about the power plays of FDR there'll be J uh do we have we have some more time we can we can go getting great so leadership position with a book and turbulent times it's doing extremely well no surprise Doris Kearns Goodwin up put it together or

and the costs\nThree thirty five\nDidn't write it was introduced by\nAfter an average is with us or began to Capitol Hill a lot of people were focused on was Abu Saudi Arabia and of course amid germs at one leaving of some judges were confirmed to so they can get out of there were Catherine going Simpson arrived I understand on Capitol Hill\nGoing Simpson president the head of fusion GPS is there any doubt in your mind he's going to show up and take the fifth\nWheel he already indicated through his attorneys are that he was going to take that to questions about the da da da da da da da da di in the spring and fall twenty sixteen\nAnd then after the election using a Justice Department official and what role it\nPlayed in securing the surveillance warrant for Trump campaign aide Carter Page when Simpson had hoped\nTo avoid today's testimony on the basis that he would take the fifth but the committee insisted on having him appear under subpoena and he's now going through this very laborious process at going question by question\nAnd then taking other steps so they have a an under oath paper trail of symptoms refusing to answer these questions\nSo where is the contradiction from his original testimony who's ramping up\nOkay go Bruce or if the Justice Department official and he was used by Simpson and former British spy Christopher Steele as a back channel to get the ... to the FBI after the election November twenty sixteen and you can see and bruised\nOr emails and know that there was contact the Clinton Simpson\nInvolved with or until well after the election so that's\nA big disconnect but Glenn Simpsons problems are much deeper than just the disconnect with Bruce or what we've been able to see in our reporting is that more than a half dozen sources connected to fusion GPS or or the law firm that was working on behalf of the DNC and Clinton campaign and\nOthers for shopping the dossier to the FBI almost creating what critics call an echo chamber so every time it came to the FBI to another source it would lend more credibility credibility pardon me to what was opposition research breast\nWow um and of course a James ... basically should didn't really think the dog if you play much of a role\nModel it ... that may be his position but at least when you look at the surveillance applications that have been declassified you can\nSee that the dossier was one of the top line item in the application and that\nIt was not the only item but it was certainly a significant item\nThat was used to secure the original surveillance warrants in October of twenty sixteen and on the way into the session today\nI showed a series of questions to Glenn Simpson including why was he taking the fifth but also more specifically whether any parts of the da da ... ever been verified and he did not answer that question\nNor the final question which was as someone who has worked in a ... as a journalist in the past how was refusing our question today really consistent with his own experience\nNo but it doesn't budge on this but I guess he's hoping the Democrats get the house who's ... stops right\n[noise] well this is I'm certainly the view of Republicans they've said very vocally that they think the goal has been to run out the clock with the hope that the Democrats pick\nWhether that same committee will issue a subpoena for the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein to secure his testimony over these allegations he discussed\nRecording the president or removing him from office in twenty Seventeen that something Rosenstein denies but even even more importantly what he knew about the dossier and other intelligence when he signed off on one of the surveillance weren't renewables are in October twenty Seventeen so it's not\nJust um what he said about the president but it's also his role in the surveillance of a Trump campaign member\nOr a couple of things you know understand that any ... being looked at a because he might have or you might have leaked information out about Michael Flynn's not telling us not telling the truth about whether we talked to Kislyak or not where's this story going [noise]\nWell new records or had been released and what's been happening in the background as there's\nBeen an inspector general's investigation that's been ongoing at the Justice Department we had the review about the\nClinton email earlier this year but the inspector General Michael Horowitz told reporters at that time that he was also looking I'm at political bias in text messages he was also looking at whether there were a regularity is in\nSecuring the surveillance warrants during the presidential campaign and then also specifically the leaking of classified information and based on the record that were made public even then you could see that there were multiple strands to the lake investigation going to a very senior people within the FBI so McCabe\nReally has a lot of legal jeopardy right now it appears with the leak investigation but she's also a in front of the grand jury here in Washington DC for lying to federal investigators\nAbout a week the wall Street Journal that dealt with on that Clinton Clinton Foundation\nBy the FBI on but what I Would say not as as offensive McKay but a contacts on one of the takeaways I have from the last six months\nOr looking at this issue is\nThat he was not the only one who may have been using leaks for Strategic reasons I mean director Comey testify publicly\nUp and he specifically leaked memos\nTo the Columbia University professor to kick start a special counsel on the Russia probe and what we know from our reporting is that it leads to wind up those memos contain classified information so the question is whether director calling me will be found guilty of mishandling classified information\nAnd by the way we struck in a Lisa Page and Peter shrug also going back and forth about how they put stories into the press and celebrating in\nSome way but it's just going I think at this I think Brian is going to be one of the big reveal a when the inspector general is finished which is the extent to which\nUm and I emphasize a senior leadership within the FBI and not not the rank and file but executives within the FBI marrying the political campaigns used makes to try and former crap the gotcha sessions\nDiving heritage you the best how you keep it straight or I can never know back in a moment [noise]\nAre we being gay I find I'm going to be the state [noise]\nGot one eight six six eight seven six six now and we're talking about three things really are we're talking about what Katherine Harris just leapt off where Glenn Simpson is now behind closed doors taking the theft on every question answered by this or by this Republican committee\nKeep in mind this investigation stops if they lose the house and if you're smart\nYou do these two things we talked to John McLaughlin was opposed over Donald Trump and by far the best thing Republicans could run on is something they're not and that is what will happen when Nancy Pelosi is your speaker her approval rating for that\nHow would effect if she was in polarizing she remains\nAnd then you say what is not going to get done if she's there one of which is to find out what the FBI was doing it is higher levels to stop the president being from winning election and then once he got the election\nAnd now we find out what McCabe gone combing gun a Baker gun struck gun page gun who's left Bruce or suspended or excuse me demoted\nYou're getting closer and closer to the answer and what I Will be running ads on what's been revealed already and what stops in its tracks and who's going to stop\nSome rogue agents next time and the FBI if they have a political agenda and they want to stop your candidate and I'm telling you I Would be justice teed off it would I found out that after Hillary Clinton won the election they're working behind the scenes to set her up for some type of scandal\nThat's what they do and President Trump there's got to ... with Russia and next thing we got a special pro we're starting to understand how the heck we ended up with Robert Mueller we still do not know\nSo that all stops\nQuarter page is one that they fired got ... or I kept getting a renewed and they were following him because he thought he was a Russian agent even though he'd work with the FBI because he had taught in the ... spoke in Russia and he had some contacts there\nBut Carter Page is suing keep him on the ... weren't or quarter page keep in mind they kept renewing and they have no charges\nIn a probe that puts an ankle bracelet on Rick Gates put a put a Paul Manafort in jail a ruins the career of Michael Flynn or puts Papadopoulos in jail for a day\nBut destroyed his life the last year and a half this just off the top of my head and I told the Russians were never going to show up and feel their indictment Carter Page was followed surveilled by that\nNational aspects I mean there is just been so many lives as you're alluding to and you look at the damage to our democratic systems and you know our institutions of government\nAre back in twenty sixteen I'm just trying to get some justice in terms of getting some disclosure if you look at some of the prior dodging dot CA cases like Mr who bar as\nHe's the one that actually got some of the biggest uh information out there that you know Senate Judiciary committee and house intelligence committee had been basing a lot a lot of things on in terms of ...\n[noise] so keep in mind to ah George Papadopoulos on Twitter finds out this whole thing started when ... decides he's going to come out and blast\nA blast prime minister Cameron for blasting Donald Trump so Papadopoulos says is on the foreign policy committee for the Trump and he's twenty eight years old and he decides because he's got some power he's going to blast back a camera in combat but Donald Trump they don't like that Britain so he started looking into it\nAnd it seems as though perhaps you could put these two and two together they set him up\nAnd they give them some information from professor ... who is meeting with professor ... we thought it was a multiple best serve teach you had to London University now defunct and then at that time he says you know there's ... ... email is getting big the Russians got a whole bunch emails already to drop it\nNow Papadopoulos get this information and the ... down or of Australia because to them they start talking about a few drinks\nAnd he says what are you know about this Hillary Clinton email it goes right here there's going to be big things coming out of Russia now down or keep that information says you told them ... now who took ... ... why would he carries a multiple fester teaching in London both turned out not really\nTurns out mixed it is not a Russian agent doesn't that Russian contacts he works for Britain\nLeading intelligence with Russia right combining to find out that Russia's got Hillary's emails and they're about to drop him down or given millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation myths it works for Britain who is being an ally against Donald Trump you know the government is which is now the pose and Theresa May probably hate them just as much but that's a side for them\nSo they asked peppered apple is do you ever give up information about Russia to uh to another agent says now they got you know why\nBecause ... down and says you did\nIn retrospect you say yeah I made a mistake he got one day in jail now he's realizing how he was set up he's going to be coming in and I hope to drag 'em up the radio on the twenty six after he testifies and he's going to expose what's been exposed to him so far but if you look at all these things that took place and all the people that are around\nYou wonder why the mullah ... was even among other pro and now it's gotten totally out of control and have the Australians work with the Brits to set up Americans who actually work for Donald Trump why the president and got word from Britain not to unveil the ways that the information that led to this investigation\nThey said it would have jeopardize your relationship with our good allies Australian Britain ... how are they showing to be well the the will to us\nTime with the listening on FM news talk Ninety seven one eight

I just wanted to Mount Vernon recently and they showed me the table that he reportedly opened up the map on and they kind of devised a plan do you does your research say that\nOh yeah no it's it's amazing what an emotional moment for Washington you know he hasn't been home in six years for grandchildren had that he's never seen have been born in that in that time\nAnd he he walks in the ... um Mount Vernon I'm Rochelle bow with him and they know that there's a huge fleet of friendships is there and they you know pull out the maps and start planning it he's only there for a few days but it's the beginning of the great victory\nThat when this side note we've just talking about this I was just reading some excerpts from your book\nAnd one of which is Washington's got some problems not only is he trying to win a war that seems impossible when he told me he keeps finding some some disturbing news one of which was the British come down to the Potomac and they start burning every plantation they can but they don't burn Washington's why why well\nHis his cousin Lund who was the caretaker of Mount Vernon goes out to the British ship the appropriately named Savage and says uh here would you like some provisions are with us a gesture\nYou know if if I give you these don't burn or the place and and if they don't in Washington here's this he is infuriated you know how how could this happen to the leader of the American army said I'd much rather lose all of Mount Vernon a than here this news\nNephew yeah nephew thinks he did a good thing\nYeah yeah no it was yeah you know thanks to that we have Mount Vernon today but it put Washington a difficult position and you know and this is one of the things I kept realizing in this book you'd like Washington to have that high five moment you know I've done this we've won one this thing but\nAt every turn he runs into issues that make it very difficult uh at the great victory Yorktown\nOr his stepson Jackie customs dies of cabin of of camp fever and you know so instead of\nYou as the rest of America celebrates he's in the morning and uh you know those kinds of things it was really tough on one right so he what he does surrender how how does he get courthouses surrender\nWell uh they they surround a this is a siege and so ... what they do a series of lines in which they they move the artillery closer and closer\nTo the British position in Yorktown until finally um they're just pounding the British to pieces at night lord Cornwall is tries to escape by the rowing across the river but a huge storm comes up that doesn't work\nAnd eventually they have no Cornwall is realize I've got to surrender\nAnd so he surrenders and Washington is very insistent that the terms of this treaty be in our favor because when at the battle Saratoga under Horatio Gates it was just the opposite\nA Washington was a very tough negotiator are finally it's it's the the the ceremony to surrender but Cornwall is doesn't show up uh he he pleads illness and and uh ... voids the public humiliation of having to turn a sword over Washington\nSenate Philbrick are ah he's our guest right now so if you have the headquarters in New York and that to a general Clinton yeah has Cornwall a surrender anything but the ...\nActually it would be two years before the British finally evacuated from New York this was one part of the army a very significant part seven thousand soldiers there about ten thousand up in New York and so this meant there was still a significant army in America and Washington worried even though we won this thing the British are going to come back\nAnd uh there was a naval victory they won in the Caribbean all this stuff but finally the British Parliament realizes that people no longer want war no matter what we just have to get out of it until I spend a lot of money to cost them a huge amount of money and uh you know it costs the French just as much\nAnd you could argue and then you have that the French Revolution in less than a decade was a result of the fact that the French were bankrupted by their support in America and the revolution and about five thousand in New York you said in particular\nUh the the French no no the uh the reddish the British had a over ten thousand ... so that Washington wanted to attack New York before he wanted to check tax the Chesapeake\nBut the French felt it was much easier to sail into the Chesapeake Bay and they were right and they were right hey you know and they shifted Washington shifted gears I mean this is the thing about Washington he would when he realized you know they're not going to do it my way okay shift gears what can we do to make this happened\nAnd he and he did it in a very decisive and brilliant way because he made his preference for New York\nMake the British in New York think that that's where he was going to attack until the very last second when they realized whoa\nA Washington erosion bows army or on their way to Philadelphia and ultimately a Cornwall is in the chest and they ended up just two years later just leaving on their own because you're right it was the evacuation of New York ah in in November of Seventeen eighty three and a you know a huge huge\nSymbolic act if nothing else in Washington rides in um as a\nA you know as a writes in it's it's it's now um you know\nJust taverns yeah where she had his final drink a the report as a with his soldiers there used to overcome with emotion I couldn't really speak but he says come up and touch me and basically she would say to shake my head right yeah and they did and they watched as he walked out to a bar that was waiting and took him down stream\nAnd then you look out and you go to Francis ... only to do was make a turn you could see with a barge would be Oh absolutely I mean it's not as if it's been covered up by building you could see the path that Washington talk\nSnow it's amazing when you go down to that Wall Street section of New York you know the ... it's a village or ... when you look at the historical buildings and it was all very intimate\nAnd when Washington left and he was on his way to Annapolis where the continental Congress was to surrender his commission from ... done you guys can have a kind of a country might be alone you know and King George when he heard that this was Washington's plan to retire to Mount Vernon\nHe said if he does that he will be the greatest man in the world because you know ... it was inconceivable to surrender power I mean you know so many dictators had had refused to do that in the past and the polling in the future but that's what Washington did\nAnd he made it possible for republic to then spring up from this this great victory right but at first it will be no president no there was no president if there was a dysfunctional Congress or without an executive\nAnd it would take you know almost five years before the continental Congress would uh with the the constitutional convention would begin to create the system that we have\nI understand you can use to grant sure okay yeah we're going to have a few more questions because the other thing that's happening now since last time we

it was established from day one when the government was established it just wasn't called primitive action\nAh because if you weren't white you didn't have an opportunity to get close to President Ford or anything else that's called the armed of action at a debate you\nDon't like I I Would actually that actually is yeah I Would call that oppression\nRacism is affirmative action when you're the only person I get the job\nNobody I Know but we're we're we're a few years down the road from the gym I Hope you're not carrying around with you\nWith all that so but what I'm saying is you're right but what I'm saying is\nDon't act like because people would became too if I said listen this is not saying it's racism is ugly\nWe're going to allow people who are are not allowed the opportunity to live a full life as a guy who created all men we're going to stop the guinea fowl and now we're going to call it affirmative action and then he would act like if something bad now all of a sudden they weren't qualified to beat his job or if you weren't allowed to read for a hundred years if you want to\nHe recalls that situation that we're trying to fix it we're trying to guide against that an evil like say that was America in the beginning God wouldn't approve of that\nWell a lot of a lot of people on the left would say what you were describing still exists today only worse if you listen to know if they'll go oh I Know that but you know that but a lot of people say it is usually the social justice more use out there Jeff you you would you would think they knew the calendar\nThey're wrong

there John are gay or gay or an Arizona Welcome to the ...\nHigh high time\nI'm sharing especially now when it's brought up the fact that let's let's find out her college education which scholarships based on the fact she said she was Native American and I believe that\nWe did we we touched on it because it's only touched on it because that's kind of general knowledge that I said she displaced either Native American women or other minority women for that seat in college and then also later when she became a professor\nRight but that was fraudulent she should have to pay that money back\nYeah but we both I mean yes technically morally yes but we know that is not going to happen so we I mean it'd be a waste a waste of time and a waste of everybody's effort to try to get that it's just not going to happen\nWell I suppose you're right\nYou you say with a laugh but I'm gay it's more of what I said yes we we all get bogged down as we can make fun of her and you have all of the names on line the Native American head dress and all of this kind of stuff but it's what I asked back in July and I've asked in September when I was here for Todd\nWhat right what is the message of the Democratic party like what okay why should I vote for you widen well why would a moderate why would even a moderate Democrat moderate Republican vote for them what would aside from they hate Trump and they disagree with Trump and they thought Hillary should win\nWhat could they were what what is the reason does anybody can anybody tell me what is the reason to vote for a Democrat what do they proposing that is appealing\nAnd I can't even find anything\nNo skill I think that it's just the act logo for all and fats socialism and ... for\nI guess I guess I Do appreciate your call but we do have the as I said history is on their side and uh you know they're going to gain seats it's just a matter of how many will be enough to take the house possibly it's all about the turnout and the turnout this year\nFinds itself the foundation of it and anger\nThe left is very angry that Donald Trump won in two thousand and sixteen the very angry about the policies that he's instituted even though the economy is booming and the left\nAnd the right excuse me is angry over the Kavanaugh stuff that's happening before that they were sleeping as you know not paying much attention they were going to come to the polls but not in droves and the Democrats were most definitely going to be taking the house now it's a coin toss it's fifty fifty the problem is everybody's angry\nThe Republicans are angry over cabin all the Democrats are angry over Trump that everything goes along with Trump we could spend the whole show just\n... over getting your blood pressure boiling if you if you wait a

open for that but we're going to shift gears here already and as we make our way towards election day what issue\nGave the Democrats let's just say the most red meat this year ...\nWhat was it it was the separation of parents from their children at the border that one really registered with a lot of people even though it started with I Believe it was a New York Times columnist posting a picture of kids sleeping behind fences that rubber that represent 'em resembles cages\nAnd it turned out that picture was actually from the Obama years was like two thousand and fourteen the picture was from or something like that two thousand twelve\nSo that kind of backfired on that New York Times columnist but it also ignited the whole controversy of parents being separated at the border from their kids and you know it was bad guy Trump who was doing it\nWhy we I had a different approach my approach was if you are a parent then you had to the border and you know that what they're doing up there is separating families is on you\nThe safety and the safety of your children the safety of your family is all on you it's not on any government is not on anybody is sadly\nThird world countries things happened look what's going on in Venezuela to hunting wild donkey because there's no food and people are starving and sometimes people just cannot provide for their families it's very sad but when you have a choice when you know that if I go to this place they are going to separate me from my kids\nYou don't go to that place okay it's as simple as that but there was being done under Obama and it was being done I Believe with George W. Bush but it it it's the policy of the United states government you can disagree with it but you just can't blame it on one president\nAnd now what are we twenty two days away from the mid terms and now we have about about Thirteen hundred or so people\nShove the migrant towards the United states border\nAnd dumped a going to get their gee how convenient just around the time of election day or a few days before there's organizers they're saying that the group plans to march through Guatemala\nInto Mexico from there they will request refugee status which would allow them to stay in the country apply for a visa or then\nPass on through to the United states where they'll be a big huge photo op at the border and then families will be separated from their children or people will be turned away or some will be given asylum in some not\nAnd this is designed to inflame the temperament of the Democratic base to get people out to vote it is not an accident that this march of the migrant is being organized in being done now there have been people\nThat's one eight hundred three one eight six nine three four again that's eight hundred three one eight six nine three for\nReading of amber second Honda resort and casino proudly present John Harris the troop adore experience an immune to George injuries again and\nThe doors open at seven PM show starts today the your tickets now and the gift shop for only ten dollars per person or get a room package for only Seventy nine dollars per night which includes two tickets\nDon't miss the troop adore experience Brennan November So I guess at Honda\nOur police they put their lives on the line to keep our community safe\nYet Kingston cinema voted against protecting our police opposing a bill to increase penalties for criminals who violently assaulted police officer they protect us led cinema didn't do to protect them cinema also\nVoted against increasing penalties from the gang members and violent criminals involved and drive by shootings and send them a defense sanctuary cities that stop local police from working with\nFederal law enforcement to deport criminal illegal immigrants the sanctuary cities let them go\nIn cinema handcuffs are police and puts their lives in danger it's radical end it's Ron reject ... imagine the damage she do in the U.S Senate in ...

is eight eight eight seven eight nine nine\nOne zero Lindsey Graham was on Fox and friends this morning and they were talking about a caravan that it's coming they march of the migrants this what I feel as a stunt a political stunt plain with people's lives trying to time in their own election day and\nHe was talking about who would help to it doesn't help and also DACA which will get to in a moment and the type of immigration system that he wants a merit based but he said about the march of the migrants the caravan that is coming he said the following number ten please Steven\nWell that makes the immigration debate more on Trump's terms now if there is no right to come to America you know we can have rules about who comes and force Mexico Mexico needs to help us this last time I checked you just can't walk from Guatemala air that going to Mexico\nAnd when you go to Mexico they have very strict immigration laws which they in force\nAnd it's amazing that no one wants to highlight that that's why when I said before they go through Mexico they have to ask for asylum because they're not just going to let this march of Thirteen hundred people come through because Mexico ironically is very serious about their immigration laws and they enforce them\nLet's get to the phones eight eight eight seven eight nine nine one zero who do you think the immigration issue is going to help when it comes to the midterms is it going to revert back to earlier this year where the Democrats played well with the help of the media\nOr with the children being separated from their parents even though that's been the policy for ages or is it going to work with the Republicans because we see this march as a stunt\nSkyline one Tom's breakers New York up there right between a closer to Albany but between Albany in Syracuse right there Tom\nDidn't include not allowing people to come across the country to illegally entering the usa [noise] and I would think any genius could be able to do that but because that includes a lot of the drug traffic that comes with it [noise]\nThe reason being is because you cannot stop people from coming forward until we get what Tom do we get a wall\nNo no no no\nWay you can't you can't just like ... you can't just make a policy that people are not allowed to come here we already have that\nIt's a it's a deal that there's no way to stop 'em because you got the Rio Grande are in Texas and through Arizona you gotta know gal is and you have to you know the southern entrance through San Diego and San Onofre up in that neck of the woods there's no way to stop 'em but if we had that wall Tom we could stop him can't do anything 'til that wall is six well built\nYou don't want to hear you don't want to hear my side yeah I Do well here's what I Would say is Mexico could stop them because you would say our trade deal is can in June I use stopping them but\nWhat Mexico is going to do is give them asylum they're not going to stop 'em they'll give his final and then once they're one of their ... do they just keep moving forward the here\nIn Mexico give them asylum not not the United states\nBut that's what I just said Mexico will give them asylum once they're in the country though they don't stay they just keep moving through and they're legally there because they were granted asylum that's what happened last time they ... us dumped a few months well earlier in the year many months ago\nDon't believe that Mexico gives them a silent Mexico has very strict immigration laws\nI understand that but you gotta remember when the last caravan king\nAs leader of Mexico and Donald Trump then you have inside was bringing his ears so they did random asylum last time\nBut we don't know that all happened this time\nAnd I said Randy my living though we got the new NAFTA deal um you're not calling him after but I'm just calling it the new NAFTA deal this is something that they will they will give them asylum\nWhat is that what is the reason for them not to give us island ... on like say you know Mexico don't give him asylum they say why what what's your answer to that Tom\nBecause the same reason that we shouldn't give ... it's not based on their requirements for asylum there are only leaving for acting prosperity they're not leaving for other reasons for asylum\nI agree with you on that latter point but try to get the head of Mexico to enforce that it it's just not going to happen\nThen don't give them the trade deal\n[laughter] and that's already a done deal this will come out listen I'm with you Tom it comes down to money and they're not going to risk the\nBillions and billions of dollars on the trade deal for a few thousand people seeking asylum it's it's not worth the risk is not a good tradeoff\nWhat happens is because of that because they won't risk that we get the illegal drugs with the illegals\nAnd and then we give them an asylum\nSay they build a wall and then that eliminates the problem not a hundred percent but a a whole lot Tom thank you very much do appreciate the springs New York beautiful part of the country up there I must say\nI was going to Buffalo New York rocky welcome to the store and show it would loop eight oh I'm Sorry Iraqi we're going to come through right after the break I think he's even I didn't look at the clock we're almost out of time so if you want to get it on the conversation we're going to continue on the other side of the break eight eight eight\nRoom and I do appreciate it and also they were here there before before the show during the show and after the show we'll be right back my name is Lou pay this ... D Todd's darn sure [noise]\n[noise]\nUm [noise]\nAnd he was talking about something that resonates I Know it resonates with me and I'd like to know if it resonates with you the ... listeners\nAbout bringing immigrants here I'm not against people coming to this country I welcome them again my grandparents came through Ellis Island if if they were not allowed through some Yahoo's wouldn't let them in I Would not be here right now\nTo be hypocritical for me to say no no you can't come it's too crowded\nEverybody deserves a better life as long as you're willing to you know kind of help move the society forward the proverbial football forward then that that phrase I'm Talking about is merit based immigration system and let's play a cut number eleven Steve and this is Lindsey Graham on Fox and friends this morning\nWhat do we do with them I Want to ... based immigration system you got to get Democrats and Republicans working together to build a wall control who gets the job for\nLegal immigration moved to ... based immigration you can ignore the eleven they they'll never be a deal with the Democratic party that doesn't a deal with a eleven men are non felons have been here for twenty and Thirty years once you get them in a good spot even have a new immigration system\nThere you have I mean that sounds very logical merit based system again not turning anybody away just asking you to come in the the legal way so dance in my own question who does this benefit more I think it's going to benefit the immigration issue will always benefit the Republicans it you cannot not benefit them\nEven what happened earlier in the year did you know that amongst Hispanics Trump's approval rating during the whole\nRating went up ten points during that time\nWhich brings us to the great divide witches presented by the media the media would like you'd have to think that when it comes to an issue say something involving women you know say the Kavanaugh blossom Ford thing that all women think the same no that would be narrow minded to think that all women think the same simply because they're women\nToo they they also present that all Hispanics think the same\nAnd they think that Hispanics who are here Latino is whatever the PC phrase of the day is that they are all like minded one thought process well the furthest it's the furthest thing from the truth there are so many different groups you catch a Cuban Puerto Ricans you've got your Dominican you've got your Hondurans you've got your El Salvador ends\nAnd there's a lot of problems within those groups which we've touched on in the past\nThey don't all think the same they don't all like each other and quite frankly the people who have come here legally and who have sacrificed waited years to get their citizenship\nDon't like it when people cut the line that John and Stephen and I were talking about the the old days which I caught the very tail end of as as a youngster waiting\nOn line for concert tickets are you waiting on line overnight would occur concert tickets with your beach chair no one's going to be too happy if somebody cuts the line it's the same thing you're not going to be happy if you'd waited three five seven years and then someone comes in and says well they're just right to the front of the line instance citizenship\nSo we're number one it was exposed at the initial picture that kicked off the controversy was taken during the Obama years the media did would have had to do to keep it alive pouring gas on the fire but at the end of the day\nHispanics Latinos in this country who came here legally\nDo not smile upon their fellow countrymen\nTo America come here because they want another chance they want a chance for not only themselves it's really more about their families and and there are people that come after them their children and grandchildren and great grandchildren people that they'll never ... they'll never meet their actually setting a foundation for them\nAnd when you work hard for that sacrifice a lot\nAnd when you see politicians just using the situation it works against them I truly believe that this is going to work you get if they push it now who knows what's going to happen once this group of people makes it to the border they might only be a few of them or a few hundred\nAt the end of the day I don't think it's going to be much but if they really tried to make it into something\nThat it's going to backfire right now the midterms are horse race it's all about turnout it's all about who shows up and and more importantly who shows up where\nCertain districts are a contested and certain are going to be a blow out so it doesn't matter if it snows in Massachusetts on election day no one has to worry about it the Democrats are going to win anyway Pennsylvania\nWith all the gerrymandering that's gone on there that's a different case it's a different story altogether because the balance of power I think this eight seats are so that are up there that are being contested the balance of power could just well sit within Pennsylvania\nSo it's interesting it it's it's funny that how a snowstorm or in climate weather windy icy rainstorm could tip the balance of power one way or the other\nOne that comes to the Congress and so there we have it but immigration always benefits the Republicans I think these activists are barking up the wrong tree I think that bell was wrong very loud and clear earlier in the year they got all the mild they're going to get out of it\nIt's kind of like going to see a comedian who tells the same jokes and you're like well\nEight nine nine one zero who do you think the immigration issue helps Republicans or the Democrats my name is Lou pay this is the ... all the time on his radio

off and on ... the overnight Lou thirty four and but the clearing guides going to be breezy tomorrow and not as cool\nWith a high back to fifty five Wednesday night slow in the mid thirties and then for Thursday sunny with high fifty seven a meteorologist and holiday on I talk one oh six\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nBecause you know we\nTripoli laws\nTripoli Street was far too to\nAmber stores all those ... in Kansas City ...\nI think you um protecting our call sure are going to\nMeet some advice um my husband is eligible for pension pay to the previous they paid job\nUm and we received a letter in the mail offering a cash payout future retirement a new study the letter says it's four sixty percent at the present value at future normal retirement annuity mhm I've heard to\nAdvise people on the path to take the taps payout\nMet my concern is that there was a recent news announcement\nThat the state treasurer um had said that the pension plan hits weak and financially and that ten years ago there were friends to cover like Seventy nine percent of the future benefits and now it's up to fifty percent ...\n... we're I'm not ...\nYou're just depending on the stream of payments so that you that she had another reason to take the lump sum and almost always and you can you can uh get with a financial advisor get with more of our smart Mr pros and run the actual calculations which are are there there are about five steps too complicated to do here on the air okay\nBut basically you can put in the amount of payments you would receive and put in an average death age of uh Seventy six for a male Seventy eight for a female\nAnd that's how they're calculated typically on actuarial tables\nAnd uh then you figure out what the president value of those payments are because that's what you're going to receive and that's what they're saying that they're offering you and it's probably the discount rate is the interest rate and it's probably six percent five and a half percent something like that so you probably make five and a half percent on your money\nAnd if you die you lose it when you die not if you do when you die you lose now and so if you took the lump sum you'd be making ten twelve percent on your money if you invested in good mutual funds and when you die your family get some money\nSo the lump sum Ninety nine percent of the time comes out better especially if you include the fact that when you die you get to keep the money or you know but I Do know\nWow if I mean fortunately not a lot going on there and I\nYou know but I Would ... just saying and it's a mathematical theory on that you run through on whether the whether it's a hundred thousand or a million or or ten thousand you know the theory is still the same and it's just it's it's less important if it's a small amount of money right I get that but\nIn other words the mistake is not going to ruin your life you know that kind of a thing but if you want to run the actual numbers out that's how you would do it\nHow old are you I'm Tony I Want to do need your grandmother to handle your finances oh she offered and it sounded like a good deal for the title Romano wouldn't let her why\nThey should be able to get me on a better financial track\nOkay at twenty five that'd be your job I Know that have okay All right so what happened um\nWell my sister got a ... check their credit and found that my grandma wide open for credit cards in her name\nUm and ah\nWe my grandpa are committed suicide and though we found out they leading up to the day he took his life or my grandma drain about Fifteen thousand dollars for the last Fifteen thousand dollars out of his bank account\nAnd uh she that so I started looking into my bills and she hadn't paid any of my bills for ...\nAnd I I guess I just don't know\nWhat to do right now okay um so when did your grandpa commit suicide\nBy three weeks ago\nOh my lord I'm Sorry what a horrible thing so how old is your grandmother or Seventy okay\nWell what you need to do is you get off the phone is you need to take back control of all your finances\nWould be for the next hour rings twelve\nYou have thirty minutes get it done okay if you have to shut down the checking account if you have to shut down the credit cards and if you have to freeze your credit that's fine but you need to get control of your finances because your grandmother for whatever reason is misbehaving we've established that correct yes there was never money with your grandpa was money and with you\nI'm not sure yet okay you need to check your credit and see if she's done that to you as well but you need to shut down a so did you give her your checking account is that what you get rid of take over and how does she handle their money\nI gave my checking account my debit card um you just go down to a halt credit or you don't just go down to the bank enclosure checking account just close\nAnd whatever monies in their ... use it to be moved over to a different account and have that bank a pill that bank what's going on that this lady is um\nYou know she's she's misbehaving she's mentally ill she says the we don't know what it is but we need to get all control taken away from her is that all she had was your debit card in your checking account\nAll I have flown\nAnd that's all she had of your money or your stuff so you get paid as I as a direct deposit into your account\nSo okay so you need to change that as well right to the new account number two a day or today yeah are you going to do it today\nI own bumpy okay good and then you just call her up and say uh renting I got enrolled in a financial clash and so I'm going to take over my finance ...\nThank you for your help I'll take it from here\nAnd then you need to call like sure your bills are being paid call every one of your bills how much debt if you've got\nAll my bills Toto that added up a minute ago it's a rolling around twenty of hungry how many different creditors are you a a ... regular bills are all that's like utility bills and that kinda stuff seriously\nI don't have any you don't have anything to you don't have any debt well okay now okay then you just need to call your utilities and make sure where they on auto draft on your account\nOf your money and you can just like random mother know that you know with grandpa was passing out in which you have to fool with this honey Sean won't take it over I and I'm I'm enrolled in a financial class and I'm going to get control as a twenty five year old man of my life and\nI'm ... I'm Sorry she actually enjoy it\nWhile she's in jail why she in jail\nOr my sister crushed charges group called on my own name yes Rudy\nWow okay well you didn't let her know that you took the bank account or a due to all this weird notion of family then\nVery interesting wow\nSo people in the family are not real happy with grandmother right now I take it\nAnd no not at all\nYou know very sad sad to be Seventy years old and that and so and then the next thing you need to do is you need to pull a copy of your credit bureau report\nAnd you can do that for free once a year with each of the three credit bureaus and see if there's anything showing up on your credit bureau report regarding identity theft roommate sushi is open cards and your name\nAs well OK\nAnd let me help you to your sister may or may not have been really mad\nAnd she may or may not meant for your grandmother to be picked up but here's the thing the only way if someone opens on account and your name\nThe only way to get that account cleared other than pay yourself which would be pretty stupid to pay an account that you didn't open when someone stole your identity the only way to keep from doing that is you have to file a police report\nAnd when you're filling out the police report they always ask you if you know who stole your identity and if you don't tell them that would be breaking the law and so your sister follow the law properly when the police report as being filled out and said yes I Know who the identity the fee is\nIt's my grandmother and I'm I'm surprised\nIt is a federal law it is a federal offense now to steal an identity\nAnd so um she she's in trouble she's in real trouble but your sister ... could maybe accidentally activated all of this because she just had to do a police report to get the identity theft removed from her name\nRight but she may have been just mad and gotten arrested I don't know either way's fine with me but um\nThose moments definitely a thief but oh my goodness what a sad thing though what a horrible thing you guys are going through not Cody um well much how much do you make what kind of money do you make\nOf forty thousand a year okay are you really ready to take this over and learn how to handle money if you are I'll show you how which in our class IMC okay\nBut you ought to square shoulders back now and not look for anybody else to baby sit you you're too old for a babysitter so time for you to man up here okay you hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we'll get you signed up for financial ... you can go through the clash is our guest\n\nAnd we'll take good care of you and show you how to handle money and then you go handle your money thanks for calling in to open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five\nHow devastating\nYou're Seventy year old grandmother stealing your stuff I mean I I mean I've run into parents who steal their kids identities and that's pretty much gum but when your grandmother does\nOh

he's actually the one who introduced me to new ... who are graduated he won't eat too much on the book and I went into reading until after I graduated college in April\nAnd after we got married but we struggle with staying motivated um I Try to do the budget on new every dollar at first I didn't written by the but then as I listen every day more and more of an ... an hour of every dollar um but it's just a struggle balance thing um\nI guess the newly married and learning all her stuff and then continuing to try to stay on a budget and within ... only make her leg are almost done with that um that just how internal how to continue to my right hand and it and want to continue\nJesus said you're treasures where your heart is\nYou know when you agree on your spending and you agree on your financial goals you really agreeing on your ... your new marriages value system you're agreeing on as a couple our fears\nOur dreams our goals so when we're not agreeing on a budget it means that we're really not agreeing about life\nBecause money flows to just about everything in our lives from our generosity to our long term planning like you know stuff like retirement or wealth building a all the way to where we are going to eat Thanksgiving dinner your moms are my mom's you know messed up money flows\nAnd every one of these decisions and is affected by or affects every one of these decisions so by doing a budget together if forces you to combine your goals\nAnd in a new marriage that's essential\nUm when I first got married thirty five years ago they used to tell us the hardest year of marriage was the first year and that's the reason you're trying to combine everything he's used doing whatever you want your he's doing whatever you want on our trying to combine everything the budget is a really good tool\nRelational tool to force you to have those conversations so it's not just simply motivating him to do a budget it's not simply how do I motivate him to do that it's it's really saying gosh this is so important that the two of us are in agreement\nOn everything and this is a tool for us to do that or if you're not motivated to do that you got real problems\nAnd I feel the same way I did from that and then other days it's like I Want to get mad\nTen by [noise] and so we're trying to hire somebody but we're not having a hard time finding good and reliable employees in the industry that doesn't usually use resume to hire\nThe how can the gadgets hoping to break certainly the one way that we can possibly find reliable and get people to be a part of this law seemed like they say oh\nYou don't know any\nAt a party at their they hadn't been reliable\nYou don't know any painters that are good and reliable people\nWell we do have that and if they have their own it as well\nMhm so the only painters that you know that are good and reliable people already have their own\nBusinesses [noise] ... yeah [noise] okay we're we're trying like\nMe but um oh that I have black and like nobody we financially and so they just don't know where to look in order to get\nWell most of the time they would rely people run around with good reliable people yeah\nAnd most of the time do fishes run around with due to ... so usually when I'm looking for good reliable people I look around other good reliable people now I could be that you look in some of the other trades and you know one elect Trish in that's a good person or trim carpenter that's a good person and you start asking them who did they know that's a great\nPainter that you could bring on to the job\nA part of the problem they got as you're in a very very hot construction market in Denver and so everybody's got work even do fusses\nYeah\nYour has your husband's got my working hand on maintenance so that that you've got a bit of a labor shortage or when you've got a construction boom always in the city and that's what you're facing a little bit of but the way I have found like you know an example in our world it wouldn't be a painter but in our world it might be someone that's in technology\nSomeone that is a great Rubio unreal developer as an example there's a shortage of technology and Web developers out there right now in most cities including Nashville in Nashville is actually a tech hub but um you know there's a shortage so where do we find those well we you know we go on like you've done ...\nNo other great developers great painter isn't or the great painters or somebody is not a developer but has other influence in and other knowledge of the tech industry that's a great person will no somebody's right developer and send them our way and of course you're going to pay them\nAnd pay them well and\nI'm a ... paying ... doesn't make them anything except that will pay ... so you you want to pay people well but you that that's not the part of the only part of the equation as you've already discovered so the only way I don't know how to find them would be to find other people in other trades that are excellent and people in the\nPainting world that are excellent and try to move them onto your team once you get a couple of excellent people they will have a tendency to help you find the other excellent people ah sixty four percent of people that joined our team last year were internal referrals someone already working here\nThat was a thoroughbred

about the four oh one K. profit sharing with my former employer I Lived it over like you suggest into a rut roll over IRA\nAnd then I got a statement in the mail yesterday basically there was a other section where the fees or over three thousand dollars and by further looking into it they're called ... forfeiture face um and there for eight different funds I'm kind of confused of every three thousand dollars of my money\nHow much money was in there it wasn't that much actually with only around Eighteen thousand dollars\nSo I'm not aware of a mutual fund that has a forfeiture fee\nThan looking at um it's a headless eight different names and then it says forfeiture is and that has a bunch of negative and it adds up to almost thirty one hundred dollars\nThat's a yeah so I thought especially when it was only you know a small four one K. to begin with\nYou know really um did you roll it was a smart Mr pro\nI rolled it over and so ... previously on another IRA that I had already opened so you don't have an advisor I don't think that um\nAm sorry I Do not know the answer your question I've never run into that the only thing I can guess is is that you bought a ... that your company your former company the mutual funds are high C mutual funds or some gun that have got some kind of got you in there obviously okay but I don't know what they are\nUntil you exactly what happened at least you'll have a mystery solved since Dave Ramsey too stupid to answer the questions I just don't know the answer though I just don't but I'm sure it was the ritual is with us in a

my tradition all the the a plan or should I jump on board with this high deductible plans\nOn how much is a premium on the ...\nThe premium will be eighty two per pay period so it calculates to about Twenty one hundred a year\nAnd what about the other one\nThe other one will be around thirty four hundred a year ago thirty\nFor hundreds of Twenty one hundred she'll Thirteen hundred dollars for yes\nGrowing and how much is the doctor will only that\nOkay so on the PBS show it will be four hundred per individual or the ... and for the high deductible it's Thirteen fifty per individual but there's a twenty seven hundred for the family\nYou know and how how uh how old are your kids my kids are ten and Thirteen other any I'm only going illnesses or is it the doctor\nHow often do well I'll

part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity\nNot a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well as stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace a stay at home parent responsibilities I only recommend term life insurance since is the most affordable\nWay to get the right amount of coverage and not break your budget go to ... dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty

on a ... a lot and the male offering a cash payout\nYou're carrying normal retirement annuity mhm I've heard too at five people on a path to take the path payout\nMet my concern is that they're with we've noticed that now that\nThat they treasure um had said that the pension plan had weakening financially and it took out there to cover like nine percent of the kitchen benefit and I got ... percent mhm\n... where I'm not having a little bit when it comes time for your retirement yeah\nYeah I mean they can be broke and a lot of pension funds of going broke and the problem is you don't own anything you're just depending on the stream of payments so that that's yet another reason to take the lump sum\nAnd almost always and you can you can ... ah get with a financial advisor get one more ... more of us are pros and run the actual calculations which are they're they're about five steps too complicated to do here on the air okay\nBut basically you can put in the amount of payments you would receive and put in an average death age of uh Seventy six for a male Seventy eight for a female\n... that's how they're calculated typically on actuarial tables\nAnd uh then you figure out what the president value of those payments are because that's what you're going to receive and\nThat's what they're saying that they're offering you and it's probably the discount rate is the interest rate and it's probably six percent five and a half percent something like that so you probably make five and a half percent on your money and if you die you lose it\nWhen you die not if you do when you die you lose now and so if you took the lump sum\nYou'd be making ten twelve percent on your money if you invested in good mutual funds and when you die your family get some money\nRight so the lump sum Ninety nine percent of the time comes out better\nWow if I mean unfortunately it's not a lot on American Idol I\nYou know but I Would I Would ... just saying then it's a mathematical theory on that you run through on whether whether it's a hundred thousand or a million or or ten thousand you know the theory is still the same\nAnd it's just it's an it's less important if it's a small amount of

bills and she hadn't paid any of my bills for salvo several months\nAnd I I guess I just don't know what to do right now\nOkay um and so when did your\nSorry more horrible thing so how old is your grandmother\nOr Seventy okay\nWell what you need to do as soon as you get off the phone is you need to take back control of all your finances\nBefore the next hour rings twelve\nYou have thirty minutes to get it done\nOkay if you have to shut down the checking account if you have to shut down the credit cards and if you have to freeze your credit that's fine but you need to get control of

she's open up credit cards and your name as well correct we don't know\nI'm not sure yet\nOkay you need to check your credit and she she's done that to you as well but you need to shut down a show did you get rid of your checking account is that what you're getting ready to take over and how does she handle money\nOr I gave my checking account my debit card um\nJust go down to a lot of credit oh you don't just go down to the bank enclosure checking account\nDisclosed and whatever monies in their ... you use it to be moved over to a different account and have that bank a pill that bank what's going on that this lady is um\n... you know she's she's misbehaving she's mentally ill she says the we don't know what it is but we need to get all control taken away from her ... is that all she had was your debit card in your checking account\nThat I have a that's all she had of your money or your stuff so you get paid as I as a direct deposit into your account\nSo okay so you need to change that as well ride to the new account number two a day or today yeah are you going to do it today\nAnd so I'm going to take over my finances thank you for your help I'll take it from here and then you need to call like sure your bills are being paid call every one of your bills how much debt if you got\nAll my bills total that added up a minute ago it's a rolling around twenty five on how many different creditors are you a\nA ... regular builds a hole that's like utility bills and that kinda stuff seriously I don't have any you don't have anything to you don't have any debt no okay oh

I'm Sorry she actually I'm ... now she's in\nJail why she in jail\nOr my sister crushed charges group called card game honing yes Rudy\nWow okay well you didn't let her know that you took the bank account or a due to all this weird notion of family then\nVery interesting wow\nSo people in the family are not real happy with grandmother right now I take it\nAnd no not at all\nYeah very sad sad to be Seventy years old and that and so and then the next thing you need to do is you need to pull a copy of your credit bureau report and you can do that for free once a year with each of the three credit bureaus and see if there's anything showing up on your credit bureau report regarding identity theft\nCleared other than pay it yourself which would be pretty stupid to pay a account that you didn't open when someone stole your identity the only way to keep from doing that is you have to file a police report\nAnd when you're filling out the police report they always ask you if you know who stole your identity and if you don't tell them that would be breaking the law and so your sister followed the law properly when the police report as being filled out and said yes I Know who the identity the fee is\nIt's my grandmother and I'm I'm surprised actually that they went and picked her up but they did and uh you know show 'em 'cause it is it is a federal law it is a federal offense now to steal an identity\nSo um she she's in trouble she's in real trouble but your sister ... could maybe accidentally activated all of this because she just had to do a police report to get the identity theft removed from her name right but she may have been just mad and gotten arrested I don't know either way's fine with me but I'm\nJust moments definitely a thief but oh my goodness what a

Social Security say ...\nI could live to be a million\nBut the way that we're spending its own way so they're not going to let you die they're going to make it work continuous pay off the crap and it is an absolute joke\nSo there's been a bipartisan reluctant to taco the title of treasures because the popularity of those programs [noise] hopefully phone point here will go sure is about the way of uh you\nKnow you haven't been Mitch yeah haven't been and it's time to get\nSerious this is massive this is a\nReal issue here a massive issue domestically right here\nAnd you guys play grab ass with one another and you talk about stuff all day and you get out there and yet showboat you do all this stuff but when it comes to dealing with real issues like this and the potential of what could happen to us as we see this thing ballooning out of control and both sides\nAre running at the money with a smile on their face what does that do for\nUs not a damn thing it's sad will we\nWe're revenues loosely 'cause you don't really do a damn thing\nBut what ends up happening as fast as it comes in they figure out a way to spend it faster\nWe had the chance to do during the Obama years were divided government for ... years so unfortunately it was all of the truth you\nKnow and I'm interested to see what happens next year\nHow does Trump approach all this stuff moving forward how does he approached this what do we really get done and what are we going to have to cut because we're going to have to make serious choices\n\nAnd us as Americans have to stand up as well and say look we got to take care of the sick and the people that can't take care of themselves but we need to start looking at these entitlement programs and figuring out how we're going to sort them out\nBecause they're sick they're on a lifeline\nAnd it ain't gonna do us any good\nIf we get to the point where the dead it's so big and so cumbersome that it tips this ship over and that's where I feel like we're going\nBut like all politicians they kicked the can down the road thinking not on my watch not on my watch not on my watch not on my watch\nIt's going to hit the wall it is not Trump's wall to wall and then what then what\nMatter how much money we bring in we figure out a way to spend more we bring in a book we figure out a way to spend a buck twenty five we bringing a buck twenty five we

interesting thing and ah we I identified several people you know in the mid west it when it's kind of interesting and he goes back a long way and you get to see some of these people are now you know what it shows you if you think about this\nJust being on planet earth the luck of the draw of the drawl or they say it's one in four trillion trillion or whatever just to just to be born\nBecause to

something last week which I found you know 'cause they caught the California uh they they got the killer right the ... and ... that was so interesting to see how they did this but now they think they're narrowing down who they think maybe the zodiac killer and they think this may end up being the exact same thing\nThinking is is getting play for the zodiac killer fill Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber that you're going to say in ... no no no no Ted\nCruz's or that that's that's that never never he's too busy right now but uh uh no that's one of the things that's been like the big thing

three at she had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet at us so what we're getting is the newest latest reports is the Turkish officials are saying that he could show ... the journalists that went missing\nWas hacked up into bits and pieces and that's how he uh was taken out that he was cut up\nOh God what an awful just a horrible horrible thing and right now\n... got a serious serious thing they gotta look at and how he deals with this\nAnd the ramifications like I say are huge 'cause we're supplying a lot of arms right now and a lot of those arms are going to help prop up a government in Yemen that's going through a massive civil war that is getting uglier an ugly or with God Knows how many people have already died and the potential of millions of dying from a famine\nAnd it is a and then of course you've got a Iran and all of this stuff I I that's why he gets paid when he gets paid that's why he wants to be this when you get into a situation like this\n[noise] [noise]\nIt is going to be a it is going to be ugly it is in whatever way he goes because if he decides that he's going to stick with the path and then he's going to buy the rope killers and that that's what they're saying\nIt's not to the potential of what could be the first domino in several Donald ... fall apart in in the middle east because it's not just us and this was the other thing it there are other things at play here including the ... when it comes to Saudi Arabia because the west across the board is looking at this\nRepresentative from the twenty eight European Union

matters the most so\nIt's interesting to see what he's going to do and how he is going to play this because I Know knowing Trump\nHe wants to move forward with the arms deal and just chalk it up as a horrible tragedy and could have potentially going that say look here's the deal guys we know that you did something you shouldn't have done and this is ridiculous I'm gonna tell you guys this right now\nWe move ahead with this you got one chance if\nFor the sake of God you do something else\nThat brings my attention to it in a way that you couldn't even imagine we will make your life beyond a

think so if I'm Trump though in and he also had the opportunity to say look I'm going to move forward with this and Congress can say no you're not we're deciding not to and Trump can say look I drive but they got\nThey don't want to they can put sanctions on you that's on you that's absolutely on you three two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had mentioned shows your Twitter you
