about doing isn't\nDone it yet it is to do away with birthright citizenship that the idea that if you were born in the United states you are a citizen\nOf the United states on me read you the fourteenth amendment says about this the fourteenth amendment to the U.S constitution says all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the nearest action there of our citizens of the United states in the state or never thought that the fourteenth amendment\nHe wants to try to override the constitution within an executive order it's impossible there's no way that he can do it whatsoever but remember we lived in a world of legally\nRight ... the Supreme Court for they look at the constitution and the kind of go okay this site over here goes I interpreted as it was written\nSite over here is just it's a living breathing document on the left side of the aisle it's kind of like open to interpretation it should be progressing with the times Trump sat down with ... and they talked about this and that's when he left the\nPolling rations some legal scholars believe he can get rid of the citizenship without tension because ... ah have you thought about this law it was always told to me that you needed a constitutional a member of one and you don't you don't\nYou don't write you don't so I was told them you need a constitutional amendment he's saying you don't and there's a few things in there and it's about language but a lot of people say well wait a minute just try to change the constitution\nOne of the fourteenth amendment to the U.S constitution says all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens and the United states any catch\nLike it that's a dictator that's not who we are the constitution is what's protect us from dictators and things like that\nShow\nHow is he going to do this that's the question that everybody's asking what is it about number one you don't need that number to nothing to do as much as well as you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nWhy is that well it's about language remember we live in a world were words do matter and for all the craziness to get thrown around in the world of\nPolitics these kind of legal ease words and how they're interpreted really really matter\nCan at a very small minority of others are reading into that language in the constitution where it talks about all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there are\nA few folks not very many things that that language subject to the jurisdiction there ah it's a limitation that means children are undocumented immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and therefore are not birthright citizens\nSo and the constitution has been ... the fourteenth amendment is invaded and they and and it's been rewarded uh because of the fact that at one time it you know if you didn't have a country\nBut if you were country list way back in the day I have no you know legions and then they wanted you to pledge allegiance to the United states and and then there is this the subject jurisdiction\nMeaning like a lot of other countries and there are a lot of\nOther countries Trump goes on her and says there's you know that there

an honest conversation about it we can can we be honest in the sense that\nComing here just to give birth to children no matter where they come from in the world and we'll we'll make it and and I and I've been totally transparent\nI talked about the fact that in Irvine, California was Irvine or at least the California they they busted a ring of people that were coming here specifically from China to give birth same thing was going on in New York but with\nBarefoot through the desert which is happening\nThat are pregnant which is absolutely happening but it's bigger than that and it's for different reasons and I think we we should absolutely have a real discussion about as American citizens and somebody's coming here and done it right if their child is born here\nThat child should be but if somebody's coming here specifically\nWe could talk about empathy oh we want\nTo give birth to a child\nSo their child will gain automatic citizenship with the potential then to bring in as in you know as a quote unquote the anchor baby what everybody wants to call you know whatever PC or non piece you or do you want to use their ... their right to sponsor than X amount of people to come here that's\nThe frustration I think a lot of people have to change if for the sake\nOf argument I say okay you know what that child should be allowed to be a citizen but they can't spot they can sponsor one parent not both parents\n[noise] ooh and they can sponsor no more than that does that change that altogether for people who are wealthy I still think that passport\nVitally important for

slowdown in China in Europe are and some of the lesser developed nations so that we have kind of lost that\nGlow of universal progress which was really something that propelled in states that kind of made forward as well but\nHaving said that I think people are overreacting to some modest signs of pulled back a the GDP number for example was not as strong as in the second quarter of course uh not

moment is undetermined that is Florida the state of Florida has a column up\nAbout the contest between Ron dissent is\nThe Republican Andrew Andrew Gillum the Democrat\nAsking from some very good questions about who is Andrew Gillum and is the state of Florida that voted happily for Donald Trump is about to move toward the Obama part\nOf the Democratic party or are they going for the Bernie Sanders even more radical than that part of the Democratic party Liz can we read Florida is it just going to be a different state every time there's an election\nIt's a really good question Andrew Gillum that Democrat candidate was a surprise winner in the primaries that were held I don't know when that was six weeks ago or so at no one really saw it coming he's the mayor at Tallahassee and\nA really there had it not a whole lot was known about him he is an attractive African American a good Baker is kind of a nearby la channel I guess you'd say\nOr or mold a but really no one knew a huge amount about this guy a\n... including the fact that there was a corruption scandal swirling around Tallahassee where his mayor uh for the last year or so and it's a pretty serious one and one of his former campaign workers uh\nGillum to an FBI\nA investigation and where they they it it's it's complicated but basically Gillum was has not been named in any indictment or subpoena\nBut he's pretty darn close to a lot of seeming bad stuff that went on having to do naturally with real estate development and pay off a ... and honestly I I had no idea what the outcome of that will be as I say he has not personally been mentioned\nBut it's very close to his office which I think is tainted his um his run but more importantly I think for the voters of Florida I I have to say I sort of shake my head about this Florida is a booming state one of the fastest growing states in the country one of the lowest unemployment rates\nAre under Governor Scott they've created an enormous number of jobs more than the country average\nUh and it's just unimaginable course from New York and I don't need to tell you there is a steady exodus heading to Florida because of low tax\nRates there and the fact that it's a great place to die forgive me but the low inheritance rate and all the rest of that stuff\nUh you know a lot of wealthy New Yorkers make it their business to move to Florida and when they retire so why Florida would want to change all that and that is what Gillum is promising higher taxes higher taxes particularly on corporations\nAre but higher taxes nonetheless this is a fellow who is funded heavily by George Soros and by organizations funded by George Soros he is not at all and the Obama lyrical mold in fact his way left of Obama honestly it is astounding to me that he has gotten so much traction in this race\nLet's look at the big picture of the Democratic party being astonishing leaves successful in other races where the logic escapes me for example we were under you\nClick on party has delivered free point five percent following four point two percent of GDP that that is to post to to to dominate the conversation but it's not instead the conversation is turning obsessively about the conduct of Donald Trump\nIs that the Democratic message is that is that the closing argument Donald Trump that's it\nWell yes and I I mean that's exactly right if you can come up with any kind of coherent democratic platform that they're running on I really love to hear it because I don't think it exists\nA instead what you have is anti Trump favor um and and the problem is because the president is out there a\n... will presiding over these enormous boisterous rallies day after day after day weighing in on all these contests in a sense the Democrats are responding to his presence in these races now\nI think he's doing the right thing I think he does things turn out I think he's out there were lining voters that voted for him you know or to work is not done\nOn on how much did that in twenty ten do you recall those rallies in Philadelphia and Chicago he was always on the campaign trail with feverish attention talking about I remember particularly one don't give him the keys back big round the car into the ditch don't give him the kid back\nAnd he ... he was extremely popular and the ... came back okay fine so it's a joke but I don't remember making Obama the centerpiece of twenty ten that was entirely about Nancy Pelosi and healthcare that was the message and it's one in ten\nAnd in twenty fourteen where the Republicans held up quite firmly it was about jobs jobs jobs jobs I was the last midterm it wasn't about Obama although it was his administration the puzzle here is what is the Democrats promised to do\nIn this closing argument against\nA wealthy Democrats backer has put a lot of money in this race for candidates who promise to pursue impeachment the minute there in Congress I think there will be an effort to impeach the president a Maxine Waters is going to be head of the financial services committee and as a committee chair she will have the\nOpportunity to subpoena records and financial transactions all kinds of stuff from the president's so she has promised to move to out on impeachment uh hearing process as quickly as possible and I'm sure she'll do that I think that that this gr itching thing a little bit John is new and I agree\nThat Republicans should be out there talking about the growth of the economy tax cuts the deregulation but the Republicans are doing it they are so cowed\nBy the damage ... Democrats particularly about the tax cuts how it was all going to the corporations into all the people that they're really intimidated and they and and maybe some can't connect the dots I don't know but it's very disheartening\nThat they have this weapon of the economy\nThey're not using it was picked a columnist at Fox News columnist up the hill I'm John bachelor\nThis segment of the global business report brought you by the Republican ... from food energy to our knowledge economy the Republican ... of the Caspian Sea bass in the region well worth exploring the drawback\nLegit you form or George\nAllen has abandoned the people in her district in favor of our big dollar donors in Phoenix\nAllen voted in favor of troll marriage\nAdvocated to live predatory lenders back into the state\nSo teachers from some of the floor and now she wants to store sixty five thousand tons of nuclear waste in your backyard [noise]\nShe'll be balanced with gender too [noise]\nSo we have on on

communities the tourists Saturday November seventeenth from ten AM to one GM RSVP by calling one eight five five as empty for\nI Want to add to that about blue collar Larry because I Do small business reporting all the time\nAnd what I'm told repeatedly these last weeks is a small business confidence has never been higher these when I first people to endorse or embrace well a Donald Trump early in the campaign cycling I've puzzled about whether they know that everybody all the smart guys don't know\nThey're still very confident about the economy and they're the ones who do the majority of hiring and all the jobs in America and the job creation\nAll I think you know going back to the campaign\nA candidate Trump argued again and again that the war against businesses over\nAnd the war against success is over and if you keep more of what you earn or risk or invest a you will be rewarded rather than penalized that's the beauty of the lower marginal tax rates and you know two years later that's what we are seeing\nSteve you have a question about business investment please\nI wanted to ask Larry about this because I was just at a at a conference today and it can on the campus of recording out with a lot of the good news that lower was talking about some of the skeptics Larry and I love your kind of response to this\nWill say well gee you know ... there were some really that is in this latest report and the things that goes up like that that was that the threats that you know basically four percent growth now\nThat they're saying they were very disappointed with the business aspect numbers that and that shows that the corporate tax cut as working and so on and and I don't know if I had all that question very well but I Wonder you know what you'd say to that\nIn the fourth quarter in my show up in subsequent revisions um for example ah in the core kept ... core business investment spending shipments and cute three were up seven point seven percent and orders were up eight point five percent both at any rate\nNow that doesn't really jive with uh the slowdown in business equipment which was only ... euro coin four percent and I think that which will be straightened out a in a in cue for if not sooner but a key point here the national association of business economists nay\nThey are reporting a new record highs and profits and profit margins\nAnd I'm profits are the lifeblood of the economy and so I reckon as long as profits hold up and they are they may be having another shelf life here that's gonna really propel\nInvestments spending business investment spending which also the prop it increases are are they to function of the a reduction in marginal tax rates\nLarry our our consumers are driving this that's the way it should be right we're ... the no ...\nNo no I don't think so only in this quarter only in this quarter John I'm In the prior\nQuarters it was business investment in fact most of this expansion or the Trump expansion is coming from the business side uh although it was sloppy in this quarter and you're right a consumer spending was stronger but actually when you look at the statistics um [noise]\nThis is investments fixed investment up six point four percent over the past year a consumer spending up three percent so this really is a business investment driven and that's the healthiest because we have not seen this since the mid ...\n... we are experiencing if it's just consumer spending after all supply creates it sounded that business investment create more capital per worker which were late to higher productivity\nAnd stronger real wages and again and the trap lied or that is precisely what is happening\nLarry Kudlow is the director of the national economic council Steve Moore is the author with

the European Union and that was the basis of our conversations\nThat focused on the ... up that in winter of twenty fourteen leading to the tearing a part of Ukraine between Don Bass in Crimea and between ...\nAnd the western part of Ukraine that begins our conversation but since then war with Russia collect Steve's remarks following our broadcast every Tuesday there more than two hundred of them\nThem all but I've not done anything because we're still following the story of the new Cold War\nWhich is told in particular in war with Russia we moved from Ukraine and Ukraine crisis then to Syria and the Syrian crisis in in a twenty Fifteen when Vladimir putting in the Kremlin commit their forces to the Assad regime and working with the Iranian regime\nThen we go to the frontier along the Russian frontier when NATO gets involved in making dire predictions of what will happen if and when the Kremlin turns its hybrid warfare so called against the Baltic states rearming of Poland

the People's Republic of China especially in a most recent exercise in eastern Siberia\nWhere the Chinese participated with three hundred thousand Russians in fending off what was presented as a fictional event the invasion of Asia by a foreign power interested in taking over the Korean Peninsula\nThat fictional event most recently that's all in the new Cold War tonight however Steven I

goes\nThe Kremlin will once again be in the field to corrupt democracy we're dealing with the irony of history how in the old Cold War they didn't tell them Margaret Thatcher\nThat the Kremlin really had an agent in the election that was their opposite number Michael footage labor party and in the new election\nOr they did they the Obama administration their intelligence apparatus their FBI either the OJ shouted to the rooftop salary Glenn shouted that Donald Trump isn't it as a Kremlin agent with no evidence that the world we live in the new Cold War is a ... and with farcical\nA week before the midterm do for the legitimacy of the American government\nWe talked we've talked about the potential and put a implications\nRamifications of this Russia gate allegation that the Russians were manipulating the outcome of our elections in the case of Trump in two thousand sixty and as you say the media's pushing this now in regard to the house congressional elections\nAnd on November six [noise] so we knew what I talked about this a little bit and it is a subject in my book war with Russia there's question mark after it\nThe more I think about this I don't see this going away\nIn the sense that as you said damage is being done we need that sense of process so here's what I asked myself and it's it's more a question that an assertion but I think our folks listening ought to think about it or\nIf you say and you say it's for two and a half years\nEven though you can't produce any evidence that the Russians may have put Trump in the White House what have you done to the institution of the American presidency\nBecause it won't end with Trump because the idea that the Russians could do this the Kremlin could do this and now they're saying the Chinese may want to do it but that up but were in power\nCan choose our president\nPotentially de legitimize is the presidency as an institution it\nCast a shadow of wine or let's go to what's going to be the normal reaction the next Democratic president is going to get the same kind of stopped thrown at him or her that the Democrats have been throwing at Trump it isn't gonna end so what we have to ask ourselves first we get\nA almost a\nNow going into next Tuesday these questions have been raised so I have no doubt that if\nThe Republicans hold the house a\nRemain the majority that a segment of the Democratic party and its media will be saying that the Russians were behind this or that the Russian to you know tip the scales\nBecause they wanted to protect Trump so would we have a shadow over the presidency and over the next Congress that's fairly serious in my my mind John's and then that raises another question in my mind these people take this seriously\nWhat are they saying about American voters\nAre on the American people now in democratic theory and you don't have to be a political philosopher notice the bedrock a representative democracy is that the agency\nLies with voters that voters will make a rational a functional democratic decision and you live by their decision you would agree with that all democratic Oscars yet to begin with that premise that go on from there to talk about\nInstitutions have representative government but you can't have institutions are representative government uh unless you have people to elect them otherwise and some\nAuthoritarian systems have outwardly democratic parliament for example correct but there are simply appointed and control\nIt's called managed democracy but for democracy and representative democracy is the one we know\nAre you named voters but if the borders are said to be as they are in these Russia gate\nAllegations forever susceptible to\nBy some Russian wacko social media operation in St Petersburg what does that say about the American people\nI mean we got to think this through at about other people you and I John where we lived our higher life inundated by advertising on television that we don't believe for him that\nI mean I Know that if I buy that beautiful car\nIt is not going to get me all those beautiful women that are leaning over the car I mean we had been raised to be intuitive leap skeptical\nOf the things that come to our attention I I think that's fair to say I mean advertising agencies try to manipulate us but we know what's going on so to say that the Russians are capable of Being American voters\nSaying something less about the Russians and about our own people but that is what these Russian gate allegations\nAre saying it is striking to me Steve remembering the election and just I was participating as a reporter and I was watching on Twitter I could tell when the Russians were on line because it was morning time in Petersburg so I Would often wish some very good morning in Russian\nAnd they would never respond because they didn't have a sense of humor they were working for money I understood that but it wasn't a threat it was kind of cheering\nThat they were so keen on trying to influence us with awkward statements like Tennessee for Trump you know that kind of thing right [laughter] it's really very persuasive very thank you very much picked a real hard states their work for the Republicans imagine Jeb his day so I I it never occurred to me that it would be\nIt would be concocted to be a threat to democracy it seemed it seemed kind of sweet of them that they want to get it that they that they wanted to get in on the process because they don't have anything comparable\nAnd cause we talked about this I won't go into it but historically whatever meddling or in there\nA ... ... let's turn to that just moments tape right back meddling and there are elections where we'll ... when we come back professor Stephen F ... new book is war with Russia

come together and and help these folks know you're not welcome says the Democrats sheriff\nIn Pittsburgh no you're not welcome to the Democratic mayor\nQuite Republican would ever do something like this there was a Democrat president in\nThere have been an event like this\nWhole what Republican whatever act like that for the statement of Nancy Pelosi\nUh Michael a bomb at all these people

cynically do the most horrible thing you can\nSay hey this market the bass sounds like a really good plan let's put it and play\nAnd you think your wisdom [noise] if there isn't a God you're

enforcement other's best without even get into an air\nPlus the same people evidence towards ... most of these Nazi ideologies are run by global ... and it's come out\nThey it it's a very simple ideology and you believe you're right and everyone else is bad and\nYou you ascribe mystical powers to Jews\nAnd then you take any evil that Jewish groups do which certainly goes on there's evil cults and bad reception every group and there sure is in\nBranches of what came out of Judaism in those people were all over the planet\nI've I've read some of the later books there but it's pretty wicked stuff every culture has written stuff like that\nWhat you think the Jews the only ones that have black magic\nYeah there have been Jewish groups in history that to sacrifice and kill babies and there's been every other group does it too\nAnd I do the same damn rituals in different parts of the world that never even knew each other 'cause the devils real\nYou know like the Bible there's good Jews and there's bad Jews\nAnd there's good gentile center's bad Jim tiles\nBut Jesus\nIs saying I have had a covenant with you and now my covenant is to every one that\nFollows these rules and the rules if you follow them give you an incredible productivity incredible success and good fruits and the world wants to destroy through\nTwo day and then Christian systems and they they are the two religions\nAnd Christianity did come out of Judaism\nThe otherwise the promises I said you know Christian values they pulled her hair out\nBut Christianity came out of ...\nAnd that was the corruption that have gotten to Judaism like any other group and Christ was forming\nAnd the Protestant Church seems to be reformed and the Catholic Church he's reform and Judaism Ajmi reform there's there's always different\nVeins in any group but Christianity and western civilization\nAnd what we have today would not up in there if it was it for ...\nSo the west\nWent from its barbarism and all the things that was involved in some beautiful something bad to its heights with the mixture of Judaism\nThat was very very similar\nTo a lot of the ancient Anglo saxon common lobby study it and so that's where they except that it's so much because so much of it made sense\nAnd so I'm a real historian I'm a real scholar I find it fascinating and I've read wide ranging stuff but I've read the anti Semite crap I read what Hitler road I've read what black magic rabbis wrote I've written what the good rabbis wrote I mean I've read a lot\nWhat the original people I've read Plato I've read Aristotle I've read Julius Caesar\nAnd I know the different world systems\nJust like there's a fight over America's destiny because it's special and it's powerful\nThere is a fight over ... de\nAnd there's a fly over anything else it's powerful everybody wants to take over Japan or something powerful there but it was said over Russia there's something powerful there\nIt's a very sophisticated paradigm but I've experienced that I've looked at it and\nWe must come together around a set of values\nAnd ideas that humans are tribal\nAnd then transcend\nAll of the artificial division the evil people use the controllers\nSome the ultimate individual is on the ultimate collective\nI Am an individual but I'd collectively\nWant to promote goodwill an open free society and by all of our individual actions by good men doing the right thing and good women in the right thing we build that world\nThe collective is the ultimate tyrants because they're not collective which they come in with a centralized vision centralized control\nThey lose their humanity and they're all cold blooded the global is playing us off because we have values and we stand for things\nBecause we have ... in our heart\nAnd levers on her so they think we're we because we feel\nBut really were already in the next dimensions\nWe already are transcendent\nThey're just like cancer of the global is manipulating\nOur humanity and our emotions to control us\nAnd then thinking they're ascendant when there are the opposite\nSo I'm going to say this again\nThere's good and evil and everybody we need to come together and love God and love justice will be right back stay with us\n\nThe things that are enumerated on a piece of paper that they were willing to fight for the first amendment the bill of rights bill of rights are

Retta\n\nMe see I've got the [noise] ... right here in the Eighteen Ninety eight ruling that that is being brought up by many people on the left in Ninety eight ruling in the\nKim arc case the Supreme Court held the children of non citizens when born on us territory are us citizens by birth however\nThe parents in question in the long case were illegal immigrants meaning that the court did that they may have had it in their opinion but they did not addressed\nActually the status of children born to parents in the U.S illegally they made that claim but that was not a a\nCase where they actually made you know a decision on it\nIt was an opinion in a case but not directly involved in that case right that makes it at that point being is that the parents were here legally right the parents were here and even though they said it did cover it as he writes here goes look the Supreme Court has held this is we're not go back to John Eastman\nThe Supreme Court has never held otherwise some advocates for illegal immigrants point\nTo the Eighteen da da da da da da da and my ... but that case merely held at a child born on us all the parents who were lawful permanent legally dominance out residents was a citizen even though they said in it they expanded it out that wasn't part of the law\nSo they actually did not create legal precedent to that point right\nNow the only other problem that the the the president would have with it and and by the way I'm I'm from the ... and ...\nTo begin with you know after reconstruction and you know it had to liberal writes activating sixty somewhere right right where you knew that everybody knew it had to do with former slaves yes that that's what that's\nWhat it was all about the parents of those children being born the children being born slaves\nThe the parents in that case were not subject to any foreign jurisdiction now that the problem is because uh I as I said I don't believe will see it in our in my lifetime I I'd be you know that's really a dump statement because who knows how long I'm going to live\nBut [laughter] but if I Lived Thirty Years' war or the draw to figure\nOut a Thirty Years' um you know I I I still don't think we'll we'll we'll see it because I think one of the road blocks is look the president's right I agree with the president on this\nUh but the problem is to Congress in Nineteen fifty two added to the immigration and naturalization act they added a portion that basically\nAgreed with the way that the fourteenth amendment was written they said we agree with this this is the what immigration should be this now they didn't they didn't specify and they didn't say\nA children of illegal immigrants become citizens all they said was we agree with that\nAnd so the court probably will look at that saying well since at that time they didn't say we disagree with how it's been interpreted and we disagree and the law should change and you know when it comes to illegal immigrants because they didn't make the change\nThat many judges in the federal system including the Supreme Court might just say well that's up to them too they they interpreted that way or we go back to Eighteen Ninety eight and even though the the courts it's not technically legal precedent there was an opinion\nAnd send it back down and it may never get to the point of talk of defining what jurisdiction mean a a bench surely we will get a bench Lee someday we will get to it but it took two hundred and over two hundred and Thirty years to get to the ... was it to hell or two thousand eight\nWas it two thousand eight hundred thousand five\nTwo thousand I forgot about roughly two hundred and Thirty years it it ... it it took ... to finally had the Supreme Court interpret the second amendment yeah that it was an individual right\nSo\nA two thousand at a time flies so\nThat's the problem and that you you have you have to word it the exact same way I just don't don't see it but those are the legal challenges\nThat you face right now that the Eighteen Ninety eight opinion that's now law which uh again this is where the fourteenth amendment was not written specifically to address it as a true construction is you would look at it and say doesn't say it applies to non citizens\nAnd in order to apply in order and and you would need to that's how I Would do it as they construction is doesn't say it if you want to say it differently than say it differently but it but it doesn't include it but will it ever get to that point where they even\nThe Supreme Court actually hears and the whole goal is to define what subject to the jurisdiction of the fourteenth amendment actually means will we ever get to that legal place is my question and again I just I don't see it in the next\nThirty years I'll throw that out for right\nBut it's a way to start the ball rolling\n... yeah ... I mean I I think ah it certainly brings up the the\nAnd then you're going to see it in the courts the question is will the high court take a case like this\nAnd and so when you look at the question yesterday where I chuckle when I heard it I said well it's really the wrong question kind of president do this with executive order will of course he can if nobody challenges kind of\nDo it effectively as the question and and right now he's not going to be able to do anything effectively ... the only thing is is that it was a political reaction to the the care of in ... ah to well illegal immigration in general um and and the president's not wrong\nOr whether he's doing it now or any other time\nAnd the approach maybe that's the point maybe the whole point is let's see if we can if this thing 'cause they know full well going to be challenged\nAnd so at that point you you decide when you know you're going to announce this now we understand to the\nUh the political leverage that that is is created quite possibly or by just the announcement of between you know now and and ah well six days from now the mid term\nBut beyond that it is also something\nThat I think in the current political climate that has to be discussed because ultimately what does it do\nNow it it\nBrings up the discussion but I think it gets us closer to and hopefully somebody on the right will\nPosition the Democrats to finally say that they're for open borders mhm so that's you know that's part of the I guess that's the political side of it the effect of it the legal side of it will be interesting but it won't be quick\n... this isn't going to happen\nImmediate an injunction immediately will be a new immediate\nBought from the courts and then they will go into the courts and it will sit there for however long it takes to get ... and I don't go to see if it ever get right and this is something that I I I again I doubt it would be fast tracked no because because it's it's not like to travel\nBan right that affected people immediately right\nSo it was it was not jailing with with like what what what you could make the the executive branch could make the case and the travel ban that there was a an immediate threat\nThat we had people traveling from certain parts of the world\nThat had been trained and that were coming here and that\nIt was reasonable to review that process that travel process from those parts of the world\nAnd and that was something that they could make a the the case for in this case it's not that kind of wild many conservatives might say look at it is a it's an immediate threat or has been a threat for a long long time the problem is\nWell yet technically it has been for you know a hundred and fifty plus years but it is not something that is going to be fast tracked because it is it is not adding any kind of knew immediate threat we understand what's going on with the hospitals on the board I Know that growing up on the board I Know exactly what their burden with and\nBut this is something that that likely is not going to be fast track\nEight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nWas busted for red or radio with a record eerie McNamara

citizenship and\nAll that you just made an interesting point here because we we had gone back and and as others have and and you know did the research of the original writing of the fourteenth amendment and senators that were involved and\nWhen you said well ... because we talk about the citizenship clause which was authored by a a U.S senator from Michigan and his name was ah Jacob power\nAnd during the debate of the fourteenth amendment he described it he actually talked about the intent of the citizenship clause\nWhich was to exclude a it would exclude Native Americans who maintain their tribe a tribal ties and persons born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers\nAnd when you look at that because historians of have gone back over this\nYou have a lot of legal scholars right now saying well no because it didn't get specific\nWhat do you we often go to a legal precedent and and everything else and certainly go to this is not exempt from that they will cite legal precedent um but there is no greater in my opinion there is no greater legal precedent\nThan the description of the intent by author the clause\nHad an author who was very vocal during the time of the debate about the intent of that clause there is no greater president\nSo we can go back and talk about our founders well what they intended what they are and we don't always have on record\n... you know the the the the thought behind a what our founding fathers set up for us now we go back we have the debate and I think you know the interpretation has been of a ... in terms of many\nBecause you don't have well here the notes we transcribe it verbatim and this is exactly they didn't break it down our forefathers didn't break it down in into them a new show but when you get back to the very intent of it\nBy the senator who was the author of that cause there is no greater precedent then that intent and that was to basically what they were trying to do with the fourteenth amendment\nIs to ah keep the the civil rights act of Eighteen sixty six essentially out of the courts in terms of ah it being challenged on its constitutionality while if you have the fourteenth amendment and its ratified which was\nThen that settles that right ah for the most part that is the the nature of of what was going on here or because\nAnd then you'd have to go to the Nineteen fifty to a a part of the immigration naturalization act ... and they get section I Believe it's I'm just from memory fourteen or one has renewed earlier that the word Congress said okay you know this is this is the law does in Congress except the way you know the fourteenth amendment here\nAnd so you'd have to go back to Nineteen fifty two the justices to say OK did anybody even bring up the birthright citizenship that it didn't include it in any congressperson or anybody who uh you know who who submitted this bill to Congress even bring that up\nBecause as far as we know that that wasn't an issue at that point why they did it more research has to be done as to why Congress did that in Nineteen fifty two and what that specifically met\nOr if if you go to war to the side to define who it applies to the uh the citizenship clause if they were to define clearly indecision I don't think this is going to happen but if they were to do that would that\nNormal fi that law from Nineteen fifty two\nSaid is if if the law says otherwise and the constitution the fourteenth amendment or just that it's no it was all day to fourteenth amendment is\nThen the what Congress did in ... it would be gone that's what I mean oh yeah yeah oh yeah the ... that ... that law also right that they could one one ...\nAnd and that's the interpretation which means that I owed as much you can let you have to get past that part and that is what I don't see happening no no I said earlier I don't think that's I don't think they're going to get to defining a very clearly what they based on interpretation\nWho the ... look at us ship clause applies doing who look it up a gun lawsuits over the last ... probably\nA a you know two hundred and forty years of the country and the two hundred and Thirty years before Congress irks me for the Supreme Court finally said the second amendment as an individual rights ... it took that long right even though to me was absolutely clear that it was an individual right\nAs it was too many of us because we knew what the founding fathers thought go back to the federalist papers and you can figure that out quite easily and still it wasn't defined for over two hundred and Thirty years and eight six six Ninety right I\nWas told that he ... he wrote a [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million

college in Massachusetts I decided that I wasn't going to go through the long process run out of state student to register to vote I had a hectic schedule I just didn't have the time and energy\nIt's just not that important\nAlso I didn't know how my parents would feel about the whole thing because my brother does not bode either so it wasn't asked if they could help us out with the registration

California and the desert southwest will be dry there is a look at your mid week National Weather forecast from a radio\nA meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety right or\n\nThe the courts would say well Congress is looking for what we believe on this to begin with now we're never going to see that that's a complete total hypothetical delusional [laughter]\nYou know delusional scenario because it's not going to happen but I'm saying they could do that but because Congress in Nineteen fifty two said that many believe that the courts will use that in order to different safe now sorry I'm\nThe Supreme Court gave that opinion in Nineteen eighty Ninety eighty when there wasn't a precedent that was that\nIt was an opinion the opinion Lee in that way Congress didn't object to it when they basically approved of the fourteenth amendment in the Nineteen fifty two law so sorry you don't have standing as the executive branch yeah they could do lower courts can do that in the higher courts might refused to hear it\nBut it has never been my my problem is\nAnd this is where you know occasionally we'll talk about the failure of the system I believe that we as a nation need to have when you have a a law\nThat clearly is and how it's been interpreted is not an amendment to the constitution which is clearly\nNot being viewed by modern society as the makers and the writers of that amendment and the people and the legislators that voted for that amendment back a hundred and fifty\nModern Thirty years yeah a lot of federal precedent not Supreme Court precedent but there was federal precedent in there that was they pressed into their the Supreme Court came in and said sorry uh owning a gun as an individual right yeah yeah yeah\nThank you Scott we appreciate it um I I because yeah that\nThat the\nArgument is often well it's been in place for so long this is what we've been doing up to this point that's really not a legal argument\nYou'll hear that if if they were to take this case if the if the let's just say this word fast tracked uh the the president issues the executive order it's challenging gets right up to the Supreme Court and ... and quick fashion I'm In the hearings you could you're going to talk you're going to hear the impact\nBut the impact remember is on would be on on on children that would be born to aliens in in in the future\nSo it's not on it's not even the we're not even talking about the legal status of anyone who was born here up to this point\nTo a parents who work here illegally that's not going to apply that's not going there is not going to be any grandfather ring of a revoking the citizenship of someone who was born here up to this point it would be those children\nBorn in the future to illegal parents and that's who would apply to and there's a certain a behavior there that isn't that is not immediately effected right uh we we often talk about the immediate effect like the travel ban\nWell you and I had to go back and screamed award temporary how many different times because the media was making it play out like we were shutting the doors for ever\nOr on people coming from certain parts of the world\nBut it's not going to it's not going to it wouldn't be the same in in consideration fear of what the impact would be because the impact would be future\nA but I'm a I'm afraid what you're going to have is you're going to have judges look at this and say\nCongress has never challenged what they did in Nineteen fifty two they never settle with\nCongress has never or there's never been a push to change the way in Congress the way that this law has been interpreted the only thing from the Supreme Court was the opinion that is was not a legal precedent that was set that they believed it was an Eighteen Ninety eight and Congress has never fought that\nThere's never been a serious legal challenge it has been accepted that the interpretation has been there for a hundred and fifty years and you're going to have judges even construction is judges\nEven cabin on Gorsuch may look at it and say well there really hasn't been a fight over this the second amendment there's always been a fight over a fight going on constantly for that\nAnd constant precedent being set on that on birthright citizenship maybe not so much and they may look at it and say it's been this way for a hundred and fifty years it has a specific law about a specific type of behavior that we allow were gun rights could be every gun issue was a different issue in a different law in a different state\nAnd they might look at and say this is pretty clear that the interpretation\nWhether the author wanted or not but the interpretation taken an accepted by the country for a hundred and fifty years even if the author that was not what the author of the amendment thought it's been accepted all the way back not just recently that it should be changed back in Nineteen Ninety eight that was their\nOpinion of the Supreme Court and a lot of judges just don't want to touch it because they don't want to be the ones the change what they believe\nWhat I think where I think it's going to go ...\nAnd it's a shame because you know and these things will happen in in any uh you know any republic any constitutional republic where a law can be passed it will be vegans somebody will take an interpretation and it isn't challenged well\nAnd and that's that's what I Would say is that the ... it doesn't matter what society it doesn't matter how new or old the challenges if it's a new challenge that's never it a new challenge means that no one has ever stepped up to travel I I agree I agree with you on\nThat is why it took two hundred and Thirty years to get you know that guns are and you know you have an individual right to bear arms in this country\nYeah every Eighteen Ninety eight case would be different because you had parents who were here legally you didn't have the question of ... what about the parents who ... aren't here\nRight and ... but the opinion there was an opinion written which wasn't a precedent that ... made the claim that they are right that after a court did which may be used and said okay that opinion was out there it's not legal precedent for but nobody ever ... challenge at and they were doing it at that time they were still allowing\nEven at that point you can be an illegal immigrant in this country and since it's been going on for ... it's not like it's stopped for a hundred years and then came back again magically mhm that's the problem right\nWell it hasn't been challenged ah so that's the question do we ignore it because it hasn't been challenged because nobody challenged it or not one shot to define that claws\nWell\nI agree with you I Will leave without question you have somebody on a ... a lot ah you when when you see that when if I was a judge and I say well look let me look at the original\nAnd the word lands that's going to be my opinion you go back and you look at the first demand or the second amendment as many of the just as the justices did you say okay what's in the federalist papers what were the founding fathers thinking when it came to guns why did they want the second amendment what was it about and once you do that\nYou know that was the original intent and you\nKnow it it's it's easy to come to a decision I agree with you I think they should do that ... because it isn't a it isn't a law that has written but typically there is no specific\nThe it it doesn't specify birthright citizenship\n\nIt doesn't state it's not this is what were you and I've talked about before if it's clearly in there like in the second amendment [laughter] and [laughter] they still went back and look to do it it's not clearly in there\nMhm it really does because the argument would be made then in this case coming from the other side well\nIf if [laughter] if\nA Jacob power the senators who wrote the citizenship clause intended it to be as such than the citizenship clause should have been written is exactly\nAnd since it wasn't the only thing you can do is go back and see what the authors mindset was who actually wrote the bill ... members of Congress or wrote that amendment that got passed what was that ... there's nothing else you can really go on you have to go on that if your original list\nAnd I agree I disagree and I don't know would Gorsuch her cabinet or anybody else would do I don't know how they would we view it it was shocking to me when they came out and said you know\nAmendment is or the second amendment a protection individual's right to bear arms because it took so long and I would like to be a legal scholar and just focus on that and see everything that they've gone through

don't understand why some people are sad or apply and the birthright executive order proposed by Trump\nOr the president is stupid 'cause ... executive order clarify law by\nMy understanding so why can't a president clarify what the actual author and he got or you guys talking about Jacob our intention in order to enforce the fact that the fourteenth amendment does not extend to aliens or people from a foreign nation giving birth in our nation\nWell the the executive order does not necessarily a clarify the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment it may attempt to but then beyond that the court challenge ultimately if it got a SCOTUS it would be the job of ...\nTo interpret that would be the right out of his ... it would be a good job of his lawyers to defend it but the secular border\nIn a self uh is an executive order to change what the immigration\nA law is right now under birthright citizenship the explanation would be in the ... that his lawyers would give where he would try to make that point of clarify in the original author would be in the actual right\nDown the actual court case so he could have branches interpretation of it is not the the final say now now if they ... as dairy pointed out\nThe president could write the executive order and if there were no challenge\n[laughter] that's a fantasy but if there were no challenge [laughter] than it would it would stand and it would be the law the land well yeah 'cause that was the question going on yesterday which I thought was a stupid question kind of president right an executive order to change the law and and what it hold on well yeah sure\nHe could write an executive order for him standing with it but I have no ability challenges yeah then yeah but it's going to study there'll be an injunction\nThe Justice Department maybe some input on the air and she's here to say that\nYou know let attempt to get this and at at least for the president I think it's it's a it's part of his his fight whether you want to put it just purely political or not it is part of the campaign promise from two thousand sixteen\nOn controlling the borders and I think it's worthwhile fight and then we're with him on that on the spirit of it and thank you for the call but ultimately\nIt is going to be about\nUh you know getting it to the Supreme Court to have that interpretation or ... or at least the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment if it got that far I don't ...\nI I don't I don't I don't believe it ever will but but still though when people say well he's just the she's just campaigning\nAndme\nOur air and it it will not doing it is part of the campaign promise from Saddam's not exceed that's my mind that that was where I Would do and exactly is the fact that well he's not campaigning\nI could see if you're upset saying he's just campaigning for example when you've got Democrats when you when you when you got to Claire McCaskill trying to paint herself as a Republican for just who happens to be running as a Democrat yeah now that's something you should complain about because she's not telling you the truth right when you when you have\nNow when you've got many Democrats trying to portray themselves as oh we're not part of those crazy Democrats I don't I don't know where we're very very moderate they've gone back to that that you should be upset about when you campaign\nBut Trump as president\nIs what he's always campaigned on and one of the reasons one of the major reasons is he got elected was illegal immigration\nAnd immigration issues across the board so anything that he does well he's doing it just to ah just to the campaign before the midterms well on the caravan thing\nThe only way you could make that point is if he financed the carrot\nMight it help his campaign yeah but it's what he's always run on and if he's consistent in his opinion why would anybody it buddy be upset about it or call it strictly campaigning strictly campaigning is what the Democrats are doing trying to pretend they're Republicans mhm right exactly that's a campaign in that you should be upset about\nBecause that would be an accident I the president clearly knows this is going to be an executive order like this is going to be immediately challenged and the court says he knows that so he is setting it up for the fight but it is also part of the positioning yet politically\nWell that's okay because it is not something based on nothing if it's not starting based on imagery\nIt's like with the Democrats have complained before the Republicans are only doing this vote here a as a campaign thing to get us all on record so we made up staying and remember that a couple of years ago right sorry ma'am staying and just not show up and may not vote at All right well of course it's all about campaigning it's all about winning\nOn the issue it's all about [noise]\nUh you know sometimes you have to be forced to tell people where you stay dry [noise] how dare you are you are the worst in us and tell us the first to tell the people where we stand [noise] that's that's definitely campaigning [noise] did you just enter the system that I live on\n\n\nBut the study claims that human compulsion to seek out animal companionship is one of the primary factors affecting our climate by the way the two idiots overnight told you this was coming along time ago Belgium we told you this would be next\nResearchers at the University of Sydney in Australia claim that those one hundred and sixty three million patch had made detrimental impact on the environment from the food they consume too the waste that they produce in the U.S there are more than one hundred and sixty three million dogs and cats that consume\nAs a significant portion of their diet animal products\nProclaims ... here the energy in animal derived product consumption of these pets in the United states is a value waited for the first time as are the environmental impacts from the animal products fed to them including Finkel production\nThe problem isn't just the United states now or just not the United states though the popularity of companion animals has grown worldwide Americans are the largest pet owners in the world and I don't mean that means we're the fattest pet owners are we on more pets probably both\nBut tradition of pet ownership in the United states has considerable cost as pet ownership increases in some developing countries\nEspecially China and trends continue in pet food toward higher content and quality of meat globally pet ownership ... compound the environmental impacts of human dietary choices it continues\nThere's only one solution no more pets\n...\nReducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar help an emotional benefits would considerably reduced those impact the study concludes\nOne of the things we're talking about is the fact getting rid of your dog and getting a rabbit because the dog eats meat and the rabbit ones or the or that chat okay settles yes so so what do we do with the dog\nWe supposed to put the dog down or\nJust after this dog not get another one hey I never search for a cat ... I rescued one it rescued you let's be clear by the way you're not the only person that said that to me this week yeah I think we all know that\nAh [laughter] and a\nAs a black cat just revised Halloween on Halloween you know the ...\nSmoke detector actually the smoke detector I thought it was the battery but smoke detector\nWent defective and it beeps after about ... oh yeah the toll is part of my house of course so I you know so it's like fourteen feet up but I got this incredible ladder wide base and everything else and\nSo I was like you know Tim Allen very excited to bring that latter route and really test its capabilities right so I get up there and realize okay this is in my I have a ... it's\nSort of an atrium it's my music studio ... where I got a little studio there piano all that stuff so but it's way up so I get up there take it off bring it down and realize it's not the battery so I order a new one on Amazon mhm\nTakes a couple of days so do I take down the ladder not leave the ladder to leave it might take it down yeah the letters there for a couple of days and I noticed that the cat black cat keeps walking under the ladder\nThought that is good luck so I figured it was all that stuff and I'm like ... should I be worried about yeah that's good luck thoughts I never had before yeah uh but uh there's only one solution no more pets reducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar helping emotional benefits would considerably reduced these impacts\nThe other choice researchers recommend is having your pets pets go vegetarian\nNope something that's not recommended by veterinarians are animal health and welfare experts who can see that having some type of meat based protein is best for your pets\nYes particular those for whose ancestors were carnivorous yeah I Can't get my cat to eat a carrot\nNo no\nI mean so uh are there you go the study of the researchers say isn't designed to dissuade animal lovers from taking the maximum number of pets possible yeah it is yeah [laughter] that's actually a point but to encourage Americans to consume less meat so that's the point are it I\nRight now I'm going to you both of them today\nI might have to go by a third one just because this article is making me hungry for meat\n[noise]\nMy favorite one remember this goes back ten years ago I think you and I ... the only been working together for a short time uh-huh remember the guy that came out that said that we need to get rid of all the cities in the United states right and we need to have said he has no bigger than\nTwenty five thousand people mhm and ... ... what was it was it over half of the people have to go\nYeah we'd all go to I think was more than half we're gonna have to take them somewhere what do you do with him I don't know like we have to [laughter] what do you do with and who decides who goes and and I think it was one of\nThe of the probably the closing in at that time seven billion people we only have like one right like ...\nWhat do you do it to me [laughter] what's what's your plan I they are just going to be the weirdest lottery you guys ever heard of but here's how it works [laughter] are you committing suicide first yeah right\nHey that'd be a cool ... movie right it's the end of the planet we're down to what ten years\nJust some kind of doomsday whatever climate suicide well it wouldn't be climate base 'cause that would just be well then you'd have Hollywood would never make a movie where let's just say\nYou know the big chunks of ice just start falling out of the sky or that the water rises in Manhattan over a period of three hours and then freezes over the period of ten minutes that would just be a stupid movie\nOr it would be called the day after tomorrow um [laughter] that's not making about climate change this time about whatever\nRight but if we could whittle it down to\nThe ... of years you know because you got ten years or Fifteen Years to figure it out\nTo got to figure out how to deplete the population [laughter]\nI don't remember [laughter] remember Star Trek didn't remember how the the two forces are the two societies on the one planet right war with each other and instead of going to war and they simply killed people on both sides okay we're going to kill a thousand people that are you kill a thousand\nUm they like managed war and then there was the other one remember all the people that were like plastered up against the wall hot and the ... member that one yeah\nI don't they were they open the window and they're like all these faces on the wall like writing 'cause society had grown so much and I don't know how would they ever solve that problem yeah\nI don't remember that one of the one of the most interesting post apocalyptic type movies was children of men Clive Owen two thousand six\nAh I haven't seen it was about essentially a the there was women could not give birth there was whatever happened in the apocalypse they no longer had the ability to give birth and then all the all of a sudden they came across this woman who was pregnant\nSo you had to they had to hide her because all governments would want you know to a study this woman and then you know all of this and\nAnd they just wanted to protect her and her baby so she kind of went underground so they could protect her but I mean that kinda gets into that area right of a population that basically is lessening not in the crazy believe that the Democrats\nOr talking to these far out far left liberals are talking about\nAnd did in the past of depleting the population but just kind of a ...\nAnd it's a global thing right\nI mean there were ... it's it's not that it would be one of those those questions almost like a Sophie's Choice I mean they did it in deep impact yeah\nOh yeah that was very clear that that are Well Bruce Willis uh you know ...\n... yeah it's got it's got to take one for the ...

birthright citizenship and immediately a discussion on the fourteenth amendment ensued uh we heard things like the president can't change the law with an executive order or Kenny change it was also put in the\nQuestion form of course she ... ... if nobody challenges that but it was very it would it be immediately challenged and we went and we spent [noise] a significant amount of time on the show talking about it\nUh you know the president may do it he may not do it\nYou know we we we may never see it but if he does you're not going to see a change and immediately be it will immediately be addressed\nA by opposition groups or will be a lawsuit will be filed the right injunction within a couple of hours after the president has has has done it and I don't think that we would see a change in our lifetime for on the tracks here's your forecast\nIs a line of showers and thunderstorms today extending from Detroit down to Texas and we're going to see this line of showers continue to progress eastward slowly today as the front becomes more pronounced will see the showers extend into Dallas in central Texas\nWith some heavy thunderstorms likely for the architects today\nAnd the same band of showers will then move up through portions of Missouri southern Illinois central Indiana and northern Ohio to include Detroit and areas of northern New York Georgia and the Carolinas will be dry today but tomorrow will pick up shower some of the system\nThe Atlantic seaboard including the mid Atlantic and northeast will remain dry today but showers expected by tomorrow and into friday\nNational Weather forecasts from wrote a radio I'm meteorologists John trout thanks so much John eight six six\n\n\n... and ...\nAnd again the language of the executive order will be will be everything [noise] um but I Will not that they will not go without a ... it will not go without him an ... an immediate challenge in fact that's going to happen right\nNow you'll have an injunction book if he if he puts it out at nine AM there'll be an injunction by that afternoon by by a federal judge I guess\nThat we're starting to court and and I don't believe here's here's the other thing to this it could take years just to get through the federal court system before it ever got to the Supreme Court mhm it if it went anywhere even if it went through the entire system because they're not going to fast track it it's not like\nThe emergency that the executive branch was saying you need to fast track this because it's about national security right now and terrorists coming in\nBecause it would have essentially a move like this effectively would would um be about future lives future children right it would not be retroactive in in nature would not have any kind of grandfather ring a powers\nOr so at that point then you look at\nThe uh the interpretation\nAnd what I'm what I Would be interested to see is is if\nThe citizenship clause is mentioned in the executive order as the basis of it\nBecause if that because of the language the language will mean everything in the court battles obviously so even if it doesn't get to the Supreme Court there's gonna be a very a good discussion\nAbout it over the years yeah we should just ah just to the president because of\nA past attempts to put through an executive order ... don't have the first draft of the first executive order be get rid of the fourteenth amendment right okay yeah no ... be specific for the part that well but you're going to have to I think you're going to also have to have a\nEssentially\nAn interpretation of that citizenship clause yes of the fourteenth amendment as as the basis of it in the actual language of the executive order because if you do that what you're doing at that point is bringing up the discussion again that doesn't mean that the Supreme Court is even going to hear it\nBut it it if it's the basis of the order then it gets straight to the point in the courts regardless of how it goes in the courts\nAnd I think that would be that would certainly be my advice is she right so you have to you have to tailor the executive order\nA in a particular way and then when you go to court ... you've got to be very specific I think that you know 'cause you're not trying to change the fourteenth amendment\nKnow what I was trying to ...\n... what you're trying to do is you're focusing in right on only mhm\nIt's possible to get to that particular point that you believe is a weak interpretation\nA of it ... and still is going to be a tough sell to get through mhm right so and I don't know if they're you know again this is something that we dragged to the courts for years because I don't I don't believe there's any chance of it being fast tracked\nAnd and so this could sit in the course for years yeah the travel ban had an immediate threat right a attach itself the basis I I don't know if he wants I don't know if the president with with all the other things that are going out an immigration that he can\nWithout question when and probably wins sooner especially ... when it comes to legislation if they're able to keep the house right\nOr that he would ah that he would want to spend the time and energy on the sea might I mean they might I don't I don't I don't do you get\nSupport ... remember when we had the influx of children coming across the border uh years ago a few years ago\nAnd you had people in the inner cities that were saying ah listen I mean Obama was president but they were outraged that we were spending so much public money\nOn on deporting those children in housing those children remember we are putting them in schools that was during the summer months we were putting them in schools and in other locations\nAnd so there were people that were outraged over that basically they're point was uh the government shouldn't be spending money on on on children who eventually will be sent back home\nIt should be spent on my children\nWho are American citizens they they're the same support for the current president in terms of okay wait a minute let's have the discussion I on on I'm I'm ... alien parents given birth to citizens and the U.S I'm I'm trying to think if I've seen a\nAgain it's just something he said in an interview\nA could have been something he blurted out and then the news cycle changes today and we never hear about it again and I looked at the question yesterday I was on the golf course when I started burst out laughing was can can Trump right an executive order that becomes law no we can't and I burst out laughing at the ... of course he can\nIf nobody challenges it ... nobody challenges an executive order but somebody's going to challenge it and it's like well that's not the point to the point is if you're going to disgusted let's talk about the original intent of the of the fourteenth amendment as we spend a lotta time doing ah earlier on the show\nSo what do you dress up or a you know for Halloween

this again well because it\nIs serious because for me is unique\nPeople listening to the show on a regular basis\nKnows I don't have a lot of empathy towards the president I appreciate his job I appreciate the work load I appreciate the fact I Would never want his job no and I would never want his workload I appreciate the fact that when you are on top\nEverybody below you hates you they may not say it\nThey don't understand why they're not in your position everybody always thinks their job is the toughest their job is the most unique and you do nothing\nSure well guess what that's not true no no it's not and yesterday\nAt these funerals in Pittsburgh I felt empathy towards the president and I'll tell you why because I I I could see it in the movements and I've watched some of the ceremonies that I could watch\nHe was really being shunned at a funeral\nI mean think about the fact that there were people protesting the fact that you came to mourn someone's death\nThere is no respect ... anyone or any of this is my ... my ran so you want to do and that's fine okay okay ... what I Want a holiday that I felt bad for him yesterday because\nOnce again I don't believe that you want to become president of the United states\nSo that you can read everything that we've done around here in the past two hundred and fifty years I don't believe that I don't believe his ideas his concepts his way of doing business may vary from mine but I Know everybody that I've ever known in my life\nWho was a bully OK had\nTimes when I felt bad for them when I felt empathy towards them because they paint themselves into a corner of loneliness and despair that I Will never have to Wade through to think that this man fluids\nYeah okay and that he was booed and protested and everything else I think is a step too far and shows the instability of the people who oppose him\nThat they suffer from the same in civility problems that he is accused of having\nOkay I'm not saying that it's not warranted in some cases I'm not saying that sometimes\nLike the situation with the caravan and everything like that he seems insensitive I'm going to put troops up an stop these people from coming here he's not doing that because he hates you as an American he believes\nIn his heart of hearts that it's the right thing to do\nAnd because of that I may agree with it and I do on that one\nVote or I may disagree with it and think oh everybody should just come by for the party\nOkay and I felt\nGenuinely bad for the man yesterday because I don't think he's evil I don't think he's the anti Christ I don't think that he's trying to mess up your life or mine I Believe that everything that he says and he does in his own way he believes\nAnd sometimes I feel bad\nFor that because sometimes I think he's just dead wrong and sometimes I think he's just dead right\nAnd\nIs a somber occasion\nNobody no matter how much you have this president and there are people out there who just bias and don't get me wrong no matter how much you might disliked\nYou would protest to make you just as bad as anybody on the other side now once again that's rather a backhanded\nCompliment but nevertheless I think that it's unfair for either side always think the other side is wrong\n\nOnce again all those old adage just come into play even blinds or all find genetic or even you know\nEvery bad person\nIn the world still has something that triggers their good side\nAnd I felt that\nThis was out on the line yesterday\nI thought it was a big statement\nRegarding our culture and where we are right now as a nation\nUm\nAnd and I know that whole a whole since the whole day of the honoring of those people who were brutally murdered\nYeah and to have people that are now since you disagree with the president but\nThe African testing and creating that creating an environment around those deaths beyond those it could have been left for another day we're rod right and this this state [noise]\nBetter\nOn the other hand spending that money for research when a could have down the road save someone's life or thanks to the science and they're the experiments done and you deal\nWith thousands of things every day that were developed through the auspices of the space program tour your computerized computer that one phone mhm television\nCommunications tell STAR One and all those things that's how they got started kept were also showed\nThis is amazing when you look at the sky next time realize that when the the fifty percent of the stars that are visible in the sky mhm okay and us being out in the desert where it's fairly dark and there's not a lot of\nStreet light interference and things like that that we can probably count what a thousand stars in the sky I gosh I\nNumber yeah OK out of those thousand stars at least twenty percent\nAnd maybe as many as fifty percent of the stars are sons to another solar area another group of planets\nSo when you look into star there's one in five chance that there's multiple planets circling around it and it couldn't be much as every other star you see has planets circling allow around it\nSome of them will have water some of them will have hydrogen some of them yes folks I'm afraid so you are not the only living creatures in this vast universe\nBut here are just a couple of the things that the couple of the benefits that we got from the ...

something that certainly helps everyone scratch resistant or eye glass lens\nAll of this one ... those are just some this thing looks like a flying oil camp okay that's what it looks like I mean that's all you can say on top of a bomb and then nine and a half years it discovered twenty six hundred planets now if it discovered a planet\nIt also meant that there were probably well from what we've seen most solar systems if they're like our own\nHas nine or ten planets\nSo it could have found thirty six thousand planets in a way mhm and we're worried about getting to the one closest to us

that's a gutsy thing to say\nNow have to say it does it does yes absolutely that is not a bad thing I'm saying that there are most people in our country who would fall prey to that type of ... yes no matter who the president is if you voted for him if he voted against him\nIf you hate everything he's done or love everything he's done\nAnd another thing don't feel bad\nBecause you that's the key

I don't know how she thought she\nWell and you know what here here's something else to it so revealing that people do not know history she had no idea about what black face means in this country\nRight I thought it was perfectly fine isn't it funny that people trip on their own ... because she really I'm sure she did this innocently I saw the ... times\nI don't think she was smart and not even know how insulting she was the people not not even a clue and\nShe was hired by one of the major networks in this country given millions and millions of dollars because they thought she had star quality\nThey thought she could bring her audience with her from the other network yeah but the her audience on the other network as a pittance to the audience that they needed NBC to be successful you don't just walk into things\nAnd she said no body a note talent and not only is she has been but she is a never was so you know what ... yesterday I have to give her ... credit what does her claim to fame\nShe was very popular she had a very strong fan base\nOver at Fox when she had an opinion show and ah I don't know she she's a pretty lady\nA what the lineup was an evening because she was on right around dinner time depending on what you're going to the right now you live under the sun and that could have been it to a dig at Hannity has are primarily male audience\nA which is coveted I'm a that age group of and that's that gender remote wait let me finish\nA Megan Kelly was in a spot and I believe Bill O'Reilly came in after so that's how\nCome after she came before or after him I meant in the line up your ... in the ... that's what I said in the daily line up not her getting to them that was already gone when she came on the network which network Fox I Know ... actually no no no\nThere's three main people after dinner or the dinner hour was Hannity her and Bill O'Reilly\nOkay I'm not\nGoing to argue that came out and I think NBC I Do remember reading that they would hope that she would she had a built in audience that they were hoping would follow her over to NBC\nOkay fine they were wrong completely an orderly Robbie asleep so that's all I'm saying I I don't think she ever\nI think you have to pay a price to be a good news person and I don't see any price that she paid Walter Cronkite\n... made reports in World War two out of a helicopter okay Dan Rather reported the assassination of of John Kennedy OK Frank muggy set in the shooting of Reagan\nAbout the shooting of Brady was get the store or whatever that situation was when Brady was shot let's get the situation right on ABC News ... when they said he was dead I always thought earning your bones I don't think\nNews anchor chair I always thought however it does it's I'm wrong on this but that was always the most coveted seats\nOn air and in the journal I agree with your situation but I don't think she was ever a name or have to earn I don't think she was ever an anchor\nI don't think that she's qualified news person in any way shape or form but you know what she did yesterday afternoon God you're hired because she stunk at her job and she is sold said Eighteen percent of the American people\nI I don't know okay she blamed the Fox said they had a conspiracy against terror and from the day that she set foot in the NBC and the third Iraq they were out to get her and ruined her career now do you believe that on one second\nNow I don't watch a those network morning shows I watch prices right I Believe in some markets she was on up against prices right wildly\nHumor is on the today show was on from eight or nine oh\nOkay okay you know the today show so I'm usually watching another network at that time but you just don't step into a network or time slot and expect people to come to you do you think Fox care about making Kelly the day after she left you know I don't think so yeah there were rod and re and this is a break your\nOkay sorry I was gonna say it's tough because you know Bill Cosby when people ask me who my favorite comedians are Bill Cosby and master long form storytelling and and he was the guy for that it was also the guy for clean humor for very long time as well and\nUh you can't say that any more how dare you say that that name any\nAnd the the standards by which everyone has to follow a or have their careers trashed and and one of those rules as you know you can't say that you like Bill Cosby's work or even though he ended up being a terrible person\nDoesn't it seem as though oh ... ... does does it not seem as though people are completely fine was being defined as one thing\nAnd that falls into the bill Cosby thing whereas yes his work was really funny and as you said he long long form storytelling and also that he was clean about it funny he's funny\nBut um it it seems like people are completely fine with being defined is one thing and one thing only as opposed to having many many sides\nOh yeah no I I I think a lot of people and and a lot of times it's that they want to play a victim you know suddenly you know um and I know that there were actual victims but what's what's really taking away from the messaging and what's taking away from a lot of ah\nActual problems in the country is that normal human beings I hate to get going back to it can go on line now and say that they're a victim merely because someone that something and that that takes away from the actual problems and actual victims in this country right\nNow who who are so you like Cosby obviously a George Carlin would come to mind and that group but we've had comics that had been one trick pony he's a guy who's like Kenny Young men are Rodney Dangerfield or guys but I mean you know guys who made careers\nJust talking about their wives are women that have made careers just talking about their husband fang like of a ... or something\nYeah you know and it's people always ask me if I if I still like a live comedy and I don't because\nStick to what someone's gonna say by looking at them help healthier and make something like that but you know like a a fat comical make jokes about being fat and hide behind a microphone and say oh you can't see me um you know women always complain about dating and and men or men are are are always you know\nI'm making comments about you know like the same like the difference between men and women it's it's the same stuff over and over and over again because I think there's I mean I hate to say there's only a limited amount of things you can make fun of the world\nUh except for politics because you can always make fun of stupid people\n[laughter] I you know I Can't disagree we absolutely love Lewis Black do you have any particular favorites\nWhile he was he's not bad you know I\nI hate to say it because a lot of people always like stumped me when I say this on the right is in particular but you know John Stewart really master the making one of the news um you know he he I thought he was pretty balanced\nFor being in a admitted that he leaned left a but he wasn't carrying a as many talking points as the current host of the Daily Show and then you have a folks like Jerry Seinfeld and uh one of my favorite because he wasn't necessarily a comedian as much as ... which is a a kind of more like a performance artist was anti cough and who

feel like we're watching these images of thousands of people trying to get in our country and he didn't calculate that he's just talking about it and it's resonating with his better so\nI Want you to

say that because of the direction of the leadership and the rhetoric that's being spoken\nThat you have people that are already crazy and so then it's just taking them off the deep end and they think it's normal I'm like why they are crazy you can't you can't kill someone unless you have something wrong up here\nYou just can't to protect someone's life\nWho would ever want to walk into a synagogue where you have innocent people eleven people and just gunned them down you don't do that this guy's crazy he's evil it is evil that is what evil looks like an evil exists and this guy had with hated

there his son in law works there\nI'm at the White House he has these beautiful grandchildren they're Jewish I just don't the president has supported them he doesn't care about that he's not anti Semitic it didn't stop this\nWe have a problem and we have a president who doesn't seem to believe has a role to play is dealing with it and we put specific responsibility on the president I think what he's done\n'em over the course of the last few years is helpful met this epicenter and unapologetically incendiary president on travelling by traditional norms of civility\nOkay so if you listen I'm not blaming anyone other than the person who pulled the trigger and who did this that crazy guy I'm In uh in everyone's angry at him for doing that\nBut if the if the left wants to blame the president are they okay with Maxine Waters saying what she said are they okay with Eric Holder saying what he says are they okay with Hillary Clinton saying there's going to be no civility unless her party\nThe president they gotta blame their party to\nSo ... and the New York times is these shows exactly why the president's so upset that President really upset because she cannot believe he's being blamed for this cut thirty for\nReality is that he has a ... in six days now they can be very difficult for him a heading into next year for Republicans lists control of the house and I think the feeling that pressure like ...\n[noise] feeling pressure possibly but no more pressure then George Bush felt when he lost the house no more pressure than Brock Obama when he lost everything that

without seeing everything just all these negative articles I don't know how they survive I don't know how they\nWere talking about president of the United states if you Google are named Jay uplifting\nThey hate us just don't do it but my point is that the the left hates him so much they attack they attack they attack and what would be frustrating\nIf you believe the president of United States when he says it's fake news how frustrating would it be when you say one thing and you know your heart and you know your mind and you know what you're the meaning of your words are and then they construe it to mean something\nIn the ... you would handle it you would say so I could I'm very upset about the way I've been portrayed on a different areas of the media here's what I think\nBut you're not Donald Trump it I'm not Donald Trump Dutch way maybe I Would add to it and he comes out and says you're the prop I'm not the problem you're the problem so then these people say well we're not as though you're not ... not only is he not contrite\nNow that he's attacking me so then they doubled down I watched a panel last night I stay up late to do more to talk\nAnd the five people in the penalty all hated Donald Trump el almost as much as the host so\nWhat how does that very thing that people love about him other people hate about him and not the fact that he's a fighter and the country I think a lot of people in middle America and voted for him that the Trump supporters they like the fact that he fights back they might say I don't like that he says one thing or this thing called the girl that's\nBut ultimately they like how he fight back because they're tired of watching them era the with vacation in America and I think he stands for something bigger and he's a fighter and that very quality a lot of other people don't like because they don't think he's as presidential but our country got here because I think his base feels like\nThe country was getting weaker and weaker and more global and more global and he fights for the country\nAs hard of a larger national offered to rejoice divides and bring people together\nThe media also has a responsibility to set a civil and stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do\nSomething wrong with that so they could do the false attacks ridiculous you know what

I. B. acts in little falls New York Tom\nA TRACON center to take a powered who wrote that phrase and they amendment is quoted as saying this will not of course include person born in the United states who are foreigners that's pretty clear\nA explanation\nThat people who are foreigners have their children born here should not well have citizenship\nTom so you're just back on track to cause I'm not a cost\nThat was ratified a said that it did not include foreigners\nI tried the exact quotation I have is this will not of course include person born in the United states who are foreigners and I got from a website called [noise]\nColorado alliance for immigration reform they'd be on all kinds of quotations\nAnd examples and how people all of a sudden started ignoring not praise\nTom thank you really you really helping the show and now the update you the president just tweeted this\nSo called birthright citizenship which costs to our country billions of dollars and it's very unfair our citizens will be ended one way or another it is not covered by the fourteenth amendment because of the word subject to the jurisdiction there of\nMany legal scholars agree Harry Reid was right in Nineteen Ninety three before he and the Democrats went insane and started with the open borders which brings massive crime stuff\nDon't forget the nasty term anchor babies I Will keep our country safe the case will be settled by the United States Supreme\nCourt [noise] it's not a crazy argument it's a legitimate one honest people can differ and you don't have to hate the person or labeled a person who we come back\nKarl Rove on this debate and of course keep your calls coming [noise]\n\n[noise] I talked to one of those points of an ... I'm going to teach me the station [noise]\nWell ... ... ...\nYeah yeah he could do a lot of good and you can do not\nSo much good it really depends on how he handles\nHimself in what he says look the president was at a high point last week\nAnd then the uh the I eat these being sent to Democrats and then there was this anti Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh\nOr hurt the president's ratings because of the way that he responded a he said the right things at times and he said some things that rubbed people raw and I can see it in the data it's affecting people around the country this is an election is going to be over so very close\nBack up to where they were like Tuesday or Wednesday of last week that Republicans are going to do better than if they stay where they are because there has been a slight diminution other presidents standing largely because of his responses to these events\nWas ... was his response to the other day right so he's response is one thing I Do is scripted and they were fine but when he started when he looked at the television I Know George Bush really never did when he moved to cable news and so I was being ripped him blamed he went back out and\nDo you think he will be how do you think it was he was being fairly treated windows IDs or whatever you want to call them went to his enemies by that deranged character living in a band in Florida do you think he was being a a adequately characterized\nOh no no I think it was being unfairly characterized the question is how to respond to respond by taking it to buy for going after your critics or do you rise above it\nAnd cause people to say well you know what I hear what I hear what Schumer and Pelosi you're saying but I see what the president saying when he goes on television and I I hear what the critics on CNN and MSNBC and other places have the say blaming him about it but he seems to be focused on\nConsoling the victims and setting the right tone so it's the contrast that people ... derive in their own minds\nRather than necessarily he what he has to say look people you know he's the president when he punches down at the media he is he is the most powerful person in the world and he is\nPicking an argument with ... with somebody who has a lousy ratings on cable TV\nSo I Would much rather have him be the person that we saw at that rally in Wisconsin who spoke so eloquently about what was going on the the president who called for unity\nThe man who raised the tone I'd rather see that and I think the persuadable voters voters who are up for grabs in this very close election they want to see that person rather than the ...\nBut the list of targets was right on a Trump's relentless rhetorical play book the bombers enemies where his enemies he has said so again and again and again\nEverybody should stop pretending that Trump doesn't really know what he's doing\nUm ... when he when he says these things he knows exactly what he's trying to encourage\nDonald Trump failed the country he doesn't just failed Democrats he felt Democrats and Republicans and all of them all Americans in between\nHe's review you in any way acknowledge what role his rhetoric may have played in cultivating the current political climate president has an obligation to stop picking on reporter the president has created a culture of comfort\nFor violent rhetoric and an actual violence\nAnd this isn't a boy Ghana point I've been watching some of it there's four people for all have the same view he's horrific responsible and he basically everything's a pulled the trigger\nDeath the let's let's let's look at a thought experiment here\nLet's turn the clock back a year and let's substitute the word Bernie Sanders or the Democratic resistance or Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer for it and have those people say the same things about the Bernie Sanders supporter who shows up at the Republican congressional baseball practice with weapons and bullets\nAnd it listed his pocket and kill and almost killed ... and if it were not for the accidental presence of to a Capitol Hill police who who accompanied squeezed as a member of the leadership\nWe could have seen a dozen or more Republican legislators are assassinated the up and and and could Eddie one of those people did any one of those people said Bernie Sanders or Nancy Pelosi or the resistance or Tom star in with their hateful language about the president and then\nYou know it Clapper call it was a Clapper or somebody else rented\nGives him of treason Brennan what what did anybody step forward out of that group and\nUp and trying to kill Republican members of Congress plays for God's sake put our country first stop this\nI agree I I was done by the president got just as bad to be better if you had to do that if someone like you actually do that exactly especially somebody\nThat's not all lean on him but somebody who's calling balls and strikes like you to be honest so called a couple of things that he's going to go over some major regions it surprised me first off why is Mia Love struggling in a in Utah\nWell first of all this is the most democratic district in the state it includes the city of Salt Lake people think of Utah as a conservative state and it is but the city of Salt Lake um I grew up part of my childhood in Utah that if you're a liberal you live in the city of Salt Lake\nOr and so it's ... it is the most democratic district and second she's never been affected fundraiser so she's got a she's got a I'm a former mayor or who's capable of raising money\nThen Nick Adams struggled there\nYeah and she's and she is she struggled but it's it is the most democratic district and in the year like this hum and remember we have a weird thing going on in the Mormons the Mormons are conservative by nature but they also have a certain set of\nStandards decorum if you will that they expect of their elected officials that's why Donald Trump brand so poorly and\nIn Nevada actually in Utah and and a third party candidate got a significant sluggish votes from nominal Republicans who said I Can't support the president's personal behavior so I think she's okay at the end in part because it's it's it's Mitt Romney time in in Utah but she is she's in a\nBigger reason people expect to get\nRight now the last poll hazard down by six we defined stunning we'll see what that goes by the way that has a lot to do with why a flake in Ann Romney for the most part can't stomach him a and even though Romney says yo suck it up and go along when he can ah we\nI don't think so uh reticent is running a very smart campaign they're attacking Marcia unfairly here at the end\nUp but um you know she's she's she's made some you know she is irritated some of her fellow Republicans over the years in the state I don't think it's over I think she wins I'm involved in a superPAC that spending a vast sums of money to help get her and\nSenate leadership on some watching the race closely we've got to continue to execute\nThey've got to continue to execute up the question is going to be our suburban Republicans in the Nashville area going to a going to turn out to vote and vote for Bredesen\nOr are they going to stay with their party and vote Republican and then our she's got a a an awkward\nRelationship over in the western part of the state with the Shelby County Republicans and are they going to turn out in the numbers that need to I think at the end of the day this state is the president's approval rating is pretty darn good in the state and I think at the end of the day they pick her but I don't think it's over\nOkay uh the ... has her up fifty one forty six we'll see how that goes now the biggest mystery to me what's going on in Arizona\nHow could more than ... judging by what is the fighter pilot in the first female in the me too movement a Republican looking to replace Jeff Flake\nAggressively campaigning why she wrestling against Christian sooner in the last poll she's trailing by two or three points and yet she is come on strong and send them has been exposed to somebody pretending to be a moderate who isn't who's like story is not holding up\nYou know we'll send them a has worked the last five or six years to convince the Phoenix business community that she is a business moderate and uh she's joined the blue Dog Democrats she said the right things she hasn't voted right that much\nShe said the right things and she has cultivated that crowd and she comes from Phoenix which is where most of the voters are [noise] and uh and ...\nEarly vote as of last night four hundred and sixty four thousand four hundred and Ninety One Republicans had voted early versus three hundred and fifty six thousand Democrats and two hundred and fifty two thousand independent\nOther party voters that's actually as a Sunday night this represents a increase in the GOP chair of the turnout versus twenty sixty three point five seven points at a democratic decline\nOf almost two points so it's a five and a half point swing towards Republicans in the state that they want and twenty six\nTeam by three and a half so that's good news for ... as long as that includes ...

like the Democrats do all the time telling you that that if you voted one way your entire life you have to continue that you have the opportunity to vote any way you want in this country and like you just pointed out there are real results for the with this president it's not just promises made it his promises kept as well\nAnd he's delivering results for the American people all across\nImpact from Donald Trump and I think people are realizing and I give a great credit to people like Candace Owens\nWho is out there on the forefront saying listen just because you voted Democrat your whole

Republican you can vote for Donald Trump ... it's really exciting to see what's happening out there and I I'm so proud of him I'm so proud of\nWhat he's done and and it's funny because people in twenty sixteen voted for him and they had all of this hope that he would do the things that he said and now he's doing them and and it's very exciting to see a president who actually does what he says he's going to do um I think he's doing a great job\nAnd it's this idea of returning to what Reagan wanted which was a big tent Republican Party and President Trump is doing that he's saying hey you know what everybody has a place here I'm In in the Republican Party and and we're going to we're going to embrace you\nUm I I Want to ask you a quick about the campaign trail I Know you're in Michigan a couple of days ago you were in in the state of Georgia what are people talking about out there on the campaign trail\n[noise] well I think it's the reality is that everybody wants to talk to me about the president and they always say please tell them thank you and I always say if you want to thank him vote for Republicans in the midterms but um people are are just very appreciative uh generally when they come up to me\nFor mostly for what they know is a sacrifice for this president the fact that he gets attacked every single day that he has so much working against him and they say it for our entire family but really nobody bears\nThe load that the president does um and I think people realize that his life would probably be a lot easier right now if he weren't the president\nOr he could have retired and been playing golf instilled than you know loved by the media and Hollywood like he was before all of this but instead he\nLoves his country and knew that he could turn this country around and I'm Still shocked by the number of people that come up to me and say I never voted in my entire life these are you know eighty year old people I never voted once I voted for the first time and twenty sixteen for President Trump\nI'm voting in the midterms or I voted Democrat my entire life and now I voted\nOn I'm going to vote Republican I'm and I think you're right the the Republican Party is open to anyone we welcome everyone you know what if you didn't vote for the president and twenty sixteen you can change your mind you can vote for Republicans now we want everybody to feel welcome and the Republican Party and as a Trump supporter\nOr we don't turn anyone away so so come on over it's it's a great place to be because you know that you are fighting on the right side of history\nWell you're absolutely right there you are you guys having a good time out there on the campaign trail and it was what are you having fun\nOh my gosh yeah listen it's it's so rewarding to get out there and hear from people about\nHow their lives have changed in a positive way thanks to this president 'cause I Know it felt like we all fought a war in twenty sixteen that was the first battle we're still battling now the war is still going on but to know that\nIt was worth it because this president is doing such good for this country to hear from people directly and know that that their lives are being impacted in such a great way by the changes that this president has made in this country it's it's so rewarding you're right it's it's\nA little hard and we have a Thirteen month old son and a two dogs to hopefully remember I saw at the end of this whole thing um and Eric and I are generally not\nTogether out there because we want to divide and conquer but it's

happening in your neighborhood your communities are people getting fired up about the elections and I wonder what is it that people are voting for on\nElection day is there a specific issue or that ah that that's all the minds of voters in your neck of the woods so here's the telephone numbers\nIs Todd Stearns dot com and there's all sorts of stuff for you to see there and um yeah you could probably get in trouble on the Web site too that's that's possible I Do that every now and again we'll look in Studio very excited to have our good friend Bob you get back to a welcome sir and while you are I'm\nYour terrifying the Democrats you're like the Freddie Krueger I mean for the Democrats over there well\nWhen you're running against the Roy Moore of the Democratic party it's time for change we're so energized that the polls are going away and ah [noise] the enthusiasm is cleared\nGo ahead I'm Sorry I'm not just say to your question about what people are voting for what what's an energizing on next Tuesday in New Jersey seem so clear to me that\nPeople have gotten sort of hopeless that there's never going to be a turnaround in terms of the affordability the state and we're hearing these last few weeks are saying oh my God we really have a chance to restore honor and integrity but also\nHave someone who's going to work for us to make sure we get value out of government and get something in return for we're paying because we pay such high property taxes\nSales tax income tax and Jersey so affordability is the number one issue would hope and do something different is what really energizing New Jersey today\nIt's also Halloween Bob and you know we asked Lara Trump but we had her own and the last segment and we asked her what kind of candy they serve the boys and girls over at Trump Tower and they've got some pretty good they've got some pretty good ... over I betcha\nYou see I thought they were I thought it was going to be like a diving chocolates but she says no they're they don't do that that's too high brow so they're like Reese's peanut butter cup since ...\nI tell you I was in a great Halloween parade in a in a wonderful New Jersey city Medford or Bedford New Jersey the other day we did a parade and we were giving out candy on the float as we were walking in this a mile long parade and I have to be honest with you we had ... and we had all kinds of other candies\nBut the reason is peanut butter cup I had to put a few extra my pocket as I was passing them out to the kids is pretty ... pretty darn good stuff\nIt's Wednesday is only one who agreed to try that one of the south Jersey senator has noticed or who had one and I think it came out clear that he he you could see who he was in a while I was at the base whoever we finally had a debate\nSo yet another reason to vote Republican are you folks in New Jersey and Bob doses is Halloween candy it's not like you're going to get granola or like you know something you know fruit from the Democrats\nNow in Halloween is such a great holiday for kids and and that parade and other events I've been on Halloween it's just really get a chance to see families together and that's one of the problems in New Jersey are tax structure and our government or trying to raise taxes recruit spending is tearing families apart\nThey're like really hard on the line and your vote is crucial on

nine nine one zero\nLet's go to Atlanta Georgia Jacob is on the phone Jacob what's on your mind today\nHey thanks for having me just want to say that Ninety five percent of the talk with friends family and co workers about politics revolves around the issue of immigration that's\nWhat I'm hearing people are afraid of these people coming across our borders and they're not by the media narrative that Donald Trump is on the devices they see him as the ...\nYou know Jacob I have to imagine when folks are you know watching a you know Fox five in Atlanta and they see the images of that that that large group of people coming up from Honduras waving the Honduran flags that looks like it invasion force I think to the average a Georgian\nOr the New Mexico border where the Texas border they're coming into our backyard and that is not something that we're OK with\nHey by the way Jacob ... this story is up on the Drudge Report Oprah is in your state or she's going to be campaigning for Stacey Abrams\nWell I'm a union employee and the union has put their support behind Stacey Abrams and I can say none of my co workers that I that I you know spend time with a are buying and so that we all think she's a photo that job\nWith that yes that's a pretty good that's that's a pretty good observation their Jacob ... you're listening to the program thanks for calling in let's go to Charlotte North Carolina John welcome to the show John\nHey thanks for having me sure\nUm hey so I was calling in I actually uh was it an Obama voter I'm a millennial so um you know [laughter] and I uh recently have been talking to some of my friends who are also Obama voters and independence or millennials and the thing that's really gotten us is just how um\nWe're just sick of the outrage culture of the Democratic party that everything that happens is the newest latest outrage 'em\nAnd all my friends that I've been talking to that are the independent a cast of I'm about ... voters including myself are voting Republican in this mid term even though I've never really voted in the mid term before or just because we're so sick of it and it culminated with the Kavanaugh hearing really for me\nSo John ... so you how well first of all let let's back up a little bit you said you're a millennial how old are you a John\nI'm thirty four\nAll right so yeah you're you're right you're right there on the uh the far end of the uh the millennial spectrum I'm Rick ... why was it that was it was there one thing that really convinced you to say you know what that's it we're done with the Democrats\nIt was really honestly um I think it really was the cabin on hearing it was just you had I mean I'm sure you've I I'm just started listening to your ...\nObviously politically motivated so I think for me and a couple of other friends that um I've been talking to now these are all all guy friends um but my girlfriend also was voting voting Republican because of that as well so I think that it it reaches across both genders who wouldn't you realize that there's you know zero evidence behind this and and it was really guilty\nUntil proven innocent you know for the Democrats at least\nIn job when you look at what has happened to this country just on not just under the control Democrats but what's been happening at the university systems with the micro aggressions and the the safe spaces and\nNow the cultural appropriation there are a half a dozen stories on Drudge Report right now about people getting in trouble for wearing a Halloween costume that offends people let's see I think you're right we're in this\nUh this culture where everything is offensive\nYeah yeah no I I saw it I went to a Wake Forest university which is a more conservative university but I remember I had a professor there who was a communist and I wrote a paper a pro calculus and he he gave me a really bad grades I Do remember that and it's it's probably gotten worse since I was in college you know graduated oh seven\nWhat what is it that that that attracts you to to the Republican side of things what do you like about Republicans\nWell I mean obviously the economy um has been great uh you know I'm a ... a small business owner I Do property management and real estate and it's been it's been booming but you know honestly I think it's it's more so just that I'm a ... like you said the cultural appropriation and\nThe political correctness and just everything being an outrage you know has really turned me off to to the Democrats more so than\nThan more attracted to the Republican just been turned off by Democrats\nNow now John you said your your your new to the show and and we are honored to have you ah as a listener but I Want to tell you that we are we're mighty conservative here but I Am a free speech purist and one of the things that really concerns me\nIn any kind of speech that that someone might be offended by and that troubles me because that's going to put us in a very difficult spot where you're going to have government agencies one day deciding what is and what is not hate speech and so we're pretty passionate about that and I hear your on this radio program\nYeah no absolutely like that I uh I was talking to a friend recently and he's like you know I thought liberals are the most tolerant and now they're supposed to be the most tolerant and now they become the most intolerant of any form of a speech that they don't agree with you know so it's just it's getting a little ridiculous\nAnd I want to shape go ahead I'm Sorry John appreciate your show appreciate your show well John ... well\nThank you for saying that welcome to the fold and we're happy to be conservative here where I'm not a registered Republican I'm an independent but uh but we are conservative and you sound like a conservative guy and\nI Want you to give us a call back to let us know how things are going in your in your journey to conservatism that's above ... I'm I'm pretty excited about that and again this is why I still have hope and America\nBecause it it it's in our DNA as Americans we want to be a free people\nAnd when you look at what the Democrats have been trying to do over the past Fifteen Twenty years they've been trying to put us all in chains that's what they've been doing All right ... let's go to Savannah Georgia beautiful city Troy what's on your ...\nI I just wanted to say that you know the the town of savannah I'm seeing signs saying you know for an urban area like a fifty fifty split governance ... rate\nAnd uh if if the Republicans are picking up urban areas like savannah into the rural areas I I just think that the polls aren't showing what what she'll start Georgia's capable\nYou're in you know I just think that there's a big gonna be a bigger turnout than you and then all of these polls are showing I don't think a lot of the elections are exposed to the game I mean people don't need to get out and vote\nYou know Troy um we to your point I was talking with some uh some blisters in North Georgia we have a lot of radio stations are across North Georgia from Rome to all the way over to the ... the eastern side of the state\nAnd uh they're telling us that that area of of Georgia is rock solid for Brian Kemp ah and I'm ... and again they don't feel like their views are and are being portrayed in in the media there in Georgia yeah\nI I'm an over the road truck driver I travel all over the country I sit and have conversations with people\nAll over the place of all different ethnicity then I I I really hear a lot of the your your previous caller with the outrage I really hear that talking to everybody that I come in contact with around the country\n... I don't know if you heard John who who called in from Charlotte the Brandt the millennials who used to be a Democrat and now he's a Republican idle about you that that gives me a little bit of encouragement\nYeah I I think the the ... there's I think there's a big similarity to two thousand sixteen now because the outrageous there but you know you see people kids sitting in McDonalds with their Trump\nFat on again or at and I just think they all are tired of much there's a much\nBigger movement behind the polls than there is in the full\nTroy we got to leave it there got to take a break things for the call folks we got trivia coming up I'm pulling an honorable producer John So don't freak out here's the first question I Want to know what kind of Halloween candy is Lara Trump going to be handing out over at Trump Tower\nGive us a call AAA seven eight nine nine one zero that's AAA seven eight nine nine one zero we'll be right back [noise]\n[noise]\nEverybody knows that [noise]\nOh let's go with um chief of staff [noise] oh oh oh oh\nOh so ...

do any giving us a household right now\nOh yes yeah we do a lot of ah we spend a lot of time giving and a monetary also mhm I'm\nYou know and I'm One of the interesting things about being retired been retired six years now and people ask me well how'd you do it and what's interesting is most people look at me about halfway through like I Can't do that [noise]\nWhy why don't why do you think they say that\nWell they did it they have to be to discipline I mean every every day you make a financial decision you know do I save the money or a guy standing you know I'm\nSo the the the it's not a true statement I Can't do that the statement as I won't do that yes that I I agree with that and they look at what did you do for KFC\nWell I started as a dishwasher when I was Fifteen or became a manager of a store when I was Nineteen and men are my wife and I have worked together for many years and then um during that time I was able to have a partnership meant\nThe current the girl has made

cool do you work for one company your entire career\nCorrect well you know yeah\nSo the end you and your parent when we're self taught how much do you read\nUm uh even though I I don't we get a lot um

GD when I was Thirty years old\nI'm you know so it's it's not it's not an education thing it the hard work very\nWell and and as you said the discipline to every day and make a good financial decision

they're\nYou know at least washing dishes if he's not washing dishes she should be learned learned the next job in line so in the management asks him can you help can you move up these already prepared to do that\nAnd that worked out for Thirty years yeah pretty incredible wild on\nWhat a great story does now that's an amazing story high school dropout started about washing dishes in a KFC

lead you argue open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five Peter starts off this hour in Gainesville, Florida Hi Peter how are you\nDoing welfare how are you better than I deserve what's up\nGood thank you have a map that I got a follow up on all the millionaire if that were just call and then um but I just want to let you know I Am an avid listener and I can't believe I'm finding myself in this situation a little background a while back I was entering my apartment complex and found the gate shutting out my vehicle and cracked my windshield\nI tried to collect from the complex for the damages caused to my vehicle and from there was contacted by them required in seven hundred and Seventy five dollars to shape the gate that quote on my vehicle\nAll come back and forth conversation I was ultimately refusing to pay that just because there are no indications are that it was going to close et cetera et cetera I thought everything was clear after I stopped sharing from them and this week I got a call from a collection agency I'm just wondering if we buy for\nHer and attorney what's that hire an attorney for seven hundred and Seventy five dollars in damages\nI think if you hire an attorney for a couple of hundred dollars and they write them a letter or you may shut this whole thing down I don't know that you don't have to go to small claims court\nOkay and so I mean I mean conversation with the a collection agency crack the mapping it with the apartment I'm like\nOh yes it is they still own let out and they're the ones that hard to collections agency I Would say like I Wish I knew they weren't my complex\nOkay for I Am in college it while it for a comeback on the part that goes on the you think my my next that it'd be the cockpit attorney and be in contact with the um with the apartment complex and no way could I could write a check that they had a collection agency\n... if you think that the gate closed improperly and you weren't doing anything wrong in the stupid thing broke your cars they need to fix your car and not charge you for the gate right\nRight that's what you're telling me and if that's the case um you know an a letter from an attorney may solved the whole thing uh but they're not scared of you obviously\nA show we need to get someone that gets their attention\nBecause basically you're getting run down I ... a corporate ladder here uh this is probably a corporate Lee owned or ... owned apartment complexes being quote unquote professionally managed and so you're not dealing with a mom and pop you just got stuck in the vortex here\nAnd the only way to jog that out is shock somebody and so yeah I mean that you're going to write a check on you might as well decide which one you want to ride\nYou want to write a check for a gate that broke that wasn't your fault or do you want to write a check for justice me I like a good fight on my hillbilly so I'd rather just fight\nI really would I mean I'll spend I spend a million dollars completely destroying something rather than spend ten dollars to keep from doing the wrong thing it just drives me bananas I Can't stand it Josh is with us in Chicago hey Josh how are you\nProposed to us as a a a\nEmployee benefits several times and it's really simple when you add up what you pay for it in a year you never spend that much on dentistry it just doesn't work out it's one of those things you should self insure through now we do have an advertiser that is with us\nThat is a a dental discount company and that is worth it\nBecause that helps you get discounts on your dental repairs your dental work and so forth and um you know you can check them out as well you can find them on our website one dental is what it's called one dental\nAnd er James just helped me 'cause I was looking at him my brain wasn't was firing and I couldn't remember are great people to have gotten to know the\nOne dental but it's a discount program for dental services now that is worth it and we do that but we've had done to insurance attempt advertiser many times and we just simply don't let them Christine is with us in Hartford, Connecticut Hi Christine how are you\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh my goodness longtime listener and just so excited never called before [noise] so um my husband and I our debt free including our house way to go well thank you for your teaching we followed them off [laughter] um and we are actually we're everyday millionaires I'm a teacher he's an electrician\nAnd um so we we've been investing in a way that you recommend and you don't just out of curiosity we finally decided to meet with an ... we went online and found on one that you your site recommend\nAiming for over investing\nOkay yes yes in Norfolk smart ... thank you okay um and we met with him and he was very ah you know had a lot of information for us and then you know the the structure is like a ... percent [laughter] I guess\nYou know we both are blessed to have ... we have you know we're only in our fifties and we and we could retire and five years you don't have to but we we couldn't be comfortable um what what is he'll make sense to hire\nUm a financial person for a year at you know whatever I think it's like five thousand dollars a year because they got a five point five percent of what you're\nActually they're lucky they're proposing a ... a manager to count for you correct\nYeah a lot of the industry has gone to the managed to count approach and on and so the question is what do you get for your money that's what you come ... and I'm anytime you're investing and when I'm investing by the way my personal money's invested with one of our smart Russia approach okay\nUm and so the there's two ways to do investing in mutual funds upfront sees\nA that as you do the investment they charge a fee and then there's very low almost no annual after that or they managed to count worry it's a percentage of the balance every year\nAnd a writer you getting for that while they were helping you select the funds and putting you in funds that are out performing the market overall um you know I Hope over a long period of time over average you know funds that outperform the U.S and the and of course you've got someone to meet with uncover anytime there's a question about anything\nI'm a if there's a change in the market and you're worried about it or up or down um anything along those lines and there's tons of studies that say that\nYou will come out ahead doing those two things one is getting good advice and picking the proper funds and to a you know just not jumping off the ledge every time somebody comes on the news and freaks out\nAll day and you're not going to jump off the roller coaster and get hurt you know so that that part of stuff so you know the thing is just asked them to show you okay why are you worse what is your charging and uh you know because you're charging me of the R U worth that\nUh and in most cases you'll find it is\nYeah that that you're going to make more than the cost of the fee\nIn extra returns and certainly in services in terms of um you know education that's available to you and\nUm you know there's a thousand mutual funds to go through I don't keep up with eight thousand mutual funds I have a day job you know and so a a life you know I don't want to do that but those guys that's all they do all day long is comb through those funds\nIt's the whole world they eat live and breathe that stuff and it's I also don't work on my own car\nI could probably fix my car cheaper than the mechanic fix it but it would take me longer\nA there'd be several trial and error is along the way I might break something in the process and so it's worth it to me to get somebody to hook the computer up to the car that actually has the computer hooks up to the car instead of me being a redneck laying on the trying to figure this out\nAnd it's kind of like you know investments I don't why those either um I don't even do my own taxes\nAre and I'm pretty good at this stuff it's what I Do I'm a money guy and got a natural for math and all that kind of stuff but\nI don't why when it gets to the end of the ... the the you know the dirty details so to speak so that's why I think you're going to find the investment is worth that the managers account is worth it but I it's fair to ask them to show you\nOkay the typical guy does this or if you've been doing this over here but if you had been with us during that same period of time and here's what we would have had ... and here's what the ... and it you know what am I knew one and a half percent more what it cost you a half a percent street an editor for one that kind of a thing\nI'm telling you that that they can't do that um that they all obviously all believe that they can and then just asking to show you a good question Alex is with us from Charlotte North Carolina Hi Alex welcome to the day Ramsey show\nI have a you doing today better than I deserve Sarah what's up uh I've had a question a maybe a better question for Ken Coleman but\nAbout my career uh I'm currently in baby steps to and I'm a welder I worked out of town and I'm Mike around a hundred and forty thousand a year mhm and um I've got opportunity to go work at home but the pay is about a third\nOf what I like working out of town and I'm just\nCurious if you thought it was crazy to take a job that I'm I'm not married yet I'm getting married and I my\nSee making a hundred and forty and you'd make like fifty\nYeah OK at home um my aunt\nNo where are you where are you working out of town\nA member going on now but I'm I'm actually going on and we're we're on um you know my own he'd be on the market right now my arm on\nMhm anything other than a ... by or mhm mhm okay\nI think the answer for me would always be see none of the above ... ha ha I liked the idea of coming off the road I don't like the idea of a two thirds pay cut so I got to figure out now and I don't like either how can I come off the road and make more money what do I gotta do to make more money off the road\nOr connecting some kind of a mix and say I'm going to be going to weekends a month\nAnd a and go do just ... there's some OT out on the road that way and pick up some serious change as until but is there\nYou know I don't know run running a different kind of a ... a different way of doing this rather than just saying a J.

don't I'm\nSave up and paid off her pay monthly um if their credit in and I know\nJohn Head of time because you can't sell the truck if you can't cover the difference okay so on\nAnd then yeah I Would be willing to go down I mean two three thousand dollars below what you owe it sounds like it's a one thousand dollar blows the blue book on it but you\nNeed to get this truck sold it's killing you\nYeah\nI mean I wouldn't go I wouldn't do ten thousand in the hold on it but\nI I Would drop down there a few thousand bucks in a heartbeat just to get rid of your stinking payments a thousand a month in it\nAnd fix eighty six eighty okay close enough [laughter]\nWow yeah so I mean you you you made the right decision to get rid of it it it's an out of control purchase while over the top and out of control and\nYou know you're just going to have to sell the truck for what you can get for it uh and if you can get forty five for it fine if you get forty four for five to forty three four it fine or you know three four thousand bucks you know a little small payments a whole lot more than I have an almost fifty thousand bucks out on a truck\nA you're reducing your debt substantially by doing that and on with what you're paying a month you beat you pay off that\nYou know a couple of thousand dollar loss in in just a few months she'll be done with the very very quickly so you you'd be

mean it'll help you get that millionaire mindset going and that's what you've got to do ... with us in Pasadena, California Hi Andrea welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave thank you for having me on that um I Am so happy with you um my husband and I currently have\nSent it to me now not totally again we've been living here about three months already okay um and just trying to see what our next step is that we have about\nA thousand dollars in credit card that we have about fourteen thousand in saving and he said I feel like they're really holding but we're just not sure what else we can do it that I mean it could come and get rid of them as they're I'm not really sure what to do\nWell you can we can do some math and determine if you want to just ride them out or if you want to sell the car\nNow if you want to sell the car here's what you would do and you need to get this information gathered up you need to call the police company and ask what the early buyout is meeting if I wrote you a check did day to get my title what would it be\nThat should be less than the total love your remaining lease payments plus the residual value the buyout at the end\nOkay and so you get that number that's like the early pay off without the interest on a car payment\nGet to the value of the car have you done that on any of these cars\nYes we have on both of our vehicle\nOh wow okay so we've got the actual numbers let's talk about vehicle number one then what's the early buyout\nThat early buyout is thirty three\nThousand dollar okay and and what the value on that car the value of that car I Believe he looked at it and it's like twenty five okay and that just blew book private sale yes yes my husband just that it's thirty two dot com much it's I'm ... I'm Sorry thirty two or twenty\nI made a mistake that the early buyout thirty three ... and kept the Kelley Blue book number is thirty\nOh great too far off okay so you can only lose a thousand dollars by selling their car you'd only write a check for a thousand dollars it'd be sold it for thirty two but you had to give the least couldn't be thirty three to get the title you're thousand in the whole right right right now your lease payment is how much\nMy [laughter] I leave the minutes five hundred and forty two dollars a month [laughter] how many how many famous you have remaining we have about eight Kmart payments okay\nAll right I'm just putting that in here that's nine thousand five hundred Seventy six dollars mhm mhm so if you sell it today you lose a thousand if you keep it you lose ten thousand yeah no brainer salad\nOkay okay you see how the analysis now let's look at the second one then right what's the value of the second one\nSo the value of the second vehicle a twenty five\nOkay in one of the early buyout on it\nThat early buyout on it I'm ... apologies the early five twenty five okay I haven't done the Kelley Blue book them out but I'm sure it's ... I think actually I live in town then for that one where really in the hall\nOkay and what is the lease payment on it\nIm K. so that um let's see here two thirty in or forward into his thirty two hundred dollars\nIf you keep the car till the end of the leash and hand them the case right yeah that's ... that's to thirty times fourteenth okay and that one is somewhere around fourteen thousand and the whole today okay so you get to drive this car for free\nUntil the end of this lease on that one you keep it because I'd rather lose thirty two hundred and fourteen thousand and I drive the car\nOkay you see what I'm doing yeah comparing a total of your payments\nAgainst the amount you're in the hall\nSo that one that one I Would probably keep it for your husband's numbers are correct on the value I suspect there\nI suspect you're going to keep it anyway because I don't think he's going to be that far off I mean we got a fourteen thousand dollar deficit right now if he if he's eleven value is right but even if he's half wrong it's still a seven thousand dollar deficit versus three thousand to keep it\nSo that one we keep\nOkay and you pay it out now it's is it overall miles\nNow that one way I'm Guy mile\nOkay and the wear and tear you're going to keep it up so you're not going to have to write a check when you turn it in fourteen months from now\nNow they're both saying that well that one in great condition\nOkay good good yeah that one or you see how I did that analysis\nYeah yeah that really clear that out track we were really struggling with what you\nKnow ... that one and you know what I Would do is move on past a baby step to\nOnce you've gotten rid of the the big car the more expensive one and once you've gotten rid of all your other debts except this but if you still have this one with the two thirty payments were just written the car all the way through the end here and you might as well keep the car you get no advantage to turning it in early right right\nMight as well drive the dad gummed car you know and um if you want to put thirty two hundred dollars aside extra in your emergency fund just to make sure you got that plus your emergency for uncovered the call yourself in baby steps two and three then that's fine but that's how you do the analysis on whether to keep a leash or not and um\nMost of the time unless you're close to ... unless you're close to the end of the lease you're going to be selling the car and that's what happened with the more expensive one there it's killing you\nKnow that one was a beach will bite ya\nSo good question thank you for joining us ... if you've never heard the saying it's kind of a country saying you're getting ...\nWhich means it it's it's like a a a sheep getting it's far removed that's where it comes from your getting ripped off his ... means that's why I call them car fleet says because if we take the value of the original\nMarket value of that car that thirty three thousand dollar car on them expensive one there for those folks and I put that five forty two into a calculator and then I put the in value into a financial calculator with residual value at the end in other words the residual values what you can buy the car for at the end of the lease\nYour your games up number at the end of the least you put those numbers you know the calculator you come back out what the effect of interest rate is\nIn most of the time it's around fourteen percent\nThey call it costs to Capitol\nAnd they don't have to disclose the interest rate the AP are to you you know if you get a car loan you get this this truth and lending sheet that the Federal Trade commission makes makes them show you the ... a PR the annual percentage wretched you're being charged but when you're leasing it's technically not that\nAnd so you 'cause you're renting a car\nI mean it's ridiculous that's why we call it ... it's the most expensive way to operate caught the Carly ... is a disaster [noise]\nIt's a disaster as a financial shit [noise]\nYou just do the math you can understand what I'm saying\nThis is the rams are ...
