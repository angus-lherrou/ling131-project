when\nWhen he said if your enemy is down you just kick them because what have we just with the law\nA metal they spelling reputation with twelve years on the federal things in the space for one week going from having a spotless record all them being accused of being a multiple rapists\nMy fear is that the that they knew mall what we saw on Saturday with the president Shockley righteously declare it dropped\nKavanaugh's and us from the White House the my expectation was maybe the Democrats look at the mirror and say\nOkay we went to her but according to Eric Holder the worst is yet to come\nNow here's the puzzle ... that house look very favorable for the Democrats and that's what that's what you expect to pick up at the first midterm I'm a first presidency as a first term of new president that then it does not looked favorable for them that probably has to do with the cabinet story we've seen\nNumbers moving the Republican way in Nevada in\nIn Montana in Missouri in North Dakota in Arizona and we the numbers move in Tennessee ... the Republican way in the Senate but not in the house so\nI'm exasperated to understand why Eric Holder and also Mrs Clinton\nWould use

you win at the ballot box you don't win in the street you don't win by confronting people in the subway or at the coffee shop you win at the ballot box and anyone any Republican who thinks that violence is going to be successful is foolish I don't\nI don't want to I don't want to associate with them that's a pretty simple thing to say and Mrs Clinton in our culture could say\nYes but it's not our job you're absolutely right this has to come from the ... all the Democrats policy we have to hear this from the ... but they're not going to say it when you have the leading left wing\nMedia

series of opinion pieces that have come out recently that was arguing that we were we were doing wrong by making investments in increased capacity meaning growing the size of the Army Navy air force in the navy\nAnd in fact these are these other voices were arguing that the money would be better spent in in investing in increased capabilities more high technology\nAnd my argument was that was strong civilian leadership we can do both and in fact we must\nSo the U.S military has a broader strategy of both attempting to preserve the peace that currently exists which requires that we have capacity to have presidents and all the areas where we have interest while also increasing capabilities are so that we have a war winning capabilities when we need them\nAnd so the argument I make in here is it's possible to do both it's it's\nPossible literally to walk and chew gum at the same time ah but I think that there's been sort of a series of final straw man that's been thrown out there\nThat attempt to say we either must do one or the other uh and I think there's some other political um you know arguments that are in the background that money would be better spent in other areas or that the physical environment is getting too constrained with rising a debt and deficit but\nYou know we're in a great power competition and we either need to make the right investments to be able to survive within that competition or we don't we lose and we'd decline\nAnd therefore area denial do we have the ships to\nNeed to continue the investment in these high end destroyers which we just purchased a more over the next five year but we also known by need to buy those forget so you and I discuss on\nMany of you know what about air frames Jerry what what would the navy need to deal with the Chinese rap\nFor the navy needs to making a significant investment in modernizing its carrier air wings in order to get additional long range or aircraft back on the carrier deck and I have repeatedly called\nFor significant investments in unmanned long range precision strike platforms in order to have the aircraft carriers be relevant up against some of the new modern standoff anti access systems with the Chinese and the Russians are employing\nAnd right now we have not done that so that is an area where the navy needs to make a substantial investment to bring new capabilities on the carrier deck in order for that the aircraft carrier or to continue to exercise influence in the future\nHowever the Decatur incident or we're not going to build a fleet overnight do we have the capability right out and deal with the increased in ... aggression in the south China Sea or any of the passages in the first time and change\nRight now we're holding our own but just barely a so the\nChinese are building up rapidly and in fact in\nIn just a few years they will have a larger navy than we do a a larger navy that's not as capable but the problem that we face as China only has to be great or over ... in one area of the world right now which is essentially the western Pacific and into the Indian Ocean\nWhereas we still have to maintain security everywhere in the world that we have interests which is broadly everywhere so uh our forces are spread thin or we need to build up as rapidly as we can unfortunately right now the Navy's build up plan to three fifty five does not get us there until the twenty fifties and that will be far too late\nFar too late Jerry Hendricks cat and Jerry Hendricks US Navy retired aviator\nCan name the south China and its partner Russia and

concentrated area but the flood\nWaters are rising there so\nYou know the damage and everything is not to catastrophic but wanted to give a shout out to them\nYou know there's one thing we know\nAbout the left in America\nAll of their buzz phrases our lives\nAnd it's amazing because you can point this out with irrefutable fact\nAnd that's what makes them so angry that's why they get so mad because you have the facts that totally destroyed their reality and instead of doing the open minded thing the tolerance thing the right thing which is taking a step back and\nRealizing you're wrong about something no they doubled down and get violent\nWomen women must be hurt how many times that we hear that during the Kavanaugh hearings\nHow big of a why is that did they listen to the women that

last night\nAnd ... then the next segment I'm going to play all these clips folks that just\n[noise] I mean you already know it but it's like we have to put it out there into the ether so that\nIt sinks in that the Democrat Party is trying to START I mean you can call whenever a civil war mob rule whatever an arcade violence chaos it's the destruction\nIt's all being caused by the Democrats they know exactly what they're doing but here's the key\nI tend to\nLook at things from a psychological perspective I just can't help it and last night\nI almost [laughter]\nI basically had\nI don't want to I don't want to say vision I didn't have a vision but the psychology of the left became clear to me in my head in a vision\nThe psychology of the left\nImagine if you will a room full of cardboard boxes\nAnd every cardboard box or you're in a left this mine every cardboard box represents a an individual\nSo let's say your a gay person well the left puts\nThat they believe about gay people exist in that box and every gay person must exist in that box\nAnd let's say All right they got a black man in a box\nThe black man must think this way they must have Trump they must hate this they must feel this\nYeah that's a great picture that is left his mind right there it is a room full of boxes\nA room full of taped up\nCardboard boxes now what does this mean this means that it's called they're close minded this means they have no room for growth they have no room for expansion and their entire\nMental makeup is one hundred percent based off of\nWhich they then put into a box and stack up neatly in their mind so okay white male they go into the white mailbox oh racist you know big it all the other things that is unless they come out as a good liberal\nAnd then all of a sudden the whole box thing kind of just just fades away and it's just oh except in you know are\nGuilty until proven Democrat\nTo the left his mind\nIs just boxes stacked on top of one another of every identity and race in person and whatever\nAnd it's just there and it's permanent\nAnd the boxes can never\n... you know go into one another because they've created\nSo you can't more ideas people can never come together because they have 'em all in these boxes and that's the only way that they think people can coexist is if everyone is in their nice little box\nAnd then they can stack 'em up and have everybody and their nice box and then virtues signal and social justice warrior the entire thing\nAnd if you don't fit in that box they freak out\nIt's honestly like a next level of OCD it probably is some\nNext higher levels social level of OCD they have like a social OCD\nWhere everyone has to exist in their little boxes and they have to put these little box isn't perfect order and if anybody steps outside of the box if anybody post a hole in the box and look at what might be on the other side they totally panic and their entire psychology breaks down into madness and hysteria\nThat's what we're seeing folks\nBecause their psychology of everyone being in a box is not reality\nAnd so now they're seeing this all black people think differently white people are not racist like all of this crap and they don't know what to do because in their mind every once in a box\nAnd stacked away Perfectly Imperfect order I can see the person who's desk\nIt's imagine walking up to an obesity persons desk and you know pushing the stable or the other side and then they get back and they're like oh we got caught him I said we're going to the right side of I'd asked what was going on and then they have like a panic in a breakdown\nEverybody knows people like this it's a mental thing it's a psychological thing\nPeople have been diagnosed with these things people know that they're OCD\nThat's the left his mind and so as soon as you go into the left his mind\nAnd you may be moving boxes around or or a black man steps out of the box that they put 'em in its total panic total outrage total hysteria and that's where we're at right now because the average leftist has put everything in a box arranged it perfectly in their mind\nAnd that's what makes them comfortable because that no oh I understand everything I Know everything I've got everything in the box perfectly organized unlabeled everyone have identified everybody\nIt's an authoritarian\nIn its nature but it's a psychological\nThere are OCD\nTheir social OCD people have put everyone in a box with a label on everyone\nExcept the man you can't do that that's not all the world works peoples' minds change people at all kinds of different varying idea\nBut that's why the OCD everything has to be where they don't want to say the total man that's where\nWe're bringing back when they get in St Louis

trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety right I\n\n\nThe substance issue huge for anybody who is paid attention over the last Thirty years as to what he's been involved with a Jim Brown is not part of popular culture today with the youth and millennials like Kanye West is the left is scared to death of Kanye West because he\nSmack in the middle of the the culture that is expected by the elite liberals to be a liberal supporter ...\nHe cannot have a different opinion and if he does have a different opinion than Trump is exploiting the mental issues\nThe Kanye West had nobody was talking about mental issues economy was when he when he was at the award show where they no ... no no no uh nobody in Aleppo was talking about his ah you know his mental state when I he said that uh George Bush a hates all black people because of the country and that didn't seem right\nThat that that that's not a because it again that's not a threat it's something at that time politically they could use a not so much the Taylor Swift award show moment but the the uh George Bush comment and it was notable\nTo the left but they didn't they didn't label them as\nInsane it\nIf you think about his demeanor because I I don't know by the way I don't\nKnow what uh uh uh what what do you call it the the hero voyage or or what whatever Trump is on right now uh\nUh well I think you can you sometimes you can go through a lot of Cairo journey is what he said yeah you're you're there you go through a ... a lot of Kanye West lurks go OK I understand this hot understand this sense at All right uh they are and I do I have no idea what this means I get back kind of get back\nTo you know I mean look look to the Beatles for inspiration she loves you yeah yeah yeah she loves you yeah yeah yeah\nWell no I disagree with you if you're looking for complete and total accuracy in a song\nTax man mhm yeah oh sure also from the Beatles yes yes I mean that's accuracy is yeah I mean that that was come you understood that exactly wasn't one for me\nWas that when they had the Ninety percent tax I was at nine for you in one for me it was on yeah which was actually the tax rate at the time you know and I\nThink the but\nIf you look at his demeanor and the way Kanye is actually taught I think he was on chemical things where he said a couple of things and listening to them as like I was like\nIf you don't look at the video you're like is that Kanye talking because his demeanor was calm and straight to the point it wasn't the Taylor Swift moment\nThey wasn't that it wasn't the moment ah after Katrina the George Bush um it wasn't that\nIt was something that the content of the comment really couldn't be debated by the left so what do they do\nWhile they go to the labeling and the name calling and then you know all of a sudden will now he's crazy which means he's not capable of making a thought at all you know this goes beyond the Mia Love thing\nUh you know and and the comments were all over the place you know the the token comment a from a Thursday uh\nWhy have the facts why to do the wires to many ... why is anybody surprise\nThat a a black man in rap ... that's

looking for you're looking for where you believe\nManipulation may be happening or if you want to look at manipulation if you want to look at bigotry if you want to look at intolerance if you want to look at an elite establishment but is telling all blacks you must think a light\nOr something is wrong with you I'm not surprised more male rap stars haven't come out and said\nWell this is ridiculous mhm as ... is doing\nI think it's completely and totally normal that you'd look and you'd say wait a minute the Democratic party has been manipulate look we can get calls\nFrom blacks all the time that said I finally woke up and realize the ... now it's not the majority but it's growing mhm and obviously when that message is put out\nTo any demographic that exists out there that you must act this way you must think this way there's only one way to think and if you don't think this way you are betraying your race\nSomebody's finally going to stand up and saying you're full of it\nRight that is just naturally going to happen and that's essentially the point the economy and made on chemical you know this this is ridiculous that someone can't think\nI mean imagine Trump had said that\nIt would be done\nThat not that all blacks think alike but they should think alike politically huh it would be over\nCNN would have a twenty four hour special report on it and and that's that's

I saw one of six one shot [laughter]\n\n\nIt's run by radio he is there a common I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety or read I we go\nTo Mary Ann in Michigan Marianne welcome you're on ... Radio Welcome to the show\nUm I I really interested in what you're talking about and about the stock market going down there for a number of reasons like you said a including perhaps a ... a political agenda\nWith respect to some businesses but the thing I called about it's about our country being able to produce everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that which is why NAFTA was so bad the good thing about doing it here it's we create more jobs\nKnowledge horror Mary it's horrible the last thing you would ever\nBecause then prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies that would make the goods and services that you get prices would be much higher than they should be it would and retail doors shutting raft and write a if we'll do the opposite for job he wouldn't go in a massive\nSection if we had a policy that we produce everything in this country prices of goods and services with sky rocket through the roof it's not whether you are capable of producing everything right here because with modern technology\nFor the most part we probably could produce now there are some there are are are some rare metals that we don't have access to that we absolutely have to get from from other countries but say we even had those rare metals\nYou produce everything here means number one you're not going to buy anything from anybody else which means they're not going to buy anything for you which means us producers only have a market of three hundred and twenty million people are three hundred and thirty whatever it is now instead of seven billion people the farmers would\nBe if they ... they would be done [noise] yeah they and they see the world [noise] we as a Mason the world [noise]\nWell that was the oh farming would be gone [noise]\n\n\nUm and they did by the way I think that's the number one reason icon is supporting um uh the uh the the president his tax bill went way way down [laughter]\nBut I'm In the you know the [laughter] that'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the line to you that right\nSo the but but\nYou put in place all those dynamics for great economy and all it's working up until what\nThe ... three numbers we talked about\nQuarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials is still high and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly\nControlled by the government that is something that is policy put in place that doesn't need to be there what\nDo win and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property yet we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even\nA for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a few things different in in TPP but remember\nThe great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the ... candle I had already agreed to that yes I'm a you know ... before so that was lauded as a great victory uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided\nYou know not to uh to take that you and I went through and and and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old\nNAFTA the biggest victory that the president has claimed\nThat he claimed was the fact that the tariffs worked\nTo get what he wanted with the automobile industry right along he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile\nIn Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah nobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that's viewed as a victory\nWell if I remember\nTwo of the president's major goals his goals his stated goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit I don't see how this does it because the majority of the new NAFTA does\nAnyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent mhm\nUh and uh\nThe rest is still the same right\nSo you ask okay what were the what were the because that the president's trying to make the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles what did you get you increase the cost of automobiles\nFor people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries\nAnd because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods\nTo you know producing them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite of the two things that you wanted a reduction in the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere well\nAnd and the right now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry are now\nYou you talk about you know the farmers I mean if you if you say it's a very populous viewpoint right we need to help the farmer but when you think of\nThe role that they play and and the and the global market in terms of food\nOr you know set up before a few minutes ago but they feed the world that food goes all over the world um you\nAnd and they're telling the administration look your your your money that you gave us a thanks but no thanks\nWe need the business that's what we need\nPresident doesn't need them he doesn't need to uh I Know everybody does it politically but this president doesn't need that and they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite\nRight because it is\nYou know it's just protectionist policy\nWhich brings about retaliation from our trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers\nIt's I mean they get their government bailout with the ten percent mandate so I have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably scrambling\nWell in terms of of getting things done and as you said it was it ... it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced yesterday\nThat show and and that's the other thing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the ah the supportive of a lot of people and other and I know people who are otherwise\nConservative and say you know they supported the president they say well well this is all negotiation well wait he was a master negotiator why does he need to threat threatened and ultimately cost people a lot of money\nAnd hurt industry in order to get them to go she Asian done\nHe's a master negotiator he doesn't need to do that\nWell as I said you know ... and again him or we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA\nRight why ...\nExcept for the you know ... and you can look as we said you can look at it the one percent increase in the market share for the United states in the Canadian dairy mhm but then they really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will\nIncreases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall was that worth the loss of business with the tariffs that the president\nHas put on that does raise the cost of goods and services and affected the cost of raw materials and other goods and services for American businesses\nAre businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule right because now but now he mentioned that but his big victory this is what the president said we're not is this isn't our opinion\nWas the automobile thing I got what I wanted an automobiles what did you get\nWhat we made it so some uh some employers of in Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour ... some have to do that well fine you just\nMade them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker right ah and even with the was it uh I think it was a Wall Street journal said must and I forgot who else said well it's only a two point five percent tariff so really isn't going to affect that it isn't that great\nSo we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that but the other than the president want to do is make sure that\nWe could in the United states seller vehicles overseas but that's less likely to happen because the cost in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up as to his caps on what Mexico you know could send us in cars before other terrorists hit\nFor both Canada and Mexico and said it sort of like what they did in South Korea\nWhere they said okay you can only do we now doubled the amount of cars uh with the safety precautions to twenty thousand that we can sell in South Korea instead of ten thousand so see we doubled the market for the United states the United states was only selling six thousand to begin with\nRight they weren't ... were humor and got everyone emerging the cap well they're not read the caps have been set in NAFTA the two countries in Canada and Mexico are reaching they gave him enough buffer space so it's actually not going to affect that it's more well it is symbolism over the substance said okay we're going to produce them here and not over there\nSo when you actually look at the specifics of what is in NAFTA what the new NAFTA what did you actually gain specifically you know there's no one is talking about that the only thing they brought up\nWas what they did on automobiles and the one percent increase in the market share of Canada

go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those thirty to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number a for a majority right so right now\nOnly Nineteen to those thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nSo it will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls\nAre and we and we will more and more are in the coming weeks that's going to be the I think by the time we get back a week from Monday things will start shaping up because those

you know nine twenty two which had test her up for the one before and and uh with the margin of error three point seven five and the one before that was test her up just to\nWhy isn't that a toss up state why is that definitely yeah on the on the Senate race yeah unemployment rate right and and ... my point is so yeah is the legitimacy of\nThe our CPA average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell ... ... and\nI guess historically Kennedy shift happened\nAh with with if you look at

one thing that I got out of the whole cabinet thing is the Democrats were tried to sell us that if you believed in due process and the mindset of due process and that the accusation alone isn't enough and you disagreed with them with this message think about this\nBut if you don't believe the accuser no matter what\nIf you believe that not the allegation but the evidence is what should be the

the lawyer shows out there uh-huh\nRight for that and and so when we talk about the fact of the ignorance of the American public ignorance does not mean stupid\nNow the Democratic leadership may think people are stupid we believe people may be uninformed we don't believe people are stupid and never had ... have\nIgnorance simply means you lacked the fax it doesn't mean that you can't understand the

a problem with everybody let's be honest oh trust me but and and and so but the thing about this ... the Democrats are trying to sell to the American public after\nHow many decades of television shows pounding lawyer shows that us over and over again where it has become\nAbsolutely crystal clear to any American out there you need evidence before you and convict somebody they're saying no that think about that that's their biggest push going into an election mid term election\nIs the fact that no no evidence doesn't matter only the allegation matters evidence doesn't matter really\nThat's what you're trying to sell the American public\nAnd that's why when the last caller just the way that just the way that he explained it\nThat no you you don't go public opinion doesn't decide public opinion does not decide the guilt or innocence of anybody gets the evidence it's and and so everybody everybody should get due process but the incredible thing is due process under the law and the

Ninety right on let's go to Roger in Texas Roger you're on right everybody I Walk into the show\nI guess the second time a long time listener first time caller\nSpectacle regarding the moderate Republicans the head of the standard um\nGo along to get along they have woken up [noise] and ah I'm Wondering if this is an apt analogy I don't know trying to the inflammatory but uh in the same way that\nThe u._s. was not aware that they were under attack by a Islamic extremism\nTerrorists until nine eleven you know they have the ... bombing they had a uh the Trade Center in Ninety three they weren't really woke up an aware until nine eleven happened in the same way I don't think that the moderate Republicans were aware that there that that\nExtreme ... left wing extremism is at war with conservatism until last week\nOr not only in the ... not not only conservatism just anybody who is opposite them even a a a poll politically a death not necessarily any logically but no I don't think it's inflammatory what you said because remember in the nine eleven commission\nWhich was put together a bipartisan they said the problem with the United states was they were at war with us and we weren't at war with them right uh and that was added like an ... so that came from the nine eleven commission so there's nothing inflammatory about that\nAnd I would think word your analogy I think if you look at that I think also it's I think it's correct that the Republicans many of them in the center now are clearly no I mean when you have to think about this when you have a Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins\nBeing the ones who were the ... that really carried if it does not so much with Collins but certainly Lindsey Graham carrying the conservative torch\nThat's when you see definitely that awareness is is is in full play now and that's where you also see Lindsey Graham saying well I'm going to campaign anywhere and everywhere\nShe wouldn't dare to that will be remembered though Scott ... in terms of their mark\nOn this a vet no doubt her speech for the most part no doubt um she didn't carry she didn't care either way I guess Lindsey Graham riot but yeah I Would uh she would do that\nI wouldn't have seen comic I could've seen if you were to ask me maybe weeks out and told me that the situation comic\nI could've seen as a Collins going well no I'm going to vote no and then a a high camp voting yes right so I mean that that would have been or somebody if you would have told me that's what's going to happen I was oh okay I see it\nAll the way we never talked about like a high camp explanation ... that she made her decision by turning off the TV and watching just his body language right yeah oh my God yeah just kill yourself were you when you're if you just give yourself no chance ... when he well\nIndoor yeah it'll ...\nYou know that was pretty much cutting the strain because then you see\n[noise] the\nWhole well downward spiral that continued after\n[noise]\n\n\n\nUh buy your own local delivery a set up for a for Amazon and by the vans and everything else\nAnd be a part of that and and there's opportunity there it was about creating\nA a ... basically\nThe the ability or more and more to control pricing said keep prices low on Amazon according to beat us he the U. S. P. S. thing if prices get too expensive and it's costing you know the uh the company to raise prices\nFrom it or they pass it along to the consumer ... plain and simple\nUh this news item the cofounder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier and for those of you that are brand new listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly and update you so you understand completely what we're talking about uh the Democrats accused the Trump a campaign of colluding with the Russians to hack\nAnd or change the outcome of the election mhm the evidence we have found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign paid a law firm\n... who paid and opposition research from a ... a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got a information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order\nTo change the outcome of the election by getting unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use\nIn order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information as a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was a part well\nThe co founder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\n[noise]\nThe lawyer said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committees\nSimpsons from a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign by the law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\n... fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the ...\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course a lawyer is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\nWell then what does the ... say they're trying to find here's I either ... or they're going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think so right\nAre are they going to ask him about a a who he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you are listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought that up\nUh I don't think so what are they going to ask him up on me I Would I they're going to ask him about Kanye West [laughter] probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their role\nOr in the\nUh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS\nThe inspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the\nAnd an associate deputy attorney general ah\nThe inspector general would have then access to any communications if they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking\nOr does he oh he but he yes from the department of justice\nYes yes yes because because they were done internally yesterday right on right on unofficial yes device from the department and I and and again if the those are ... that that's a number of hits right away from the point being is that\nYou look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because you shouldn't GPS doesn't want to cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut\nHow so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with a you know a\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do as you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still preserved in any way\nWe we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fifth mhm yes I have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand than what I Would wonder is a blend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't let let's take him at his word mhm that the house\nThen I Would ask ... lawyer then what do you think they're going after right if they're not well look at our is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing as a mother investigation\nThe Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russian collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the mother investigations is going is at the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know of a fusion GPS committing any crime I don't know I'm One I don't know where there was any evidence of it\nYou would uh concerning you know get gathering the information and getting the money from ... thrown opposition research firm that just on the level is is ... that's what you do you get hurt on the other\nParty's candidate or whatever you you do up as well the what they do opposition research is self explanatory\nSo what is he worried about what would they be what possible crimes\nIs Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about well ... Anaheim and the timing is interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior I'll justify I'll go under oh I'll do there are plenty of people that go under oh mhm\nSo what is the crime that he is ... that that what is the charge\nThat Glenn Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going to try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\nAnd by talking forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating his firm\nYeah\nThose are the questions that what they are those are questions on the investigator would have running through their mind ... yes that's all we're not indicting anybody yet [laughter] ha I'm just I was that

cold live fingers it's the people's right yes\nA very interesting I just want to get to this topic because you happen to bring this up and I didn't know about this many employees on the Las Vegas strip fear being replaced by robots and you were telling me there's actually these and I'm looking at it right now that they've come up with these drink robots that will make bartenders obsolete\nYes and you can come at the design I've seen I don't know if this was in place in Vegas just yet\nBut the design I've seen also includes you walk up to the kiosk or the kiosk is even embedded into the counter like they do the are they actually have like a a if you go up to a bar and a gambling city or for those who don't gamble or never been\nWhen you sit at a bar you can get your drinks actually for free if you're gambling and they'll put the right there at the seat there is a video poker thing you can play mhm right by the way the drinks not free [laughter] it'll cost you whatever you lose and video [laughter] to be clear you mean they're not giving yeah anything free\nNow that uh that are just that they don't deserve to buy a bunch of alcohol and lose money on it\nNo I'm the those are the [laughter] getting back to the robot thing I'm a I'm not sure what the strippers will look like I ... but but for the bar it they'll move away from ...\nOh man oh no no no no right now bartenders robot brothels yeah I I guess by the way we never really talked about yeah we didn't talk about Houston didn't we didn't talk about and we did last week well I mean you know if you think about remember\nThe old but I guess they still have them the coffee vending machine with me\nAh that went to make a a cup of\nCoffee didn't work out too well known as the to walk up behind them and then became him which was weird but\nYou think about robotics in serving food that's been around for a while but it will be different in a bar like this where you go up and you basically\nUh order it you know and you know the type it in a you're going to insert your credit card and then all of a sudden the drink is going to be made and even delivered to you depending on the set up on the counter ... by automation\nYou know I think John ... a guy who has a pretty good uh business or or has over the years in Las Vegas\nAnd also from uh the the bar rescue\nYou're never going to see a well first of all there's no way to steal from the till I'm not blaming bartenders from for that I'm not condemning all bartenders but that does happen in the business\nAnd you know ... caught it where they were you know skimming or whatever from from the register but even to a greater extent pouring way too heavy right right uh robots not going to do this\nWell be the one but I here's the other point because I was thinking the same thing I'd asked John tap for how far can you go with the robot bartender and\nKen a regular Barbie all robots right and just a person walking around or do you have to is is there a 'cause he talks about the science of a bar mhm and the science of the bar is about people and interaction\nAnd wrote a a a robot can't be pleasant trust me I Know a few of them well a robot also can't be angry either right MBA an angry bartender right\nOr can't can't be a drunk bartender [laughter] well that's that but how how far do you\nNot communicating with the bartender or not walking into your corner bar so my wife and I uh recently went to a place\nThat had a robot roulette wheel now we walked by it several times we didn't we didn't look at it because it was often like they have\nA a a a what would you say it it's there's there's there's poker and blackjack were you walk up and the screen has\nYou know a dealer but it's it's animated right and so that you know the the whole table is animated the cards were animated well on this roulette that's what I thought I was ... that I thought it was all animated\nIt's actually it's it's an actual wheel in the center and you don't you're not close to every one it's not crowded like a real roulette table and so we thought okay let's see how this works\nAnd it was interesting we played it for a few minutes and it was interesting because I said you know that's that's not the animation thing it's still gives you the view of a real roulette wheel right and that's important for a lot of people they don't trust right ... well\nIn in the case of a a a Vegas in in a in a bar setting there's a couple of settings you're going to be a nightclub kind of setting in nightclubs are huge in in Vegas\nUm where they don't care they just want to drink it's not your pub writing where's ... where the bartender right things to be pleasant needs to be a companion for and carry maybe a little bit of a conversation on with you in Vegas it's not that\nIt's not that for the most part it's either the gamblers or ah like I said the nightclubs and no one cares anything except about the alcohol when it comes to the bar is all about the alcohol or it'd be interesting\nBartender ah yeah going\nYou're walking your house and they basically you've got bottles that you insert vodka whatever I mean right ten different types of alcohol that you put in their right and the mixer and everything else and then you just walk into your house and you say Alexa give me a screwdriver\nGo oh and then she hands you affiliates

stethoscope uh that's\nHow I knew he was a real doctor sure absolutely makes sense to me you want to Ninety five percent approval rating of something very sure what to say that you would like to have\nMr Miller shut down the Russian investigation because I Believe I don't care where you are on the political spectrum I don't believe that you believe anymore that this is a Russian investigation\nAnd I don't believe you'd think there was collusion with the Russians all that what is behind those I wouldn't go as far as one direction to say it's a witch hunt\nBut I got to tell you the truth they are not staying on topic representative Mark Meadows says it's time to shut down the investigation\nBut I think probably the biggest part is is the president is exactly right there is no collusion he knows it I Know even the Democrats know it and it's about time that Bob Mueller\nHe must finished the investigation it's time to call it quits because what we're starting to find out or the wheels are coming off Clinton Simpson\nFusion GPS going Simpson refused to come before Congress I talked to chairman Gaddy this evening\nThe only option we have now is the holy man contempt of cop why well we've got we've got to get those out transparency is good medicine shot as you know I've been advocating for that the president has been advocating but he wants to be cautious and I applaud that you know he's getting accused left in ride\nOf interfering in this investigation\nOr it's time for it to be over if there was something there should have come out already that's for sure\nAbout to\nWrite to report but you know a re just to go to the last twenty five more days because in twenty five more days America is going to go to the polls for the midterm elections and we'll see what happens in those elections and then once they're over\nThis investigation will and that's the good news and the bad news and and maybe we'll get rid of the roses steam situation at a lot of the lingering on fire and what you got\nWell a story that we had that I found earlier this week that didn't really get any air play that I saw at all and it was pretty important more than a hundred and twenty missing children were found in just one day during a wide scale law enforcement operation in Michigan authorities located\nOne hundred twenty three children in the Wayne County area which includes Detroit as part of a one day sweep the initiative took place on September twenty six\nA one hundred twenty three of the three hundred one children that had been reported missing in the area following weeks of investigations were were found a\nThey also received information onto missing children authorities receive the information onto missing children in Texas and one in Minnesota which they are still actively investigating the U.S Marshals Service also said Michigan State police have ask for assistance with fourteen other cases\nThese children or all I'm\nTaken and put into the\nSex or whatever and yeah ... yeah ...\nYeah I I just wish I knew Samir about it and I try to get to stories that we don't really hear a lot about is funny\nOr a a unfortunately we don't hang around as many different people as we used to one thing I can say about living in Los\nAcross the country you met a guy who was visiting from Seattle one from Denver one from New Orleans one from the east coast and whatever mhm well I met a guy and a girl yesterday when I was heading golf balls ... were just brought a dog grooming shop\nHere in the here in our area and it's out in a cave creek and\nWe started talking and he was from upper\nUpper Arlington heights who was from New Jersey somewhere so we had a lot of places that were in ... yeah that's right for ... and she said to be and when the girls set up to me she said it was a ... like she will bring your sick like we were just talking about with the hurricane about\nLiving somewhere and then you go back there\nAs completely gone completely devastated yes and she looked at him he was her boyfriend and they bought this grooming shop together he was from New Jersey and was literally a terror in her I well she said I grew up in Detroit\nOh and yeah I get sick leave she felt like her entire childhood was waving are raised had been white boarded\nWell ... it's worse than being a race because up from where I grew up much like Detroit yeah oh it was seven not only dealings I remember I ... and it was never it was devastated and left there to die to be on display\nAnd uh to go back and I remember a couple of years after I had been away I was living in Tucson like many of the kids of that era left and went out west because that's where jobs were and try to make a life going you're young yes and a dad says a stick\nSo we're going on and it's not like it was a way in any new like\nIran\nAnd all that stuff you know in the building that one\nOff or something [laughter]\nFor certain causes but I think a lot of people learned about this form of arthritis with filmmakers Mickelson the Gulf her who's come out and said he has ...\nYes certainly at the awareness that he was able to raise has just been amazing\nUm and you know it's interesting mentioning him you know he's someone that has talked about um the impact of that disease on his wife and his career as a golfer and now we hear from our community that\nAbout Seventy five percent three and four patients say that there are radical arthritis has negatively affected their career path so it's certainly bigger than just\nA the physical um applications that to see it\nNot really you you have a form of arthritis because you have them back condition and I don't think that a lot of people who have backed conditions associate that back condition turning into a form of arthritis will\nUm something that I'm kinda glad you let us they're not that I like to talk about my own ailments but I have moderate to severe arthritis\nBut I have osteoarthritis which I Would not trade for any other type of arthritis is very bad and ah ah as we can tell us\nPeople do go through life wearing a mask\nAnd you actually he was not to participate as a result of them please continue\nYeah they really do you know and that's why it's\nAimed at elevating the voice that patient raising awareness about the significant impact\nSporadic arthritis and then\nImportantly acknowledging the role of the patient physician communication\n... yes because sometimes we are kind of disregarded oh it's arthritis but in this in a in ... ah the damage that continues to be done and it's not necessarily in one area is it\nNo it's not and it is a degenerative disease so it's it really is important that when you start to have symptoms\nThat you do go see a specialist you go see a health care provider who kind of work with you to treat your disease to prevent any further um a debilitating consequences and and damage that cannot be repaired\nOr I always encourage people living with ... threat is who feel their diseases not well managed to talk to their physician about what more can be done it's so critical that patients and providers have agreement around what their treatment goals are and that they're able to have productive discussions about how to get there\nI don't know what the overall number is but I Would imagine if you talk to people that are senior citizens eighty percent of them would tell you they have some form of arthritis what does that number is a human closed Rene correct\nYou know it is one of the most um common a chronic diseases and the United states and so that's why the tips that um we offer really thinks that apply to so many people you know prepare for your appointments by um going\nIn and talking about any changes you've had than a year last a appointment and any new symptoms that have developed be open about talking about how the disease has impacted your quality of life and come with a list of questions that you want to talk to your provider about and those are combat not apply to\nThe amount of time that you get with your position now a days I think it's important for people who knows they have a condition to write down some new so they can relate to the ...\nAbsolutely you know one of the things that we have heard from our community is that challenge of really raising concerns that you have with your physician\nAnd in fact more than Ninety percent of patients say they feel uncomfortable talking about their concerns and fears or with their rheumatologist even going so far to say they're fine when they're still struggling and so\nI'm preparing really thoroughly for an appointment often helps you get over that hurdle 'em and make sure that those issues that really must be discussed are brought forward\nLeave can you stick around for another few minutes we got to take a break here we do have the time\nUnfortunately I don't but I really appreciate you letting me\nWhere can we learn more give

the big bang\nBut to think that that's still flying around out there will actually Haley's common has broken up and uh it has a and we see remnants of still and I forget what ah every five or ... yeah that comes about that you're able to see\nSo we decided to and uh that we'd bring you a couple of things about national farmers day\nOkay a recent survey by the undeniably dairy campaign found that fifty one percent of Americans question would be interested in moving to a farm if they could would you move to a farm if\nYou couldn't do it can get up early in the morning humanity [laughter] do you manage\nA survey said\nEighty percent of people interested in meeting with a farmer to discuss farming or I or something that yeah we went on vacation seven out of ten think it's important to get to know the farmer\nWho grows the food they eat\nWell that's very nice I I don't pay seven out of town and say they would like to I Wonder what the number of people that actually do\nI Would imagine you would have to meet to meet the farmer on his terms as far as time of day go because they have a pretty pretty serious schedule\nAid and he doesn't drive a truck that said I'm a farmer guy I talked to me every guy stuff growing out there yeah yes yes\nUh Seventy three percent of the people interviewed view locally sourced foods as very or extremely appealing I couldn't agree with them or I'd rather have food look\nOkay but once again ray you say that like there's not limitations there we live in the middle of a desert where there are many many many things that you can grow here mhm that will not grow\nSo we have to have some kind of cooperative yes we need ... California\nEverything is a role\nBut then again look at the state and expands almost a hundred miles\nI don't think there's one thing you can't grow in California I don't know of any one thing that can last big lower enlisted amazing ah um farming state from avocados strawberries are too yeah bananas but once again it's a hundred\nMiles oh you know\nSo the fact that there's different climate zones across that eight hundred miles if you go from the tip of Florida to New York city\nThere's a difference\nYeah yeah that's right and see a strictly the kind of a distance that you're talking about their own less than that yes basically from the tip of Florida or or from\nThe main um yeah it was like Caroline is Halloween is coming on the topic or you know a lot more yeah by the way Twenty one years ago today John Denver and killed a plane crash on already like California and then the experimental plane\nOr Shariah right at this stage where you\nUm we see is the emergence of a very we're way over brown shirts party\nBecause he used the term for people who environment of Germany went\nDumb and his troops by brute force\nHe can't win\nMy judgment when\nAre anti democratic\nThere are ways will destroy it\nI think that faced with that kind of opposition so some of us have an open public debate I think if people don't hug Eric Holder Hillary Clinton to allowed to impose their will\nThink has profoundly wrong\nIt should only be that easy yeah you know I mean if you like one side you know it's so much easier to be a sports fan\nYou know and just say well let's say I really liked the quarterback better for the eagles than for the New York giants sure okay and and as well within your limits but just to say well one side's oil is right and the other side's always wrong\nOh yeah yeah and you know it really has disappointed ridiculous something that we're seeing more and more of and I'm a that is um\nDifferent political figures in different places and they're being harassed I'm close to violent situations are that have been happening I'm disappointed me very much in in just in humankind\nYou can have a disagreement you can agree to disagree\nBut when people harass you out of a restaurant or they harass you out of a public place it's so on becoming and so unproductive\nAnd just the last two weeks in a row and alone what they did Ted Cruz and what they did to Sarah Sanders should not be done to any body yeah this has no party lines are restrictions it's so just last long it area absolutely wrong\nOkay who me yes I'm a realist no you're not you're a cynic okay I Am sure that we will get through this period\nI Hope will moderate back to the middle because that's the way a pendulum works it goes all the way to one side and the swings back and goes the other way and that is swings back and onward we go\nAnd I honestly do believe that we will swing back to moderation that we will once again become more civil that we will become once again more homogenous\nThan we will maybe even get closer together then there'd be ... ever before\nI Would only hope so at this point I don't know how that could happen and we could treat others a little more graciously uh just like the protesters I get you have a point to make but during the beginning of the Kavanaugh hearings the protests that others usually arable physically removed\nFirst of all none of us heard what you are saying we have no idea what you were born here we have an idea based on news reports but you being they're shouting or over shouting people we didn't hear you was unproductive and wasn't it embarrassing in the end and maybe we even would\nAgree with you if I was in the right setting we might even be on your side on the issue you might be perfectly right but your methodology stinks okay and that's what\nIt is we are methodology nowadays is not very good by the way a very important they understand Nineteen Ninety two Brett\nBrett hits man a heart beat Rick Flair for the W.

a dozen a U.S citizen is being held in Turkey we don't have any hard evidence here but the timing does look awfully awfully interesting and maybe not so coincidental that at the same time as we have this incident with a ... show\nStates which has been suffering over the past couple of years and by the way that is a Daniel hopping former CIA guy Fox News contributor who knows work extensively in that area of the middle east through Iraq\nEspecially in of course Russia and he's saying listen things just to to ah to perfect here there's video of a set what they say is is how to hit squad coming in this video of the journalists walking if the Washington Post he's there to get a marriage divorce so we can get remarried\nAnd then it turns out he doesn't come out but if people leave with bags they say that they have audio of him being questioned tortured and killed\nAnd then brought out we know that he was being tried to be lured back in the Saudi Arabia because they're not happy with a lot of his columns\nJoining us to discuss the possibility that this isn't the true and if it's found true the release are the effects in our relationship with the ... with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia ambassador Robert Jordan's ambassador what she'd Saudi Arabia do now\n[noise] they need to complain\nA they have every opportunity to explain what happened ah it\nStrange beliefs to suggest that they are closed circuit TV is only on a live feed and as not recorded I Will bet my bottom dollar set a recordings are always made and should be available unless they conveniently disappeared\nAh I think there is plenty of the Saudis can do that to a uh provide more transparency to rely more cooperation and I think the U.S needs to demand that\nAre absolutely but what I mean if they know what to shake with our relationship\nAnd we are actually evaluate we are supporting them too as they try to get the who the rebels out of Yemen we support them as they try to counterbalance what we're seeing is the emergence of a run in the region why would they risk everything here's the president with us yesterday cut twenty [laughter]\nIs that in jeopardy now I have to find out what happened when I go out and we're probably getting closer than you might think but I have to find out what would happen\nAnd you know according to the report says audio and we had Bob Corker on yesterday and says that we think he was murdered ambassadors so if isn't DDT was murdered what would be the mindset that would allow the crown prince to think that would be acceptable to us\nI think it is probably a combination of extreme paranoia on his part\nAbout even the slightest dissent even moderate descent ah coupled with the belief that he has bullet proof or in the eyes of the Trump Administration and his relationship with your ... ah Saudi's position\nIn the middle east as an important ally that we do depend on a I think has led to a sense of hubris and uh uh being impervious to ah outside influence\n[noise] uh yeah and what do you think so for example a Dan Hoffman as we bumped in says listen turkey in the U.S have been at loggerheads really for the last year or so we don't like the direction of that country their economy is crashing\nSo they want to keep their pride at the same time they want to rekindle relations have not economic relations have everything else so do you think that they would benefit from a crashing of a Saturday American relationship\nI think they probably would feel they would benefit but I don't think that sense of benefit or could even possibly explain a the notion that they have cooked all this up I think that is really a in the never never land a fear right\nNow I think we have to believe what they have provided\nTheir intelligence services are among the best in the region um we have a many contracts with them and despite the fact of life\nAlly or and I think we have every reason to believe that they are coming forward here a cruise\nSo I went to you Bob Corker said yesterday cutting Nineteen\nIt just will change the relationship the warmth well dissipate uh it'll be far more businesslike and certainly there are going to be put at\nAt arm's length on many issues that we deal with them all and there's an arrogance that has developed with them over the last year and a half a an entitlement there's just something about the way they deal with us now that is very very different\nIn that ambassador to explain the city because his crime prints did his American Tour trying to tell everybody that women are going to be able to drive going to try to give people additional freedom try to be more tolerant try to allow more demonstrations why go give us that toy dog and pony above pony show but yet you haven't changed\nThe crown princes anxious for foreign direct investment foreign direct investment since the uh\nIn prison his cousins and uncles that rich Carlton a year ago\nOr has dropped off the cliff or it has gone from a seventh day in a two one billion dollars so he is anxious for foreign direct investment\nOr he is trying to put a happy face on it but bear in mind that at the same time he is allowing women to drive is imprisoning women who had a demonstrated or eggs agitated for that right he's making it clear that every privileged they receive in Saudi Arabia comes from him\nAnd not from any kind of sentimental rights and that's a very important distinction so yes she can it can point\nTo reforms which we will ... a ... show get complimented him on those reforms\nAnd let me think I Do the treasury separate issue should be going there this week for a conference\nI Do not I think a lot of the treasury secretary should not go\nTwo branches already canceled a thanks so much invested Robert George appreciate it Ed Rollins next\nTrusting the dog was point seven million K I find I'm going to teach me the station [noise]\nPeople are waking up to the fact that Beto O'Rourke Robert Francis O'Rourke is a very liberal guy in favor of impeachment once a government run health care are in favor of free college universal job\nThinks that the ... said that he can think of nothing more America and he said then taken than deciding to take a knee or at the plate of the national anthem\nThat's not a very ... Texas guy the more you get to notice a liberal the less as a moderate or the the stronger this but people have strong opinions about Bedouin strong opinions about that but at the end of the day it's going to be a red victory\nYou ... do you think to cause right there\nApps and no one of those car no one knows the country better than Carl and certainly Texas a which is where he lives in where he basically built a reputation Ted Cruz is a very strong candidate putting people forget that he actually had a very very strong campaign against Trump last dying at probably the best campaign operation\nI'm going and he's got all those people there again any him self serve a very strong candidate he's very articulate\nAnd I think a certain extent he's going to have the one that the one that's released\nYet but you know they say it reminds me of little Bush forty one he when he was a successful businessman made the transition into politics he lost a couple of races including a Senate race but they said while in a democratic state of Texas\nThis Bush guy did very well and he was tapped by the Nixon administration somebody they could join there and and begin to make his name known and they're seeing the same thing in beta O'Rourke even if he loses am I correct\nYeah absolutely they they see him as a future a national candidate or you know he's a ... is attractive the raised a lot of money\nParty a and clearly their message a which is higher taxes more spending uh is is meant totally rejected by the Trump people and I think to a certain extent will be rejected again\nBut you know the trend uh and you've tried to push against the trend when you were with Reagan the trend is a go back and push back on the party in power and so that's what the uh Donald Trump is fighting against what did the cabinet or a ... confirmation do for this race\nWhere I think I think it was such an outrageous attack a man of great the credibility and great a reputation that I think we realize aloof as a as an without discipline or the Democrats will be I mean there's there's no no end to what they will do\nAnd I like that [noise] we now know that uh I think what we're going to be some people don't realize is is we have an extraordinary ground game of the congressional committee that National Committee or some of the superPACs put ... ordinary people on the ground the races competitive races so I think if you don't see that you know national report\nThat Democrats have done very little of that and I think a certain extent they're going to pay a very or is\nThis going to be interesting and Florida you're actually going to earn the wind or not and governor Rick Scott is chief strong which he always seems to be very organized guy and Ford and knows how to do hurricanes\nThat would boost to the Senate prospects and then somehow Rhonda Santas has the congressmen who wants to be a governor show himself competent in this situation how would you invite advised the Republican are running against a Gillum\nWho has got a lot of support and even though he seems to be a failed mayor in Tallahassee how ... how would you tell them\nI think the key thing here is don't don't over in don't miss represent Gillum directly just talk about what he's done what he stands for because he is a socialist uh\nUh and I think the reality is that he he is not a credible candidate\nRon not dissent is just sort of stumbled out of the out of the box up\nMy he's got a good campaign manager there ... or ... comes campaign or her as they used to work with me in the White House many years ago and she's as good as anybody in Florida a you know as I Am very confident the Scots gonna land Scott as a very strong candidate he does very well in national\nCrisis and this is a big crisis down there is this is going to clearly give him some advantages of Nelson as very tired or his men underestimate in the past when people try to beat him I think this is his time that he's called who's\nYeah very optimistic what does it do anything but I just put it this way when you have Rick Scott as governor who did so well for two years in won reelection and has that state growing in in the black\nUh besides the red tide which he has no control over this would be a Republican to lose so far you have to say that this ... this has not done enough to win I mean a ... any such a low profile right now I don't get it\nI don't get it either you know he was a guy who basically built a very strong reputation being on Fox ah east not doing much Fox at this point in time and\nYou down they run a different kind of a campaign and uh and I think there's some disappointment a you know there's still time to go uh I mean the key thing there's there'll be as a very aggressive at the ballot program 'cause that's a very important that upstate people are already voting down there and he just hasn't quite caught fire or I Hope he does ah I like him and and I\nBut I think the key thing here is just exposing\nThem for what he is and what he wants to be wants to raise taxes or he's he's very socialistic and is this approach a being mayor Tallahassee is not what it takes to be mayor or governor of the states so\nI think that race can come back and again Scott Scott I think what is the ... but the Senate race in and if he ties himself to that race or get a ...\nA and Fitch got does when he'll be like the one of these Lindsey Graham senators he'll be part of almost ... ...\nUh also has the resources to attend and media markets state it's a lot about organizations all about the your message on television and Scott is always run a campaign sent those are all\nAround is with us now Lou Dobbs allowed me to talk to you I Know your own lady Maria too I'm very jealous of but I'll tell you I'm ... thank you and uh but I'm I'm fascinated by what's emerged and that is healthcare number one the through the entire process the controversy that Michael Cohen situation\nThe Russian situation now the cabinet situation when you ask the American people what matters most is healthcare it's a mess right now and now comes Bernie care\nBernie comes out and writes a column where he says we have to get Medicare for all\nAnd guess what they were thirty nine states that rely on a that ... will will go along with Bernie care but you know in ten years is going to cost thirty three billion dollars do you know they tried that in Vermont they had to bail out of it right away because it was on a ... a unobtainable are unsustainable do you know that doctors will get less reimbursement\nSo you're talking about a lower quality care spread out through taxpayer dollars no longer have it off from the offered from the job\nAnd the Donald Trump or to calm or somebody on the Trump staffer to come and say do you realize what everyone's proposing which leads Donald Trump to do something I think they did wrong which would support tell Democrats you can vote for him listen\nI think a lot of Democrats are going to vote Republican because I have many friends that are Democrats the main base of the Democrats get this so far\nThat will end up being Venezuela\nWould end up being Venezuela I think a lot of Democrats are going to be voting Republican\n... isn't that what he's trying to say is I'm not telling that to be a Democrat but I'm telling you your Democrats have left you\nHave an ...\nIn modern times uh let me this is the this is the Howard Dean the Bernie Sanders this is the ... the you know the party that basically wants to government to do everything for you which means you're going to\nPay more taxes I mean the premise is very simple or we're going to reduce the tax cuts are limited ate them and spend more money and that's what that's always been the formula and Trump basically is you know put his thumb on the in the dike and stop the excessive spending and basically uh you know\nLord everybody's taxes or which has got a booming economy and I think is the last two days\nOf this in the economy has benefited every American gr effectively\nAnd just go out and spell out would universal Medicare for every one will do and sixteen senators including most of every body of the centers who want to run for twenty twenty Cory Booker Kamala Harris Sheila brand and Warren have said yeah we're for Medicare for all okay it's got a hung on his when he was in the house\nIt will destroy Medicare Medicare is a very strong program it was intended for seniors wasn't in control and it it will basically destroy the system that is very effective for her and and I think to a certain extent was people realize that ... plus unlimited spending a no control whatsoever uh\nIt it just won't work or you know I think we have to fix the healthcare system I think we leave the good halfway there last time and we need to come back in the fall and then next year and ... a modification we need to do something about pre existing and what have you um when I think the reality is that what they're advocating is absolutely instructor ... program\nLet me just tell you they tried it and Bernie Sanders Vermont\nThey had a payroll taxes ... eleven point five percent income tax a nine point five percent and they still were not able to pay for everybody that's a big state with not many people and they had to back out of it now he wants to a gym down

news or the release of the\nPastor at the bottom of the hour Alex Conan A marker Rubio's former presidents communications director but now we have Geraldo Rivera Geraldo man this administration worked hard to get Andrew Brunson out the deals done he is out what do you think this does for Turkish American relations\nI think it will be very helpful I also think that it is absolutely tied to the murder of a Saturday or American journalist in uh in Istanbul it clears the way for the United states now to work with turkey\nUh you know for whatever reason maybe because she's so beautiful and young or because their husbands or you know a allegations of our husbands are notorious private life or you know I I don't know why it is but she gets none of the reference that we've traditionally

that she'd be great and is great is not given sufficient credit I I Love her I think that when you see she stunning the fact that she was shunned by\nSome in the fashion elite circles because of their\nHer husband's politics I think is really dreadful way of historically\nSeparated first ladies from the politics of their husbands we don't in her case I think this is absolutely right but she's she's really given the the short end at the stroke\nYeah we're up against each other but I just think this is the beginning of her doing their own thing and letting her go let her talk to ABC when she talks to so many people use so many things don't bring up to bring up a can only talk to this anchor dang enough let her go she knows everything she's uh she's very smart\nAnd I think she is very

[noise]\n[noise]\n\nDon't trust the challenge [noise] talk almost six point seven million ... I'm going to teach me the gas station [noise]\nYeah well but let's let's put the blame in both places grind you're well done I'd say that Bernie says things that he doesn't mean he knows it can't happen he knows that are bankrupt the country\nAnd they said that the American people fall for it and Republicans for seven years said we'll ... we'll go in and repeal Obamacare they didn't get it done right so and maybe everybody needs a reset but I won't points I agree with you on this Bryant\nThat health care is too important to too many people to not realize that it's an issue that we have to face right eye you and I I think would prefer a technology competition\nMore opportunities we don't want a single payer even sliding towards expanded Medicaid or anything but we got to have something right and we got to use we got to leverage technology I think Trump will be game for trying this you know try to leverage technology competition and and what we can do but\nYou're right we got to face it and and the Republicans haven't done it and by the way it's one thing the Democrats no they're running on that a little bit they're running and saying hey those guys are supposed to do something they didn't do it\nSo it is a problem that's got to be faced I Hope that the president knows that\nSo Bernie Sanders tries to roll this out and twenty four teen in his state of Vermont\nHe tries to roll out of the Web and point five percent payroll tax plus a nine point five percent income tax and with more increases coming even progressive couldn't get single payer up and running for only six hundred and twenty five thousand people they had to abandon it by twenty six\nEighty boaters rejected the referendum to set up a sign co pay or in Colorado\nSo what is going on and the Republicans might not have the answer would they have to find a way to underline what Democrats thinks the answer is it doesn't help anybody doctors get paid less ruled that will leave the profession\nRight well and the problem\nMe and they see healthcare is a mess so I you know I well I agree you got to try to explain how crazy Bernie is and how men more importantly how bankrupting his vision is you know as you point out one of the things people don't realize yes it would cost trillions of dollars but\nIt would also take out of your hands decisions about healthcare you want to see people write tell them they can't go to their doctor they have to go to the doctor over there I mean people so this is and that's the thing that's really damning about this socialism\nOr that they're doing is they take away from the individual control you have to give up control of things you care about but I I got to tell you\nI I look I I think it's just pure politics the Democrats know that got an issue that's kind of a wedge than Republicans don't have a good answer that you can explain in one sentence or one\nUh one image and so we got to get through this election and they better step up and do something about it\nYeah so the president so when you look at the numbers and talk to your people yeah what percentage would you I Know what you want you want to Republican control everything but what percentage do you give the Republicans were holding on to the house first\nWell I look I've been somebody uh Brian you you maybe you won't be too surprised I've been saying it's going to be a truck red wave since January and the reason why is because I I'm from Missouri right in Missouri they told me the polls told me on the day before election\nTrump was gonna win Missouri by four percent he won by Nineteen percent I see nothing that has taken away from the coalition of Republicans and I see a lot that's taken away from the Democrats so I\nLook I think they hold the house I might be honest I think the whole house a hundred percent I actually think they're going to hold the house with exactly what they have or maybe more I noticed people think I'm Crazy\nBut I don't think anybody understands how the bottom look\nThe other thing Phyllis Schlafly my old boss who's to say late Phyllis Schlafly one of the best thing she ever did was run for Congress\nAnd lose and I ran twice and lost my cell you learn how campaigns go at this point in the campaign you can't really change the trajectory of the race she just got to kind of tweak it\nJust no attraction and they get to do it I tell people give me one reason I Do the old Tracy Chapman's I'll give me one reason to be a Democrat tell me one reason maybe healthcare that's what they say but not really so I think it's about a hundred percent they hold the house to be honest\nI Want you to read the wall to said in the from the cook Political Report you said listen the way we are right now no one's listening to each other we're on a separate corners ... to\nThis becomes about which team are you on are going to be on the red maggots had team or you're going to be on the other team and the entire a Trump presidency has been basically about picking your side picking your team\nAnd for ... to put the red hat on then he literally as saying I'm going against my team\nAnd there is a backlash to that and the same way that Republicans who said or people who were normally read going to the blue team they get the criticism for doing that there is nothing left there is no middle there is not going to be a middle and this election is just going to I think\nFurther get us into these deep deep deep polar pull around the world\nAnd let you know it'll is the party in power holds power but if it's split it's going to be accusations and uh and interrogations\nWell but Brian ... missing the good a political revolution that's happening because the Republican Party is as dramatically changed I mean we chased off some of the never Trump birds who were sort of global eschew wanted a different don't you know not\nNot social conservative not conservative and much we've added a bunch of people that are working class looked for Missouri for Thirty years we had Democrats say they ran for president on it it can get part right for presidents get rid of after it was Republican got written after I got rid of TPP got us out of ...\nI mean the party that the Republican Party and the Democratic party or trance transforming\nThe problem for eighty Walter she doesn't see it but the problem for Democrats as they're transforming to a party of women and anti men\nFuture her future right now they don't have a message that doesn't last long politically so I think ... wrong I think she was wrong in twenty sixteen I think we're in a political revolution we're in a mass movement moments that people lot of people don't recognize that what's happening but that's why it's going to be so interesting after

Jersey [noise]\nAnd we actually have a picture of the Jersey or not touch turns dot com and it's a great look in Jersey it's sort of a baseball type Jersey or on the back it's got the name Trump and the number forty five on the front of it it's got the the words USA and it's got the lady liberty storage\nSomehow that is offensive in North Carolina now [noise]\nSo anyway the heart ... county schools that they've officially apologized and they said the the principal made the wrong wrong decision [noise]\nWell I Hope they learned their lesson to hear but something tells me they have not [noise] by the way the juicy that bizarre story out of 'em out of Santa Monica [noise] the ah Steven Miller who is one of the press\nIn the Hollywood Reporter have you seen this this is unbelievable I did I did my morning radio commentary on this oh the woman's name is Nikki Fisk she was the third grade teacher of Stephen Miller at Franklin elementary school in Santa Monica California [noise]\nAnd she wrote this tell all essay about Hollywood Reporter Stephen Miller was a loner who make glue that was the that was the big headline that Stephen Miller eight blow us up third grader\nWell I suspect a lot of people across the fruit and play a blue and possibly Play Doh as children [noise]\nNow all of a sudden that makes you a lot of qualified to hold public office\nNow they're going back to the third grade [noise]\nSo miss Fisk Nikki Fisk ... I Can't say the name of enough because she needs to be publicly shamed and Sean for what she has done here [noise]\nShe's a get I think she may be the poster child for these left wing propagandist disguised as school teachers that are poisoning the minds of schoolchildren and I want you to think about something you're thinking about this for just a moment\nShe was she was Stephen Miller third grade teacher in Nineteen Ninety three she is still employed we're talking about a generation of little boys and little girls brave American patriots who have possibly been indoctrinated\nAnd mentally abused by this woman [noise] miss Fisk says Stephen Miller was like the Charlie Brown and character pig pen says he was a dirty child and she complained that he had bad penmanship\n[noise] okay well it was in third grade lady come on cut the guy some slack [noise]\nSchool policy miss Fisk when she released and divulge to all of this information you're not allowed to do that and so now I'm the school district has placed this woman miss fiscal on home assignment they say she broke her rule about releasing student information [noise]\nWell quite frankly ladies and gentlemen it seems to me this woman ought to be fired\nOr you ... you know I I Am just I'm beyond frustrated and beyond tired of these public school teachers who get a little slap on the wrist every time they get caught turning their classrooms into these left wing indoctrination centers I'm sick and tired of it were graduating kids who can't even add two plus two\nAnd the reason why is because these teachers are too busy filling their minds with all of this political group\n\nThat is what this was really all about so I don't know why she was on home assignment they know they know what she did she admitted it so I say fire the lady she ought to be fired and she ought to be stripped of our pension\nThat's what ought to happen but it's not going to happen they're not going to do that and by the way\nMaybe maybe this was just me [laughter] but the mainstream media seems more engrossed in Stephen Miller eating glue and the third grade than they did what we learned that Iraq Obama did cocaine in college [noise] so what is worse eating glue and third grade and\nForce or or or doing coke and doing drugs what's worse America you don't have to answer it that's a rhetorical question\nBy the way real quick before

victim of an assassination attempt he's a survivor and you know when you go back to that ... that shooting and and what what was meant to have happened on that baseball field\nThe gunman who is a far left follower of Bernie Sanders a man who wanted to gun down not just just Congressman Steve ... he had a list of conservative lawmakers that he wanted to kill\nAnd you've got people like Eric Holder out there and Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton saying that\nYou need to get on the faces of conservatives you need to harass them you need to track them down wherever they might go [noise]\nI understand that Hillary Clinton is not calling for people to go out there and shoot conservatives but here's the problem some of her followers don't do that\nAgain we're dealing with liberals they're not exactly the most intelligent people in the world a lot of them are ... you tell them to do something they'll go out there and do it we had we you saw that last week at the Supreme Court remember we played the audio\n... that you're again liberals they can't think for themselves is called groupthink\nAnd you had one of the protesters outside the Supreme Court and she was she was chanting a

you to listen to to some of of what he run I I'm not going to read the entire thing here [noise]\nCongressman Steve ... this summer California Democrat Maxine Waters called on her supporters to harass cabinet officials former secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday you cannot be civil with members of the Republican Party [noise]\nAnd Wednesday videotape was released a former attorney general Eric Holder telling a democratic audience at a campaign rally in Georgia on Sunday they should kick Republicans when they perceive them as going low\nDespite the continued reports of politically motivated threats of violence Democratic Party leaders have worked to keep this anger burning end in sight even more harassment and violence and the truth ladies and gentleman [noise]\nBeginning with my own near death experience at the hands of the deranged shooter who sought to assassinate a baseball field of Republicans there was a growing list of violent or threatening actions taken against conservatives by Democrats [noise]\nAnd he goes through and he lists some of these threats and attacks\nLadies and gentlemen again go back to what that gunman that that Democrat gunman wanted to do at that baseball field he wanted to slaughter as many conservatives as possible\nSaid the man was shouting this was for health care as he opened fire on the lawmakers and now you

and the way of what's best for us\nI don't want them to get in the way but I don't want to discount them\nAnd that's personal and that's reasonable\nOkay as an example okay and so we didn't sell it when we were going broke there you go it wasn't that big a dominance wouldn't matter but um you know the same thing here so I guess what you need a backup from and say\nUh I like being ... about things I'm getting old I liked legacy things I like old things that other people in that I loved touched inhaled and treasured I like having those things in my life I was a little bit difficult to be nostalgic about its large\nOr is this got a lot a lot like a lot of land with it is it multiple generation or is it just a subdivision house and I happened to be where he grew up\nIt um does heavily on Monday and that's where he grew up and the issue comes than rat I Would love to have the house\nRight now are on mortgage is very affordable and that's how I Wonder how right but I just got paid

David take seven hundred for a friend of mine was telling me that that thousand dollars that works for a given mhm that I have to pay taxes on that at the end of the year and I was just wondering if you were true\nThat is true that is not given us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they'd likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that day for gays oh okay so what's your household income\n[noise] um [noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand is here\nOkay let's let's say you're a ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend\nIf you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight\nAnd so it's still a good deal which you're going yeah yeah your I have about two hundred dollars per thousand\nSo that is forgiven that hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you if they don't you have no obligation too\nForgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine and send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so\nYeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have in in addition to that now if you had a large returning coming because you're over withholding\nWell then in that case so you're just

mhm we could transfer they're still have both of our jobs they've she quits also we our health insurance goes to my health insurance which is a lot more expensive than hers mhm and so what does your wife make er about thirty two thousand a year ...\nAnd I make around forty okay\nYou know she's not going to ... for daycare on that when they lose money she basically be working for daycare and health insurance but mainly yeah um I mean it's not going to end just not twenty five hundred dollars a month but it is probably going to be a you know Fifteen hundred isn't it\nYeah it comes out the Eighteen 'cause one will be born you know coming out to be so ... yeah I'm All right uh ... and what do you do for a living I'm In sales or my wife works for the state what do you sell a pest control

Would want to decide where idle Leo's\nBased on some formula other than\nDecide where you live based on the quality of life based on I Want to be near family based on the job that I Want is their land we figure out a babysitter\nI'm it sounds like you're following mom around a little bit I don't mean that in a negative way I mean it's yeah it's just a baby sitter thing is drawing un and it feels like that's the wrong way to make this decision I'm not sure it's a bad decision\nBut I I yeah I think it might be arrived in the wrong way and and so it wouldn't help your next time so I'm you know I started asking myself okay you know ten years from now when these kids are our early teens\nUm and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically\nA show a is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that we try to take the other way we want you to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one woman should get reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of debt because when you don't have any payment you know what you have money\nThe bar or a slave to the lenders so no we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit you to use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the car worn out to the point it's going to give me trouble\nSo the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it in other words a hundred thousand miles dodge neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point I don't even know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay it's not called smart anymore so I just give you that\nA higher in nicer vehicle or they're typically well built I mean ... again Honda Lexus a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um\nThe larger body Ford products forge building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck afford truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing you think about that ah it's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we can depends on your budget and how nice car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or know got got about fifty something on it\nAnd um so it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day\nAnd um\nSo you know you just you're looking at your situation to\nWhat is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't you know I can I just I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how are you\nHey they I think my cough Sherman what's up I'm Seventeen years old and I cook a near I've got about three thousand dollars and then the cat out donating should I invest in my view what China then you're going to college\nThe community college within a cause for him and ... and the olive tree okay so you're only going to do two years and years and then ending on how the program ... maybe ... service the fibers maturity and I keep program at the community college of either you write out in the workforce\nBe a wise investment I agree with that on crime so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer you weren't being on or whatever okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus um\nCan invest it ah here's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to ten and a nine point nine\nFinish college and all your education was he wrote that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and has a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know may I talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account to stage\nA with this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree and your field of study\nWhether it's a two year whether it's certifications and the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools and your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream without any that\nAnd that three thousand dollar spin on that is more important than but then the mutual fund and so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump\nThanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nI'm great Dave it's an honor to speak with you you too sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward than ... percent for retirement and we're using the excess our budget to\nPay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our gross take home pay into our dilemma is when we save an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we already contribute we don't have much left over from August coloration\nSo when we say ... percent were able to save a lot for a mortgage toleration though is it okay to do that or him recommend saving their twenty four percent\nNow the the mandatory amount that you're putting in a ... or you invested in that is that uh are you choosing an investment for that or as a pinch and\nGet the answer is no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct I have to wait till I'm sixty seven oh okay ah and it's nine percent nine percent\nSo the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct correct okay I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like the pinch and we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd a don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly runs state and now we're bending them those guys [laughter] uh yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a full nine what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we Canada's or for then that means we need to put it in ten percent right\nYou got a million that you know have a choice\nPicking the failure of the teachers pension and Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there you know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and go round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it you know a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction show I'm\nI'm you know go do it\nThat that's that's what I Would do a backing off a little bit\nAppreciate your joining us

better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] okay so the husband and I have for rental got to pay for and he came home last no earlier that same got during one can I get one but I'm the mortgage and this one well we're in the process of mortgage that we have a construction law now\nAnd we are in the process of turning it into a regular market but I didn't have a bad feeling about it and I'm thinking about it\nAnd wait until we can get another one without mortgage I just don't feel good about it\n\nBut he he wants to ... and he doesn't get that yeah you know because I'm a property manager\nHe said it's up to you yeah buddy bought it without talking to you\nOh no no he bought it we agreed on line I mean it together and okay\nSo you agreed on the purchase and now you're thinking you don't want the debt\nOr rent it twelve hundred in them\nWe were oh Ninety two thousand and\nThen you have a four hundred dollar mortgage\nA four fifty seven yeah we did not escrow Texas or you sorry\nWhat did you do an adjustable rate thirty year\nUh we did it or ... well we wouldn't do it that we haven't did anything today mhm\nDo you have any money [laughter] [laughter]\nWell we have um\nNo not really ...\nOkay I'm In I assume you can sell it and make money on it it sounds like right now All right\nYeah we can we put money on that front cut they on debt\nIs um and now we could probably make about ten to Fifteen Eli outright but you know when we do the math and we can make that and you know two or three years like in Iran but not really because we would have a mortgage on it oh ... I was just going back and forth\nYeah so what ... did you pay off\nWe paid a ... like that I think of a Home Depot credit card mhm and my mom I don't remember\nOkay here's where I start um I I start with the premise that somewhere down inside of you all but it's not there all the time my\nPremises is the shortest way to become wealthy is to have no payments\nAnd use your assets and your income to invest and grow things that have no pain much I'm In the show the shortest way is not to borrow because if the shortest way was to borrow you'd go to this deal like Tom's tend you do ten more of these right\nOh yeah and our friend who's doing it I don't want that\nI stopped contributing to a four one K. and I've got a beginner baby steps\nCould do for my family right now what's your household income but a hundred thousand okay\nShow can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school\nAnd stop the studio is if we don't if we're not as aggressive on a these rental properties as we in the past couple of years okay if you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into that I Would rather pay get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is our ... and the plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess that is needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to be going to college to here in the next few years\nYou know we'll buy buy baby steps for five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement five is kids college which you enter cash flowing in this case\nAnd a six is payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth a but really um you know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to pay on your mortgage is\nYeah which is stupid in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think a lot of our Confederate that we should just save up a of a three three maybe four month emergency fund that then yeah\nAnd then and then ... then stopped taking out student loans\nAnd clear him out and then do the same with the other day and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there is money above that then we start throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two but it sounds like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nThe sixty Seventy thousand hippies okay or the moral fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen ... yeah yeah and for what was the only ones only twenty five I was going to write them a check like a year from now ... if yoga and my son is still take out a low\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay Hannah there was one in there somewhere to make that math work alright [noise] ah yeah still I'm just going to plink along on those minimums and take her college without that first once we got college without that\nThen we find money we throw it up at the public will knock out a little twenty five one out and then I'm a ... house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\nWell how about ... back in the oil and K. or not\nDo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now\nNow okay yeah well no as soon as you get your emergency fund right yeah emergency fund as maybe step three and then maybe step forwards Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals and the house\nThat's your order of attack baby steps four five six in order\nActually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then if there is money left we keep going down the list in the next thing on the list is mortgages ... is that so there's still a power as Asian even though it simultaneously is that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead for skipping tree or two and three I guess technically you're skipping five are skipping five of yeah yeah yeah and you had any skip three to yeah [laughter] yeah\nSo yeah you don't want you back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nI mean it's an honor I talk to you how can I Do what\nFifteen I'm by no there is not an ill in our area [noise] um we just lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [laughter] we've had only one showing we've had hundreds of heads on line [noise]\nUm [noise] what we're struggling with here's we paid one fifty for the house\nThe average stays on the market and my area as three hundred and sixty nine [laughter] good\nLord what is rural area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania\nWe have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half million [noise] um and then ... and so that's a vacation because it's on lake\nWe're on water on a on a stream but I'm a realtor than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know so you're not in our house in Harrisburg proper them\nNo no I'm In like northeast yesterday a near near New York border but so your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yes\nDummy three sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in\nI mean and all that says is you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff\nRight and you just have a limited market I don't know what to do your other than\nA is there anyone in the resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort\nIs or is or a a real her up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere the kind of specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the have stepped down by ...\nNot purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort area the higher and stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a high fleet in the military I mean we had a professional photographer it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these ... it's so rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise] we need to get it where we have an hour drive to work we can't can't do it anymore you know okay I mean kids you know well on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like that we just say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices your problem you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at it\nThey're looking at it on line\nOr they're just workers they're not they're not clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through and they when they realize where it was I walked away they were not client's\nLocation killed him was not the house and it was not the brush\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours his sold for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the lot you know\nBut he found a buyer where most too I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one I mean why pick another real yes\nThat's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses\nThat when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house in just gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the person that can do that\nThis is that the people that are gathering\nAnd that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you and not a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't work this area\nThey and they don't have the potential buyers for it you need to it's a very unique\nSemi rural somehow resort situation\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches or being reported every day and hundreds of millions of people about their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy that I've seen firsthand when people are
