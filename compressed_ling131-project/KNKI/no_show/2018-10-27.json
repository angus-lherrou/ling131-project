no no you didn't have hit it today because otherwise I mean what's to say you didn't tape all of those in in one day\nAnd in skip out for the rest of the week we are going to the thirteenth thinning Red Sox and the Dodgers tied at one apiece Nathan baldy comes in a clean inning and the red Sox have now used poor cello Rodriguez Kelly\n... here mourns price kimbrell Henry and now you're older you probably as at least one more inning in him I don't really have anybody else laugh no that's the thing you're looking at why do you do they have left you start looking at what's been broken down for this\nGame and\nI don't know that there's I mean we've got to do the count I don't think there's anybody left I ... I mean it's it's very difficult I don't know that they have I mean the Internet has may actually have to pay it well here's the thing the Dodgers\nHave been much more economical they found a way to just you five pictures\nSo I got a seven innings of a gym out well yeah that's all all those years ago and it goes for cell only went for two thirds even though they only gave up one run right yeah viewer do seven which was phenomenal gets more and him in a second chance and goes to buy as goes to the mass Alexander a combined to pitch the twelfth ending so\nThe daughter saw some guys left but man I'll tell you what the Red Sox\nI didn't really you you you may wind up staying then intend to already ... to put them in the giving it up at the pitcher has a long time ago this is a battle one of those war of attrition is right now as we go to the top of the thirteenth and I thought UCLA game coming along\nOh I don't come on if you're watching UCLA come on man really\nWant to joke that was made earlier and I thought I'd do it\nEditor does though are we are more of the love Kevin Iran is showing for\nMadison Square garden because if you don't believe me it's the top story on ESPN dot com right now and many other websites the love Kevin Iran has shown for MSG and the next and their fans after his twenty five point fourth quarter explosion\nIn their one twenty eight one hundred victory but before you get to that a couple of quick things from the game because there are really when when you're going to break this game down right now or is it thirteenth ending there are five really big things to talk about in this game\nWhere they can slide show out of their trudging choice she started the first thing let's\nGo Walker bealer yeah Walker bealer seven innings no runs we set up the other night ... said\nGame three will go to the Dodgers Walker Biller is ready he's going to pitch a phenomenal game he reminds me of Jacobs ... three years ago when the ... was just starting to become the pitcher he is now which is the best pitcher in baseball the same kind of mental makeup\nThat Jacob ... why watch Jake rom go into Dodger Stadium\nIn game five and twenty Fifteen and it was the ... and ... is he going to win it was a ... and it was oh my goodness what is going to happen in ... won the game three two didn't have as best stuff\nBut mentally I knew he is going to be an absolute superstar I see the same thing out of Walker bealer come into the games and I didn't get the win but down to zip in the world series seven innings no runs he is so mentally strong he gives up or run it doesn't affect him he's going to be an absolute superstar\nI think the biggest thing when you're looking at your tonight with his seven shutout innings is how it started twenty six pitches in that first inning would have been very easy for that to start a gift and we'll start just get a little bit loose because we've seen that from others\nThat it it starts to build on itself and here\nI don't know what the change of philosophy was for the red Sox thinking they were going to be able to to get a good pitch to hit first ball swing and quite often they didn't work the count as deeply\nAs I thought they might right no yeah a lot of guys and aggressiveness against the younger pitcher thinking you're going to make the mistake but he went and he dealt like he was a five or six year veteran rubber before this game the biggest means that we're going around were pictures of him with his sister\nIn the crowd and watch the game last year going hey how about the world series what do you you know hashtags is whatever whatever he'd use so I made a difference of each year makes we're now you've got a guy who's got to be your stopper\nWho's got to be your stop her down oh too and this young age and he comes in and he pitches lights out baseball for seven innings again the rarified Arab two hits zero runs zero walks in seven plus it was Roger Clemens back in two thousand\nWe sure can't trust her to be our senator\nPaid for by women to W.

red Sox lead the Dodgers\nScoring the go ahead Ron really on a slow drip blurb between\nThe pitcher's mound at first base [noise] Alexander couldn't get there in time to first base the overthrow and brought Cole scores all the way from second\nTo give the red Sox the lead they are still ... in the top of the thirteenth standing with two outs to in Florida now and for the Dodgers and the red Sox we'll go to the bottom of the thirteenth standing\nAt the worst one run up trying to close things out now before we get to this whole play that happened\nI assume you of all the will come in for another inning of working through team pitches in the last inning and the red Sox let's face it just about out of guys so uh it looks like that's where the ninth picture of the night you know I Would assume Bruce first\nWill come in or if something happens with ... but you know the funny thing is is why are the the red socks on the cusp of going up three games to none is you can talk about analytics\nAnd all these different reasons and and and why the red Sox and why the Dodgers haven't won and all this and again it's not over it's two one thirteenth any Dodger still have their last stuff's coming up maybe merry heart will bat look just cause I referenced the foreigners law for so long that Jerry doesn't mean that the Dodgers season has\nThere come on now but the reason the red Sox are winning is as we talked about this after game too you can cut things up many ways and talk about analytics and yes and some of the decisions the Dodgers have made of backfired on them analytics wise\nBut bottom line is the red Sox have just been a little bit better than the Dodgers in every aspect of the game they're starting pitcher has been a little bit better their bullpen has been a little bit better they're lined up for a little bit better\nBut the other thing that was happening is all the fifty fifty plays the red Sox were making and all the brakes of the game seemed to be going the red Sox way\nTurner and Jack Peterson can't get there to pass it into the seats for a double what it should have been caught that elves turning into a three run Homer and that's something you go okay that was a break but what can you do\nThis play right here I could go down as the biggest player of the world series was just something that was bad luck for the Dodgers right because you had a hit\nThere what you're doing is having trouble already batting because he just went ... cattle and when he hit the ground on bravo called steel of second base they had to stop play for a couple of minutes while they made sure he was okay he hits a seeing eye dribble or in between the mound and first base\nAnd what happens Alexander who is a lefty has to come\nAway from the from the ball you know ... he finishes away from where that fall as it is now he's got to come back and get it match months he's playing so he comes in to try to get the ball and as a result it's\nAll laid coverage over to first base and the ball gets flip that it goes\nInto right field and hope comes all the way around a score that's one of those places where it's just more you want to lay blame and go why didn't date Roberts walk pneumonia put set up a force and all these things you could say but really it was you had a left handed pitcher he falls off the mountain the other way\nAnd you had a play where the first baseman is not playing as far as he is all of these things happen and it was just it just happened it's a fifty fifty play and it went the red Sox way\nWell convergence and a lot of things and then the cost to first base just high enough\nTo be a over the outstretched Arman ... Hernandez and enroll to give hope the opportunity to score in it and that just did it literally a game of inches because if the ball field it even if the safe right in in even if New Years is safe at first base my runners up the corners yeah\nYeah that's that that's an allied whether you're walking full go or whatever instead you've got to one and now\nIn the game ... up was over five tonight a base hit to write put runners at first and third the Dodgers intentionally walk the bases loaded so now Flora trying to get out of a real Big Jim where instead of one run in the bottom of the thirteenth and you can see just fan streaming for the exits\nAt Chavez round merry heart though not married you're going to need all the answers to the end I guarantee you she will stay until the head now if I went over in the last couple of minutes to try to figure things out and it looks like the only two players who hasn't gotten this game yet or ... and ...\nThose are the only ones who have not gotten in this game yet so that for the red Sox so that's where you're at for the red Sox\nOnly those too and you know sales not coming in 'cause at this point so we have to pitch them off you know so this is where this is where things are at right now as we go to the bottom of the thirteenth ending the Dodgers get out of it bogus looks like you hit a little dribble or just in front of the\nPlan everybody stood around trying to figure out what was going to be called Austin\nBars just grabbed the ball and stood on home plate so Dodgers get out of the inning so little break right there was like one of those numbers it just spun and stayed in the dirt\nYeah we'll we'll see it on replay I'm sure when they get back on the Fox broadcast but certainly a curious and she knew what looked like it could be an explosion happened in in any Dodger fans exhale\nNow and then realize this couple of things you know a couple of names or what we get here sometimes because we're trying to do the show and watch the games on our TVs maybe we don't get it right or what does that but we're like you're getting the gist of everything that is going on and situations are All right but sometimes you know like when you see players you know\nFluctuating in and out you know I've been a lot of moments that guy that we're in our scorecard are no longer in the score and try to keep track of who's in right field out who's at second base right now but this is where we said that and you had to close\nSo I had over baby hour we celebrate with you raised in or a fourth or fifth cups of coffee or getting deep into the\nGame [noise] meanwhile while this is happening in the end of the world series could really be going on right now\nJust make sure you say series a little closer their Siri end of the world series series [laughter] like oh no backup junior just head but at the fed him and electric\nFan like that like that yeah exactly I Know that was one of your best teases in recent memory look we've been talking all that and the cat the two big stories that well the three big stories we could replace with Phil Jackson's sound drops below and Marty the cat and that might be a better show\nOh Cady\nThey were on that poster together oh have you know the although I think I ...

God's laugh\nPrep first show only to stare up at a TV and realize the world series is still going on on a World Series is approaching six hours long\nUm it looked like the red Sox had had that we're going to pull away a went the extra innings or the red socks on a on a fielding air by kittens blur\nA scored max Muncie in these Thirteen dating or they have just gone to the top of the fourteenth\nOr the red socks went down uh in order and the top of the fourteen or I Believe they gotta walk but the red Sox did\nCome away scoreless in the top of the fourteen so now we're going to the bottom of the fourteenth\nAt Dodger Stadium [noise] um\nThis is one of the crazier games that I've seen and I was planning I'm thinking of okay what do we open a new you know something interesting happens would definitely talk about the world series early on\nYou know if something else has gone and then the more this game ... kept going on and on and on and it's playoff baseball and there's pitching changes and there's match ups and ships and all the other chaos that goes on with major league baseball games in the postseason the more you realized [noise] yeah\nAnd the Dodgers\nAre tied to a piece a bottom of the fourteenth Nathan of all the who was projected to be the game for starter for Boston was brought in a couple innings ago it looked like he was rolling he's been dominant so far in the postseason he was dominant in his first appearance\nAnd the Dodgers were able to scrap together a couple of runs the air helped a smart running by a base running by max months the he got the second on a ball that was caught out of a\nAt a play and and falling into the stands by a Red Sox player um so now we've got one out in the bottom of the fourteenth and I have no idea how ... how long this game is going to go on the red Sox have used every buddy they've gotten their roster\nUm the Dodgers ah I I Believe I saw ... warming up I Can't come from that um the rumors are chant ho park is on his way to the stadium I have no idea who the Dodgers plan to bring out um but right now as it stands this game is approaching six hours and we're still playing baseball\nAnd here's here's the thing about the\nMajor league baseball postseason and trying to repeat or trying to make long runs when you've done it before\nDallas ... after the Astros won the world series a year ago there was a quote that he had before this started this season and they asked him about a World Series hanging over you know because the cubs dealt with it then next year and Dallas ... had a quote along the lines of\nWell [noise] you know I'm ... we're not the cubs we've got better players\nAnd that's probably true and if you were to look at Houston and you were to ... it can compare their roster and their line up in their pitching staff against every other team in major league baseball you what state it outside of Boston\nHouston had the best line up in the best roster and major league baseball they were done in five games in the ... which he is\nAnd when you factor in how many deep runs to the post season the Dodgers have made\nWhether it's going to the NFL cs in twenty Fifteen going to the end I'll see us in twenty sixteen going to the world series a year ago and losing on in a seven game at\nDodger Stadium and then coming back this year starting off sluggish having to play an extra game to determine where you're going to be placed in the postseason against the Rockies then getting into the post season and now you find yourself after playing a Thirteen and game against Milwaukee last week or the week before\nYou find yourself now in a minimum of eight fourteenth inning game to save your season because if the Dodgers lose this game it is a rap\nTickets for game for Dodger Stadium are going to be a bottom on the shelf bags cereal prices are at Dodger Stadium\nAnd so now we have it it's going to be two outs or for the Dodgers now two outs in the bottom of the fourteenth a runner on first base ... Hernandez with the base it I mean this is and it gets what the New England patriots that never gets talked about enough\nYou want to know why the patriots are able to continue to have success and continue to make deep runs in the postseason a lot of people will tell you well it's you know because they've got the greatest quarterback of all time or that's fair\nYou can you can talk about Tom Brady he did listen talent is always going to rule out in most situations town is going to rule out and so you look at Tom Brady and you go well he's the greatest quarterback of all time so that that really is a big advantage for the New England patriots okay ah they've got the greatest coach of all time\nSo that also is an advantage for the New England patriots All right fair enough you know what else they also have almost every single time they make a deep run in the postseason\nUp by weak and at least\nThey don't deal with as many games as other teams do when they make deep runs in the playoffs\nSo the patriots who play in the AFC East where they are dominating and have been dominating for ten straight years not only when they're division and are guaranteed hosting a playoff game but more often than not they get a bye week before they host the playoff game\nLike fatigue is a real thing it's why there's such thing as a rookie wall when rookies get into the into the NBA Jason Tatum of the Celtics dealt with hitting the rookie wall those guys are used to playing what thirty games\nThirty five games that they make a deep running in in the NCAA tournament and now all of a sudden you factor in travel and you tack on fifty games plus who knows what they do in the postseason\nLike we can all say that these guys travel and luxury and they're put up in the best hotels but I I don't know about you a forty five minute flight from LA to Las Vegas and I need a shower and a nap\nThese guys are traveling all over the country they're going to play a for at least a fourteen in a game and now it's going to be Fifteen in and game 'cause the fourteenth just ended\nAnd then they're going to be asked to come back and play again tomorrow and potentially the day after that\nI mean I don't think it gets enough justice I don't I don't think these guys get enough credit for having to deal with what it is that they deal with and the grind of long playoff runs and when you get there and you don't win it\nYou give up a golden opportunity because so many things have to go your way to even get that far it's why I was so impressed with the Atlanta Falcons from a year ago just think about the psychology of the Atlanta Falcons mentally if there was any team that could fold up shop\nOr as we are now uh now waiting to see how this one wraps up and finishes up there so\nThis is a insane I'll be I'll be honest man it's kinda cool oh you big shots who work on Monday through friday is all you big shots\nNay game ah or you're doing that you know working Monday evenings and you get Monday Night football on this show got the world series\nWe didn't just land Hawaii football this time around because Hawaii plays San jose state at twelve twelve am local time in Honolulu\nNow we got the world series here on weekend overnight damn straight this is the biggest I'm not kidding I said this earlier this was the biggest moment for this show\n'em because up to this point the biggest moment that we had on this show is we were on the air when OJ got out of jail\nAnd so now we've got the world series and it's an it's a classic that's going to be talked about for years to come and game three\nOr as the red Sox are looking to a drive one of these runs in and take the lead and hopefully take a three nothing series lead I'm All right so I Do want to welcome in the crew here they're going to be joining us a until six am eastern time here writing shock them with me on Fox Sports radio\nLadies and gentlemen he's your technical producer he's your favorite Iowa Sam in\nThis

to nothing hung on Saturday\nI mean because it was about this will be the most of waiting loss maybe and franchises only to have your a superstar closer blow it in the eighth inning they score a run on an air the doctors come back a score on on an air it's one of the craziest one of the craziest to to to ties I've ever seen\nYeah it's not this is a this banana land what's happening in this game and so we'll see um see how it shapes up because and and I feel for whoever loses oh you you have emptied the chamber so to speak to try and win this game and then to expect to come back tomorrow and bounce back and try and try and get one again I I think is a tall atoll laugh\nAnd a lot a lot of damage being done to the red Sox because they're projected starter for Saturday was in the game of all let me through fifty plus pictures I Believe\nYeah so now a Boston it's got to figure out who's going to be next up in the rotation to go tomorrow yeah um now we did mention a brand new addition to

slash match limitations apply\nSo we in this game are now going to the bottom of the fifteenth ... just struck out with two men on and so we go to the bottom of the fifteenth I feel terrible for Dodger and Red Sox fans\nEspecially if you're at the stadium because they stop serving beer about two days ago in this game so you now have to deal with this and there's nothing worse than having a buzz feeling like you're approaching\nThe the crescendo\nOf your business only to find out that you're going to be stuck in the stadium for another two and a half hours and they're not super serving booze anymore what a miserable feeling for Dodger fans and Red Sox fans that are at this game\n'cause look it helps man you got to take some of the edge off you got to calm down a little bit you know you're you're like if you're watching at home you're you're you're perfectly fine\nIf if you stocked up and you did all your pre planning and you bought enough booze and enough beer and alcohol to to to get you over for the entire game you're good to go but if you're at this game\nThat is a nightmare scenario\nThere's nobody likes the tiredness after a couple of drinks so you've got to fight through that the that post to beer tiredness so you got to have your number three and then once you get to be your number three it starts to become you you wouldn't have beer start to become one [noise]\nAnd then when you get to fear for ... and then get to be your five then you can really start to feel what it is your night or your evening is going to look like and the fact that they are no longer going to have that you've got a lotta tired people I think I see some empty seats\nAnd to not have any dog in the fight to not have anything to do with the red Sox with the Dodgers a fan because I don't know how they deal with it major league baseball the playoffs in major league baseball World Series AOL cs and I'll see as wild card it takes so long\nAnd it's like death by a thousand cuts and the emotional rollercoaster that these two fan bases have dealt with in this game I Want no part of\nUm good over here I'd rather win fifty games and not ever going to the post season I'd

[laughter] [noise]\n\n\nSo I think I've identified why it is a lot of us have a certain NFL quarterback I'll explain who that is and why coming up here and just a few minutes you're on Fox Sports radio Jonas knocks here on a bus or you can check out the show in the eye heart radio lab you can listen to us on serious ... channel eighty\nThree and on all of our Fox Sports radio affiliates wherever you are we appreciate a few minutes your time here as he can be alive from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios or Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance visit guy go dot com poor free rape quote um\nThe world series game three is still going on\nAh this is the game that started at two o nine in Hawaii friday\nAfternoon two oh nine before happy hour kicks off in most places in Hawaii this game was still going on\nUm we're now a a little after three am eastern time and this game is still happening it is the longest game and the history of major league baseball's post season the red Sox and the Dodgers are tied at two of peace talks\nThe Boston Red Sox um this has been craziness a Walker ... looked great for the Dodgers\nAre can lead Jansen was brought in in the eighth inning ah he gave up with a one nothing lead a home run a tying home run to Jackie Bradley junior with two outs ah winter extra innings it looked like the red Sox had taken command of the game they were up to to one\nAnd then they even loaded the bases\nAnd there was a little uh a slum or I guess you would call it I don't even know a dribble or I'm with the bases loaded ah Austin Barnes of the Dodgers picked up the ball stepped on home plate and that was the end the beginnings of the red Sox left the bases loaded but they had Nathan of all the ...\nAnd of all these been dealing\nAnd so you assume that that was going to be advantage Red Sox and then the Dodgers out a max among the walked\nUm there were a couple of hours one of them are which drove a a player for the red Sox into the stands um he fell back while he was in the stands trying to get the ball back into the field of play max Muncie with their heads up play bass running\nAdvance to second base ... was pitch to with Austin Barnes a on a next up and first base open they elected to pitch to ... they looked like they were going to win the game it was a ground ball the second base a throwing air\nBy kittens ... of the red Sox and ... months he went around to score and here we are and it is the top of the seventeenth\nA Jackie Bradley juniors just walked he is going against a a Julio Erie is is in the game for the Dodgers\nI'm so Jackie Bradley junior is now on base of for the Boston Red Sox is the red Sox are still trying to win this game a guy by the name of Christian Vasquez is now up to bat for the Boston Red Sox [laughter]\nBecause this game has gone on for so long and so many changes have been taking place that here we are top of the seventeenth two outs a runner on first and uh\nUh ... and we're still playing baseball or we're now four minutes away\nFrom a step in our baseball game and Nathan of all the is still in the game and Nathan of all the looks like he's getting better as the game's going on he's at eighty pitches and this is the guy who just pitch the other night and it was set to be the starter coming up on Saturday\nLittle did he realize he was going to be pitching on Saturday but it was going to be in friday's game\nOr this is I I'll be honest with you man most of the time we get a big time sporting event here on weekend overnight and if it's on Hawaii football it's the Australian open and who gives a rip about the Australian open or we get some some golf tournament and Dubai\nBut we don't get actual real sporting events so the fact that this game started at five o'clock local time in LA and it's still going on\nOr is is craziness so we will keep you up to date as to what transpires up between the red Sox and the Dodgers but again a bottom of the seventeenth\nThe red Sox had he run around for a space tied at two and two outs ah Alex would ah is in the bullpen warming up for the LA Dodgers the red Sox theme or just committed to the fact that they're going with Nathan of all the\nUh a guy who's had multiple Tommy John surgeries and his pitching or at eight eighty pitches in the world series after just pitching a couple of days ago and said to be the starter are coming up on Saturday So\nHere we are All right Jonah stocks up as our um\nSo I Do want to get to this because Jimmy ... who injured his knee in a game against the Kansas City chiefs um tore up ah a couple of ligaments in his knee in a season is over we have not heard from Jim ...\nOn friday and drop below talked about sort of the narrative that he may be one of these injury prone quarterbacks\n... Andrew from they don't really know if I'm Out but ah ... my whole life I've only had two injuries so it's a weird I'm not used to it that's for sure but I don't want to get used to\nHere's the part that I don't understand about what's happening with the Jimmy ... below narrative\nUm but I Do have a theory on it okay I Do have a theory on on what is happening with Jimmy ... and why he's getting crushed we're not going out of bounds in that game a lot of people gave him a hard time by the way we're going down to the bottom of the seventeenth the Dodgers get out of it are still tied to a piece in the world series amazing\nUm but here's here's the thing about Jimmy ... because he got crushed by a lot of people\nWho said he should have gone out of bounds that's just a dumb decision he made in that game\nA there is no point in trying to run back into bound to make a play the game was already out of hand what do you do on why the hell is this guy going out of bounds um\nFirst of all since when do we tell players and criticize players\nFor wanting to still play hard won a game as out of reach if you're trailing and my quarterback is still trying to make plays and putting himself in harm's way I understand why you would say well you got to be smart about it\nBut I also understand that if I'm a player in that locker room\nYou know we're better with him on the field but the fact that he's willing to take those chances and and go back in to play as opposed to taking the easy way and go out of bounds to me that the rallying aspect\nTo Jimmy ... below that if I'm a teammate I'm all about and and I actually enjoy it but I think what's what's happening here and why Jimmy ... gets a lot of the criticism that he gets because what are we talking about what is he started twelve games in his career eleven games the reason Jimmy ... gets the heat\nI think because he was a quarterback for the team in the NFL that elicits the most jealousy and the most envy by other fans he is going to be just like to buy a lot of people who can't get that image of him as a patriot out of their mind\nThat's what he's always going to be he can play a couple of years in San Francisco and he can bounce around and go to five or six different teams and you'd think Jimmy ... you're always going to see him as a New England patriots think about it\nIf there was a dude and high school who you didn't like when you see 'em at the reunion years later don't you still picture him as the a whole he was years ago\nI'll tell you like if you ever go to your high school reunion you'll see the guy that you didn't like in high school and all these years later you guys could have never spoken a word to each other and he still will be a hole in your mind you'll never be able to get that image of your mind he can be completely different person completely different guy married kids successful good human being\nSo um we're still playing baseball game three of the world series or this is your uh if if you were looking for a wall to wall coverage of the world series with an occasional pit stop to talk about a Jimmy ... a porn star\nThis is the place to go here on Fox Sports radio a game three of the world series is still\nGoing on if you're just tuning in um this game is now officially over seven hours long\nOr the red Sox and the Dodgers are tied it to a piece Alex what is now the pitcher for the LA Dodgers we're in the top of the Eighteenth with nobody out\nAnd one runner on a a walk to the first batter up in the inning and so the red Sox and the Dodgers are tied to a piece of game three of the world series and this is a huge swing game because if you're the Dodgers and you win this game and you you you pull this game off\nYou go in with all the momentum you're going to be exhausted you're going to be worn out you're going to be tired but at least you're going to be at home\nAnd at least you got that to work with as you come into the game for a later on Saturday\nWhether or not this game took a and extended amount of time to try and win if you're the red Sox you'll take your thrill lead\nYou'll go into tomorrow you'll sleep walk through that game are going to later on Saturday or sleep walk through that game and then you just take your chances and you'll you'll take your chances in game five or if the Dodgers do one game five you'll go and you'll have another couple of shots to win it\nAt Fenway Park in Boston and games six and seven but as it stands right now I mean if when you're a batter and you're over seven\nIt's not a good thing\nI'm ... now the batter\nThe red Sox have emptied the bench there's there is now one\nOut and a runner on um as ... beat out a potential double play a moment ago so the red Sox are now completely spent um Clayton cursed shah\nGot in it that last inning and flight out to right field that is how deep and far down on the bench we've gone Clinton Kirsch law actually hasn't had that in the world series again that started on friday and his blood into Saturday now\nIf if you're a big time baseball fan of like if you're a Red Sox fan on the east coast\nIt's three twenty in the morning then [noise]\nI mean what do we like at some point you gotta put the whiskey down and and you got to be thinking Dunkin' Donuts coffee right\nI get to ... you have to there's no way you can possibly do this Dodger Stadium looks pretty empty and I'm seeing some Red Sox writers and people from Boston that have traveled all the way out to LA that are that are calling out Dodger fans for leaving this game\nBecause the log it's only after midnight here local time why are you guys already leaving 'cause I I don't want to sit in a stadium where I'm exhausted because it\nNot have to deal with a noxious Red Sox fans in the stadium in ... go do that\nBut the guy who is putting on one of the great performances that you'll ever see considering the situation and considering who he is and is Nathan of all the the Boston Red Sox ... was set to pitch on Saturday he was set to be the starter for Boston they got him up in the pen\nProbably hoping if we're going to use them it's going to be for a short period of time\nHe had a lead and because we're throwing air the Dodgers tied the game and I think the thirteenth if I'm not mistaken I think it was the thirteenth dating\nUm we're at the Eighteenth now so everything's kind of a blur at this point so Nathan of all the went from I just pitched a couple of games ago a couple of days ago\nTo I'm going to be to start or on Saturday to a a go out there and close this thing out just keep us in contention and then the closest thing out once we get a lead to now not only is he still pitching he's thrown Ninety pitches\nAs a reliever in this game and he's now about to walk up and take his third it that of the game what is happening here man\nThis craziness and for all the people out there that have called up baseball because you think that the geeks and nerds who do the analytics and crunched the numbers you you you you accuse them of over thinking the game and it's not old school baseball anymore and everybody's over thinking it and now they're worried about match\nUps and all the decisions are being made upstairs I can assure you\nThis is not the ideal situation to put a guy in on short rest when he's not expecting to pitch it all let alone let alone thrown Ninety pitches when you're ... and you've already got to Tommy John surgeries and he looks like he's getting better as the game goes on\nIn a playoff game Nathan of all the and what he's doing and now we go to the bottom of the Eighteenth as the red Sox have just grounded into a double play so we're after the bottom of the Eighteenth regardless we will have officially played to baseball games in a matter of seven and a half hours\nIs an unbelievable that this is absolute craziness I don't know how fans do it\nOr it's the longest game by a mile in the history of baseball I have no idea how fans do it or if if you're an umpire\nAnd they even use the bathroom at this point\nDavid Anderson a former NFL wide receiver joined us earlier in the show and and David Anderson was accusing Larry King of wearing a diaper at this point I don't I didn't even know uh were Larry King is everything's a blur I just see a bunch of empty seats 'cause everyone's like F. this man I gotta get outta here\nGetting too late but we'll take it man we get an actual live sporting event that people care about here on weekend overnight will take all we can get it right this is incredible\nUh Kevin figures as our national update anger here it up as our Kevin figures also the voice of LA sports radio\nKevin weren't you doing a broadcast from Dodger Stadium on friday\nA viscous yes our local station yeah I was not out there I was out there for a couple of games and the previous series but yes one of our local shows pictures of money we're actually out there on\nFriday they have ... and I'm and I'm assuming that there were probably people there that just said you know what\nJust going to stick around for the game why you know why rush back to Burbank and deal with the travel just going to stick around for the game I did they realize that they were going to be sitting in the same spot now for ten uh\nA half hours now your wildest dreams [laughter] that is amazing move us down at five o'clock for the game is our five o'clock local time and you look down and it's midnight twelve thirty\nThey lose this game I'm I'm gonna feel I'm going to feel terrible for them because for all the analytics people out there that that have talked about this stuff and have criticized baseball for trying to outsmart everything and and and used to many numbers and I think the room and all that stuff made fun of all the this is not in anybody's analytical plan\nI can assure you know six innings no five strike outs Ninety pitches these at right now he's like Ninety pitches at the moment he's he's a starch and what this is at Ninety pitches and he just pitched a couple of days ago\nAnd he was set to be the starter\nOn Saturday and here he is about to throw a pitch number Ninety One and the bottom of the Eighteenth\nUnbelievable yeah and I don't even know what other words they use\nYeah and so they're they're just showing at a graphic Chris Sale has thrown the most pitches or of any Red Sox pitcher as far as starters go and he threw Ninety One in game one and that was in four plus settings Nathan of all the not projected lead to start or has just now thrown is Ninety first pitch\nUnreal yeah I don't I mean where do you now it's baseball so these guys can sneak into the clubhouse and probably get something to eat oh yeah who knows do a shot or something like that I mean I don't know what the show yeah Boston Red Sox have been known to do in the ... I Am\nThough a crafty move by um by Dodger fans and maybe Red Sox fans\nYou're seeing a lot of the seats closer to the field fill up a little bit oh yeah the old uh hey you might have we moved down there now screw it whatever\nUs and now we do have activity in the red Sox bullpen finally there's activity in the red Sox bullpen as Nathan of all the ... is still on the mound facing ... months the ah we've got a two oh pitch here are Nathan a ball the now three oh counts\nHere in the bottom of the Eighteenth let's go live\nTo our extra innings major league baseball insider Iowa same for the latest Sam\nA brutal and ... you're like if you're a Dodger fan All right Jonah stocks here Fox Sports radio or coming up next year on fs art is historical something is happening in the world of sports but is it actually historical I'll tell you what that is next year on a facade but for all the latest\nFrom around the world of sports if there is anything else going on in the world of sports it's Kevin figures now nothing anybody cares about right now we're talking about bottom of the Eighteenth ending in Los Angeles the Dodgers and the red Sox tied at two apiece for things have combined to use eight team pitchers Eighteen pictures up and use the night\nSorry for all the numbers in five four three two one I Am out of time\nThat's when the Michelin Man is on your side you know helping you sleep better and Dr Saper new Michelin premium ...\nDesigned with exclusive smart like technology or English beamed Michelin relates to the curb of your which giving you unparalleled street three long lasting off season performance\nSo when the going gets tough\nIt's a difference you can see a bill ... pep boys Amazon and other\n[noise] Saturday November Seventeen it's the first annual stop dropping run five K. race to benefit timber Mesa fire and medical auxiliary applications Fifteen sixteen north six street in show the competitive he and his at eight\nThe cost is thirty five dollars for adults and twenty five for children ages six to twelve\nOur streets register online\nT.

it takes me two hours to get home earlier in the we find out who the ... was the top of one on one was the landing strip\nWhat an idiot uh speaking of somebody who is not an idiot let's go live but to a A R celebrity gassed hotline\nSteve just said her mom and Fox Sports radio anchor Fox Sports radio reporter one of the best in the business who was at Dodger Stadium\nTo witness the longest postseason game and major league baseball history in which max months he just a few minutes ago walked off with a home run off Nathan of all the in the bottom of the Eighteenth and Steve joins us now here on Fox Sports radio Steve what the hell man\n[laughter] exactly I got to the stadium at two o'clock today you\nWeren't doing that other show in the afternoon I was here I Am I hear you're doing you're Late Show I'm Still here in fact the producer of the show before you\nAsked me at about eight o'clock Pacific hey can you come on as soon as the game goes over\nAnd I texted him back only half kidding if it ever end because I was here at the thirteenth at a uh the thirty then again one week ago and anyway I'm here at Dodger Stadium as we speak in a section to outside and\nI should be in section eight the way they've got actually you know the only regret is that I didn't set the DVR that go long enough and that I ran out of room on the scorecard but otherwise longest game of the world series history seven hours twenty minutes and Eighteen Dodger win and\nBecause normally if it's not Hawaii football it's like the Australian open as far as the sporting events we get here again overnight so the fact that this was an actual important game that people gave a rip about I was ecstatic about it I don't know how fans of either team do it I\nMean is there something about the postseason in major league baseball that is more nerve wracking than anything else and I can't put my finger on it maybe it's all the pitching changes maybe said it's one pitch at a time all the time\nBut you got to imagine the swing of emotions that the red Sox in Boston fans are feeling right now thinking you had it in a bag with Nathan of all the on the mound only to lose it on a throwing air and a heads up base running play by max months he just need crazy a turn of events in and I would think ... not a good\nA turn of events for the Boston Red Sox\nYeah that was that the press conference much earlier today would that have already as he was introduced as hey he'll be Saturday Night starter\nAnd then he said during the press conference unless that come on and relief only three hundred touches it in a really good and what's still throwing Ninety eight miles an hour or near the end by the way and I did during this game think of that exact comment that you made to be in the hallway of\nMan I'm Glad my team is not in this postseason those are great I Can't believe what the emotions going through\nI'm surprised that in the more Red Sox fans here but obviously there were pockets of them at Dodger Stadium I knew that if the Dodgers had lost tonight there would be a ton tomorrow because there was money to be had by felt like a\nGame for tickets and now instead the whole series may have turned around just like a week ago when in less than twenty four hours the Dodgers went from as close to going down three games to wander Milwaukee\nTo actually leading the theories after taking the extra inning game and then again the next day just like the Dodgers did in the Nineteen eighty eight and ... yes which is the last time they won the world series\n[noise]\nNews talk in sports for the White Mountains talk one oh six points of an\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra Boston leads the series\nInteresting ... not to you or your family and some of them call or what do you have to say about joining us now [noise]\nI don't know\nFor instance this is coming through your speaker [noise]\n[laughter] it's always\nHot and from the guy on Fox Sports radio studios here but I guess ... years and she always\n[noise]\nSo you can actually for the future guarding the NFL team multi who they are coming out momentarily here on Fox Sports radio I'm Jonas knocks\nAll of our Fox Sports radio affiliates wherever you are taking part in the program we always appreciate a few minutes your time as we can be alive you are from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios for it's\nEasy to save Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with guy go go to guy go to our comical eight hundred nine four seven auto the only hard parts figuring out which way is easier so I'm coming up or are we so we will get to a uh the NFL story here momentarily we do want to let it for those you just tuning in\nUm you saw history and major league baseball the longest postseason\nGame in the history of major league baseball and Eighteen inning affair at Dodger Stadium\nIt was over seven hours long and it was the Dodgers on a max months the walk off home run in the Eighteenth an opposite field shot who win the game I'm this courtesy of the ammo beyond\nFox Twitter account the game was Eighteen innings along a that's a World Series record all soy World Series record seven hours in twenty minutes also a World Series record there were forty six players who appeared in\nGame three ah they were Eighteen pitchers who appeared in game three that's a World Series record there were a hundred and Eighteen bats that as a World Series record and\nThen you add a Eighteen hits five runs and also a World Series records thirty four strike out in game three or so absolute craziness 'em I said it at the top of the show 'em\nThere's there is a a an old adage that if you want to make God laugh tell me your plans if you want to make sports talk radio God's laugh a prep for a show or because of something like that happens it throws everything out of whack 'em so the Dodgers game three\nFive o'clock local time start in LA figure out who's pitching\nUm ... if it's going to be a bullpen game I'm In ... was\nA phenomenal Nathan of all the through a Ninety plus pitches as a reliever projected to be the Saturday starter so absolute craziness 'em and coming up by in about a a ten Fifteen minutes from now or you're going to hear a from the the scene of the crime\nDodger Stadium some craziness going on there so we'll have that for you here coming up uh ten Fifteen minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio um I did I Do want to get to this though\nBecause\nYou can actually see into the future potentially for one NFL franchise and it's something that we don't normally get do you ever think back to certain moments in your life and wish you could ever redo just because you know so much more now you've got so much more information you're so much more experienced\nYou think back and you go man I'd love to have a redo guys do this all the time right this guy guys I guarantee you listening to this right now you at some point in your life have said\nThis man if I was in high school now [laughter] the things I Would do\nYou know like guys are are they and that just that and it's with guys that guys think about they go man if I knew then what I Know now oh man I Would I be\nJust a completely different person and the problem is you didn't know then what you know now so it's kind of a waste of time but still\nYou know you'll you'll picture what you would do differently to go back then and you use your current experiences as sort of a guide to how you would have reacted back in the day women out there you know I mean look if you're a woman out there listening to this if you knew that the guy was going to cheat\nYou know and make it a lot easier no heartbreak you move on\nYou weed them out early on you realize he's not a ... just going to turn into a scum bag you'd rather know early on\nRight but we don't all get that information gate\nThe point being if you had the right information at the moment you'd have a better sense for what things really\nAre and we have the right information now in the NFL we've got all the information we need in the NFL regarding one team won franchise it's All right here\nAnd the franchises the Houston Texans we've got it got all the information we need the Texans have won five in a row they want to get on Thursday night it's tough to do you\nGive them credit for that\nYou wouldn't five games in around the NFL I don't care who you are that's still an impressive feat that is tough to do in the national football league\nWhere teams have a more often than not a week to prepare for you know depending on a by week there are short weeks and things like that that come up but you're the Houston Texans in five games in a row you've been the Victor so you give them a little bit of credit for that\nBut instead of looking at\nThe winning streak why don't we look at the wins seek a closer look at the wins\nBecause the Houston Texans where a windowless football team and they played the Indianapolis Colts and they won that game in overtime you could just look at the W you could do that well why not dig a little bit deeper you remember what actually happened in that game\nYeah Frank right of the Indianapolis Colts\nDecided to go forward on fourth down in overtime and his own territory [noise] um and the result was Andrew Luck throwing a ground ball to as wide receiver Houston capitalizing on it and being gifted there\nMs below Brian played for the tie\nBecause he chose to kick a field goal the series before so you were gifted that when your first one of the season then you when you play the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night for your football you remember that one\nMr loyalty Jerry Jones who always ... guys who always ... Jason Garrett even Mr loyalty Jerry Jones after the game question Jason Garrett's decision making it overtime by not going forward and not taking the chance\nBecause that's what Jerry Jones his career is built on taking the chance taken the big swing and so what ended up happening\nThe Texans got the ball back a conservative play called by Jason Garrett one big uh play down field by the Andre Hopkins and the Houston Texans go on and when another game that they probably shouldn't have one in overtime\nThen you play the Buffalo Bills who are a mismanaged team from a quarterback standpoint and you won that game because Nathan Pete Herman forgot which team he played for late in the game and through your pick\nSix it shouldn't have been that close it's a home game\nNathan Peter men you shouldn't have to rely on Nathan Peter men to win a game like that what you did and then you got the jaguars who are in the midst of a full blown melt down\nThe jaguars who played two quarterbacks not just like ... but also Cody Kessler in that game and so the Houston Texans won that game\nAnd you give them credit the jags one of the division a year ago good for Houston they won that game and then you get the Miami Dolphins you know that powerhouse team was playing their backup quarterback on the short week at a defense it looks awful\nFox Sports radio [noise]\nYou live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios are still you will hear from Alex score a manager of the red Sox you will be joining us here moment\nSports radio or we do have a controversy a bit of a controversy here at EPA SARS Steve this acre who joined us earlier I hear on Fox Sports radio he is a Fox Sports radio reporter national update anchor he was at Dodger Stadium\nUm he sort of threw out and gave a hint that Ben mile or the uh ... uh the host of this time slot during the week the great bend mile or\nWho is a right up there near the top of the list amongst Dodger ball washers and the\nMedia or bend mile or left the press box in the eighth inning and the game when another ten innings Abed Mauer has since replied to these allegations on Twitter\nAnd said the following I left the press box and sat in the crowd with my family you're spreading fake news\nSo a ... that is a that is a controversial topic um I I'm not sure ah ah who I Believe in this in this sense I I don't think that Steve to say you're would lie I I'm not I'm not saying that Ben Miller would lie either I just think the ... reputation as being Mr Dodger\nAnd for him to uh to walk away from a game like this\nAs pretty a pretty amazing uh so so if you want to hit up andme our on Twitter and and and call them out if you feel like he was lied to you I think you should do that [laughter] I've Andy On my list and I'm not here to call anybody any names I'm just saying what was passed along to me I mean this is this is a crazy show for everybody so when we we we why we've already had\nTwo gas we have two guests on this show we we had a seven and a half hour baseball game this is my third show or in the last ten hours\nBut come on man there's all sorts of stuff going on [noise] so\nBy the way we will be playing a pro wrestler a porn star coming up or less than ten minutes from now we normally do it in our too but we had to push back an hour because of the game was going on and look at that\nSeven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine operators are standing by\nAlex Cora the manager of the Boston Red Sox a talk after the game three laws about the game about his picture nascent of all day you took the laws are and what the plan is moving forward\nFor the great race one guy and I don't know seven are what are we was kind of a\nCrime people back on my way can um right now to have a [noise] what um\nIs is probably\nIf not the best game I have been part of a the effort from both sides you know what made that tonight I was so amazing that was amazing or we could have gotten married later I'm good I'm good I'm good um\nWhere where am I but I was more a there's a few guys a line that I'll be in my office to to start again tomorrow so I'm Will will decide what we do and a woman on my\n... you just got a like a a like a hell is that [noise] [laughter] I\nWas at ... uh yeah so I look\nAt the red Sox are a better team or anybody who is watch this you're you're watching the the series play out and the red Sox are just a better team but in a small sample size like a\n... a games through three like a series through three games there are moments to wear momentum can change things can change and you you miss out or ... you don't you don't get a break here or there and it could end up costing you or extending his theories that maybe shouldn't be extended this far\nAnd so if you're the Boston Red Sox you took the chance\nYou what what the ... you decided he was going to be the guy that was going to get you through it and Nathan of all the\nTo the ball the just pitched in game two\nHe comes back a couple of days later expecting to start on Saturday and instead of getting the start on Saturday Nathan of all the is called into duty on Fridays game which went into Saturday\nOr he throws close to a hundred pitches pitched brilliantly and and ends up walking away with the loss\nBecause Macs Muncie went opposite field on a home run\nAnd it's it it's tough man it's tougher Nathan of all the I feel bad for the guy I I don't think he deserved the last I think he he played really really well and there are opportunities for the red Sox but they'll get a great game like that a lot of flu things happen and they just see how it impacts the team moving forward\nOr the rest of the series skied the savior who I mentioned earlier he joined us on Fox Sports radio just said her was at Dodger Stadium we talked about the performance of Nathan of all the in the longest\nGame in the history of the major league baseball postseason\nWas that the press conference much earlier today what sort of are overly as he was introduced as hey he'll be Saturday Night starter\nAnd then he said during the press conference unless that come on and relief only three hundred pictures in the early ... and would still throwing Ninety eight miles an hour or near the end by the way and I did during this game think of that exact comment that you made to be in the hallway of\nMan I'm Glad my team is not in the postseason those or grind I Can't believe the emotions going through\nI'm surprised that in the more Red Sox fans here but obviously there were pockets of them at Dodger Stadium I knew that if the Dodgers had lost tonight there would be a ton tomorrow because there was money to be had by sound like a\nGame for tickets and now instead the whole series may have turned around just like a week ago when in less than twenty four hours the Dodgers went from it's close to going down three games to Wanda ...\nRogers did in the Nineteen eighty eight and al ... which is the last time they won the world series yeah putting heartbeat the cart before the horse there still trailing the theories but it was a stunning night\nYeah and it's that's ... and he's right in and look at let's just think big picture if the Dodgers come back and when this series what's the big picture I'm not like this game and what transpired\nSaved a window from shutting in their face because you\nThink the Dodgers are going to have enough in the reserves to to make it all the way back to the world series this claim Kirsch us seem like the same guy\nOr you can't count on all those breaks the fact that they got back to this far I told a a buddy of mine who's a die hard Dodger fan I said listen I\nIf they don't do it this time that's over it's done remember when the Texas Rangers went back to the world series they have that opportunity they were a strike away from winning the world series and then the very next year they went back and I think they got beat by the by the giants if I'm not mistaken\n... they've never been the same sense\nThey've never been back I think they had a a wild card game I think the rangers did a couple of years ago if I'm not mistaken but they've never been back you just can't expect you're going to get this many opportunities to get this far\nWhich is why it was a must win scenario for the Dodgers and it turned into a must win scenario for the red Sox because\nThey emptied the bench that was it that they they they\n... they put in their game for starter to try and win games three because they knew you win game three who gives a rip about game for you'll get blasted by twenty runs and nobody cares nobody cares because you're still up three one in the series and now the red Sox are in a situation where they face\nYou know the entire series may have changed based on just what went down in this crazy wild\nBizarre seven plus our baseball game that we all got to sit here and witness I had no idea of the game was going to still be going on when I was prepping for the show have no idea was just as soon\nLogo where weekend overnight that game will be long gone and and uh and we'll figure out what we got going on now and and I'll put together the entire show\nI mean we put together a a five other topics with NGOs and spins and jokes in a crank jokes and uh and and borderline insensitive material or put together all that to put a lot of work in to beat the decrepit\nHuman beings we are here on weekend overnight radio on Fox Sports radio and unfortunately because of seven plus our baseball game that's all been pushed aside for a little bit\nIt's too bad\nI Would you won't let you know we are brought to you by a discover card become a new card member and discover card will match all the cash back you burn dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more discover dot com slash match limitations apply a eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox is the phone number that is an important number and here's why\nEvery single week here on Fox portrayed and we play a game called pro wrestler or porn star\nIdiots can't miss radio gold if you've never heard it before do not go anywhere we normally do this in our two of the program but like I said because of the game and all the craziness going on a we had to move some things around but we will be playing pro wrestler a porn star coming up next if

we ever could get Rudy switch played on the show and like he may be dead or so if you can make it that'll be even be more impressive you can get a dead wrestler on the show or we can get Rudy switch laid on the show [laughter]\nThat's big time I'm On it yeah that's a huge I mean I'd rather have him in Tom Brady I Swear to God ... so and we go back over to Ken in San Francisco looking to tie together on pro wrestler porn star can name for you here is canon pain pro wrestler a porn star\nOf cards that while I Want to be a pro wrestler so bad but it's a porn star\nIs correct and listen now

situation if you get this correct the game's over you're going to win that\nRight yeah I like that\nYeah it's big I this is big time so Jeremiah in Minnesota to win the game here on pro wrestler a porn star Jeremiah are you ready\nI'm rather that's\nThe name for you here on pro wrestler a porn star to win is Shawn tells stacks pro wrestler a porn star\n[noise] that's gotta be pro wrestler\nIs

don't the game is over and Jeremiah when so Ken in San Francisco\nThe name for you here on pro wrestler ... ...\nFlorida for a wrestler [noise] that is incorrect\nOr in a while and we're on the same way\nThat a nice it was already bad for can have a Boston Red Sox fan has just gotten worse as he loses pro wrestler a porn star [noise]\nUh and we let Ken go right away because if he's already lied

Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance visit Geico dot com for a free\nRate quote so a game three of the world series is going to go down in history as one of the great postseason games in most remembered or discuss postseason games\nOr in all sports and I I I I don't know if I can if I can call it the greatest game I've ever seen there are some other great games that come to mind and that's to um prisoner of the moment sort of talk but just everything surrounding that\nGame ended absolute craziness\nOr as we saw a step in an hour and twenty minute baseball game in game three of the world series or the game started a little after five o'clock local time in LA\nI had just gotten home\nFrom doing a show here at Fox Sports radio when the game got underway right I'd just gotten home\nUh I didn't realize that same game was going to be on a as we were in the middle of our two of our we had no overnight show and it's it's just bizarre thing after another that took place in the game or a but it was to the\nEighteenth inning max\nMonths the up to bat for the Dodgers bottom will be Eighteen in already the longest game in a history of the major league baseball postseason and this is outside of courtesy of Fox [noise]\n\nCrazy the absolute craziness and so the Dodgers uh survive are now the series the two games to one with game for coming up later on today uh you'd imagine this is a big disadvantage for the Boston Red Sox by the world does a Dodger fan those crybaby Dodger fans\nWho have been complaining about Joe Buck and John ... ah the entire postseason\nUh where are all you twelve year old [noise]\nI'd like to do they're showing more excitement for the other team you know there's been a lifeguard team shut up but what are you a choice\nYou sound like me when I was younger you go trick or treating and somebody gives you whoppers you remember those things because basically I shock with chocolate on the outside [laughter]\nI agree ... complaining because you don't bug John ... being mean to my team a good change your diaper\nUnreal that I I did see that all postseason it blows right and we're not talking like Josh Dodger fan but members of the media\nPoor or or or just claiming that John ... and Joe Buck or being mean to their team I don't know where do you think John small to Joe Buck would rather stay three days in a row Milwaukee\nOr LA words in eighty degree weather come on man a but nonetheless great win for the LA Dodgers a fantastic performance by max Monti a ... in the clutch bottom of the Eighteenth\nI hear was max Monti who joined Fox moments after his walk off one at Dodger Stadium\nI saved over seven hours [noise]\nWe're just throws the way they fine with that what's going through\nEye on that really good about um a really good job at\nAll I got in a while [noise] ah you know he he was wiped out he was unbelievable he was a he caught and everything you wanted to get a caller Blake but uh [noise] and I don't get about about a feeling good about that one got a real have\nFought back and [noise] ah it kind of where the big like that before he tried to go back to work on her [noise] so ah [noise]\nAnd so he gets it gets to the gate or aid bath afterwards and I just ban what what is what a ...\nMonths he won the game or earlier against of all the\nBecause he hooked one down the line that looked like it was out and it was foul by less than a foot had to be less than a foot that it was a foul ball I thought he had hit it out so it does point he was seeing of all the better than any other hitter in the Dodger line up um and and and the real victim and all of this\nAnd the guy who's going to get it you're just going to look at the box score and you're gonna chalk up all lost the Nathan a ballgame and he's going to have a loss on his record in the world series ... D did was absolutely amazing like the performance of Nathan ... in that situation but you gotta you gotta\nConsider this so Nathan of all the ... and just\nThese are all the the circumstances and all the factors that that led to why Nathan ... he was in the game\nSo the Boston Red Sox tied the game up\nOn a home run by Jackie Bradley in the eighth inning off can lead Jansen and so the red Sox all of a sudden find themselves\nIn a position to to potentially win the game a game that\nThey thought they were going to lose because they were trailing late\nInto the Boston Red Sox now changed their approach so\nA couple of more innings go by nobody's scores nobody scores ... D comes into\nThe game and\nNathan ... brought him because he's going to finish the game out\nAnd best case scenario you get a lead and Nathan of all the is there for the ... and and potentially the save and he's going to close it out and the red Sox are going to take a thrill lead and then after the Boston Red Sox go up to ... to one\nThere's a bases loaded situation and the ...\nIt uh the Dodgers pick it up step on home plate and it's a force out any innings over they go to the bottom of the thirteenth\nAnd the red Sox would have all the dealing he ends up walking maxim Muncie\nOr they get a couple of outs but on the second out\nNext month the advances to second base because a Red Sox player defending against the shift to add to add to run so far to catch a pop out\nThat he fell into the stands and max months he was able to advance to second base so ... comes up\nWith two outs of all the gets the ground ball\nBut it's a throwing air on Ken's lower end because there's two outs months he's already rounding third he scores and the Dodgers tied the game\n\nJonas knocks Fox Sports radio [noise]\nCompany alive here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios [noise]\nUh in about ten minutes from now you're on a bus or rural Abyei nether edition of the scraps with Kevin figures that's\nWe uh get to some things that we have not had a chance to get to on this show and there are plenty of them are because if a but just a crazy crazy Eighteen innings seven hour game that wrapped up a that started as I was getting a whole ... from\nDoing the previous show on friday and ended a while I was doing the overnight show on Saturday morning just\nBizarro land at Dodger Stadium is the Dodgers on an Eighteenth ending walk off beat the Boston Red Sox three to two and now a we've got game for coming up on Saturday um five o nine pm Pacific time eight or nine eastern time I it's\nFan boys who are listening to the show and they're upset because we're praising Nathan ... apparently everything's got to be a a a ball wash the Dodgers and you've got to talk of nothing but Dodgers or you can only uh you can only talk about the LA Dodgers I'm\nA guy why I guy writes in and he goes ah [noise]\nGet off of all these bleeps\nHe wanted to do his job and he lost the game what about the job Walker buell or did that was an awesome performance\nCar washer [noise]\nThat's as big as it gets right there was a ball washing fan boy [laughter] of all\nAds of hazing that is somebody who cannot absolutely cannot see the other side of things they just kept you got to be nice to my favorite team that's probably somebody also has been complaining that Joe Buck and John small to been picking a new team yeah been seeing them nice things about our team\nGod [laughter] so I Do I tell you they're they're the little kid on Halloween\nWho goes trick or treating and gets pissed off when he comes back and he opens up his bag and he got like lassie taffy instead of more Snickers bars what a child\nBut um see a game\nFor is a is coming up later on a Saturday Night\nUh I'm actually I'm going to defend somebody in the world of sports that it's not gotten a lot of defense and I'm going to defend them\nBecause I think some of the criticism is pretty ridiculous um so I was talking about this earlier on the show so Jimmy ...\nSpoke for the first time since he injured his knee or out for the season\nAnd some of the the criticism that drop below got\nI think is in large part due to the fact that he's a former patriot\nAnd I say that because of like if you have an impression or an image of somebody that you went to high school with and say they were in a hold of you in high school\nThey could go on to do great things in the years since high school and and be a completely different person but for a split second when you see him again for the first time at the reunion you still go back to where you knew them in high school and they were the bag\nAnd and you're never going to get that out of your mind I think Jimmy ... deals with some of that because when when he got criticized for going on a date with a porn star that was a big time story and to me that was a big time store because he was a patriot and because so many people hate the patriots or when the guy tears up his knee\nInstead of people saying man that's a tough break for Jimmy ... there were a lot of people out there who are criticizing him oh well he's an idiot I mean why didn't you just go out of bounds the game was that a rigid Kansas City you didn't need to make that play God Forbid the guy wanted to make a play for his team God Forbid\nBut I think he's dealing with a lot of the heat because he was a former patriot\nAnd somebody else in the bay area who is dealing with a lot of heat and I think it's completely ridiculous\nIs Derek car their car has been getting crushed\nAh people thinking that he was crying out an ad on the field after he took a hit\n'em there's the stories that are going around about Derek car and his teammates losing respect for him because he cried while he got hit a in an NFL game that teammates don't respect them there are some people out there that are floating the idea to Derrick cars soft\nYou know maybe he's not tough enough uh you know maybe you can't trust her depend on their car from a from a mental aspect because maybe is not tough enough um\nHow completely ridiculous an asinine it is to call anybody in the NFL soft it's completely ridiculous\nTheir car had his leg snapped two years ago he said numerous injuries the past couple of years and he's always come back always I'll be honest with you\nBlew my knee out a few years back dislocated kneecap torn ligament destroyed my knee destroyed\nOr playing basketball to this day\nI'm cautious about climbing down off a ladder because I don't want to step wrong and have my knee cap sitting next to my ankle again like it was a few years back\nI'm paranoid about it to this day I'm overly cautious about it just imagine a pocket of three hundred forty pound lineman collapsing at your legs thirty times a week\nAfter you snap your leg two years ago imagine how tough mentally you have to be to overcome that fear\nThe idea that he's soft or not tough enough\nHe's completely and totally ridiculous I Do a show with ... when you're on Fox Sports radio every single Sunday night I Can't tell you how many injuries Brady is dealt with\nPlaying games in college where he had a concussion that was so bad he didn't remember what happened on the drive\nHe has to fit a certain way and the chair because of his back injuries that he suffered while he was playing back injuries that were so bad that he had spinal\nAdd Steve curves issues where he was he would feel nauseous and all that really dealt with those as well to he can't sit in certain spots in a chair because of the damage that he's done his left foot is completely deformed because he got Liz Frank\nAnd he said other foot injuries that he hasn't been able to get fixed because if you do get it fixed you're on the shelf and on crutches for six to eight months and he's got two little girls at home that he's got to take care of\nThe pain and the agony that these guys go through we will never know we'll never have any idea what it's actually like so when we flowed out the idea that there are cars soft you're an idiot\nHe ... it doesn't it doesn't make sense\nLike fans in media members calling out an NFL player soft understand that there's not a player in the league that you could out of violence on the field\nNot a quarterback not a kicker not a lineman not a punter nobody\nAnd it's why I've said this and I've always maintain this and this is just a fact I've said it before football players and fighters top of the food\nChain ... you cannot dispute that toppled the food chain\nEvery single plays a coalition the collision every single play is violent every single play you're risking doing permanent damage to your body every single time out\nMost of us we go to work and if we got like a really tough sales job you you know what a real rough day for us as like you know when you make eighty calls and you get rejected eighty times in a row man that's a rough day sales wise poof\nYou know we'll figure it out or a or your show up late because you had to deal with traffic or you blow a flat tire on the on the side of the freeway that's a real rough day ah that that's called a a combative day or that's called an uneasy day at work for a lot of us\nFor an NFL player every single time you show up to quote unquote the office\nYou're competing against somebody whose job is to injure you or hurt you or knock you out of submission of the game because that is how they make their money same infighting imagine being locked inside a cage with a human being who is capable of killing you\nGot their good she stepped Steph Curry on Thursday ridiculously good and then they they go to New York and it's like you go on the road you travel all that way you get to Madison Square garden you've got an earlier or start time to a game that you're not used to 'cause you're Golden State\nAnd they still win by almost thirty ... on a back to back it's crazy you know\nBy the way our Kevin to rent they erected a giant billboard to try to recruit him to come there and Kevin ... before he ended up dropping forty one and a victory in New York says yeah that really doesn't do much for me so I got to be a little bit harder to New York if you want to try to Kevin rats come to the next\nSay come on man you know you want to do something or a good James stolen to sell the team you're in if you want to get them get Kevin ... to go to New York at James going to sell the team either that or quit his stupid band JD in a straight shot that band stinks and you could tell James Dole and I said\nThat too [laughter] [laughter] well past the message along thank you I don't know if you have a list of course is what they re doing right now at five thirty in the more we are by the way you live coverage of the world series that show you Kiss My ass exactly\nWell right now I don't know if you have anybody in your family Who's Afraid of spiders and my sister has a giant fear of spiders us I don't know if you have anybody in your family at the giant argue and directing a phobia\nNo not at all I've I've I've held tarantulas before um uh my my girlfriend is is very afraid of spiders but yes I I Know that those those people are out there\nSo maybe she'll be a similar to this gentleman in Fresno war\nPorn reportedly burned down his house trying to kill spiders wait what yeah\nSo put out to alarm boys they say there was a man sitting in for his parents in at their house and he tried to kill a black widow that he spotted where they blow torch\n[laughter] oh that's great\nThe attic and the second story of the home or actually damaged by the fire because he was trying to kill the spider and the craziest part is they still don't know if he killed the spider or not it's very possible that got burned down the house and the spider probably crawled out and got out safely\nOh that's awesome that's like a it's like the more on who tries to kill the bug on his windshield with a hammer\nAcquitted idiots so each completely burned his house\nDown the brunt of the top story the the addict and I'm not in the second story of the house or burned down\nI just it's not the spider offer pick it up\nAnd I do I ... I mean you could do is you are you you know what I Do and this is only for good karma because there's that stat how many spiders you swallow year what is it like a ... to spiders a year the ads on like that in their sleep they swallow spiders\nUm so what I Do just for karma purposes I never kill the spiders I always scoop it up and I put it outside because I'm hoping one day I'm being attacked\nOr by like a you know like if I'm In Venezuela and being attacked by a bird\nSo that one of those Venezuelan bird eating spiders can all up behind the bird wallets attacking me and put it in like a dark joke or something and that way all those years saving lives will will come in handy later on\nDown the road here that are the spot or eat the bird and then you afterwards\nThat do that is that a a very likely possibility as well to now let's go live to our grew up on a farm and\nIs not buying into the spider hype insider Iowa than for the latest Sam you're dispelling the rumor that you swallow to spiders a year or I think I read an article that that's pretty much hogwash or that you don't really know how do you come up with them\nYou'll sleep with your mouth open and they'll just crawl in there\nBut I think that you might swallow one like once a year maybe there are certain things I don't want to know about it if I if I go to a restaurant I I don't want to know that uh that the cook was playing a pocket pool [laughter] ten minutes before handling my\nFamily I always really really nice to ah to the restaurant where unless you're out at massive resource always super nice yeah because they're handling your food yeah so I put fan but spiders or misunderstood yeah of course they are blood blow torch for a spider that's a bit overkill no pun intended now did he did he end up killing the spider the mess\nWe don't know well we were having no evidence has been found as to whether or not the spider actually survived but not a moron\nSo wow well done I think it's got no

Saturday what are the ... oval incredible game three really ate teen endings\nAnd then ... the home run the night night link\n[laughter] night night you assume if somebody wants to sleep for a moment [laughter] ah I I've never seen a sporting event that lasted all the eight hours almost me entire an entire works shift for people I mean that was that was crazy Eighteen endings but I mean it was it was exciting game and they all have been exciting games that's for sure\nThe ... this was that there's something about baseball and that'll get lost in everything but there's something about baseball and when it comes to these epic moments and it's in your for thinking about this\nThe it was a tight game on like three to write and it was this game where you just watch white knuckle throughout the entire evening\nYou know I mean the Dodgers are all one nothing the whole and and clinging to it and you're you're with every\nOut Diane and then of course the red Sox tie it NBA and then they take the lead to topple the thirteenth and then lead to just try it I mean that's incredible\nFit or that's what baseball needs to capitalize on this it needs more postseason for at chances of epic moments like this well I I Will\nSay this you know if you're a dodger's fan you've been you've been waiting for this moment you've been waiting for a win because\nThe postseason and if you're a Dodgers whenever you know lead has ever sacred no no matter what you're doing it is ever safe you just want to get to a point to where you can finish off of team the fact that that went that way you know that that game when they're away last night was was you know and not only impressive but it was as you mentioned a great game that great drama\nRoute drama theater though the white knuckle part of it that we love certainly I mean I ... that that's what it was this would have provided that I don't know I should I I got to be full disclosure I\nHad a long day yeah I Do I got a job a fulltime and a show and then we had to my niece's partied so I'm watching the game to party\nAnd then I go home and I'm watching the game and and I actually stopped it was it was after that the that Utah pulled away from UCLA was current route right I was always on baseball and I do wish I does and I it was\nIn a lively oh you you wouldn't be expected anything different come on man I'll be honest there were times where the game was watching me more time that I was watching it I had it now it on TV and I was in bed I was like as I got to get up you know the one thirty two o'clock to get over here and get ready for this show uh my my thing the TV was watching me many times [laughter]\nYeah I was ... I was the top of the search and their memorable wedding my ear do this to topple is Thirteen\nAnd they did the red Sox scored on the throne our mhm right and and and I'm going and I like let myself for this fall asleep [laughter] thinking that it will probably be out probably get re overcome that it's probably over\nSo I let myself sleep and try to try to stay in a week\nAnd then I wake up and I'm like oh my God\nAnd our crew and the audience which is when you wake the baggage X back being something and woke up to it amazing surprise\nRight like I expected when I fell asleep\nI fell asleep expecting the red Sox to be up to three now right I expected Boston to have won that game last night\nRight and the Dodgers come back and not only do they come back we're deeply five more ratings and they it's just incredible drama up until the ... I went back and I did see it to the ... the home run you know I mean it was it was it was just unbelievable fairly\nWell I mean you know here here's the thing I as I said I found the the the TV on watching me more and uh I think\nWhen I fell asleep the first time was probably in the eighth any or somewhere around there somewhere around I Can't remember what any was but it was it was just going back and forth nobody was making headway view on that wasn't the eight because neither were still in pitch and\nI'm ... and it just it it just went back and forth and then all of a sudden you would hear this loud share something would start a you know ... what happened oh oh okay Dodgers up okay a boss who came back up oh boy oh man it looks like\nAnd you fall asleep so I kept going in and out the entire evening until finally I think it was around the thirteenth fourteenth I was just like I Can't do any more I've got to get some sleep because now I'm a I'm a ... if\nThe word I just thought that I got a guy like you know I Know that if you\nHad to turn off the TV but then I woke up early or before the show I Walk around one and caught up with this you know the the highlights and everything it was like wow seven and a half hours are you kidding me I could you imagine being at the park for that long and it was crazy but it was a great game\nOctober I I Love I Love the sport\nWhen it when it's like this to him in\nAnd I like to be greedy but that's why the playoff should be two months you are creating what branch what her destroyed [laughter] because there's too many meaningless games where nobody cares about the result like it's just All right yeah\nAnd he yeah but it's not an exact science for you to pitch it it's not an exact science for you to put to good teams against one another I mean if if you could have had all the playoffs well I mean but even then I mean there are times there were some teams are just so far and away the Dodgers the Dodgers took apart the Braves it was nothing that wasn't\nA series you know what I mean like that but no my my point is not that you know you ... your Golden State warriors right so you're not going to have a the climactic playoff series and gains\nBut the more playoff games you have the more chances you have the playoffs the more chance you have for a game like last night that was\nThe one that on a football weekend people will talk about right like people talk about what you know where where they last night right you know like what what was going on I I I Want to talk to people they're still on a high from last night they were at the game\nA ... [laughter] probably a rabbit that game but if you're at that game how incredible\nOr if you were at that game how you wouldn't you you couldn't possibly leave until you know the outcome you you could not be one of those ... you didn't see or you weren't there because they are how many sports moments have we had in the last decade where people leave early assuming something's gonna happen or whatever by William violation though I voted for the violation\nYou don't you know you don't leave you alone along World Series game you can leave\nAt\nAll you gotta do is become a new card member discovered car will match all the cash\nWhy we ought to fellows he's after you've got 'em like Kennedy when we come alive after that a marathon of World Series game um if you did not see it I don't know what rocky were under because\nIt lasted a long enough for you to go out to dinner or have a party come back get dressed get undressed get new pajamas to get a bath and still the game is still on so [laughter]\n\nYou another long I literally had all night long guest or ever a game postseason game ever almost eight hours my goodness I Can't believe it\nYeah it's it's it goes down in the annals as one of these\nUh one of the timeline of your life games especially if you're a Dodger fan right oh yeah well you know I was a you know we we have games or having it being from Philadelphia and a a grown up with some of these sports fan\nYou I can tell you you know states in places in the whole time to time on your life with ... games that you will always remember that are like indelible and you're a Dodger fan particularly last night that's one of those that is automatically\n... ask direct you know there is an ass tricks right next to it\nNo doubt it's a it's a it's an amazing amazing amazing like so because of that I Want to introduce our crew right because I noticed a Dodger fans there we have a new produce sure that\nWe like the welfare [noise] that's right [noise] I Do that we need to break in lake [noise] silly I smashed [noise] on the\nAnd uh of course the or the group\nAnd then of course a triple em is off\nTo a Big Ten\nAnd now we like to welcome from the blue field of Idaho Ryan Dennis\nRight away but hey there you go I like it had been links making it sound like I got to get jumped in to get in the end of this crew here\nWhat you do oh okay [noise] waiting for the [laughter] the way our [laughter]\nYeah I was just telling a in the break it's it's been a been a while last time I I think I was here the or the birds when the super bowl but it's\nIt's funny you would I Would I bonded over the eagles so ah and ... you're already fell uh\nNow now you know the normal test our before we your prick your finger for a little blood and burned the sink and your palm the uh usually that's the need to pass and pass but to me you know you're good to go you're going to\nPass I might give it a pass now now now [laughter] I got to work for it okay [laughter] so am I going to come on come on what you mean like [laughter] or\nHow you doing there are you ready to go\nOh absolutely guys that are like you said it's prime time let you know prime time in the middle of the night out here but hey it's a big Dodger win out here and you know we're finally seeing everybody get home from the freeways right now\nYeah that that that was my question the loser like in a way or the Dodgers\nWhen like there are very teetering you're about to go down three of the series is all but laws\nAnd then you have the errands throw\nHygiene and then you winning\nDramatic fashion was Muncie not only be a ... or the theories now still alive to one but you got momentum going into the night game would the quick turn around\nTeenagers basically two fold games and they're starting pitcher evolve he he was supposed or you know he was supposed to make the starting tomorrow and now he's you know who knows at this point same same kind of thing for the Dodgers so we'll see we'll see and you're right we're going to have some momentum who knows maybe we can even\nYeah I I gotta I gotta bringing him a are made the fig because I Know he's a major dodger's fan I Know he's a huge dodger's fan fig what what was it like for you\nVery stressful extremely stressful for any Dodger fan\nEspecially those who were in attendance at that game a sitting on pins and needles and there's so many different\nYou know highs and lows from Cody bell or to getting picked off of a base when they had a chance to do a rally and he killed then to the very next part of that anymore he saved a run gunning out of the runner at the at least ... at home or at home plate so there are so many highs and lows that go into a game like\nThis are you 'cause you're clicking that leaving Jackie Bradley who is how bad the about the postseason he's had unreal\nAnd I felt like this happens for almost any championship team there's always somebody that you don't expect\nThat comes through and plays huge for you I Know for the Dodgers last season this happened uh with them with the Austin Barnes who lost his starting ... catching job this year a back to the ... of resurgence and our bars because we're in Dallas been struggling\nKinda Russell did back a little bit but Barnes is one of their best postseason hitter last year have not doing much of the regular season and you guys have you've covered this sport long enough other athletes I just know for every World Series champion there's always somebody at the bottom of the order or somebody that you don't expect\nThat has an amazing series and so far or just an amazing postseason run as a whole and that's Jackie Bradley for Boston right now\nThere you go back to resist the series and pick it out one of the guys names as Cody Ross\nNo doubt I remember hearing oh yeah ... or ...\nDid you go the roads you other dog giants yeah more than ... right right\nI I mean the ... just that whole vibe\nYou know the the mini ... she came back but you knew it\nYou must have been a while like ooh now you're going down the by the ... your ... your best to go against Rios she reads over\nAnd that's what made it such so much more of a high stress game for the red Sox it's almost you can't afford to buy one get away from you the only thing that what made it more just waiting for the red Sox is that it went this long and you had a chance and you didn't and you had to burn through all of your pitching and you have to burn through your game for starter\nPitch basically in the tower gaming ... standing six and two thirds I Believe is what he pitched a before the walk off home run so that's what made it a little bit tougher from their standpoint but from the Dodgers you literally had everything on the line and I there was no margin for error for you whereas Boston it wasn't as big of a deal\nYeah yeah All right let's relive it for a moment ... ... ... ah right here I think it was\nAll they are free to [noise]\nBack from the dead have\nWant to have had shot at some point\nThe great Charlotte diner on a five Seventy LA sports you go yeah man I Love ... and he's also now ... what a great call how 'bout um like I mean it was ... rifle I mean does it does I\nMean look at it kept off a long ...\nOf of baseball that's the beauty of baseball is that you can have in or you can have a game like that some ethics game that never ends\nThat's all I mean and there's there's a ton of standout performances across the board and this and the eight hour you know in the fiasco or you know talk about ... performance as a rookie on the biggest stage and I was\n... one of the doubt and if he if he that brief moment that figure that brief moment or in the ... division series and we looked a little shaky and then he's been just money ever since\nNo doubt absolutely Oh absolutely yeah real yeah so and for the Dodgers this is just more of the same where they're getting a contributions from from everybody in different spots there was a different hero every night it seems like you know ... was the MVP\nOf the NFL CS he only had a couple of hits in that series but there are ... the bigger hits the biggest hits of that series so\nLife is that the team has been all year long they've had their struggles nothing has been easy for them but they keep finding a way to get victories um so it's encouraging for them look the only needs to get one you want to find a way to get a game there was always says when one game by the time as\nCliche as it sounds they found themselves in a position to get a win tonight\nAnd they were able to tax the Boston Red Sox pitching staff which only works in the Dodgers favor because they did not have to go and use ... who is scheduled to be those starter for game for although oddly enough after the game day robbers would not commit to whether or not rich was going to be the starter endgame for me it was interesting to me\nSound engineer and I was saying yeah there it is right now so it's a producer in my gym hello good morning that please don't take that as a front oh no that's all right it it only took link mentioning my name for you to remember that I exist so it's okay so [laughter]\nI like pleasure now actually [laughter]\nActually you're right ... ... ... ... when ... when he goes we reference Jew for the story I was like damn\nI didn't I mean he's Sammy my job is to stay quiet and\nUm no it's interesting with that Dodger crowd and you and it's funded kinda borrowed a term from Gulf and say that back nine you know if the of the game the ... of those innings there and and just the the fans just it was almost empty by I mean not not empty but it was very a lot of fans had left just because\nI don't know for whatever reason they're exhausted at the end of the lives that well their mind [laughter] if you're paying like five dollars to the end there if you're paying five hundred dollars or a thousand dollars for a ticket to the world series I mean hey you're getting your money's worth right you're getting two games in one a guy\nYou know you know people get really chilly when it reaches sixty degrees out here so maybe that people needed a sweater and couldn't take it anymore so they had to that hit the hit the road so home white guy and a lot of so many so many athletes were empty by the end of that game and it was sort of like a man he missed the one hell of an ending there so\nYeah as you might as well we've been small problem Dodger fans is do roll on\nBig big like show it leave early Miami Heat fans from it was it like they they'd come back in a playoff game or something and they some of them had left before the uh I don't understand that some of that right yeah\nI looked at those people who were playoff game you're you're at the world series I Believe it would be the world's well once again\nBut it is it is though a an\nEight hour affair I mean I don't care ethics at Santa Cruz game you know\nI I had to go on but here's the thing

Sports radio studios [noise] Fifteen minutes can save you Fifteen spend more time short visit\nGuy go dot com break free rape quote I I Want to begin our number ... just touched on now you're ready to report what did you see anybody else getting move\n[laughter] well I didn't see the two that got moved you moved [noise] um and be honest with you know and it's really hard to say because if you look at it there's really not a whole lot else they could give up\nUm uh but you know would that be instead this this team as I said he has five first round draft choices next couple of years [noise] um I don't know really what else there is to be God\nIf if the if you're the raiders right now\nYeah so you you you're you're\nThinking because everybody else has to stay right I'm trying to figure out who else\nI'm that's what I'm trying to figure out who else who else could possibly move I mean I Know after the fact why they did the ... as I said in the last hour it's mainly because they did not want to pay a franchise money uh and the fact that they had a team I'm going to give up a first round pick on\nNow I I Do think of Mari can be serviceable I think he's talented enough but there were times where like last year not only with the injuries\nBut there was there were times where he drops and you had a lot of jobs and it was it was a mental block whatever reason so the fact that they gave the the cowboys gave up my first round pick in next year's draft to to take them I think that was almost a deal you could not walk away from as much as you loved him are\nDo you think if you're the cowboys what what goes through their heads like we knew that they need to receive needed a receiver man I mean our number one he\nObviously what's going through their mind is that they think they still have a chance to be a part of the uh a big player in the east and their ... in their division\nUm and so this was this was giving this was able to give back press had another weapon to be able to stretch to fail because let's face it the receiver they've had in in in line right now I've been you know the watch the Redskins game had that kind of like five or six and drops if they had\nThat they should have called a that would have could have been the difference in the game a along with the um bad and officiating could have made you know better than fishy and could have been any difference of the game but um if you're the cowboys you're going for because you think your your window is now\nI mean I guess is their window now\nAnd how do you say because I think the thing I I just don't think that they're driven off during a division as bad as the eagles are or have been playing\nThe only one that you know for sure that's not a player in the division as the giants I can say that right now because it could go either way you can't discount the Redskins every now and and the cowboys show you something um but ... you know the eagles with their struggles and inconsistencies this is going to be a division like it always is they beat up on another\nYeah I guess I don't know I I did that kind of a fallacy\nThey beat up one another I was actually east\nBeen good since I don't know\n... okay I Know what you're saying they beat up on each other and get some great division nicer they granted great division but it's hard to decide who's going to come out ... other than like once seen\nThis I don't think I don't think it's a trash division I don't think I think I Do hold fast to the to the words that they beat up on each other mainly because when you go like\nYou go like need five hundred in your division and stuff like that and you have a couple of teams I go five hundred in the division or three and four or or uh you know five and two or whatever it is or five and three\nYou you're going to have those instances where it just takes one game a separation put you in the playoffs and if you look at the standings right now we're not even at the halfway point look at the same as right now with the ... the eagles clinch last year\nBy November the eagles ran away with the division that's a different that actually mine the norm\nBut that I I got I'm On I'm going to argue with you I Wonder what used to be I I just think the division I think there are certain foul season sports and this notion of the image the east there's some great division the Redskins having been good since Nineteen eighty eight\nRight now the Redskins are on top of the division of foreign to okay do you believe in his team 'cause no I don't believe in Nineteen but at the same as one four games as compared to well the ... only three games I still saw the ... the Washington Redskins go into New Orleans where the Monday Night and get absolutely obliterated we're talking about New Orleans\nOkay that they've got obliterated by forty of a team that was a division doesn't get obliterated like that they and they quit on the game\nSo I got no time for Washington not only to Alex Schmidt if they if I got no\nTime for that is why [laughter] to these horrible right\nI look at the giants in their dead and you know the cowboys I just don't think the quarterback is\nThis whole run pass option Arpaio bit and go with it\nI don't believe in the Arpaio because I think the true way to fight defending the our ... our ... to hit this not out of the quarterback Everytime them whether he has a ball or not\nThat's just ... there's not there's not very many teams have taken that on themselves I still see defense of ins and outs on line backers read like there's something to Reno hit the quarterback and I guarantee you off it's a coordinated will stop doing that play but that's that's just me\nBut if it was All right you're right if the ... when he is every single time and whether he has the ball or not because for that instance he's not a pastor now running\nAnd you have a defensive end of the street a von Miller knows guys coming off the edge my assignment every single time as you see that quarterback I Want you to put your I Want you to put your shoulder pad right in the center of his chest every single time whether he hands the ball off or not\n\nI Love it but my point is is that do that I found if they found a rhythm if they found something that can utilize ... assaults on line and take a lot of pressure off his ... trying to just pack bat a backup impassable 'cause he's not a pass or like that then they might they might be on something where they can win a few games\nYeah I was about love valley as a runner I I I figure defenses decent I think there needs to be friends I just\nYeah I just don't fear driven good [laughter] yeah I I think that division and she's not very good period it's going to be interesting to trade deadline and who gets move yeah\nAnd he's in big moves already and generally don't see it in football that's the thing in your lady for here though you have you noticed\nI have yeah it seems like a lot of big names and like a lot of the bats are is where the giants going to do since they had a you know basically a bargain basement so they gave up ... up now and then ...\nRight that's a big deal\nSo are you I'm curious to see who's the next team you know that that that that goes in and his intent\nBoat I Will say this I I Will say that the ... if you're going to make a move if you're going to go all out I think Jacksonville is one of those teams that has to go all out I Do not believe in like ... I have not believed in photos and if they continue to go with ... I don't see them going in the right direction they're going to lose this division because of Houston is caught fire\nAnd Jacksonville can ... and the other night about that I mean he has just been tearing up winters are five straight and we were trying to scratch your head a couple of about a month ago what the heck was going on with this team and now now you see that they've got to read them and they've got their all sorts of wind is even playing better than nothing left with confidence does for you because\nThey're ... you know the technique wise they're not very good [laughter] your matinee collectively but they find a way to get the job done and just Shon now knows what he's dealing with and those and and they've created an often second work with the timing of work with a short comes a that off at some of my\nThose are probably by discover\nDiscover card we treat you like huge country [noise]\nHe's got 'em like they were having a little fun as we prepare for this weekend of sports marathon of a World Series game last night it picks up again tonight for today I guess this afternoon a and then um you know we've\nGot a whole slate of college football before you get for ... ready for Sunday 'cause you gotta Halloween next week\nBefore the Thursday night game and taking the kids don't know I well actually I'm I'm with my niece's here the boys are with their mom and California so I'm going to let her go do the thing with her friends uh uh before I jump on a plane and come to the Thursday night game in Santa Clara so All right where are the niners trick or treat\nBitches Les Mis [laughter]\nSo\nIt's right now the ...\nHour wean um today's um college football it's like it's okay no good you know it's one of those um the Druze weekends word you know\nYou get the cocktail party yeah which is which is always fun but no Alabama like oh\nMan whatever have you ever seen a quarterback who I Know it can't do this for our pets in the fourth quarter\nBecause he has been played\nNo have you ever seen anything like what Alabama's doing right now\nNo\nAlso never seen a schedule makers like al ... schedule but I'll come on there's been cupcakes 'cause before not in the middle of the season\n[laughter]\nI mean how can you their schedule is just casual let's go to a discussion you do have control over it and if you're going to sit here and try to convince me that Alabama did not schedule the way they schedule for a reason I say you're saving mistaken\n... ... what is your biggest problem you playing the FCC which is that I see is what so no oh look at all stop not giving you that the FCC is so down on top heavy please tell me that to the best conference\nSo they are when we're packed twelve no I'll give you the big twelve the big Penn or any other conference before they say yes you see the ... defense maybe only defense and the score you got a lot of like that\nAll right Alabama played little role\nModels of anything more than what they used to be Arkansas ... colon way of Mars isn't\nA and and\nUh that would be Louisiana Lafayette ... there's a powerhouse\nHave you forgot to say Arkansas state you see that now see the thing about the thing about the schedule when you mentioned the schedule you have the mental ... in which a goatee\nA bigger name I'll lose that you know when they did well ... they weren't bad they weren't bad but they weren't they weren't anywhere close then you come back with Arkansas states\nBefore you play at Mississippi Mississippi supposed to be a big game Mississippi's had and your number a couple of times in the past not many times what a couple of times so you the men then you have Texas A M M then you have after taxes and have you have before you have Arkansas let's schedule Louisiana Lafayette\nCome Omer ... really going to go through this yeah\nNow you have a by after you've really Tennessee which was supposed to be a big game for you you have a by while before you get rid of them here because ...

Vikings and a lot of people are all over the saints I actually think the Vikings win this game you think the Vikings win this game\nThe same kind of big test last week against the ravens um and that was that was a big one for them because a number of things outdoors and you know the the ravens defense and stuff like that and so there's been some there's been some big test for uh you know for the team down under\nYou and I know I I ... ... ... ... ... years funny because when you look at the AFC the taxes getting hot subtly during the mix\nThey have to be they just won five straight and don't care who you look at how you look at scout or whatever when you went five straight you've got something going\nEspecially after dropping the first three so when you talk about your AFC rankings well there is no one that's hotter than Kansas City with that off ants um unbelievable and the what the the show they put on against the bangles I really felt bad for the other team I was like you can't stop them\nThere's nothing that you can do that can stop the opposing team from scoring and they've got so many weapons and they now know how to use utilize them all and now here's the thing\nFor everything we're talking about what the Kansas City chiefs\nAndy ... head coach\nWhile you run into one of the joke doesn't doesn't do well doesn't do on the play offs and then what do you but he does this is a different year\nI okay I Will I said that about a couple of times about some of these legal teams that he had in the past\nThought it was a different year that's the first one that sticks in micro the next one is happens to be number twelve a New England married\nA show that they can get into a shootout with him and outlast and that was just one game but that's one game elimination and I think I I Do think and when it comes to the top five I Do still feel the chargers are going to be a player in some way I like to charge\nThe I like the charge I like the Texans\nThey're there you go there there's a lot more competition in AFC in in spite of the fact that Kansas City is so pronounced with their offsets the defense might necessarily be might become very ... because they had trouble slum people down\nHere you know he's one of the question do the Steelers come back from the dead because that's not out of the question I have no no sign out of the question especially in that division not out of the question was what I look at the dealer team they still you know they saw a ton of weapons\nHave a ton of weapons is just wondering if the the whole thing about leaving on bill surrounding it becomes sort of a ... becomes a sort of toxic and carries on throughout the season\nSo worried detergent from winning cars that division as competitive as yours teammate ... how would you react to it the same way most of his teammates to I'm not\nI'm not trying to get in a way of you getting your money but here's the thing I only have a short window as an athlete to win football games and the wind championships everybody wants to win a championship I can ill afford to sit and allow my best player one of my better players that opposition\nTo just sit on the sideline and nor do I want to talk about it I Can't control whether or not he plays but the fact that I have to talk\nOh I don't care if he comes in is now I hear you but just say here you go stage we can and Libya on bell is ready to go\nWhere do you do\nAs a player is nothing you can do you just go out there in black or it is you hope the coaches make the best discretion you might not necessarily agree with their ... their their viewpoints if they put them in but you wonder how you want to have the best players on the field they give you the best opportunity when right now it's just being selfish so he has a better running back and you know he's fresh put them in I Wonder when\nI don't care how we do it\nYeah I I you know I mean I I don't count them out\nI don't think I'm the amount of all\nKnow Cincinnati you'll get five Wednesday it's amazing how bad they are [laughter] like when when when when times are good\nBut it looks like they're good right and they make and then they go to a place in adverse place like New England Kansas City and they get the doors blown off now that I mean we have to look good she's defense isn't that good right what happened today any dogs on fence\nYou're forced into one that you get panicky get press\nThe picks sex you know when they're trying to make it you know get some points on the board game seems a little outrageous and you take one series of the time we can only get the max we can get a six point seven points\nSo we've got to go down to get a score that picks six that that took every last bit of the air that was in their sales the

attack\nThere are things that you can do but you got it you cannot all your money to do with your secondary without a doubt\nAnd and but my they're playing a little bit better now they're playing a

and this open the door the red Sox are ready to put this one away\nAnd are accused litter why throw on a tweet ground are allowed to be safe and that\nWas the tying run the bottom of the thirteenth so it was a wild night and it was it was just incredible uh Joe Buck gave that great great call a which was a ... the\nWalk off in ...\nI'm holding on to what I said and beginning so yeah I mean look you're probably right I mean I I'm not a Red Sox guy I'm anti red\nSox so I'm I root Dodgers\nPlus I'm kinda partial to the national league I still kind of I'm Still weird that way yeah because I was born in the national league city mhm so I kinda favor the national league I get it\nI was at all is that a loser a no no no civic pride there's nothing wrong with that yeah it's weird I you know but Dodgers all to see the Dodgers\nI'm not a big fan of Boston get is already I'm so tired of Boston [laughter]\nRight or you already know rats that so it doesn't matter that remains additives so\nIn a way to go out and its Celtics [laughter] All right we have the patriots hate the Celtics I ate the Bruins\nSo yeah\nThat's that's kinda how I was always acts Roadrunner boss because he wanted the road trip to ... yeah I Try to live [laughter] I Love this you when you grow up in Philadelphia it's hard not to eat the Celtics I get it under an extra man and when I'm All right I'm going through pain I'm going through six their pain right now\nAnd meanwhile you know ... just cruise\nYou know what I did find interesting last night as compared to the games the first couple of games in Boston\nWhen you look behind home plate and you see who's who you know in Boston you see a lot of you know obviously people paid high money to get their tickets ... stand out you know\nBut you know you you turn on LA you see Larry king's and makes it a little young you know when young one you see Sandy Koufax you see all the who's who's stars celebrities out in LA and joined the game at night behind home plate versus the you know you could pick up you could pick up names name drop a for those guys\nBut here's the thing though I mean maybe either though\nMary hearts and Larry king's they are the ones who were there during the regular season and that's the litmus test if you were there\nFor a series against the pirates in August then you have my respect because there's a lot of people and this happened with the Lakers as well\nRight and they ignore them all year and then they call their Hollywood connections and get tickets to the finals or in this case the world series and the atmosphere this actually happened in the Lakers Celtics NBA final game\nSeveral years ago the atmosphere at staples center was dead for a Lakers Celtics NBA final game and the reason is all the Hollywood types we're just showing up to be seen and they wouldn't cheer for the game so merry heart and Larry King man they have my respect for sure\nWhile really yeah Oh yes absolutely don't they don't look so so they just come in the middle ... here in LA this was you know there's going to say that there are a example\nThat I remember in in old age when the Lakers Celtics played in the finals the Lakers crowds were nuts throughout the playoffs they were fantastic we get to a game three which is the first home game it's staple center and the atmosphere is just noted noticeably dead and that was the reason is because\nAll the Hollywood types who wanted to be seen they got tickets for game three and they would just show up taking pictures of themselves while you know Kobe is battling it out with Kevin Garnett and ray Allen and Paul Peirce\nAnd then the rest of the theories though everything was back to normal because they had their Phil and then then they went home I don't know if it was the same for the Dodgers last night but yeah that's how it was for sure once yeah\nWow that's amazing though they may have it in Philly\nThat [laughter]\nThat those those people are they're they're they're true blue ... ... do well\nHere it's it's made because usually\nSo they're they want to be a part of that's why that's why Philadelphia's is known as a great sports so I mean they they they support their their their franchises or you know over the money that you know like the whole Boston Boston's the same way on the ... that are around ... Boston\nNew York I've often you know I'm not I'm not not sliding me the the true fans that are in Los Angeles but for the most part I think Los Angeles was almost like a fair weather town when you're doing well they'll come and support you look I'll look how will you took the rams it get support\nYou know well that was weird you remember I remember this right last year before the eagles Ramsey remembers a big deal Oh yes box had to go to a casting agent to castigate agency to get rams fans to show up for the pregame show\nYes it was you know the the the actor outside a go Jared go go Jericho I [laughter] I haven't looked at Cambridge how dare you say that you know sure go [laughter]\nIs that Joe [laughter] seeing a scene McVeigh\nOh [laughter]\nAh for me well ... ... ... there were said to one eagles fed their\nFellow me three thousand miles away yeah there was a believable now\nIt was unreal anything goes with the chargers up their own stadium you know the charges are turning to the clippers and they are for the Los Angeles steps out\nInteresting thing though when it comes to LA than generally LA is really a fantastic sports town and it's obviously dominated by the Lakers and Dodgers but in certain situations I think economics become a factor because when you get these playoff and World Series\nEven if you're a die hard fan economically to sell your tickets to some you know Instagram or YouTube celebrity was going to spend the whole game not sharing but taking selfies of themselves and tweeting them an instant ramming them so economics kind of plays into it to understand\nYou know you're right you're right you're right oh excuse Iowa but you're you know it's amazing um you know and I'm thinking about this\nWith these two teams charger good team yeah shame but they're playing for the nobody but they don't have any fans who have well your people see the egg or like you know are bleak view you last dog and\nOne of the ... the same that they feel the same about um they they they the the Spanish family and everything what they were taking them from the argument though from San Diego they feel the same as white and more people in America and that stuff up you see more of the opposing team's fans representing than you do charter\nOkay a little um\nOh there's the jets tomorrow yeah it was there or at ... field nah I counted building in all sports\nStory yeah that's awesome that's all\nWe were we\nWere just talking about the idea of an NFL team in London again because it's a little bit earlier Roger Goodell is in London and eat out once again talked about the prospects of an NFL team he said a a team could be here right here\nAnd they would figure out the schedule\nAnd they would do the could totally see that happening where do you think\nYou could have happened so much money just too much money I've been over there are a lot of like that NFL Europe things over there for ten years that lived there\nEnded up at around the international NFL international people and I've seen the commissioner over there for a ... you know for him ... though and um the amount you know their sponsorships and the money that they're at least the banking capital Carl Barclays ...\nIn Florida where they come back to the states and they'll stay there and train they'll have a facility there in London um you know I've got to figure out your currency issues and all that stuff and travel but they've been working on a real hard for\nThe last ten years and so I think it's going to happen I think it will happen within the next five years\nAnd I totally agree with you write a letter to a certain some attention to the college hoping that we were having a a thought we were talking earlier about the college football rankings into possible playoff scenario and I know that you cover a lot of big twelve football is Texas legit should they be one of these teams if they went out and take care of business and other things fall in front of me to be blamed for ... in the playoffs in\nWell they've got a terrible loss to Maryland right you know to start seeds and now they want ... and then they had an oppressive you know come from behind while not come from behind I mean Oklahoma Texas game was you don't want to ... college football this year and so you know\nIt's not going to be a great resume because of the big twelve doesn't have ruined my ... year\nSo [noise] you know when the big twelve championship and they went out right now whoever they would play in that whether it be West Virginia are you Oklahoma again\nOr there'll be the conversation but when I watch Oklahoma get beat by Purdue last week and I see the upsets that people think are upsets every week\nI just am curious what the ranking people move\nAnd at the end of the day you got to play it all out and they they get pretty close to getting the best for teams in it\nBut the rankings are just confusing to me because I've started to Alabama and maybe ... maybe I'll let you we'll find out next week LSU in Alabama played a it's Alabama then whoever three other teams you want to put it into right now\nHave you ever told than a great ball the have you ever seen this\nAnd in the fourth quarter it's unbelievable with two is doing one of them\n[noise] while we've ever you know I mean we've got maybe the best quarterback of the country I mean I I don't think that's even a debate best quarterback in the country and the best in the country you could never say that in any other Alabama team especially when they said what they had the best quarterback\nAnd the best team but now they've got the best quarterback on the best team and so I mean just the most dominant Alabama team that we can remember because the quarterback is also the best player of the country and that's just a departure from anything receiver for the\nWell let's turn some attention to the to the pro game in ... the you know there's been some there have been a couple of teams the giants and it looks like the raiders from what is\nDeemed to be having a fire ... have you seen in ... he remember in recent history where you this still it's still early in the season we're not even at the halfway point with the trade deadline has had an affect your teams just want to I guess start rebuilding if you will\n[noise] yeah I mean that's what's happening there just trying to acquire assets that basically said that um you know the season is over that's what they're telling all the players and fans we've strayed away a mark Cooper or trade with you like apple or your trade away you know snacks Harrison\nI mean they're just trying to acquire assets that looking into the future and we're going to be more and more of this I mean we're going to see more traits before the deadline um comes and goes uh you know the it's it's always been this it's always been good teams rate pat teams of good players\nThat's what's going on usually they got it free agency but now a salary cap is just so important especially when you've got to pay the quarterback and maybe your star player you know a good chunk of change so things are just right now in loaded contracts and good teams who are trying to acquire is Betty\nHow to handle a you know the contracts for the next player that gets traded here next week\nEyeball the rank the four quarterbacks because they'll get mobbed and rank guys yeah rag these four young ones did Sean watch car student when Patrick mobile homes and Jerry ...\n[noise] okay so I'm only one of them has played in a playoff game and he lost yard golf we always rank quarterbacks by playoff appearances and how they performed the playoffs and how they perform in Fort quarter complex\nSo much more homes has one of the great fourth quarter comeback to the season this year on that a Monday Night in Denver and we all got to watch it I have to put more homes first right now and now he's he's quarterbacking it I'm off into football\nAnd it's seven days but I Would start with homes first uh what your show watching it on Thursday night was he's [laughter] he's just unbelievable I mean I I mean that plays that Seventy three yards forty nine yards fifty eight young arts I mean it was just it looked like big twelve opposite\nOr more he's able to do what I said right now I Do more homes went\nOff and then watching that's how I Would go right now\nAnd I like that yeah I looked at ... or any logic\nProbably among the same way because as I I like his philosophy you talking about playoffs because we want to see guys in the big element in the big games not so much the regular season\nWe've seen regular season champs the regular season champ don't win anything um in in the big games Jared golf has got the most experienced gives him on his plate in the playoff game but these young quarterbacks have a bright future so I liked that ranking\nIt's I think they usually handled the jets were you when you look at the ... bears and break them down as much as ... you know the defense can definitely set them apart but as mentioned ... the one who's going to be able to take them and possibly win that division you they think I'm On a division\n[noise] well that division it's got a lot of the games left because you cannot count Detroit out right now the way the plane is finally decided that carry on Johnson's ... hunting and he just torched the Miami\nDolphins last week um and they got a good one two punch with him being looked out on right now all sorts of cruelty and playing really well\nSo I don't want to keep I I think it's too early way

I'm Sorry guys you're you're rushing things I Need some patients year also listen I fired off a tweet last\nRight oh I I saw a little bit of a Kevin Durant Steph Curry annihilation of the Knicks you saw that fourth quarter just assume nominee of points raining down on the next and I fired off a tweet and all these people are angry at me\nBecause I called Korean to rent the greatest ... of the NBA modern era and of course now that I'm In LA here all these Laker fans really going to be in shock and then of course you've got the Michael Jordan cruisers so we will dive into that but I actually want to start\nIn the NFL because this weekend slate is incredible last weekend I open the show saying you know nobody knows anything and I was spot on because I had my worst weak in the super contest I wouldn't want him before I was devastated my Sunday night was ruined\nI'm not kidding when you get in deep into this NFL gambling stuff and it's fun\nBut when you're in these contests and listen this is a one point four million dollar contest I was tied for first early in the season and I want one for you can't go one in four and I'm I'm studying the NFL this weekend I'm like\nWait a second last week nobody knew anything this week I Love the card everybody else was complaining about it and I kept coming back to this somebody once told me in life that you're you're not good until you're ...\nRight and and this applies to anything I said I'm not a good dad until I'm consistent\nAnd my punishments that I go all out or not consistent and any fathers out there listening driving your kids to soccer on a Saturday morning listen it ain't easy to say no to your little kids when they're crying yeah I mean listen I Know you've got to be tough dad but you've got to be consistent I mean listen you're not a good eater\nOn TV or ... whatever it is yeah might pop down to the ice cream shop and get a little bit of\nThat might do that two or three days a week you know ah I tell myself no donuts no don't know donuts and then they just opened a Randy's doughnuts which is like a big deal out here in LA within two miles in my house so like casually stop there a couple of days a week so I'm not a good either because I'm not consistently saying no to the unhealthy stuff\nAnd also this week speaking of consistent I picked up a golf club for the first time in at least five years and Gulf is the ultimate consistent ... right you know you could come out on the first hole and Dr something perfectly down there where you're like yeah\nAnd for the next four holes you'll pulls proceed to spray it into the woods again consistent you're just not good at anything\nTo consisted whether it's\nPing pong right tennis or anything you want to talk about sports or otherwise you've got to be consistent and right now in the NFL there's only four teams that are consistent\nI think there are only four teams right now that can win the super bowl\nA lot of inconsistent teams now maybe they can find that consistency over the next you know six seven eight weeks as they head into December for instance defending Super Bowl champs Philadelphia Eagles are they good right now\nThey're not consistent no running game defense is spotty the secondary still bad how you lose a seven point lead in the fourth quarter at home so right now the eagles are not good they are not consistent\nOr the Green Bay Packers good right now hell no this is a defense that God shredded at home two weeks ago by a guy who actually delivered me a pizza one side I think CJ bestseller right I think he was a pizza delivery guy like three years ago\nMean how does that happen\nJust didn't the Green Bay Packers right now are not good I could go on down the list folks Miami Dolphins number they started through you know people like oh they're stupid playoff team that's a sample size man three knows nothing here we are eight games in and what do you know water finds its level\nDolphins are foreign for average team once again\nCincinnati Bengals I feel like the bangles or the ultimate litmus test for this right we do this every year with a more of an Lewis the\nBangles well a good look good\nAnd all of a sudden the inconsistencies pop up and they miss the playoffs are they joke in the first round never be fooled by a more of an Lewis team member bangles were foreign one\nOh last two weeks consistency or lack there of they gave up Seventy three points in the last two weeks still have to play I look this up\nThe Bengals still have to play the saints ravens chargers Steelers for losses alone there they're not consistent you can forget about the bangles\nBut here's what I think we do know\nAs we approach the midway point of the season there are four teams that have been consistent\nWe can start with the ramp undefeated if they beat the Packers Sunday and I think they will actually think they're going to blow out the rain and\nRams when in New Orleans next week that's going to be tough I actually think I'm fine with ratcheting up the undefeated talk I'm not even kidding this team is so stacked remember right now they're doing this without to leap\nOne of their best quarterback they've had a couple of injuries that hasn't gotten a lot of publicity because they keep winning but the rams are consistent they're one of four teams\nThat can I Believe when the super bowl right now now a big test for them the greatest show on\n\n\n\nGo mobile once the California state in my lab with it I saw one of his point seven dot com for\nThe past the city [noise] on merit

earned dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more at discover\nDot com backslash match limitations like hey so real quick Isaac are you there I'll let you go first good morning good morning I Know you're Mr baseball let me ask you Eighteen innings seven hours\nWith last night's World Series game good or bad we're in the grand scheme of things it was good because if you look at the TV ratings in this\nThe friday I'm you know that's a tough night Friday nights a wasteland will will know that that's the thing though that I I mean the the ratings for the first two games though oh yeah everyone was expecting because these are the two two of the best brands in baseball for the ratings for the first two games will be much better than they did but the fact that it it was an Eighteen inning\nSeven hour and twenty minute game this has something to potentially\nBuild the buzz but I think the damage from a rating standpoint has kind of already been done a at with baseball the nationally\nTelevised sports so despite the fact that you have the red Sox and the Dodgers and now you suddenly have what for the moment is a very compelling World Series I still don't think the ratings are going to reflect that from a TV standpoint because the groundwork had not been properly laid\nFor major league baseball to get the sort of ratings that did in in the eighties when the ratings for the eighties won't like bars they were in the thirties yeah no no\nNo cable no net flicks that man and listen NBA ratings are down to start the seeds and we know NFL ratings were down a but in the grand scheme of things gathered and your thought like if you're a young kid who liked baseball there's no way you stayed up until three ... out here in LA there's no way you could have stayed up till midnight\nExactly and I fell asleep or on the fifteenth sending myself so but also I just think what hurts that is is the lack of a sense it's very hard for young you know the younger generation to want to stay tuned into a defensive shut out\nAs we saw last night yeah Sam you want to chime in I kind of signed with that looked at Eighteen ... or five runs scored this was like a twelve eleven game where you know massive excitement but they would go like two hours was almost like ... not even close to score\nIt yeah Eighteen innings is an entire extra game tacked\nOn there if it was about if it was twelve innings with the score and we had twelve or Thirteen or ... would have been fun last year it felt like the uh the\nAnd I think even Dodger fans who you ought to look at the stadium in the seventeenth ending raging hunting and\nYou're like a lot of them left I had a buddy who was at the game and he texted me they cut off food and alcohol sales and the ninth inning\nWhich I don't get it maybe you run out of food but why wouldn't you keep selling food to make money and you know the clear going you know no food or alcoholic\nBeverage I mean that seems rough but uh I I just got let me throw it real backed you real quick again we'll get to ... Rondo here in a second but what's the impact for the next to a game for the Dodgers in Red Sox having pictures were spent did do you think this help goes\nTo the Dodgers favor I Do uh the starting picks pitchers technically for both games right now are TVD so we're looking for my prediction being or all her size or in Roger Clemens' both coming out of retirement so from a momentum and in a in a pitching standpoint yes the Dodgers definitely have that in their favor going into this game and\nI Would add the red Sox probably ended up going to bed at their body clock at like five AM right I mean he asked them and they arrived at Dodger Stadium at twelve pm Pacific time yesterday is you know Jason\nUp in basketball and football players all show up about\nWhat you write off hours I've never understood why baseball players arrive four and five hours before the game so if they were there at twelve Pacific and they left the stadium at like two pieces to a out all the yeah so there were there for fourteen hours ... so maybe this helps the Dodgers and helps the series yeah\nAnd who knows where their hotel is whether it's downtown or whatever but that could Adams on some time as well yeah that's a ... hour a day\nOr All right let's pivot quickly to the NBA lawns overs Rondo that seems to be the big talking point for Lakers fans that I guess I don't totally get it I don't I Know ... has looked decent and I'm not going to go overboard and say was great he's improved over last year obviously when you were as bad through stretches as he was\nFolks look at the sample size that three games and you want to start lawns what's the rush the guys coming off an injury he only played in to pre season games\nAnd and now everybody's and we got to start 'em over run or you look at it it's not like the Lakers are struggling\nIn the first quarter or the first half this year okay let's look big picture\nFirst of all number one Lorenzo and ... were buddies last year tight on and off the court I Know they had that social media back and forth that for fun I'm telling these guys are tight OK they anchor the second unit right now instant off fence good chemistry\nThey work well together so I understand Alonzo should come off the bench with ... and now if you want to argue cruise we should start over Ingram I can buy that but he don't play no defence like who's been does not play defense ladies and gentlemen\nHe's not very good lawns though is a good defender we know the defense of metrics loved him last year but I liked the idea of him coming off with the second unit\nWith ... and you want to toss inland Stevenson enter a member of folks I was hammering people saying listen this team is deep\nSecond deepest team in the league\nI you know it I kinda missed the raptors Depp raptors would obviously be two in the Lakers I Would say or our third deepest team in the league know the warriors do not have a deep bench I'm Sorry they don't\nMaybe when cousins comes back but they can't go eight and nine deep the way the Lakers game now of course the warriors I better start or is it better high profile players no doubt but debts matters and again\nLook what happened in the Minnesota timber wolves last night Andrew Reagan sat out injured they lose by thirty at home to the box\nThe Houston Rockets without without James Harden you got a hamstring injury last night they lose that twenty five twenty at home to the clippers that's just out one starter I Know\nSecond leading score and won do they're starting point guard they want to add up three this week and the loan loss was an overtime so I mean Gavin you want to make the case\nOh yeah the laws are should start yeah I mean um you can simply look at the uh you know their record with balls started and these are short a small sample size absolutely and to be fair the numbers aren't totally in my favor actually here's an interesting that the Lakers are Twenty one point four points worse\nPR one hundred offensive possessions when balls on before but wait is that this season yes but again that's such a small sample exactly\nYou know I mean like I Can't get too worked up about it but Lakers fans love blondes do they bought the jerseys you know all that stuff let me add one other or no to the ... like veteran look at his history\nMiami when he came back to Cleveland he wants veterans guys who are proven\nThe young guys gotta work their way to the lineup Lubrano was never has played was rookies historically he trusts veterans guys with experience now I wouldn't be surprised if Alonzo starting by Christmas but I Do want to add this and you know I talk about youth sports on the show because my kids play sports and I coach him and stuff\nJust remember it's not about who starts\nIt's really about who finished because\nSorry in youth sports you know you try to rotate so everybody gets a chance to start right in the NBA you are still tinkering Lakers have three new starters\nBut\nIf he gets a big contract how are you going to pay to Marcus Lauren how are you going to pay in a couple of years ... how are you going to pay off Mari Cooper he's on a rookie deal for now but he's going to want to get paid you can't franchise tag everybody\nThe cowboys are in trouble this is this is about to get really ugly for the cowboys short\nAnd the timing was right right you go to the by week you get Cooper to kind of think up if you will with Jack\nAnd into the all fence cold be lead you know the white rapper Colby easily who also plays wide receiver he's all excited\nAnd understandably so and the schedule is in the you have the titans coming up next you know we know the falcons repeatable or they just lost the Redskins but the Redskins are not a great team\nAnd they end the season with colds books and giants three non playoffs he's\nSo yeah that was could sneak in and maybe a more Cooper and everybody says Jerry Jones is a genius at the cowboys sneak in at nine and seven or eight and ... but I'm telling you man next summer the summer after that there's going to be so many problems because they got to pay everybody\nAnd they can't pay everybody and it's going to get ugly I just I I'm very if ... now Jerry Jones had done it for a second or third round pick or second the fifth nobody would care about our first round pick when you're a three and four\nI mean in all honesty cowboy three and four debt Prescott goes down this team five in all of it and you're picking on the top ten and now the raiders that that the first round draft choices in the NFL are huge and the cowboys don't have one coming up next year\nOn the big lead Fox Sports radio what are the ... biggest stars is demanding a trade and something happened this week in

so\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nDo the talking points out his eyes are going to have a dot com detail with Jason mcentire\n[laughter]\nThe big league is now\nCan you\nGuys are sports radio studios [noise] ladies and gentlemen here's your o.s Jason McIntyre [noise] well comeback\nLadies and gentlemen our number two here on the big leave Fox Sports radio I Am your host Jason McIntyre coming to you live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on par insurance visits\nGeico dot com for a free re quote a\nLot of folks out here in LA probably just waking up after the eight teen inning marathon seven hours wow\nKudos to those of you who sat through the game at Dodger Stadium as I said earlier I had a buddy who said they cut off food an alcohol sales in the ninth inning so ah\nHats off to you a Heinz souls who were able to stay and watch that when a classic for sure oh we got a lot of NFL an NBA talked to get too but right now we're one hour from kick off in college football around the country so we want to bring in one of the foremost experts on the sport\nJoke class the great college football analyst for Fox joining us he got the call\nOn Kansas State Oklahoma today Joel good morning how are you what's going on Jason how are you doing man\nExcellent than uh you know I wanted to have you on a ... you know you're obviously plugged in on college football you got a pretty good game today I Know that spread is large but a Kansas State kind of could be a a sleeping dog here I Want to start with Oklahoma Joel\nWhose putting a video game numbers I Want to just get your thoughts on Oklahoma as a playoff contender we know they had the last to Texas but can they get back in the mix and would you they need to happen for Oklahoma to get back in the playoff contention\nWell there's no doubt that there in in contention the first thing that you got to understand is that in the big twelve they're going to play round Robin regular season and then they're going to play a rematch in the conference title game ... able to get there and that rematch is likely to be against Texas so\nIf Oklahoma work to wind up a big twelve champ with just one last their resume would be excellent apps excellent the only loss would be a neutral site to a top ten team\nI'm the only resume that I think could potentially be better from a woman lost perspective is probably Michigan with that loss to the first week of the season to an undefeated Notre Dame game\nUm I think that's the only thing that they would lose out to 'em and that's only if one's in Alabama Notre Dame and wind up the season on to feed it to Oklahoma has got a great shot at this or in a position to\nActually make their third playoff but they've got to take care of business today I Know that you know you've touched on that Kansas City Kansas State has actually beaten Oklahoma to the last three times a year and a woman\nThough and this is a theme Oklahoma's only last ten home game since two thousand so through those being Kansas State and a three of the last time that they were here so it could be interesting today and we'll see that type of character in particular on the defensive side Oklahoma has now with the new defensive coordinator\nYeah love bill Snyder is an underdog hey Joel quickly I'm curious your thoughts on Lincoln Riley I Know he's only thirty five\nBut we've seen the NFL kinda pivot towards younger coaches aggressive all sensitive spread kind of guys you know when you're meeting with Lincoln Riley do you get the sense that she's gonna be coveted by NFL franchises in his off season 'cause we know the coaches have made\nBut it it's just a matter of whether Lincoln's going to be interested in on candidly you know I asked him that yesterday's different foreign blank in his office\nI just said hey you know with these young guys in the office and you know really evolving towards the college system at the NFL level you know do you have that much\nAnd he and he answered unless you're always gonna get oh you know concentrating on on this job you're and you certainly gave some of the stock answers but he also said\nListen my family's really happy here my daughters are happy my wife's happy and we've been through and an inordinate amount of change already in the last year and a half I'd really like what we can do here\nAnd and I believe them you know call me crazy comical but I think someone's going to come after him or if he takes it good for him but you know I wouldn't be shocked if he stays put this is a place that you can be for a long time remember that and this is not in it it's a total ego\nWay to go to the NFL because you're making a lot of money in college football\nHe's making this year about foreign three quarter million that's going to go up over the next few years and and in this day and age I think he's the type of guy that could be at Oklahoma for ten years Fifteen Years very similar to what Bob Stoops was and just you gotta understand over that amount of time before the salaries are going\nYou could in theory make between sixty five and eighty five maybe even upwards of a hundred million dollars being the head coach at Oklahoma over that time you're not going to make any more money in the NFL or so you know it wasn't shocked me at all if he stays put\nYeah interesting now we do the big fish in a small pond theory but he's at Texas guy right I think I looked up he was from Lubbock, Texas do you know if he's a cowboys fan could you know the Jason given situation could get interesting there\nYeah I didn't ask him specifically about the cowboys but that that the team that I Would expect would do the hardest at him I wouldn't be surprised if\n... has been very eager to take a look at and evaluate Justin Herbert at Oregon um so yeah I mean all of those things I think would be on the table or and and I think that those two teams would probably be the first ones are in Norman, Oklahoma and the off season\nAt least scratching the surface and and and seeing if Lincoln Riley would want to come do that and here's the other part of this\n[noise] I just made the case for why he would stay let me quickly make the case for why you would go\nBecause you're never going to be blemish if you go and don't succeed in the NFL and we've seen that time and time again chip Kelly mix tape and are great examples of that so you can go to Steve Spurrier you can go try it for a couple of years and if it doesn't work out you're gonna get a ... job right when you get back into college football\nIt's it's it's almost like college doesn't care at all your success rate at the national football league they'll only hearken back to what your success rate was as a college coach um so you know from that standpoint you're not going to lose any value if you go try it for two or three years\nThat's a great point Joel quickly Baker Mayfield and his former quarterback in Cleveland we know the browns are huge action we won't die down that rabbit hole but any shot you think Lincoln Riley would move from norm into a Cleveland, Ohio\nIt would be interesting for Baker I Do think that that was interesting and that's a roster where I could see him um you know potentially saying that's a good enough for Oscar I Would have a quarterback that understands me that we had a lot of success together that'd be interesting I mean there's\nNot a ... year on all over the country but man you want to live in ...\nCum laude Joel do go there I mean let's be honest right come on I I'll protect you Joel talk with the great Joel play college football announcer he's got Kansas State Oklahoma today Joe let me ask you about Michigan and we've been on the Michigan a trained since they lost\nAll of a sudden they're back in the mix like they're right there and we'll get off from Ohio State ... of course\nI actually think Michigan they could be the better team right now than Ohio State I Know we're several weeks away in Michigan still has to come out of the buying or take care of Penn State the Penn State's looked shaky your thoughts on how the Big Ten is shaking out right now\nThat would certainly think that Michigan is my favorite right now they're the team that works the best I just had them last week\nAnd here's the thing and and back to back weeks without would I Would consider is their best player in Russia on Gary they've absolutely dismantled dismantled to rank Kleenex Wisconsin that Alex Warner Brooke didn't even have a prayer in that ball game in Ann Arbor\nIn Michigan State and Bryan that working who a lot and a fellow scouts actually like oh I have a work you put up one of the worst quarterback reforms as I've seen a long time and he's pretty good player\nHad the

rams Packers that's going to be a good one I I I Can't tell what the game of the weekend is is it rams Packers or\nIs it Vikings saying I mean the rams Packers is is Brett a big spread so I don't know if technically everybody will agree it's a game but a lot of people think Aaron Rodgers going to show up and that one we will see\nA brought to you by discover card we treat you like you treat you by the way if you missed joke lot just now I thought that was like a great eleven minutes just a\nJust a bunch of interesting stuff the Denver Broncos Lincoln Riley connection now that is interesting I Would think you know obviously everybody saying Baker may feel Cleveland Browns\nMake sense for Lincoln Riley okay a geographically I don't know if it's a good fit ... and ... geography matters to some of these college coaches um keep an eye on the Broncos Lincoln right I I like that that's interesting I also think if the cowboys flop and Garrett gets bounced\nPotential there a Lincoln Riley

Stanley he's a pro prospects okay\nAnd I will can get to the Big Ten title game I'm taking the six and a half points there with Iowa at Penn State next up I Know this isn't a and I talk about this on my pod cast a got a gambling pot has podcast called coming up winters we talk about a fine\nPurdue was in a bad fine okay last week of course the big win over Ohio State everybody saw national TV they've been celebrating in West Lafayette all week\nNow they've got to travel to Michigan State right you're thinking let down there's no way they can match the energy well Michigan State\nIs really really beat up their quarterback we don't know is that it's a you may not play the wide receiver their number one receivers out their top running backs hurt they are so beat up they only got Ninety four yards of offense against Michigan last week\nI think ... you can go into East Lansing and win outright they're getting a point and a half I like her do\nThe fishing line of the week award goes to the misery tigers they're favored by seven over Kentucky now if you're not a huge college football fan you may not know Kentucky's ranked they're taught in the country [noise]\nHow on earth are they seven point underdog at Missouri Missouri for three what's going on here that's why this is the cause she lied as a week [noise]\nSomebody knows something\nAt home they they did cover against a mighty Georgia covered fourteen and a half I like drew lock in this spot [noise]\nUh and I'm taking Missouri favored by seven I Know that's a lot but I'm taking the tigers there by seven at home [noise] next up I'm going to go with another Iowa City Iowa State psych loan if Iowa sham it's still in the building he probably loves it and not only am I taking Iowa plus six point five I'm taking Iowa State favored by three and a half\nAgainst Texas Tech now Iowa State started slow but they've been bouncing back their NFL running back David Montgomery he's healthy again\nAnd here's the reason I'm dating Texas Tech I Know kings very has them rolling their five and to what they host Oklahoma next week massive gay rights huge game and the big twelve Texas acts good this year and there are actually playing some defense but in the last four years before the Oklahoma game [noise]\nTexas Tech but win for one in three against the spread gimme Iowa State favored by three and a half and finally the only team that cost me money last week the Mississippi State bulldogs I had them at LSU\nAnd they couldn't deliver now they weren't awful in that game but the four turnovers killed up they moved to football well statistically they matched LSU but the four turnovers ra killer I'm going back to Mississippi State and here's what the public saw that game Mississippi State LSU last week it was a national\nTV games the public Joe public who's like I can be twenty bucks on whatever to you give me a hundred walking into a casino this weekend [noise]\nThe public is eighty six percent on the road underdog jumbo fish Texas a and M.

Mets have a deal in place to hire agent Brody band wagon as their new general manager now bandwagon and is currently\nWould be there knocking on the door every single year they haven't and there has to be a reason for that and a culprit so to speak so he would be the the logical choice but I don't see the Packers necessarily doing anything during the season I think if they were going to make a change it would be a it would be after the season but\nIt is Aaron Rodgers and it's still a long season there's plenty of time for them to get it back together and be you know make a\nDivision Ron or a wildcard run but they've got a really tough schedule coming up uh and it starts on Sunday against the rams and this could be the defining part of their season going\nAll right good stuff Vinnie

that\nI think that's going to happen in sports gambling and Preston is kind of one of the guys who starting to get in the mix\nYou I'm sure you see him are all over social media he's now doing some stuff for ESPN shock uh\nYou're so I've been doing a lot of stuff for them and then he asked me and my my favorite thing I'd probably done in a long time is running there like a weekly NFL call them

weekend so we have a special guest in the studio a professional gambler yes it's true heat actually gambled for a living fascinating story it was just telling it to me in the break his name sports cheetah at sports cheat on Twitter Preston Johnson\nJoining the show Preston thanks for coming in the studio no I appreciate it fun to be here uh so now you are a professional gambler I don't know how much of this you want to tell on the air um but how long have you been doing this just to give the readers a sense of uh what it's like out there for sure national gambling\nSure no it's it's been a while now I think I was ... I was playing online poker originally at the end of high school and doing All right in that boy did in college paid for college with that and then Black Friday happened which would have been about eight years ago now and we couldn't play online poker anymore and so I had like a bank roll set aside for online poker that I was well what do I do with this now\nAnd I was like you know I've always liked sports I was actually studying sports psychology at the time I my master's degree in sports psychology and I was you know I could probably do this and it's very numbers oriented and they had the kind of bankroll management I guess you'd call it from poker than I can apply to betting\nAnd so I just went for it and it for the first few years it was slower and I was reading a lot less than than I Am now per game um but that's part of I guess the learning process and experience and so now I think seriously betting it's probably been Seventy years but allowing betting for a year or two before that just kind of on my own\nSo we know that you can get an edge betting like the WNBA you know there's a ... of the absurd hadn't as you can make a lot of money or use that kind of guy like looking at everything or you just focusing NFL college football NBA you\nTo try to look at everything if there isn't as you're supposed to be betting it no matter what there are guys out there are betting WNBA or tennis or soccer or or props around like the only betting MBA over under on assist props or points rebounds props I don't have time to do everything I'll be honest I mean it's unrealistic if someone says I win betting everywhere\nAnd then I'll do the MBA in college basketball\nWow All right let me give you my college football picks before we get the NFL real quick tell me if you like any of these I said Iowa State favorite by three and a half\nSure I think that ended up closing like five and a half sick really you've got a good move their nice arena and I took Missouri favor by seven against Kentucky that lines so funky I now I'm actually against you just 'cause I usually just play the numbers and I had been Missouri last week was my biggest better the season but I I took Kentucky parts of and it was a smaller but but\nI had like three and a half so I had to just yell and not something something seems up you've got to be right in my beef is she a Missouri does wins you know twenty eight zero halftime and it's easy I Know it's a bad spot ... plus one and a half at Michigan State of sharp that actually gives automatically you're thinking it's the worst spot everyone's going back how ... can stay at one point favorite home\nI think will work is out if he is but it's still nice so you got it out and Purdue actually ended up closing a favorite or if it might still be open on the ... it's not a clock but I'm not sure if they started at nine but that's a good bet to I think that's going to be a winner\nI took Iowa plus six and a half in happy valley a Penn State has Michigan next week\nI'm opposite on you or I laid four and a half so if if all ... and a half ... wins by six I let it early in the week we can both be winners [laughter] I'll root for that but middle yeah this is one of those things where I was everyone's been trying to you know bet against them as they were a favorite and now that they're a dog and I've just been blowing everyone out\n... everyone can be backing Iowa has a dog it feels like says one of those ... I had a number eight point one so I probably do the public's on Iowa I think it's a popular underdog\nOh dang it and then finally Mississippi State favorite by two and a half in home another pot in hopes listen I saw that LSU game they were not good like\nThis to be said wasn't good but there was this you know I let you fill out one yard ... uh for play I think for the first half or LSU on off into Mississippi State defense is really good I think in Ames offered by it helps them a little but this is a total corn slip for me I didn't even touch it\n[noise] okay so those are the college football picks up were pressed in Johnson professional sports gambler in the studio ... so we'll go through the super contest stick by the way how are you doing in the contest for us\nTwenty two and I guess Thirteen yeah I'm only four games over five hundred and he's still got me by like for all right well you have a year the professional you do this for a living I'm let's get started a I guess we'll start with the game we both have\nDid you take you said you took the Steelers yeah okay so we both have the Steelers favor by eight I Know it's a big number and as a professional gambler you're probably an underdog player or do you play numbers and none of teams\nYeah it's usually numbers and it can be either an underdog or a favorite I Would say generally more underdogs are probably applied betting fifty five or six percent underdogs by coincidence yeah I'm not trying to look for underdogs only or anything\nBut so Steelers by eight or what is it the the psychology of Mike Tomlin coming off a by Pittsburgh had a I guess five ... Cleveland was plus five in the turnover and I don't know what I'm saying Hi yeah Hi rod Taylor was acutely\nYeah big or maybe it's better quarterback but ultimately they're going to be better meaning the Steelers off of the by by ride number not even accounting for about a week which is worth about one point two points are historically a bye week as a ten points to wild or eight like I'm going to be ... it wasn't for the super kind doesn't like my fourth or fifth biggest edge it and we\nNow I I Know people out there listening will hear raw number what can you talk about what goes into your number I don't you don't have to reveal your secrets us so that's why I I have like\nA set of power ratings that I Do and adjust manually every week and then I have a model that actually just puts out a number based on the data from this year\nAnd some data entering the season and I kind of way the two together to get a a number and there's some other guys I'm Talking with trading information with like give me some ideas on certain games inside throughout the week but I generally and going to trust my numbers versus where the market is I've actually NFL's been pretty good so far\nI'm so I'm probably due to have a bombing we know what I'm here with\nYou [laughter] I I don't know man that listening to you you know your stuff so we'll go Steelers we both agree on whose you give me your next play\nSo we're opposite on this one I think I I think are a total mess\nAnd I almost went to five ugliest just on the cars are still my bills like how are you going to bet the Packers against Iran talking about the Broncos against that yeah and then ... and drugs were masses\nAnd I use the raiders and jags though just because I I almost both of them should have been around pick I think and you're getting a field goal I just had to do it with a number and honestly if if if if I'm wrong can't get something ...\n... he was really upset if you can't get this out of their players this week then they're done but this is the way guys thinking there during the maximum effort after next\nOkay fine max ever know AJ ... secondary we know up new Algernon Jeffrey back playing well Aguilar should have a big day\nI I Wish the eagles didn't blow that Seventeen leaving the fourth quarter the Panthers because then they would have been more value on the jak I'd feel a lot more comfortable getting the job [noise] I mean something's wrong with the they can't run the football at all but a little more Miller I\nThink at a hundred yards a couple of weeks ago maybe against the jets yeah last week yeah I mean it was I was on the jak last week and that won't hurt the ... did you did you see I'm Wondering about the raw numbers just remember last year they were getting all the turnover and now all of a sudden this year they're not getting\nTheir morals is turning it over on top of that it's not even lived there during the middle I think they are second in the NFL rush it the second worst and giveaways\nYeah let me ask you about engaging betting so there was a great stat or I think the jags last year we're tending to when they scored first you know they ride the defense in the run again this year three you know when they score first oh in for when they don't show is their value if the eagles get on the boat was an early touchdown go up seven nothing\nIs their value in game against the jak\nWould say that it's a pretty small sample yeah I don't want to take everything you know just straight off of that but there's something to a logical you were when they score Fritz especially last year when Leonard for that was healthy yet but they could rely on Iran game and the defense of so good that was a lead they're tough to beat when a plane from behind and you have to

about and and I'll offered games were I think there's value\nAnd of course Preston knows as a gambler oh yeah I Love like coastal Carolina this weekend well\nYou can't tell a producer on a TV show let's I I like coastal Carolina 'cause it could be like the audience is going to change the channel but at the same time if the audience wants value and picks sometimes you're going to go have to go obscure in off the board and that's going to be a tough one like president\nIf you're going to go on a TV gambling show this week they're going to say I need to pick Packers rams everybody's talking about that game where do you got for us and what do you say\nYou know that's that's that's the tough part about doing that sometimes when you're writing articles are doing shows or pot yet I I Will tell me a lot more opportunity in those smaller games a smaller market games just because the market isn't as liquid not been into his often and and ultimately rams backers are going to be a huge it's a popular game to be honest to answer your actual question\nIf I was about anything I think I Would just take Packers money line it's it's either going to be they win outright and you can get whatever it is a plus three fifty yeah or they're gonna lose by twenty eight\nOr like funny so I Do I started a pod cast coming up with ... you know and we do a money line pick island west Packers money line even though I like the rams to win big\nThat it's one or the other in my opinion shocked if it really came down to the eight nine ten range just feels like one of those\nYeah so let's go with your

missing\nWow and and I didn't put real money on this so I'm not telling everyone to end the super ... generally maybe have three or four NFL picks a week but this is like the last choice I had to just go with one in my numbers as it should be closer to seven or even ah when they put in Denver a few weeks back they close three and a half\nAnd you can assume at home field in in the NFL worth roughly two to two point two five I thought it was three it's that's a misconception that okay to be completely honest you can you can probably Google it and kind of woke up some numbers that have been run but it's it's all it's less in the NFL or college is going to be higher college is gonna be a three to four months five like for Hawaii Boise State\nWay down in ... I Do wonder a like a Denver home field advantage but also Kansas City at night now this game that during the day one o'clock I think there's probably got to be a half point Casey at night they forget night New England at night\nActually have Kansas City higher home field advantage in Denver even though they are really isn't that yeah it's like a probably point two points higher huh lately comes in really high but uh Seattle's up there but\n... and ultimately you can talk about all that stuff it's fine\nHow are you getting in front of the ... train exact with the Denver team that I Know this is the third time they seem to homes right there's some weeks Seventeen last year I think we'll get caught and earlier this year so and I use the analogy for baseball right the first time to the lineup wow man that guy's throwing smoke and then the second and third time you maybe\nSome navy Denver's I I just keep coming back to this\nNow Vance Joseph isn't all you know\nThat's very I mean the Arab

happen but John Elway can convince people stuff keep an eye on Lincoln\nRiley is he's the one that he's like the McVeigh kind of Shanahan is mine's offensively like he would be an office of coordinator there are they going to get him to the jets I really think it's a geographical fit but real quick though you're making points I think why you have to just take the Broncos the numbers to hide but the cheese\nBut when it was plus four and a half I remember they were up to up for another ten and then it was fourteen straight for the cheese and it landed foreign to close three and a half so it kind of came down to when you've got to the side and after that game as I swore off against that you\nKnow that I'm now you're back on toilet paper gradually that's right down to it so quick note chief defense off all the numbers say that bat yeah last two games at home I Believe was Jacksonville\nWhere they shut them down and Cincinnati where they shut them down\nIt's gotten better is there something changing they went from I think thirty or thirty first in the NFL to twenty fifth now which one right now so I mean they've improved and Arab varies gonna come back hopefully eventually that didn't Houston I'm really injury but I think ... various where to say just one player on defense 'cause we were talking about quantifying the value of players on defense or or quarterback or running back\nOr star receiver Eric berries one of those guys that he could swing you're saying there one of your top four Super Bowl contenders that could win it he could be the

Lakers during the separating them\nUm they'll find a lot of time for them to be on the court together because this is going to be um you know the Lakers are going to be you know play a lot of different lineup so they can\nBut uh the characters in the thing I Do think it's really interesting how you run away from Britain granted in our ...\nOur bill real quick uh I Know you don't want to put too much in an early season game but they already lost one to the spurs their four games against San Antonio this season and I got to say you don't want to go in that oh to hold because that western conference could be tight you know any thoughts on the importance of the game in San Antonio I don't know\nWhy do think they're all important in in the western conference late and I I mean you'd I've read the point you\nJust made a I mean you really lose ... wouldn't worry too much about three game losing streak in February eighty but because the start of the season and you know how how tight the ... western conference there does the there is a real sense of urgency\nBecause of the whole they dug themselves into start the season right we've ... team that could be right there with the Lakers if any wherever that six to ten slot in the west conference\nAnd so you don't want to have already conceded the tie breaker in the first week of the new um yeah I I Do think there's a little bit of extra motivation to San Antonio or the Lakers looked really good suppose\nLast week that was obviously a close game they think of the key is finding somebody who can be challenged Marta rose in

I'm\nI'm doing very well and it's great to be with you it's been a couple of years it has been since we have done the show\nOr I think it was in the second inning of game three of them were actually he's apple I did a show because that was for ever last night\nAnd into the morning I always gave me if you missed wondering 'cause I Know most people and again you east coasters I mean how many people on the east coast we're still watching is at three thirty in the morning you might have passed out so if you miss that if you if you still think the game is going it's not\nIt actually ended here's the call\nIt's Charlie Steiner or we have Charlie Snyder making the call\nOn the Dodgers radio no more\nNo one more excited bullying\nI I I\nIs one of those nights where you you have an assignment Dan we've all been there in this business after many many years that sort of defies all logic it was one of those last minute assignments for me to do in LA TV or I thought I was going to be in Studio but at the last second they said no no no we have you at Dodger Stadium\nAnd I said because I come up from San Diego said I'm not going to be there till nine the game's going to be over I mean it's going to be long over and then I'm going to sit around for a couple of hours at an empty Dodger Stadium well as it turned out I left at eleven thirty at my last update eleven thirty on TV and the game on for another\nHour after that I wondered why stay because with the east coast TV station said TV station for Boston locally\nThey would have had the set up a eleven o'clock news at eleven Thirty years there will be able to go get a Red Sox up\nThree hour or two or whatever the case may be and the gate was moving along to that point and about the fourteenth ending I'm like maybe they'll be able to do good morning Boston alive shot and say we are live here at Dodger Stadium is this game continues to go on and\nThen and it was on and on and on and I don't know like what position you guys are in or how you sit there and we're just kind of a truck I ever waiting for the stadium so what\nWe're doing is I have to occasionally for what was our ten o'clock news in our eleven o'clock news you know do a tease or do an update from the stadium but you know I'm I'm watching the game because we're outside this I never was actually in the ballpark\nEver I mean I was I ... I got there stole away I didn't even have time to get the credentialed to actually get into the ballpark and you're just standing outside of the the outside as young as you said you know it was interesting though being outside the stadium is\nAfter every inning so we're ... you know I get there basically at the end of the ninth inning so after the ten eleven twelve\nNow that we're in a lot but there would be started like after every half in and you see about\nOh I don't know like Fifteen twenty people walking by and I'm like why would you leave I mean you can bet that the money to be at the world series which was a lot of money we saw the ticket price it's a friday night it's not like a school night or anything like that why you we asked this\nLaw wife asked me that last night in the fourteenth ending she goes would we used to be at this game and I know know we'd be gone we would we would probably have left tell one nothing in the eighth or like that but that's just my my my being I Know it sounds ridiculous\nThe point being it's funny to see what range people lab because concessions closed and then they had to open back up we're all they could really serve or things like\nPopcorn rap shows like you're not going to have the pulled pork sandwich available to the sixty dealing\nWith those shut down for a while and then had to reopen everybody is kind of going on the fly and as you said how many times you get to go to a World Series how many times is it going to be the extra innings and going as long as it did in trying to weigh what you've got going on decisions decisions but what about ten Fifteen trickling out each time was that what\nIt was about ... about a dozen ... and they would walk by our trucks and I would say\nWhy are you Amy how are you kidding me you know how I noticed people were leaving because Marlins Man made it into the camera frame\nIt about this thing and he was off to the side or the majority of the game didn't get one of the prime seats right behind home plate but by ... sixteen because enough people have left he had moved into the cameras shop behind the plate so I was like wow there are people who are actually\nBy the way they bring Marlins girl with him I didn't even see I did I did not see that he is dynamite there's no question about that that's an I fall All right so anyway so yeah it was one of those I mean it just shattered all the records the longest ironically the longest ... game in World Series history was the last time the ...\nThe red Sox pitcher through a complete game his name was Babe Ruth seen through all the headings so\nYou know here's that final call and the robin's radio network no\nObject [laughter] so you go to ... just getting by the way I had a heart attack by the way and those\nDays remember ever that there's no baseball that's a day game there was only so long you could go um and then of course seven hours in twenty minutes not only by far just obliterated they all time record for longest World Series game it was the longest game time wise\nIn both the red Sox and Dodgers history they never had a seven hour twenty minute game\nI Know the Dodger fans are on cloud nine if they're awake right now with this when yeah another Red Sox fans are saying oh no here we go again this is going to happen to us this is where a cursory starts if you're not a fan of one of those teams\nThat was a tough watch last night it it really was I there there wasn't enough happening Steve in the other innings the where you were captivated your just more like\nWhat is this thing going to end she had the ... to one of the thirteenth All right this is exciting than the Dodgers score again and it resets but there wasn't it wasn't like it was strategy it wasn't like that there were rallies being\nBack at going back and forth give me a six hour Wimbledon match\nOver what we saw last night because as a casual fan was not an easy watch for what we had\nA well first of all as I said a couple of times of my news updates um this game should've been over three hours earlier for hours earlier here's what I don't get let let me let me take it back in time\nOr were they made relive Eighteen ending so Steve are you know I'm not going to go to the the ladies there although I we could do that and I've done the known to do that\nAll right so the amazing thing about Dodgers World Series history is that they won six World Series all Time Warner Brooklyn five in LA and in half of those series\nYankee Stadium one in seven Nineteen sixty five World Series last the first two in Minnesota one in seven andme in Nineteen eighty one was the first two it Yankee Stadium one for in a row so in other words\nIt's it's only happened eleven times every but the Dodgers half of their World Series wins had been one they've been down to games to none so I'm thinking this is perfect especially when the comparisons to Nineteen eighty one habit\nSo Nineteen eighty one of the world series in which Howard Cosell and ABC proclaim before the series of the Yankees were better every position than the Dodgers and then the Yankees won the first two games Yankee Stadium series over\nThe Dodgers come back we're Fernando balance well his rookie year in game three as dominant as he had been early in the year he had struggled a little bit down the stretch well this game he was struggling gives up a couple of home runs he walks seven batters in a gay but Tommy all assorted said he staying in\nThat overall one hundred and eighty dollar value mountain day\nGoes by the next five minutes

is a Buckeye die hard after what happened last week with that blow out wash\nAgainst Purdue and you know it's one of those games you know like let's say Dwayne Haskins its role in five\n... he didn't I mean the dean\nFoust got absolutely run over by Purdue they're taking the week off I thought you might take a week off to rebel about Iraq that yeah that that's one of the day you don't have to worry about the book I\nThere was no game if you were seen how things it transpired really from the start of the season it's been in any team that obviously loses a potential first overall pick the third gave the year is going to take a hit on defense but it's that's\nFall because we get selling Avon and we see two are throwing the ball over the lot for for Alabama and we we see\nOklahoma putting up fifty points a game of Kyla Murray running about the physical nature of just running the ball down someone's wrote sometimes gets lost in college football teams still do it Michigan's doing it right now and with great success and that's why they they've shot at the polls\nThat spent Ohio State this year they're they're offensive line Izzy liability right now and when you have to good running backs and J.K Dobbins of Mike Leiber and they aren't getting the job done you say what's wrong with the running back towards the five guys in front this line isn't even close to the line that they had the last couple of years\nAnd it shows are getting beat up front and it hurts the back into the defense Purdue up and down the field can tackle rundown Moran DJ knocks last week and\nYeah now I just ate sitting in the spot where many people including myself don't think there'll be Michigan a month from\nNow I just think of what do you have spinning in his grave scene and has the quarterback throwing Seventy three pass says they have any three that's more passes in some seasons and Ohio State back in the day their strengths\nOn their team they do have a really good wide receiving corps they're four or five guys that are legit threats when they touched the football\nBut I I don't care you have to run the ball and you have to stop the run and Ohio State has not been able to do that there's warts on every college football team at Ohio State she's just been covered up by lake comeback against Penn State questionable play calling by James Franklin ... especially late in that game and\nIt was an opportunity where Ohio State maybe would have been knocked off but they escape the victory do you think everything's good the next week they had trouble with Minnesota and then the produce game last week so abide probably came in the right time for Ohio State but they've got to turn it around quickly because right now they're not good enough to be\nProjecting forward by the way Dan is already a projected he'll share that a little bit later on uh the play off if you want to know who's going to be in the late ... what the rankings are going to be when when it comes out I\nHe's like over reading certain teams so that they can put that number in front of them\nTo go there again and again it's a I like I don't blame ESPN I get it I mean they're the ones paying the bills so it say ESPN national championship that's what it is it has no legitimacy at all obviously because you have you know conferences multiple schools Alabama should not have been in the playoff you say well they won the playoffs\nAnd they lost their ... they didn't even play in a conference championship game then you know as well as I Do there is such an easy solution to this where they didn't that doesn't need to be committed if you want to have even a semblance of his so called playoff you up five power conferences there's a championship game and each\nThat's five representatives and then the highest ranked\nTeam from the a group of five so at least they have some path to upon ... light like last year usa UCF now you have six teams that are over there a way you don't even need a committee six teams are in the way the top two seats get by\nThe other four playoff creating a fine of ... only adding two more games so the mix\nAnd you don't have to have a committee in other words you want to be in the championship you've gotta when your conference tournament championship game you when it you're automatically in the top ranked team out of the group of five so you again you have half the schools\nAnd I you know I I'm a dear friends who rocky long the San Diego state football coach there is no path\nFor central Florida South Florida or any other group of five schools to even be in the playoff they will never ever ever they could go Thirteen and all winning fifty to end up being every game they have no path\nName any sport in any support anywhere I play it and what you have no idea how to when he had said I ... I Would have the schools don't so but anyway I I'll be interested in hearing your rankings out there but here's here's here's here's my question to this because I think it's a legitimate question\nIt's an eight team bracket if you will and let's just say you figured out a way with the mountain west and other teams do you think do you think ... each school from the mountain west conference or a Sun Belt would want to get humbled by Alabama in a ... you could call a quarter final game meaning one and sixteen game like we would see in\n... Oklahoma back in the day oh that's right\nThey did well I was ... Byard they pulled out all the tops in that game and they figure it out a way\nThis is what we call we see in the essay basketball tournament where agency literally blow out team like at George Mason or a butler are somebody finds\nA way on that day one day to come up with the Supreme effort and get the brakes pull out an upset that sports\nAnd I know it is I Know and the funny thing about this is when I ask Steve the question that wasn't an obvious answer\nBecause I Do think like a buffalo bulls team\nWould want to play Alabama and if they lose fifty six to nothing they lose fifty six to nothing but you are in the dance so I I'm actually agreeing with you in in allowing that to happen because it sets up something if you look around college football right now and one of the biggest problem is I think the college football\nDoesn't have the same feel as it has in other years and really hasn't like the we thought that the the playoff rankings and now that they're come out would\nBring a lot of discussion and a lot of energy to the game this year it hasn't been that way because Alabama is so good\nAnd and because we're all resigned to the fact that Alabama is going to be in the playoffs and whether it be because of last year of them getting in by not winning the confidence still winning the national championship it doesn't have the same field Steve but if you look at a game right here Wisconsin or northwestern going at it each team has won last and their\nConference and the Big Ten west right now battling for that spot in the in the title game you look at the pack twelve right now which is just\nIn the past twelve north I don't know but these races could all be good race is if you would allow a carrot to be there at the end of the role\nIn the legs with oil and again that yes well that is going to get locked out again out of the play out this is it's a sham it's a joke I get it ESPN paid a lot of money to create a fake playoff it is a fake play out it's not a true play up we're going to get much more into the U.S they were just a lot of fake news going on out there\nI was trying to right now we're in the guy go Fox Sports radio studios\nA popular narrative right the Packers are going to pull the upset because the rams are being favored by so much and people not believing in this ramps team one of the big match ups to watching the game as when jerk off approaches the line of scrimmage I'm Talking pacing\nOf this ... you know that that ... and this had said whichever he's allowed to do every coat can do it but he tries to get you know Jared trust get ramped up to the line quickly\nForce that defends the set then when they sat and they have to keep the wrong person all on the field Sean changes the player even start from ... in the rams run from there so I wouldn't be very curious to see how the jerky to what they can do to try to keep the Packers defense from substituting too much my pet loves the pro multiple packages\nAt teams it's been a very different deep Pentagon Papers which was a lot more basic and simplistic and what and what you know is being run now or am I cut and that's not the safest certainly going to be more successful in the long run but that's just what's happening right now in Green Bay I just think the rancher too good they're not going to undefeated they have their their weakness that they have their flaws\nBut I just think this ramp team especially at home I think they can I just think they can put up more points I mean if any better I think it's safe I think take the ...\nI Know that we're going to find out tomorrow who the second best team in the NFC is when the saints and Vikings played but who is the second best even the NFC\nBest team in the ... I'm I'm a saint Scott I just I think the Drew Brees and what the heck's going on in an office right now is absolutely magical and this is Michael Thomas the best wide receiver we don't talk about ... I mean really I mean he smashing every ...\nThe southern part than a cloud of dust right I mean I Love Michael Thomas can get down the road he can catch every route them through pre just so funny it's such a high level I think mark Baker was going to get in the toilet they\nAs time goes by and the he's not quite honestly just be good enough and you only apple acquisition helps them they were interested in Patrick Peterson from what I'm told\nJust didn't have the first round pick to really make a legitimate offer and then Arizona would have to pull the trigger on that deal anyways so they go a little bit of a cheaper route with the ... or they're hoping that bond ... and Marcus lot more to a form of a book out to former teammates apple\nAnd showing the ropes and help him get into this locker room and he couldn't put that in New York locker room but beyond that part's pretty low it should be able to get that done\nBy the way I quick side note I'm Michael Thomas I Am covering a high school football game\nThis was back in twenty eleven at my old high school Taft high school right sure so I'm at the top tier school football game and I'm standing there on the old field and I see key

I mean I see it laid out he and his ... even if Notre Dame loses a game they're in\nThey're not going to miss an opportunity to put him in that playoff and they'll way no chance no out and their schedule and what they have done would also show that I I think the model wins the type of winds at the head would be enough that you could say okay that's that's legit but if you looked at Alabama that's what makes next\nLSU team run the table and when the SEC where Alabama would lose that one game and we have talked about them is the greatest team and all of college football\nCould be left out though the odds of everything happening perfectly we've seen that in college football hasn't happened the last four years but there is a way and it was shocking to me because I went into it thinking even of Alabama loses we all love 'em they got in last year but it's not the case right now with how things are being played out in college football\nDied so or Dan is put together the list they give us a little sneak peak of next week when the a playoff rankings are are put out and again we've seen this every single year since the new playoff\nFormat was started and it really started with Clemson you remember remember this ESPN carries SEC ACC games\nShowing the rankings come out the rankings are meaningless other than a promotional tool to promote the ACC and the SEC so I remember that first year they Clemson one and I'm like Clemson that one [laughter] talking to my wife's collapsed one oh that's right coming out this week number one and clams and I'm like\nWhat is happening here it was a foreshadowed but remember this Fox carries Big Ten pac twelve the made for ESPN playoff they carry the ACC SEC so even in my book give Alabama Clemson Notre Dame all those teams lose a game there in\nOne loss Alabama won last Clemson one less Notre Dame all three of those schools are guaranteed a playoff\nSpot if you would take out a conference champion and let's just say Michigan with a one loss I highly doubt her name and the ... if it had come down to a one last Michigan versus a one\nLast Oklahoma for the last spot there is no way they're going to lock and one last Notre Dame at a playoff I Will check I I don't\nThink that that ... says they beat Michigan ... the toughest thing of about\nComparable to Notre Dame Alabama's going to win that even though they're when they're best when would be against that LSU ... Alabama for his greatest they have been has\nA deep anyone you know in a while though as it is when you say they haven't been any one compared to them who is anyone I mean as LSU really that good I mean you have to admit Ellis you came out of nowhere this year I don't think anyone had any faith that ... was going to get LSU back to prominence\nNo but their their resume and what they have done on the field I think is enough to say that LSU is pretty good but this would be the second straight year all of a sudden we're talking about Alabama strength of schedule\nRemember last year their strength of schedule was hit because the Andre France won Florida State fell off the map from that opener this year they're non conference neutral field opener was against the really bad Louisville team that I think right now is getting crushed by Wake Forest island oh let me ask you this one is that they will only got one good game on their schedule and that is LSU next week\nAll right let's say this let's say that the winner of today's Florida Georgia game runs the\nTo the SEC championship game so they're going with a one loss\nSEC ... overall record and other Georgia or Florida or wins the game today and they they have one last only all the way to the Jesse championship game and they play undefeated Alabama and they upset him\nOkay either ... or Georgia with one last upsets undefeated Alabama in the SEC championship game\nIs it possible that they would actually end let's say you have a one last Notre Dame won last Michigan or Ohio State one last Oklahoma\nAnd now one loss Alabama is it possible that Georgia or Florida can be locked out of the play off even if they beat Alabama in the you know Jay Leno and I think\nBecause they don't have a championship caliber team apparently chip Kelly is doing the same thing at UCLA so they just swept out everybody let's play all the freshmen take our lunch for a year I haven't I have a guaranteed contracts don't worry about it\nBut it still should be shed that the second most important person on a staff under their head coach of a college football team is not the office of coordinator and not the defensive coordinator\nIt's to strengthen conditioning yeah he's the one that is with the players the most out of anybody on that program and if that part of your program is lacking then your program will be let me give you an example of how to get a team and rebuild it bear Bryant\nYou know the famous junction loyally out the junction blowout so he leaves Kentucky to go to Texas ... and I was okay\nHe comes in there and that first year with that famous junction boy's training camp where you know three quarters of the just quit on him that was fine\nThat year they want one in nine two years later they were undefeated he clean house of the guys that don't have the talent and within two years they were undefeated see how that works\nAnd there have been you know to see what really angered those at Florida State has won your your Oregon\nHad some questions about strengthening conditioning and some issues are up in Eugene but this is a Florida State program that is over matched me up the losing thirty five nothing to Clemson right now and they just can't match up with the best team in the ACC which is crazy to think of it for the state\nThere's another new coach that has had a tough time taking over a new program\nThe pack twelve south is going to be there\nFor for for you have or any other program so it's not like us she is\nSo far ahead of everyone in fact they're just all in the same group by the way it's starting their third string quarterback today against Arizona State ... well I mean that that that smells Las ... when they get back way I'm this conversation about scenario played out a scenario where you damn\nWhere Clemson goes undefeated they've finished they win the ACC Championship they go undefeated Notre\nDame\nRuns that table they go undefeated Alabama's\nMeanwhile Oklahoma we could throw a Texas and never lets say Oklahoma they run the table when the big twelve championship with one loss in either Ohio State Michigan runs the table is the Big Ten championship game with one was that the schools there's only four spots in the playoffs who's\nIn who's out okay ... Notre Dame and the SEC winner of uh Georgia or Florida would be in the playoffs so right centrally trying to figure out if it's Alabama Oklahoma in Michigan or Ohio State squad getting there\nI Will do this I Will rank the for schools because Michigan and Ohio State aren't in the same boat and there's a specific reason that the most likely to get in if they were to win Michigan would beat\nOr Alabama\nFor the simple fact of Michigan's victories that they would ever rode win against the Ohio State they're only loss\nBeginning of the year at Notre Dame team that's already in the playoff\nThey would have the strongest resume I think Oklahoma on a one last scenario would get in over Ohio State considering their loss came to a Texas team where they would likely avenged that loss in a championship game against Texas\nIf that scenario played out so Oklahoma and remember Texas already has one last last uh Maryland to open the season Oklahoma would actually be the second spot Ohio State would be the third and that is if they win the Big Ten so in your scenario if it was down to a big twelve champion in Oklahoma\nBig Ten champion in Ohio State and an FCC runner up in Alabama I think Oklahoma would get that spot the big twelve is a decent conferences or\nThen I understand what you're saying and again you're saying what you should say but could you honestly see Alabama obviously if they're undefeated their number one in the poll going into the SEC championship and they lose a three point game\nThat they would go from one to five\nI was I was one does I I was with you\nSeptember doesn't matter right losing in September doesn't matter it would play out here losing in November big deal losing in December and even bigger deal like you don't want to lose that last game remember\nAlabama didn't lose last year the age they just they lost the Auburn and didn't get to play on the game and still got him right losing in that game but we saw the same thing with Ohio State when but oh yeah ... they didn't make it to the to the Big Ten title game\nThe losing in the title game eliminates you automatically it's better to to not go to the title game than to go and lose to strengthen your\nBut that would be something I mean if they dropped Alabama from one to five losing a three point game in the SEC champions I I I Can't\nSee I think if if it was an ESPN ESPN is just not I can't see them leaving Alabama out and and I think that they are or\nThe big twelve is going to be screwed and they and their their idea would be that Notre Dame essentially is the Big Ten representative\nThat's our mid west school so we'd have Clemson we would have Alabama we'd have Georgia and Florida and we would have Notre Dame there's your fight of\nEither I as a Midwest guy I don't look as Notre Dame was the mid west school I just look at them like I had only they're really an ACC school yeah yeah they are women they probably have a ... eyes so let's let's ... unveil now\nSo now we again we're going to have the news that comes out Tuesday we are going to have the initial rankings in college football playoff pole\nSo we we always see really the top six\nYou know we always sort of like the the top four and five and six so can you project already who\nThose schools will be yeah I can say this the first I like the ... that you would change their would say of course number one Alabama Crimson Tide on beating going into their big match up in Baton Rouge right no surprise there who's at number two and this is where you do\nThe one over Michigan because of the weight over Michigan they also have a win against Stanford who that's who I think Washington state tonight right and a road when at Virginia Tech which is better\nThan what Clinton has on their right I'm not ... it's going to be Washington state but go ahead you know oh you like the uh I think it would who are pretty underwriter right now they get that that quarterbacks throwing like crazy last couple of weeks or Washington state actually as a veteran defense and Stanford\nThey would you would think of Washington state as a team that you know it's just going to score a lot of points are deeply ... the last one was the the ... teams has been the lack of a running game rice lesbian in and out of the line up they haven't had any consistent run again I go ahead\nEven if you don't let her name is number two Notre Dame would be number two and he had if you want to take out the Stanford when the when against Michigan is still better than what comes to do that\nWhich would be aware that Texas I don't care if it was closed it was a win at Texas a and M.\nAnd a win last week against NC State this Florida State game means nothing for the state's awful so Clemson still would need a bigger winter jumped Notre Dame and they don't have it so Clemson would be number three number four\nIt's an easy spot to put in but you have to put LSU in that for spot they probably have the best winds of anybody in college football this season he's got the LSU when a couple of weeks ago they also be Auburn\nLSU would be the for spot they would be the one last team the first one last team that we hide suing in Alabama one Notre Dame to Clemson three LSU for yes nine hundred and five six Michigan Michigan is the team that has about ... pounds into the top for\nThat Alabama LSU game at\nMichigan has been really good routing Wisconsin a couple of weeks ago badgers losing right now the northwestern part going into that game Wisconsin was thought to be a threat and again Michigan team that's gotten better and better and better throughout the season I think Michigan is going to be at number five and then at number six number six is interesting is it the winter\nI'll tell you that there's something that really tells me I should say Florida Today I but I'm going to put in Georgia in that six spot I'm really [noise]\nThey've got to figure out their quarterback situation yeah they've got to make fields throw the ball just stick with from and give them confidence field as the ... the better player but you can't just have him go in and and run the balls this close Texas is seven and they've got a game tonight against Oklahoma State and gives me\nA longer should play what his shoulder injury is kind of then yeah so if Texas doesn't win tonight\nMaybe it's an injury to the starting quarterback shoulder [noise]\nMaybe it's other things but Texas would be seven in my rankings Oklahoma eight Ohio State nine and then I Would have Kentucky\nAt number ten I like how are you a young sailor Florida where there are a longest winning streak in the nation rank tens of both the a P and coaches fall out of your top ten longest winning streak in the nation dead and you can't take two seasons Steve and just tell me\nHow many what when I'm central ... own Adam stands out that is better than they can talk you win against Florida which is what the Yankees have ... or excuse me the Wildcats and they're only last words do Texas the Texas ...\nSo I like Kentucky right now in that tank chancy Milton Heisman Trophy Lulu zone [laughter] the or they don't have the resume I'm Sorry a hero it's not going to happen back to back perfect seasons and they still have no shot at the place that would be unbelievable I were in the guy go Fox Sports radio studios\nIf it was zero zero instead of one nothing through Seattle would you have kept Mueller and the gas you think gay robbers way to get them in the game on a hundred and eight pits is I don't think so [laughter] I don't think so either that's a problem\nThink that if you're looking at what were the Dodgers were less than the air was replacing ... replacing viewer with Jansen and not Ryan ... that was the problem is is if you want to take the viewer can stay in that\nWe're seeing just pictures all over the place by the way that the cardinals years ago ... do we we knew the royals were short on ... and and so we we kind of seen hints of this\nEven in the fall classic for for a while it gosh I'm I'm just trying to think back of cardinal years but maybe that ever pitcher ousted and the fourth and ended up leaving their bullpen to do the rest the point that I see though Steve is what I thought we've gotten in the last Fifteen Years in major league baseball\nMaybe Twenty years is the role of the set up man and that's the eighth inning guy we've developed the stats for it called the hold like there was a now you have it you have an eighth inning guy and that's what last night I have a name that are but I Can't say it on the air they're they're middle relief guys that were making all star team in ... the first\nSet of guy who was Ron Davis with the Yankees he was a ... he was the eighth inning guy through some heat\nTo set up like gosh it's you know in the in the ninth inning um I I just my and Ken but my point is I here's what I don't understand if there are fewer quality arms to go around then why are you asking less not more of them\nI just I don't understand it again if your if your idea of a perfect game is to have your started I Would use to be six ounce five\nNow I mean what I mean we had Mueller taken out in the fifth inning of a game mhm so now it's like now you need a six any pitcher a seven and eight a night you're investing money in a closer which is over rated to begin with\nAnd the odds of him even getting to that point is all dependent on that six seventh and eighth any old getting the job done the more pictures you throw out there the less likely it is that all of them are actually going to have their a game that none of yes\nTrue but what they are looking at and what your you know we're all looking at her what is happening in each individual situation\nFive times in a row all every time you play that game your odds are exactly the same and that's what we've got with major league baseball's you'd think like oh we're just going to\nContinue with our picture because he's on a roll right now but now is the way it's viewed as every single at bat you want to look at the best opportunity to succeed and that's how we've gotten to this is that's why you have watching I mean again I Would say okay\nWe're in the guy go Fox joining us I yeah I Will be I'll tell you why because you mentioned uh the Dodgers right here there's a player on the Dodgers they'd actually remembers how it used to be and he said something in the midst of this postseason that just sort of blew me away on what players have to accept\nIf they want to be a part

Bronner markets are five and oh yeah [laughter]\nThey notice MBA\nYeah we're watching all this MBA and oh yeah we got the world series going on what made it so difficult this week for me is that I Know I'm late to the party on this folks but on Tuesday my daughter a installed the fire stick on my TV so for the first time in my life\nI have Netflix so a man who's come and go it's the first week your Netflix one night I'm watching it on one\nForty three one forty two Lakers you know if that's what I'm\nTrying to watch what bra and I'm trying to watch you know football and trying to watch the world series and I'm trying to get started with Netflix\nSeason you know I go one I didn't realize they yell like three seconds like the episode and it's like ... and then they go now I can tell you why they get hook you like you're just four thirty in the morning right and then all of a sudden you're all hooked that they'll called binge watching what you're talking right and I bought a new vocabulary I also that I don't know\nA Netflix and chill I also found that one out in my twenty two year old son I'm\nAll right so I'm All right I mean I'm going to try to zip through Ozark which is it now its second season so I got to get season one season to where should I go next now I've never seen Breaking Bad\nTry go back in and go through the whole runner Breaking Bad I Am I was like you in that I did not watch Breaking Bad while it was right aired we watched it in a binge fashion and it was worth every\nMinute alright so binge of Breaking Bad I saw Mad Men so I I I did watch that series when it was out what else am I going to get into a stranger things is that ranger things everyone keeps talking about is that um us as well Oh yes ... especially the ... of that or is there being two seasons have\nReleased around Halloween I don't know where the third one yeah and there's a new um an additional episodes of ah making of murder so he doesn't want every one of ... one of the attorneys I Do have to say what are the attorneys on the case or my sister worked for in Milwaukee\nBut the problem is there's only so many hours in advance we're still having days away\nAny therein lies the stroke but then and that's why you have to determine Breaking Bad was what guys six seasons yes as you said you've got your on Ozark and that is too\nI I the yard and I get maybe two to three episodes at night that hot sit circus at least a month to do break right right and so that's\nMaybe why it's better to if you were to start out with the ... that only have one or two seats\nThat's why it is yeah there are those are because I knew I it's you know so I'm a I'm a I'm going to get through that and then ah so I mean it's just it's mind boggling but on top of that oh it's been going on right now we have\nYou know it's the the good news for the NFL is your ratings are up and a lot of people could say there's a couple of reasons for that there are a couple of reasons one scoring is up\nAnd that's good for two reasons one it means that your fantasy football teams are scored more points than ever so that's exciting and also the fact that we have expanded legalized gambling in this country is making\nMore and more people watch the national football league they put out a a a little report on the amount of revenue that\nEach of the four major team sports in this country will generate in a single year based on\nLegalized gambling the NFL checked Senate additional two points three billion annual\nTo point three billion annual so when you have that serious money on the line yeah a lot more people are actually watching the national football league connection\nOf football and because of the fewer opportunities for games also allows you to think that you know a lot more than they can like you never know what's gonna happen you know if you're on the second out of a back to back on an MBA night you know the other team's going to show up right may maybe it'd be wary of it\nBaseball the tough enough of the lines anyway because it it's just difficult plus if there's a number for starter you don't know what they're gonna start bull pending\nFootball though like a lot of us we feel that we know football that were connected to it and so you have the feeling of wanting to dive in and would have a better opportunity of\nCashing in on your own knowledge and that's what I think football ... whether it be the NFL or even of college but really more so of the national football league\nLooking at the odds I I go to a site that just sort of a consensus Vegas odds and it's always interesting to me on watching NFL line they move dramatically and when I say dramatically more than ...\nCincinnati is hosting Tampa Bay bucks have no defense\nI was on the bangles bandwagon in fact I thought bangles plus six\nAt Kansas City was not a bad play\n[laughter] forty five dead by the way the L Michael slip it in the number is ... [laughter] so Sunday night game it's forty five attends the score and al Michaels who is obviously a guy that knows plenty about gambling 'cause he's constantly throwing outlines and everything else did this\nVery discreetly by the way he said it's forty five to ten he goes\nI Would imagine this on it I Would imagine the number fifty six and a half is on the minds of a lot of people [laughter] that was the over under on that game I you couldn't you know mad as the chief score forty five but I mean look on this line here so Cincinnati is hosting Tampa Bay the wide open with Cincinnati minus six\nNow the consensus is mine is three and a half that's a whole lot of money going down on him by as a dog at since ...\nI've said Steve for weeks that of just pure titans and wide receivers Tampa Bay has the best collection of pass catchers in the national foot\nL look to the Arctic Winston putting up every week now and\nIt's not and it's if you look back to last year there were a couple of stinkers but otherwise you was hovering around that three hundred yard barrier that give or take twenty yards on on both ends and Steve\nIt's a team that doesn't have a consistent running game so you put a bad defense with the team they can't run the ball you know that he's got targets whether it's big plays with the Sean Jackson or big targets in Mike Evans and OJ Howard\nTempers really good through the air and I think that's why you're seeing what you're seeing with that game it's just because you know Tampa is going to be able to put up points it doesn't matter they can't stop anybody they're often says at least going to be able to ...\nIt'll be more of a diet I got three more games the over under on that game by the way the over under right now consensus is fifty four and a half\nOkay that's a big knock out a little ... All right here's another line that his move dramatically there's actually a number of this week and this is the I I but I watched this a lot and I've never seen a week where there's been more big moves or tour and more point line moves from the initial move to where they are now another game\nHindi at the raiders ... dance is open as a pick 'em\nNow India is eight three point favorite at Oakland the thinking obviously is the raiders of just throwing in the town you know I'm Ari Cooper you're thinking that they have lost it was all like Mark Cooper was putting a ban big number no and marsh on which placed on aged reserve eyes so there is another gay here's another one you ready for this ... this one this is the\nThe Vikings open as a one point favorite at home against New Orleans now there are one and a half point dog and all the money pouring in on the saints in Minnesota\n\n\nGo to the I don't see that I talk\nLooks to me the most the networks [noise] argue with shows where we\nLeases civil age [noise] and when we had like ... as we cover when you see on the hog Fox Sports radio\nOn your own data will join us going out to a lot of the kind of what you say your Lakers\nAs they provide unique perspective and expert on al ... a Lebanese dirt on Fox Fox Sports\n\nAre with you on this Saturday hopeless great Saturday for you it is for us\nThat's a five percent savings in store an on line subject to credit approval cannot be combined with other credit offers exclusion supplies the store for details us only All right we've been flying through the Saturday but I can I can sense the anticipation\nFrom Dan by it's been a while so yes it's that time [laughter]\nThe highest ...\nIceman up to now I don't know a whole lot of listeners know this but I have a Heisman vote ... to go now I don't share that with a lot of [noise]\nI I Will say that scared a lot of people that I'm a ... vote yeah if it came down to one vote he's the one that probably should have it they give the ice but voters was just I just been voter\nIt probably should be department there are a lot of people that shouldn't have Heisman votes you should have I well I\nI look at it this way is a passion of mine I Know everything about the history of the Heisman that guy was back in New York last summer with my boys went to the Heisman headquarters\nAnd started rattling up stuff and they looked at me like\nAll right this then can we get this man out of the building right now nobody should take the Heisman as seriously as you do and that was from the high some people I Need to get a vote I you know I don't know how I got my vote because I got my vote back in twenty ten I actually made a call to the Heisman headquarters Heisman trust\nAnd I was actually telling them I've done a lot of\nStatistical research that I thought they might one for the archive I wasn't looking for money or there's like I've done all this work you might be interested they didn't seem all that interested but\nThey did ask me do you have a Heisman vote I said no I said how does that happen well\nOf the states there's eight hundred and Seventy media members and never changes eight hundred and Seventy needy members six different districts hundred and forty five votes each and there's a certain distribution by state each state as a representative\nTwo ways either you leave the state that you're voting in or you die\nThose are the only way I was probably you know I get on the list now I didn't know the guy that was sort of running the LA the California show and I said well I mean I can be on this list forever\nHe goes I Know but all of a sudden he gives me a call a couple of months later I got good news ... shoot you the top of the list\nI'm like who died he goes he didn't die but pat hate and just became the athletic director USC and head or fit his\nBones when you're at the university so I took over pat Hayden's voting twenty and [noise] and I'm proud of heavy and that's a victory for UCLA in itself and by the way I didn't want to do a couple of years after that and thanks for taking that John\nHi so that's how I have a Heisman votes so each week I give you my three two one I don't go beyond that 'cause my final valid only has three spots on it where do I stand this is true last week's games here as my current number three Haskins is going to burrow back of the fifty looking fires middle field\nGoing be from a corner the\nKoran and fight for the football any hangs onto\nA forty one yard pass quite asking them a forum\nI it's very difficult for a guy to hang onto a top three spot with your team just got wall of forty nine of twenty by the way that courtesy of the aisle Ohio State I. M. G. network but when you look at Haskins numbers four hundred and Seventy yards passing two touchdowns only one big\nHe leads the nation in passing yards he leads the nation in touchdown pass\nSo your guy Dwayne Haskins is still hanging on my ballot they've got weapons there is a gathering they've just lost Austin Mac likely for the rest of the regular season but they've got four other guy\nThe fact that they can't run the ball right now in their defense just acceptable but giving up yard to the place which allows Dwayne Haskins to get\nYou to pass a quarterback he's more talented than brags Millard ... or ...

I was I Know it but you know what the deal is with soccer soccer's appointment viewing you know when you send them to watch the soccer game when you think about the world cup if it starts at eleven is ending at one\nYeah but that's that's the world cup like we get that once every four years I'm ... it's not always appointment viewing or\nEven even when you watch Premier League and you're watching your favorite teams\nIt's still pretty much you know how much time you can devote to it you know exactly what you're going to get you know when you may get to the point if you don't have the time or if we're going to go into these games where we have ... and stuff like that yeah like it's pretty cut and dried you know when the game is going to start you know when it's going to end and baseball there's\nA level of uncertainty when it comes to how long it's going to last even if football they figured it out over\nTime it's ten minutes well he'll get it done in ten minutes is a done deal should you know their vote but I hear your yeah yeah I hear you I I Know I think they could've damn\nWell I Know they did cut it down and they should because it's awful because that ten minutes thing is what's leading to the ties you get one team driving all the way down and then they you know three minutes left to go and they don't get a touchdown the other team gets the ball they're already in the two minute drought like\nJust another five minutes it got to kill anybody uh they they that that one that's the rule I'd love to see change but I tell you what I think there are a lot of answers to the question we're asking would love to involve you in this day and age seven seven Ninety nine on Fox\nDo you use your services or buy your product\nWell that's the real question isn't it we have the answer we can show you how we can walk you step by step through a process that has been effective in doubling tripling and even in some cases quadrupling our clients business wants us to do that for your business\nCall I talk one oh six seven eight nine to wait five three two ten ten that's five three two ten to five three two ten ten\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal mobile with the talk of six point seven mobile apps visit I talk one of those six point seven dot com for detail is\n\n\n\n\nMore free\nBut I certainly looking towards poodle like well raiders I taught I Want to extend we'd go forty niners\nNeither Thursday at seven thirty there not by now they say [noise]\nFifteen Percent or more on car insurance bill ... dinner nine minutes\nFunky everybody wants to weigh in on this road rules do it\nI was going to Yankee Joe\nI'm busy San Diego right now but ... were you at the game\nBut actually I'm heading back from LA going back to San Diego passed to Disneyland right now and I'll tell\nYou how are you know it's one thing yeah it is the cost don't get me wrong and with the costs being so high it removes the father son content actually I was with my daughter last night and I got to admit I'm a huge Yankees fan and be honest with you the energy I said I'm almost converted me and I'm you know I'm Still\nDebating on still debating a bill to pay\n... usually I mean if you're going to hear you saying then this week you can be aghast Dodger fan I mean the people people forget that I think\nIt's something I I Can't duplicate that with my daughter I'm not going to go to Yankees stadium my daughter and one of the things I was ... I was a split have that father you know ... you know father not some but you know with\nAll its moment explain how the game and things are happening and you know you can't really duplicate it that much with the chicken costs and it it just wasn't all those intimate experience was that you have what your father 'cause it's not a game like basketball shoe that book you know going back and forth back and forth is not as\nFast as hockey and even on a low scoring game and football's pretty selfish I'm not saying there's not ... I'm not saying that\nBut it's pretty self explanatory gets the other side and try to knock the other\nI'm not sure how old is your daughter and did you guys make it to the end\nSir I left and I proudly lab Chavez Ravine to fifty God this is all of this and are I mean it really was\nGoing to old state Mueller we got to go walk over there yeah but you know my daughter's twelve and I'm forty five and we just you know we're just actually just turned Thirteen so how 'bout that and um it was just didn't really experience such a huge chance and um\nScalia because I remember what the climate for whatever reason we get a lot of Dodgers games all the climate and I remember you know Blair the TV was was one area that this was one treadmill and ... only secret spot is a threat but no you know live skill these boys do on a treadmill on deployment at a it was it's really one of those experiences that\nMy father gave to me and I gave her last night that ultimately or I'm really grateful for the last I remember I did when I when I feel like I said I don't want this thing\nThat ever and yeah I really felt like I ... I went to him as the the national anthem I was like God I mean ... like please don't let this wedding metals yo yo what\nWas your fault Joel put up a rare everybody thinks Joe ... Joe put up a prayer ... hoping there you go for it works\nSo unbelievable I mean you're talking about a long game the ups and downs especially if you don't the Dodger side of your Dodger fan like using and has done is homeless and young people we just went over to middle human error extends um and then you get to walk off I mean it's everything that you can hold for one\nNo doubt I mean yeah you're right from a Dodger fan standpoint like every pitch because you're at every moment you're like if they lose the series is over\nYou know the red Sox fans or you know looking at it like halfway along as this one okay we're up to one so for a Dodger fan that was just seven eight straight hours of stress a let's go to David ... here in Southern California wants to talk about the same ... Hey David\nHow you doing something me this World Series sample what's the matter with baseball bats make it that the average fan feel stupid they don't know what they're watching what other sports that you have to go to the NBA Finals not like Iran and clay aren't going to wait at night because the computer says the match\nOn Good Friday\nYou're telling me that your three home run hitter I'm like I don't even understand the sport I think you're not weigh the costs of the [laughter] I'm telling you what if that's all it's a start drifting port world stars on the field chat about the\nDamage that I think it's incredibly well said Bucky track this listen Rob man for at at the all star break talked about publicly about why might trout isn't more popular\nAnd he talked about uh the different things that go into making a star more popular in in a public setting yet baseball as David just detailed\nSeems to go to the ends of the earth to keep their stars down you talked about the unwritten rules so therefore they cannot show emotion are now are they cannot even always play ah the starting pitcher the stars starting pitcher where's he going to go\n... your your yanked in the fourth inning the first time you throw a curve in the dirt because somebody thinks oh you're tired and the next guy in the on deck circle is a you know got about five hundred batting average against you so all of these things put together tell me that baseball does not understand\nThe equation of how to make us are no\nThey certainly don't like it should be a game where you're trying to elevate the stores are and everything is about playing the hits we talk about a new t._v. all the time we talk about um radio you want to make sure that you're talking about celebrating you're promoting the people that are the best in your sport and so\nIf baseball doesn't have the wherewithal to uh know that look man we need to elevate stores you to put them on the big stage we let our homerun hitters have the opportunity to hit home runs so they can draw more fans then that's stupid on the airport\nUm let's go to Nick in Nevada Nick we're a little up against the bill passed in ... minutes a real quick what are you want to say [laughter]\nWhether life target\nAnd I agree that you know there was an all parts of why are the ratings are down overhead ahead of time watching baseball but I also think that\nThe national sports media also had the little part of in that because\nUm I Know football it's got to a great game and everybody loved it but the national sports radio boarded up and that's all they cover that's all they talk about and I have heard a few\nNational sportscasters one mainly on Fox that worked in the afternoon type uh you know the ... or that there's a group of buffalo or he he mainly in a\nGay bachelor baseball during the season and then when the our our fiesta right around that he starts\nTalking about in covering as well do believe that I don't need to have something to do with\nThat Nick I'll just say this and Bucky I don't know what your perspective is Nick thank you um this is a classic chicken or the egg conversation that I think we have non on radio a lot on the media does not have an interest in blowing something up or before they know if you want to watch it it works the other way around\nThe media is going to follow football because the data that we get shows that that's what you want\nThe media no longer talks in the mainstream about hockey why\nIt's not because they don't like it I have a lot of friends in media who are diehard hockey fans will say a word about it on the why is it can't they'll get called the boss's office because the data says that won't work\nIt won't work so why is the national media going so heavy NFL an NBA and starting to welcome in things like soccer in USD because they're following your data take that for that now that that's it that's our analytic\nTheir lives you know just a dress rehearsal back down [noise] oh my gosh the game is no three and a half hours away everybody know why am I here why don't why why why am\nI I don't know I'm a very sick\nSays man right out like they may then I've got ...\nAnd you and your kind of ... when a crate today's game is half as long as yesterday's oh half is just half as long I'll take half his law amity that are being\nApparently so everybody else the game starts and three and a half hours in last night's game just stopped for hours ago I I mean\nThat that's what you do when you put in more like when you're a true fan that's what John you show up early you stay like what you're saying that's\nNot what it is because the fans are not even allowed in yeah biking you know what is the people who live in LA or deathly afraid of awful traffic no I mean so you get it yeah so people are just like a hell of all I Can't sleep I've been home for two hours what the hell am I just go back\nYes I I Can't believe he's trying to get rid of number six he said you know okay you know a Dodger yeah the Dodgers trade yes yep week I Am going to blow up your plastic you use Twitter okay these six is one of the only reason while I watch it because as you said if it's entertainment\nI Want to be entertained I Want to hear more easily go at it yeah I Want to hear more from your why you think they should keep them coming up next we'll also continue with

way\nI mean I like yes you have nothing to do for you because one of the reasons why a lot of people tune into the Dodgers now um and if you look at this postseason he has been the guy in big moments that delivered everyone else that we can talk about\nThe bats had been really really selling but in big games where they really needed people to come through your your week\nThe guys who play differently in the postseason then they play in the regular season and if you're talking about a winning team and building a champion you have to have enough of those guys that can deliver when this stage is the biggest in the life of\nBright okay there but now we plays right field ... what if the Dodger front office or came to their fans and said yeah we we are trading week and a and were signing Bryce Harper\n... I mean I'm okay with Bryce Harper but I don't you're okay with the law I mean I'm okay with him I just find a lot more I spent a\nLot more expensive but what is the one what is he doing what at the moment says he'd been in to help the nationals when something this major ... is one thing is one thing to be a guy that plays and can kind of dance when it's the regular season but can you dance when it's real\nHe's got some good postseason series it doesn't get postseason moments that some long home runs a you know against the giants a couple of years ago I remember that series he did All right that's what led to that whole thing between him and a hunter Strickland was staring at his home run for too long and I'm okay with it but my favorite honey\nIt's funny because I wanted to know like because bill flash was talking about the distractions what distractions are we talking\nAbout well yeah that that word that bill used I ah my ears perk up Everytime I hear it you use the word\nThe

nice move 'em but they're not playing dies none USC is getting their huh cats right now\nAgainst Arizona State at home in the first habits twenty four to seven\nAnd the devils out of the ball down I've promised through the years I never use the microphone in front of my face to call for somebody to get fired not my job now my car or not I don't I have no interest in it does it doesn't\nMatter what I think about whether or not someone should be fired that's for an athletic department or a you know a general manager to make that kind of decision there are certain situations that come along and sports where nothing needs to be set\nA man I I I mean I think that this was one of them\nAre you know uh it's the clay held in his super well liked by everybody over at USC but uh I'm just passing along there there's not a thing that I hear right now and then add this game and what's happening or there there's not one thing I hear that would suggest that he'll be back next year\nOkay so here's my thing would have seen who does is the higher [noise] like it's one thing\nDepression expectation that comes along with being and as the coach um I I don't know who's out there because there are many big names that are out there\nAbout law given or they can't do that [laughter]\nI'm okay with it but they can't do that you know you're not okay I Am okay where they came with it you know they're not doing that\nI think I ... what do you think about this I think that at USC [noise]\nThis is a a a lesson I got from a good friend one time\nIn my professional circle where a job that I had came to an end and the first thing you do whenever I whenever something like that happens in your life as you look for where else you can replicate the same thing you're like oh I was qualified to do this now let's go do the same thing over here\nAnd not friends said to me be careful about trying to repeat history\nBecause it rarely works you cannot when something is kicking and click and you can't just snap your fingers and make it happen again and I would get that same advice to us see that from the moment Pete Carroll got there and had lightning in a bottle\nEvery single time they have hired a new coach they've tried to like scrape up he's off of the tree of what was there before with the Carol\nAnd you know ... and then there's there every single one is attached to the previous one it doesn't work\nIt doesn't work it's time to just do something completely new\nYeah I mean I absolutely agree like they have to find somebody that's different somebody that's not necessarily from the tree I'm\nI just don't know like the thing is clear and was inexperienced coach um can they take a hike coordinator making the head coach can they find a guy who was doing it at a smaller program and make them the or the name that is going to come up\nHe's disgruntled he's not happy being at the Ohio State university writing oh maybe maybe this is their opportunity to swoop in and have him come and go the powerhouse it is seen\nAs a tough slog that's tough public ... public relations play\nOn I ... at a place that has had its share over the years that would be a difficult press release to write\nIt will be but you know what\nThey want to win right yep so if they want to when they got to keep your tires and all the guys who are no winners\nAnd all I hear you I hear you 'cause it 'cause 'cause the other\nThing is I don't know like I don't know who say you can't bring a Tom Herman from Texas because even though he grew up in LA ah seamy valley played a cab Lutheran yes Texas seemingly turned around and wrote and he's not gonna leave that job to come to\nThe S. C. right and they miss their chance on Chris Petersen yeah Mr channels\nThere that now that's and that's the while I'm Talking about it's like you had a chance to do something new and and you opted to stick\nWith your your your ... Carroll tree and you know you made a mistake you did you absolutely did make a mistake um\nSo uh anyway that's just something to keep an eye on I don't think it's going to be a mid season deal um but uh at this point I'd be shocked if a if play out in his back I'd smart weather Bucky Brooks Fox Sports radio Maury brown with for\nSports business reporter but also just a massive baseball fan and so he'll be perfect today he's coming up and about Fifteen minutes would be perfect to do to dive into some of this stuff\nOr if you're just joining us or the ratings are down they'd been down across the board games one two and three\nFor two of the highest profile baseball teams you could ever imagine with close games are big stars and even last night's drama the ratings are down and those first three games have gone up against a total of nothing in sports tonight they will go up against afternoon and evening\nReading out of epic proportions and it is my hope as a baseball fan that that is the moment that is the moment and that is the data that as the analytic\nThat baseball will put its arms around and say we need to make change and I and when you buy heating that I'm not sure exactly how you get this across the teams but the analytics generation needs to go away it does not mean that you can't use data that does not mean that you cannot use math there's always been math\nIn baseball just look at the back of a baseball card now ever you cannot let that math\nGoes so over the top that you decide we don't need to be entertaining anymore provided that we are\nCorrect in terms of our percentages\nThis for me the watershed moment is the Dodgers going to the game one of the world series and sitting there talk for a homerun hitters because there was a lefty on them out\nThat is an absolute you don't watch your fans and you cannot do it that is that you do not work all year to get to the world series so that you can dump your best players on the bench\nNo I mean no one wants to see I mean no one wants to see that no one wants to see your for home run hitter sitting on the sideline because ah analytics told you was in a good play but here's what I Want to kind of spin a little way from baseball but more to the analytics crowd in general or how did you feel about past Sherman going for two\nOn the Monday Night game when they were down fourteen\nYeah I think he is currently I Believe it's over thinking it it doesn't bother me that much like whatever your thought is on what makes the most sense percentage wise but here's why I laughed at that\nI laugh at that because every coach will go to the press conference just like sugar dead and and they'll say well we've run the numbers and uh it says that that's the right thing to do well no you didn't\nThat means if you buy them you believe all quarterbacks at the same\nYou believe all receivers at the same you believe all our fence lines at the same and they're not so you can't tell me the analytic when you're down fourteen points to score a touchdown says we should go for two and then we're going to expect the same result whether you're quarterbacks Aaron Rodgers or your quarterbacks manning\nThat's why that made me laugh because it's an analytic that's true but it's it's it's being received in a fake way\nI'm a little bit I I I think the here today and here's the thing like\nThe more because I got it for print out on like how the analytics go do the the the move when you're down fourteen reason you go for two is because uh the numbers say that to point conversions are basically a corn for their fifty fifty proposition\nCalled little bluebird studios today nine to wait three by one Seventy nine forty two on line a little over ... little bluebird studio the company that cares\n\n\n\nGo off\n\nWhen it goes down in your town promise you all talking about football for for you that uh we're the ones that you are listening to\nThis case Fox Sports radio sports when\nThe planes ... ... is it I thought it was going to have an old\nReaders neither Thursday at seven thirty Easter non box now take\nFor granted it was new home quote explore was built to save time and money by allowing you to compare multiple quote options all on line to head to progressive dot com today and see if you can say [noise]\nOkay we've actually brought\nMargaret Willard Fox Sports radio [noise] we got to get into a program abroad and a little bit later this hour about comedy do you oh my gosh and you might need to punch me on the face okay I can take it anymore you can't take it anymore and it was like a battle\nBe mighty battery nineties I Can't take it anymore I Will get to that coming up at about fifty minutes or so but right now\nWith getting more a Brown in here the absolute perfect voice for today here's why more brown with for sports business reporter also a national baseball writer so therefore understands and it's a huge baseball fan\nSo more you're all over baseball yet you're also all over sports business and right now\nThose two things don't seem to be getting along very well if you ask me like games one two and three all stood alone on the sports landscape with two flagship franchises close games big stars\nRatings are still down now we go into the weekend\nAnd I mean you mentioned it in their two storied franchises I mean if you're going to sit down and try and mapped this out you know I mean you you probably couldn't have put to better together I mean the Yankees maybe but I mean\nThey hadn't met since Nineteen twenty four I'm so you had this long tenure they're both in two huge markets um I don't know what baseball does I mean look I think I think the thing that everybody and look this is not just me the commissioner\nAnd the folks that Fox or trying to grapple with is why\nAnd you know you could sit there and look at maybe this idea ... penning um has lost a lot of average viewers the fact that um the bloom is maybe a little bit off the but in terms of\nYou know the it's just not as compelling anymore to have Boston when as many World Series is they have it's quite different than two thousand four so I'm putting me quite a bit of play\nHere and let me are jumping on their morning so you can clear thrown a little bit but ah yeah quite a bit of play for sure I think some of the things you're talking about all come from the same way don't they would you analytics I mean that's what I was saying earlier\nI'm In I'm analytics maybe rights they may be mathematically correct they're not bond fan it's not fun to tune into the Dodgers on game one of the world series and their top for homerun hitters are on the bench that just seems silly\n[noise] yeah I mean you know certainly if you looked at this I mean last night's game was a record set her for\nA number of things I mean we went through Eighteen pictures and that tells you a lot when you look at how many hits that were which is ... either tells you that where there's a lot of swing and Mrs or there's a case where everybody's so closely\nAligned in terms of being able to hit that you get that but yeah I think I get it you know you're like hey let's go ahead and make sure that we're right he left the match ups and let's keep those guys sitting on the bench we saw that there was a little bit of a change in the lineup for game three that didn't seem to move the needle dramatically one way or another and I just think that people are trying\nAwfully good baseball team I mean look they they handled I'm not only the Yankees but the Astros both teams hundred wind teams handily and I think that there's something to say about that I think that people were like wow this is just you know there is no Cinderella there's nothing really to look forward to here\nAnd I just think that it it looks like two became is trying to slug it out\nAnd then once again I just don't know if there's that much in terms of a compelling story line I kept waiting for mainly Machado to break out I kept waiting for him to not swing it at pictures up and out of his own he just cannot seem to lay off a high hot stuff so you know it's starts to become highly predictable\n... so much of the conversation ... ... or analytics ruining the game was in the deepest and she was we're making it very difficult for hitters a divine holes in the ... what do you think about the process or\nWhat do you think of the impact in the middle of the game and you can we blame analytics for some of the lack of viewership when it comes to people wanting to watch the game\nNo I I'm not going to put this an analytic seed look guys I I'm I'm a huge proponent of it now there is a shift I think you know probably something that makes it difficult we thought for the longest time I came from the school that it was like hit at we're there ain't right I mean if if you're shifting everybody over to one side of the field and by golly hit the other way\nAnd we're not seeing that what we're seeing our batters deciding you know what if I hit it out of the ballpark it doesn't matter where you put people on the field I'm just going to drive it out where you can't get to it\nAnd so I think we see a lot of that I mean strike outs were up we had more strike outs and hits this year it was just you know it's kind of an odd state right now so I don't know I mean ... are largely though I think in the world series we've seen a little bit more\nStation to station plan spots which I think it's interesting you know but I mean still overall I think we're just looking for some kind of compelling story and I think guys since ...\nLook last year was up and I think maybe that has a little bit to do with once again kind of having two big markets in there that don't have\nYou know big stories for whatever reason that's the only reason I mean last year was up and I don't think the players change that dramatically other than how the ... are being used and look if you use a bunch of pictures and have a lot of commercial breaks games are going to get along and people are going to switch the channel\nMore brown with for sports business reporter is with us mark and Bucky sports radio\nMorning how much of this is us you know I I don't know baseball always ...\nWhat the problem is well because it's like oh we need to move quicker and look what football games are just as long oh we need more scoring well soccer's grid going you know going up in popularity what is this just two thousand Eighteen and and we may not have the attention span for something like baseball\nNow I think that's really what it is and this is the difference guys between the idea of\nPace and link the games and they're they're somewhat related but they you know they aren't in other words\nLook if you if you're both panning and use a lot of pitchers every time that they pull somebody out of the boat and we're going to a commercial break and that just loses your momentum when you had starters that could go you know maybe as many as seven or eight innings right you could have some sense of momentum\nAnd that was really something they kept people view to the television I think that that is a large part of this you know they tried to take care of this by limiting mound visits and you know that's helped 'em in you know we no longer have four pitches to get on base if you want to automatically walk somebody\nBut I Do think that there's something to be said about the Christmas of games and that's something that just doesn't want to buy very well there's something about games that move along at a good pace that's different than the length of games\nLike more a real quick you're a baseball fan you're watching these games do you think that these are good baseball viewing games\nYou know what I don't\nIs that thing I keep looking for some sense of movement to the games themselves look it's a World Series I'm not going to miss a second of it and they're great plays in great moments\nEvery single game I I just cannot stress that enough but the thing about it is is they seem to be getting stretch further apart due to how this is getting broken up so I don't know how you deal with the guys I don't know what Rob African do its clock sure\nMaybe but if you're still use an eight hundred and ...\nTime to go strategies before the game who will be the first pinch hitter who's going to be the first uh get

to day\n[laughter] you know to understand are but I Do not understand why do you understand this no really you know I mean this is happening\nI kinda understand it because Kobe fans feel like LeBron\nBasically moved Coby out of the conversation when it came to the greatest of all the time\nThat it was Jordan was made Kobe fans believe the Coby was right after Jordan because six arranged in five rings and all of a sudden now is just Jordan and LeBron okay and Kobe is not going that in the conversation\nOkay um you know the Terminator series and the movies [noise] yeah yeah you know how in one of them like Arnold Schwarzenegger sweaters and becomes like the good guy\nSo even if he is one of your competitors your adversaries if he is the greatest at what he does and he shows up to help\n...\nLet him the Lakers are the most interesting they've been in six years it's not close they're going to end the year with the best record they've had in about five or six years it's not close and what are we talking about here the stories the other night when the Lakers\nBefore there was a story we get [noise]\nWho the Lakers beat now gets ... tenants\nNobody was there he watched him he watched la Braun play in a lake or uniform and then after the game\nYou went over and he said something to look at the facial expressions on Kobe I'm abroad as the two of them are inside the house to Kobe build but what Brown's winning the jerseys Kobe used where look at them look at the way they're looking at each other just Kobe like him Kobe actually acting\nLike he like somebody actually hate them hate them does he like them or does he like um like him this is the most annoying I mean high school was mature compared to what we're doing right now in the world of Laker fans\nI never heard Philadelphia called doctor Jay to ask him if it was okay to bend Simmons got drafted\nI never heard Boston Cole Larry Bird I'm Sorry Larry is it OK and Jason Tatum is good because not All right how we we signed Gordon Hayward is that okay with you 'cause he's white and you can see would also and that's kind of like you is that okay what do you remember serious Bucky what\nOn God's green earth are we doing right now\nI mean we just always trying to pay homage to the great well I was a statue [laughter] there's a ... and the raptors you always got about out\nSodas liberal on on a statute about three or four cities by the time it was all things over\nBut he doesn't yet right now he's on uh\nKobe's team Kobe's team they hosted Kobe built staples statue\nTo Jersey than the rafters totally I mean hey you got out he asked that we did he ... he has to kiss the ring\nDidn't even see this\nIn the NFL with Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck\nOne of the greatest quarterbacks of all time they caught him\nAnd drafted a new guy and I didn't hear one cold than be like\nA excuse me a Andrew uh I just would like you to know what city you're walking into what Jersey and what position you're walking into you better respect theirs because if you don't I Hope you know you're not one of us yet\nYou are not one of us yet because this is the house the painting do did you ever hear anybody say that in Indianapolis\n[noise] ah yeah I mean kind of they talked about this in the house they paid and bill they got a huge statue out front of the outlook of soil stadium or everyone can associate the Indianapolis Colts with Peyton Manning so yeah I mean he kept a large that over there\nYeah he did but nobody ever like did not have their arms open to welcome Andrew Luck nobody ever but you know let's go back to the line of questioning that we saw pre season\nUm when a when\nThe reporter is like a hey ah so how are you going to kind of a you know indoctrinate yourself to Laker fan and the bronze like\n[laughter] me [laughter] he's like who who me\nThat really aware that that's LeBron James and I know what Laker fans are saying you got to win a ring or else it's a failure great great it's been five games he can't win a ring yet you got a calm down Kobe Bryant has tried\nHe's tried to get everybody to calm down it's like I'm On his side I'm On his team I'm Glad to hear whether he's being genuine are not quite frankly who cares\nWho cares this is the greatest player in basketball today he is definitely in the conversation for greatest player ever if you don't believe that go take a look at the Cavaliers box scores this year\nAll and more importantly the fact that Laker fans seem more addicted\nTo a false soap opera than the actual games that are being played which by the way are entertaining for the first time in five years is beyond me and quite frankly I look at any Laker fan in the eyes just tell them this is not speak well a view it just doesn't your team is good beer fan\nBe a fan of the team nobody nobody has to turn in their Kobe's card\nTo root for all abroad in the Lakers and twenty Eighteen\nYeah but when we became this debate coach where everyone wanted to debate about who's better than whom going back and forth having arguments people building cases where the guys\nThey made it harder for fans to be able to say I'm a Kobe fan but I'm Down to brown because the bronze here because even though they weren't pitted against each other didn't match up against each other and the finals there's still some of that rivalry between does fan base is because\nIt's Kobe next in line behind Jordan and he'll be on the line\nBut that's not being a Laker fan in but there's something a Laker fan I mean I couldn't I couldn't I make the argument rocky uh everybody ribs Kevin ran for going to the warriors\nThe year before I actually just months before he had been beaten by the warriors in a series where he was up three to one mhm so couldn't we say that Steph Curry and play Thompson and dream on green and the two teams were being compared with one another\nWho's better was rather staff would you rather have Katie\nKatie didn't blink is like okay now I'm gonna switch teams there's not one warrior fan on God's green earth was like whoa oh\nSee I have to break their Cady All right we've got staffing clay and just make sure you know that this is the house the staff dealt um and uh just uh you know make sure you watched yourself because this is\nI Would walk in the Bronx in marketing or radio marketing wrong though you wrote some interesting things on a on the radar situation will get to that coming up a little bit of soccer we can start talking about the raiders right now with race while they had it for a ride or Yahoo Sports are joined us out alive\nUnderstand a rebuild in the post ... trade I don't really understand I still to this day don't understand the ... power NFL people assessing what John Bruning company or doing\nYou know I think fair to me you almost have to separate the Mac trade and just say there was a mistake [laughter] I I guess maybe the writers don't feel that way because they did it but it ... if you'd separate that everything else said done I mean\nWe can criticize some of it for sure but they have five for a strong picks the next two years there they're going to be able to rebuild this thing\nI you know getting a first check for the first round pick our mark Cooper I thought was excellent I I don't think I'm Ari Cooper who's had four games of less than Seventeen hours this year as the first round pick but we'll see what the Alice and I I just think that there is a path for the raiders to rebuild and get better I I don't\n... it probably comes around and getting something out of the car find their replacement for ... which is difficult but\nThe ... trade just looms over everything because you just don't give up a generally racial player like that which which they did and I think that set them back pretty big\nYou know speaking to the you talk about the readers ... fibers Rome picks um is up\nTo ... when you go back and you look at John ... history or when it comes to pigs uh it hasn't been great how confident are you that he is a guy that can do review especially if we can do is rebuild is going to occur through the drive\nYeah and that's ... that's the ... you can have five or ... you need to have the right guy to make the picks I don't know I I mean the raiders you know Richard McKenzie hasn't turned great either a if you look for the call Joseph Gehring calmly these guys are they're not getting much out of him and that that's not good it's not good at all for 'em\nI I just wonder you know it it's hard to miss on all five too though [laughter] it's\nI think we can add to the main thing I feel about current in any way\nIs it's fun to pile on him it's fun to make the jokes everybody's doing it I think we do need to give him a little bit of time I get the Mac trade again that's almost separate it's almost a separate economy at this point than everything else they everybody realizes that was a mistake\nBut I think other than that\nLet's give grew in a shot at least big of a self out of this whole and he's what seven games into a ten year contract I well let's see what he can do nothing I mean nothing's impress me so far nothing short and perhaps many people so far without some other graphics within okay already you know somebody like that and hers than I and I and so\nThere's been some progress I think we do need to give him a little bit of patience sociology can do\nFrench law with Yahoo on the NFL joining us on Fox Sports radio Frank the Houston Texans on Thursday night want a bunch of people some uh you know their fantasy games and and then once I'm In a row and so now everybody seems to be really hot on on Houston\nBut what what is the read on the progression of just don't want them back from injury and how might they be affected by will will fall are now being out of the year\nIt's huge I don't know that they really have anybody to replace well fuller he's a he's just a difference make her he might not put up the ... D Andre Hopkins is not the receiver down there happens as but\nHe he takes the top off a defense you need a guy like that's a stretch to feel especially to Sean Watson who is so good on the people I think\nIt's funny what are we talking about the Columbine it's oh you know the the velocity on his throes of from the radar gun and he's not going to the arm strength and here he is he's in maybe the best deep I'll throw it in the NFL early she's up there so not having a folder and you're all fence it doesn't affect them a lot\nBut I don't know what to make the Texans at this point I really don't\nThey're often lines terrible that that that has to be [laughter] you know mentioned up front that's not a good thing\nThey had coming back from the ACL yeah they want for in a row great for them but I you know\nThey beat Indianapolis I'm Frank right wing for when they shouldn't they be the cowboys were chasing care it didn't go for it when he should have is this team back I don't know I'm I'm I'm just curious the Texans hurricane that perplexing me but if the ... and we saw on Thursday that that's where we're getting then they're going to win this division and be a contender\nYou into quarterbacks without talking about pets more homes or what do you think about pets ... homes and what he's been able to do it again so did you do just one\nYou know you know I don't know about you guys but I Can't come up with and maybe it's Marino all the way back to Dan Marino a guy who was married kind of a commander the position with the physical skills\nThis early in his career this young of an age usually you know guys start to really mastered a position when their physical still skills start to drop a little badly I\nGet there and Rogers that you know he was still well within his prime when he started to get it but I I seem a homes and I thought it was it a pre season I'm sure you guys did too especially the bears the bears game was high opener for me where I saw\nWow this guy isn't just a big arm you know he's going to throw the ball through the wall he knows defenses he understands this progression and he understands where to go with the ball he understands what Andy Reid wants them to do in this off and\nI said wow this is pretty impressive from a young guy let's see if that carries over regular season and he's got even better I you know I was blown away by this guy and I realize there are some blowback of oh why we crony I'm so early well the reason is there's no reason to believe this is the flu he is\nHe he could only young quarterback as I can remember the stage because he's just marry the immense physical gifts with mental command of the position it's really a president or hey let's also let's get Randy read some credit to I mean he lost it all comes a coordinator obviously not nature to\nI was picking coach of the year right now I began to read simply because he deserves a lot of credit for what homes with done so far\nRice drama Yahoo is with us on Fox Sports radio Frank all the talk of a team going to London every time we hear it it yep you know getting closer and closer are we really getting closer who's going how are they pulling this off at the top at all\nI don't hate that I hated this since day one you're going to have such a difficult time in the building a competitive team in London\nAnd why they just greet them a it's just an appeal agreed to it it's great for them to have any ... any regular season games in London to maybe I'm just a nerd when it comes at a scheduler wanting everything to be you know everybody's got equal equal shares and all that but\nYou're getting some teams seven home games does have eight and that's not a fair that's not cool I don't\nJust what it expand your brand in England a little bit so instead Thirteen million or you make Thirteen point one billion I just don't get it I've never understood the London fascination I Know the house fans there I Know that they like NFL football there but they must not sending a a Premier League team the U.S why why are we sending NFL\nTeam to them [laughter] you know I just don't get past I don't\nUnderstand the fascination I really truly don't I don't think it makes a leak better wherever you send over there you're going to have to make such concessions to make them competitive for to lower free agents I what are you going to give them a higher salary cap and everybody else but I mean\nI just [laughter] I just can't imagine if you have the choice of playing in\nChicago or Houston or London unless you're really adventurous well why pick London unless you have some ties there I I just don't get this at any level why this makes sense and I don't think it brings the NFL from again to Thirteen billion dollar industry to twenty I was just it is very\nReal quick you tell me a decade from now the jaguars play where and the chargers play where\nAfter Craig question I added no idea where the chargers play but if not LA I really don't believe so and I do at the ... I just think that they're studying the ... playing these tracks for a long time [noise]\nInteresting Frank great stuff grey tabby thank you that's what it calls I appreciate\nIt okay for a swab NFL on Yahoo joining us Fox Sports radio I don't know where it's going to be but not LA did you catch that [laughter] yeah I mean I heard her [laughter] why why you why you proponent man\nI mean I just I just I I'm not I'm not only convinced it is going to open up the LA LA is good big enough for two ... New York is the jets the giants working at all they had the chosen ramps\nOkay so next just whisper it in my area as he's wearing his charger Jersey he says they're locked in and so ... what you just did was you just bought the Internet\nSo the Internet [laughter] the Internet uh and pro football talk was the Internet portal that the NFL used to get their message out last week\nYou know what I'm Out and said oh well I'm Sorry I stopped the bus the chargers are last\nFor years Twenty years locked and loaded gun do things hey nothing in the NFL is ever locked\nYour negative about the charges because I told you what the plan has been was the last time the charge when the playoffs I'm it's right in the exactly what I don't ruin winters right in in to be honest about the charges who are their stores or power Bucky they don't have any star power first of all the all star\nPower harder than than pardon them not having any star power this is chicken or the egg is because they're chargers they do have stars chargers if\nGordon was her if nobody was around he's not a star\nI'm not coming from there I'm coming from I'm coming from I'm looking at I'm looking at him and I'm looking at what he's accomplished he's not a star like he's a good player yet but when we're talking about stars were talking about guys to move the needle guys that when you watch them they\nPot why does it early items that early pop and Gordon doesn't what do you mean girlie are caused because of the biggest statistical running backs in the NFL this year the new and actually I'm Erika [laughter] so why is one pop and whatnot\nBecause girlie has done it back to back years girl he's been a special player for the majority of the time that he's been in the league okay if you look at what he's done Melvin Gordon has been ... or more than ... he's he's here that he had he had in the hot though he's not a stall\nThat girlie also had one really awful year which Gordy hide it\nBut now you said a but Gordon had to put a big numbers consistently throughout his time like if you think that if you want to say that with the seasons are good like that's fine so but I understand it is is is bigger\nBut there are Jared golf is better than Philip Rivers is is what you're telling me\nI'm not saying I'm saying LA has more stars or I'm saying that\nThe rams on officer driven by the time girly\nAnd all things ...

more than ... so I'm seeing some people on Twitter criticize her bed words took I Would just have to ask you\nIs a thirty one twenty eight at the time there's about\nMinute and change to go in the game us he does not have any time outs ASU quarterback breaks through the line on the run\nAnd he's got nothing but green grass in front of him\nWhere he takes it all the way to the house\nSo scores a touchdown you go up ten with just over ... minutes ago\nBut now you're given the ball back to USC\nMhm and some people said harm you gotta\nYou gotta have you got to have you guys know in that situation to just fall down because then you Neil out the clock and the games over instead now as he's got the ball in theory they could get a touchdown and go for an arm sidekick\nAnd tied the game if they get that on site kick\nWell they did just scored a touchdown and now with thirty five seconds they're only down by three again and about to conduct an on sidekick and we'll see if they get it you know they probably won't but uh let's see ball bounces up in the air now as you will cover it and so they'll escape\nBut in that situation I always go why are we blaming the coach like ... in you coach at the high school level don't these players like they're big enough to know\nThey're going to really hit ... you really really you have to kind of talk I'm\nOver and over about situational awareness so one of the teams that\nHas always been the best team when it comes to situational football has been to New England patriots and one of the reasons why is because they are committed to not only talking about those situations\nThey practice do situations Bill Belichick gives pop quizzes on those situations and when I've asked other coaches or why is New England so good and everyone knows that they're good at situation of football how come everybody isn't that good\nHe said because of the coaches are lazy and they don't want to spend the time they goes into being good a situation of football really they don't want to take the time to go over all of those scenarios they don't teach it they don't spend\nThey don't go to the level of detail that bill a check in the patriots go same thing down in Alabama when it comes to Nick statement\nThey are detailed and meticulous about making sure that their players understand situations at all times and most coaches\nDon't have the band with nor the discipline to say that I'm going to make sure that all my players truly understand situational football they'll give lip service but the actions don't always match up with the words well you do when I said\nI Will I Will back you up on this you know I Know a handful of guys who who used to play for the patriots and it's it's not like other systems I mean they do they they refer to it is I don't know if they use the word jail but it's like they don't they don't when you're a patriot you don't have a life\nYou're not allowed to have a life\nAnd so it's it's ... taking the time to go over each scenario doesn't just mean like oh boy stayed after work a few minutes no no no I mean it's like ballot check his round ...\nSo the night before you always send me a very detailed email on a here the topics here's what we're going to cover\nHere is the only way we live in and then I'm going to view yeah\nYeah like he he had what we got [noise] or whatever [noise] okay well let's think about\nMaybe some of the guys that you work with who don't have that level of detail and who don't have that level of attention to all of the things and how your show may suffer because their preparation isn't up to your level world when we talk about these games and most games and football and decided by\nSeven points are less will the guys that are really committed and focused to really making sure that their players understand\nThe details how you win games and those things they're the ones that when Marty shot and hammer told me a long time ago when I was saying they can't said he said this and it resonated I'm more games are lost than one\nIf you can just go out and get your team not to lose the game many don't turn the ball over don't have a lot of penalties make sure you understand what you're supposed to be which is supposed to do when you're supposed to do it\nYou wind the overwhelming majority of all your games and looking at how his career played out he wants you and your games and yet people are taking the tests are not winning in the playoffs right but each and every year he won ten or eleven games just because he wouldn't lose games and then you may not win a championship like that\nBut you will always be in the hunt if you can kind of buying into a let's make sure we do the things that we can control if we can control the control room when a lot of games\nWell I mean I'll also just add that just because of the kid didn't fall down doesn't mean Hermeto works didn't tell him to the other the other thing like won't blame because she was like well I don't know if I I who knows what he told them right\nYeah you you never know because you can tell man we we've sold\nIraq over and over\nAgain light so two weeks ago when I came a late because that was coaching my game on a Saturday yes\nHave a timeout hit his third Nineteen\nSo all you tell your players we taught a time out and said hey don't let him out of bounds don't let him throw it over the head you know what happens mark they threw it over our head for a touchdown so you can talk about it and it still may not clicking resonate with the player\nNo brother I got three kids you don't need to tell me [laughter] you're telling me about things I just that the people that they ignored [laughter] I mean is it is a five minute by five minute thing yes I have heard the words of my house what did I just\nSay well why did I say to you know let's say a yes though it's a it is it is difficult or by the way I wanted to follow up with you because it was last week you said and I got some ideas on how to fix the shah and watch it did you see those things on Thursday night\nI did I fix to you so you say that affects them look a lot of people that want to thank you man I Know a couple of things that are played out the last two weeks since I wrote the article about the show was shown reading NFL dot com I Am and that's my guy guy he just shot I'm\nMiller has been a fact that when it comes to running the ball I talked about they need to take pressure of the show I watch them by run into football\nThe last couple of weeks they've been able to run the football will and because of that it's played out last two games with more Miller has had over one hundred yards in each of those games on the ground when you can run the ball it allows your quarterback to play in a comfort level and allows your team to control the game\nThe other thing I talked about willful the need to be a factor\nA will for the show was and had a major connection last year he uses vertical guy he could push it down to feel last two games will fill that had made some place now unfortunately willful the towards they feel on Thursday night and he's not going to be\nAnd he's not gonna be available to them so they're gonna have to find another deep there\nTo do with less not more fewer pass attempts fuel responsibilities allow him to play and I don't want to say as a gay manager but really\nKeep them on a pitch count don't expose him to so many hits because he was getting beaten to a pope the first few weeks of the season\nThey are now beginning to play kind of a ball control style and that is allowing him to flourish more teams need to do that with the young quarterbacks they're running game matters even though this league is shifting to a passing\nI Want to keep you up there on a couple of things going on in the college game right now or Arizona State has officially put the finishing touches on us these ASU and harm Edwards pull the upset and win that game meantime in the Big Ten\nGo to the top one of those things are going to have a dot com\n[noise] end up paying twelve [noise]\nMade America about groundbreaking usa [noise]\nAll of your goals are wrapped righty\n[noise] more free\nOf charge you know they have been acts and lazy or John six million\nMakers is safer to buy a new lease perspective and expert analysis we ... a Lebanese dirt on Fox Fox Sports\n\n\n\nYou know that's the Georgia Bulldogs radio network and the second such down to the game for Jeremiah women are now joins us live on Fox Sports radio we're going to raise your your back about ten minutes no joy and let's get Jim on the way\nYou're somewhere to go under a we're doing a good for you guys I I I Wonder every time you go\nAnd when necessary to impress the people who vote on this kind of thing\nA lot of like it weighs a lot uh honestly you know it's the talk to him they cannot they compete in a lot of people you know they doubted as and things like that we came out we play the game that we need to play to come out successful\nYou know you're talking about the world's largest cocktail party or how does what does that robbery mean being on the Georgia side of it\nIt was great I mean uh knowing knowing the history and all that stuff and they just all of them is the first time since the eighties the Georgia is one back ... years so I mean no one that we're a part of that no one I was a big contributor today I mean that's that's just great\nAnd right now Jeremiah you guys this when and and the opportunity to play Kentucky next week\nOr if you guys when that you guys are going to you know how to control your own destiny in the SEC ease and obviously then it sets up potentially down the road you guys might be able to face Alabama how badly do you want to play that game\nI mean it's not really about like what we were playing a which is whoever whoever's in a way whatever you have to do to get what we want to because we we we don't want it in a closed book too early so that's that's really what it is\nYou know Jim are you guys are forcing because you had to really really good quarterbacks today obviously Jake from headed going Seventeen to twenty four two hundred and forty three touchdowns but talking about the quarterback situation Jay from Justin feels what a broker those guys bring to the table\nOr I mean they're both I mean there are two different types of quarterbacks but ah you know not knowing the iron shop is on uh they they correct each other they they make each other better as in the day that's that's what they do so that's that's what it boils down to uh so yeah and that's that's really helpful for us 'cause I mean we don't really have a bad as part of the quarterback situation\nHarlem in Georgia receiver joining us Fox Sports radio how different is the life of a receiver are based on who is the quarterback you know different\nQuarterbacks just knowing or they both get the job done basically are both of them are on a check for all we gotta do to do everything so yeah\nJeremiah we really appreciate it a few minutes of your time thank you and she grabs again\nNo problem okay Jeremiah Harlem and the Georgia receiver with a couple of touchdowns today at Georgia Tech South Florida vi final of thirty six Seventeen\nAnd now they're on the road at Kentucky and it's kind of jarring Bucky to look at their schedule and seeded Kentucky is a twelve reading gym in the nation and I'm like I'm On the right I'm On the football page right I Can't really be Kentucky is writes wealth in the nation\nI mean it's unbelievable but they look they have some really good players a stooges in a really good job getting those are getting Kentucky on track\nThen a dog fight right now I say on a plane Missouri but the first ... balls on therefore you're going in down forty nine but they are playing really really well on defense they will be a stiff challenge for the Georgia Bulldogs and when I think about Georgia\nOr is unique that you have two quarterbacks that can both stored and make a ton of plays Jake from obviously let these guys are the national title game a season to go\nUm he has become ability but a kid playing behind in just a feels was no more recruit in the country become quarterback\nUm Jeremiah mentioned iron sharpens aren't the competition at the quarterback position normally it can kind of fraying fracture team but in Georgia for whatever reason it seems like it's working we'll see how it continues to play out with this team\nDid in the middle of a hut to go get a national title\nAnd keep you up to date on that Kentucky Missouri game right now Kentucky has moved the ball in Missouri Territory they're closing in on about a minute to go fourteen to nine Missouri leads Kentucky wrecked euchre will join us in about five minutes while we're talking about quarterbacking all eyes as we approach that\nLike you walk but Bucky I was interested to read your article that you have this week where you wrote view where of the draft centric rebuild for John and grew and why do you mean by that what do you think's gonna happen next that's\nWhat I mean everyone is excited because I think we all see ourselves as general managers because fantasy sports it allows us to kind of have our own team so we think hey man drafting is just either we'll just go drafted players that we need and poof\nA waiver to replace the killer Mac ... replacing them more Cooper and get whatever we need right away and that would immediately changed the fortunate the franchise\nWhen you go back and you really look um dressing and the first round as a fifty fifty proposition in terms of you hit rate\nIn terms of hitting ... not only at like a starter but a high level player and so those five picks over the next two years were saying maybe they'll get two and a half players that can play at a high level where the trick is I'm\nIn the league in history you haven't seen people have success when they've had multiple picks and the first round fine to a more pro ball players that can reach that status in multiple seasons so what John route and is trying to do is something that the U.S who just can't be done he is going to replace\nAn offer a player and could little Mac and a pro ball player to vote pro ball player in the morning Cooper and address I just don't think is going to happen because when you look at history down in Tampa he didn't really make 'em\nHeadway with a lot of great picks he didn't have those kinds of players that elected when he looked at it I just don't think it's a good place for the Oakland Raiders but time until if John ruined is able to restart their roster and get them playing like they were playing two years ago\nAnd Reggie McKenzie is not going to be there anymore that certainly seems like the secret is out and so it is going to be on Gurdon and maybe does better this time around I just look at the whole picture and I I feel like people would be saying good things about the raiders\nEarly in the season and maybe even before it a first round or for Mari Cooper\nFact I even think today people like that's pretty good 'cause Cooper's been you know he's been great and then he's been not so great at other times so they get a first round pick that's really good the reason people are laughing at it though is because he also came in the wake of the ... which was not a good decision\nIf John Goodman simply looked at 'em already Cooper and said I think we can do better\nAnd he had looked at their car\nAnd said I think we can do better we're not going to win the super bowl with those being the two best players on or off ads\nPeople would have bought it and then he could have kept ... fucking traded the wrong one at the start of the season\nThey traded a wrong one there's no reason for them to treat a little Mac and I can go back in detail why\nThey didn't need to trade 'em at the time that he did um but I and I'll say briefly a ... plan on his fifth year option the raiders had the opportunity to put the franchise tag on ... Mac and back to back years\nAfter that so for this year and the next two years basically for three years they still had a little Mac under their control without having to put him in a long term deal\nNo matter how much she was crying and whining about wanting a new deal they did not have to ... they still could have had them when they hit their control\nAt a deal that really play to the team\nFor whatever reason John brutal was I was too much money he let him out the door\nThe issue that you have is ... is a proven player everyone in the locker room knows that he is a tough I play a disposition they know that he's a special play or maybe even the best player\nHe was the best player on their team when you trade that away and then you come back a few months later and you treat them more Cooper away another guy that is recognizing the lock them as one of their best players\nThe locker room is now looking at John ... sideways they're wondering ...\nUp in the was and not really able to compete in for feel some of the things I Want to ...\nYeah 'cause how many players in the locker room or thinking I'm going to be here in ten years\nSo none of them should be done and go after the exactly okay\nBut I I Need to see it at crunch time I need to see it when when I Need a D to go take over a series to impose basically like again if you're talking about their side you're talking about a D you go back and you watch that playoff series last year\nYou didn't see Anthony Davis ... Davis should should should not allow dream on green to play him even or to uh to be able to handle him one on one he should be drawing additional attention\nAnd forcing a the the warriors to make a decision that we double or do we double lady or do we stay at home and we let him get his\nAh and worry that he'll he'll take over the game and and beat us that way\nHe didn't do that and for the pelicans to do everything that you hope they will that's what he has to do\nWreck wonderful to have you as always appreciate your flexibility thank you you got a guy okay read euchre senior Indian writer bridge report joining us marketed Bucky Brooks Fox Sports radio and the pelicans or a perfect example for what I Want to ask you about the NBA and quite frankly beyond coming up next\nDoes analytics and shovel you think of Dodgers games during\nYour fans rejoice does your team gets with that and then when it comes to the world series your coverage is right here on Fox Sports radio\nIndeed news finding the right higher takes time away from your business hiring unqualified data engineer felt like a second job more job seekers use indeed than any other site so there's no better place to find someone with the skills you're looking for I needed someone with a masters in computer science and database experience\nPlus indeed screener questions hope you find your shortlist fast now I'm back to having just one job\nSo it's ... it's this is a court ordered notice current and former foreign Lincoln and mercury owners or less the skin receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective to connett airbags in their vehicles\nTo see if your vehicle is included and to file a claim to auto airbags settlement dot com or call one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six that's auto airbags settlement dot com or one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six\nHave it in right now and he taught or blue patient teaches celebrating its ... anniversary of the show it's appreciation will offer savings like never before just any brand new twenty Eighteen he so he would for Lincoln Dodger Chrysler car this week uh getting tires for life\nAs right Trader Joe's brand new car for this week uh never buy a set of tires again don't forget taste is the only ... offers you a three day money back guarantee swing by today are visiting Machar Pete's dot\nCom tires for certain conditions why does it tires for like ... number for life dot com or see do we need to\nFill the Allen has crisscrossed this district listening to what is important to you and she understands that our communities need and care about Sylvia has fought for our school and the teachers that make them work she is thought to protect our property rights and she has advocated for the businesses and industry that make our economy thrive\nSylvia Allen is the candidate with the experience to get the job done vote early or on November say for Sylvia Allen for district thick state senator paid for by the Arizona Farm Bureau federation in ...
