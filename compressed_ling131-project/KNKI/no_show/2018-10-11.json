the Chinese authorities and their Kendrick of Cain Gordon\nSay who you're a graduate student University of Rochester in March you're organizing an event on campus who is the event for\nSo the event was pretty much for everybody in the university was an open event where everyone can come without paying a fee and it was meant to sort of um spread this idea of dialogue on campus\nAnd dialogue with whom I mean who who were the people are going to be at the event\nSo I'm as I said before it it it although was open for everybody I Won\nTibetan issue mainly focuses on on having dialogue with those that you tend to disagree with\nAnd so I'm by by setting that by setting that issue and talking about it on campus we want to give a everybody a chance to participate to get to know about the issue and of course being on a college campus we do have a lot of an international Chinese students\nThat want to give them a choice I'd give them an opportunity also too\nYou know I could get to know the Tibetan issue um\nAnd then find some new shoe to bet I'm Beijing believes is a part of the People's Republic of China it sits in the south western portion very strategic because many of the world's a river start their high ground 'em\nAnd Tibetans they don't necessarily agree that they are part of the People's Republic some of them do but some of them want independence hacks\nAt least since two thousand and they the Chinese authorities have used brutality against the people of Tibet we have reports of internal migration forced internal migration ethnic cleansing that can be called\nNot only in Tibet but in large cities to the edges of the Tibetan Plateau that's what you were introducing people to the facts that we have about uh the persecution\nAnd his holiness the Dalai Lama the spiritual leader of the Tibetans um has taken the position that he doesn't want independence that Tibet should be autonomous\nAnd who's complain of what he's called and what many people agree is cultural genocide the purposeful attempt by Beijing to eliminate Tibetan Buddhism\nTo eliminate Tibetan a density 'em to take over the lands of Tibet so this is controversial with regard to both drugs that are on an American campus what happened well\nYou know it's it's not a I I think it's more it's bigger than being an American campus at this point because\nAny issues as a student and we can\nCome come to come to the mutual ground and and just simply and simply sit down and agree to disagree or or to agree to agree\nAnd et cetera et cetera um I purposely use the Tibetan issue in order to give a an opportunity for every student to observe it and make an opinion of their own and then have a dialogue amongst themselves\nThere by living out the principles of what it needs to being at a at a college campus especially in the United states of America\nAnd in March you would actually organized this event it was advertised it was actually the University of Florida's new about it because of course ... it was taking place on the campus of the University of Rochester and you had a very good central location on campus ... what happened immediately before there\nSo I'm up until I guess a day before the event um or even a even a little bit before that everything was uh going as planned um I was told that the hosting student organization\nI'm even had a meeting about the event and they've even decided not only to host event for me but to help me register for the event I I I went through every every guideline that their advice or had told me to follow and\nSuddenly um my ... so my event was that on the thirty first of march and on the night or the twenty ninth\nMy a friend of mine actually sent me a screen shot up an email that they receive from the Chinese student association saying that um you know apparently the Chinese student association has had received ... concerns from uh some of the members of the Chinese a international student community\nAnd that are about my event going on on campus and they will and it set on the email that they will let the ... at both the university and the ...\nUh we're actually fearful that your event might be canceled or something worse might happen and I told them you know what you know this is the United states what could happen you know it's I I'm entitled to my free speech as a scholar\nUm ... just as they're they're free to they're free to go and complain and I don't see anything wrong with it so what happened to come that morning I get an email from the advice or the advice the same advice or who helped me all throughout that month to register and\nTo reserve or that event on campus um sends me an email saying that the hosting shooting or organization all of a sudden with drew their support for the summit which are the sponsorship for this event and henceforth\nUm this event was cancelled and on at the end of the emails she even noted that um she suggested that I I I moved on from to an off campus location\nSo basically the University of Rochester decides to um cancel your event\nAnd trucks you off campus well I I don't know exactly what happened I don't know why I don't know why she decided to um you know take that step but uh to to the eyes of many people might look that way because I have a lot of smoke around here right [laughter]\nRight but all I can say is that you know um I it was a big disappointment and also at the same time I was not only disgusted by what had happened but\nYou know I I just I it it it's I was so\nUpset not because of the fact that my event was cancelled but because of the fact that we I personally felt that we were somehow compromising our values as Americans as as as people were living on this land um to to practice this idea that this this right\nThe phone call I mean who do you think who made the phone call somebody made a phone call who was it\nI I can only I can only guess at this point I'm a maybe maybe it was maybe with some very upset student on campus maybe it was a the Chinese government maybe it was a some donor who who might have not been happy that this kind of ...\nAnd let's go let's go to mark Clifford for the answer what Santa Ana come to\nWell we were talking before about um the the scholar Perry links 'em\nA suggestion that the Chinese government is a bit like an anaconda in a chandelier at a party everybody's enjoying nice party in the ballroom drinking champagne eating canopies whatever\nThe snake doesn't have to do very very much everybody knows it's there you'd reaches out every once in awhile often quite randomly you can't figure out why the snake does what it does but it keeps everybody in mine\nJohn there's another part to this story um we don't have time in this segment but we've got to get back to it because this is an issue of what at a campus administration is doing and what have tried to do to cover its tracks\nGordon Chang the database mark Clifford is a former editor of the south China Morning post and we thank you very careful very careful scholar say when Kim to tell the story of the University of Rochester yes there are other explanations but I think everybody just started not only in the United states but around the world\nThe anaconda I'm John ...

likely to be used against and that's China which is why I think it's perhaps not as concerning for Washington and last month or the secretary of state Pompeo and Secretary Mattis we're in Delhi signing a much more important agreement\nWhich is a a ... which is a communications\nAgreement with Delhi which will dramatically increase and drop her ability between the Indians and the Americans and I'm sure that the sale was discussed during those meetings and\nIf the U.S had had very serious concerns they would have been addressed at that time so there there's the legal possibility for sanctions but given the politics I I Would hope that there wouldn't be any\nYou have to put a little context and the United states sanction China for by the same as four hundred a\nAnti aircraft

these two countries started to work much more closely um but you know ... seems to be playing a very interesting game of outreach not only to put not only to the United states but also to China what's going on there ...\nSo the the China focus is always or or you know been overtly economic India needs investment um it was hoping to get quite a bit of an investment from Japan and and it's gotten some investment from Japan\nBut Modi in order to be reelected and you know there are elections coming up in the spring of twenty Nineteen really needs to deliver on things like jobs that sounds familiar I'm so he needs investment and the goal with the Chinese engagement was to try to get the financial engagement without the ...\nAnd the investment he expected from the United states\n[noise] it hasn't been as a as easy as it could have been um but I think there have been um problems on both sides there are a lot of\nUm vested interest in Delhi or that have been slowing things down as well um a lot of people made a lot of money from a lot of different sorts of relationship so\nI'm One weapons sales are involved um you're looking at relationships that may be going back decades including

Russians at a time when the U.S really wouldn't touch India at all\nSo um there is you know it it's not considered a problem and um I think there was during during the time when um the west was backing some pretty nasty elements in Afghanistan\nUm the Indian knew that this ... hottest problem would flow back to India\nAnd were I'm not averse to working with the Soviets during that time either to try to contain it so a lot of their relationship with Russia is very much a reflection of their immediate border you know the problems with our hottest on one side and the problem with China on the other and that's the lens through which they view their relationship with Moscow\nAnd clue what is the studio glued between uh\nLately after ah India bought the ... the um missile defense

playing the rush of card if that's what they're playing this can be a dangerous game the Russians are not easy to work with use that forgotten the Soviet days does that regarded as that was all that

during the during that period as well\nA lot of compromise material all that sort of stuff\nThat's the way of putting it yes [laughter] so um you know I think it takes a long time to to to read that up but also you know they ... the Soviets were there for\nIndia at a time when sometimes others weren't but there is that the more serious problem is that a lot of the stuff that Russia sold India has not been great the quality has been particularly good and the price tends to keep going up and up and up with a very slow delivery\nSo the actual quality of what's been sold in the past has been a

you a rapist or they call you KKK so you have anti randomly set up checkpoints in Washington DC or in a places like\nPortland, Oregon if you don't let them direct you wherever they want while they yell and scream in custody you they beat your car with medical with a metal the times and they say FU whites come back\nOr they say FU rapist if you're a white they're authorized to be mean to you

a vacation there is that the police should somebody has a question will shooting or whatever the case may be or the the police beat somebody questionable or knock collection of like then that draws out\nThe antifa who go into operation they already have their manual and then they too are sometimes even that night\nThe general public sees it on the news the news you did this favorable shows adverse favorable the police stand down\nAnd then the general public start showing up and in the Baltimore a Maryland documents they say we're targeting the black community were trying to get the urban community to get angry and cause a chain reaction\nThis is so horrified because the same thing that happened tragically in Charlottesville almost just happened again and local media working with local police or you saw stand out in Portland they were waiting down the street overseeing it\nIn case anybody did resist antifa they could then be crack down on they were waiting with the experiment like the CIA is practice and many others Jim Morrison study this in college is how to cause a riot and so you've got the cars coming through Russia or your screaming name's Adam you're calling them scum bags are calling them KKK\nYou're hitting our cars with the times\nYou're ... their vehicles\nA venue for giving the orders agitate block roads so that someone else gets run over\nBy the local

him down\nThey just they just show the people going oh my God it was so scary we were loving reality\nAnd then this horrible mean people try to hurt us and then that's how this works and\nThen if you question somebody getting killed well\nYou're going to be called an extremist and thickness\nJust like I didn't say that nobody died at a Parkland, Florida\nThey don't care they just say I did that\nAnd I can be said for it you say\nSo this is the mind control operation they're bringing in this is the whole system we're dealing with right now and you can see them now trying to activate are

moved down here to Austin, Texas and started doing politics every day [noise] I called a lot of fun\nEntertaining sporting events buzzer leaders are championships [noise] but cover and what's going on in America right now I mean there is [noise] sports does not hold a candle ladies and gentlemen it just it is so epic what's going on and just seeing the moves\nSeeing what's on the horizon it's all epic up quickly I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mentioned what's going on in Florida perhaps we'll cover it a little bit later on in the show once we get to a lot more\nCalls and some of this news but\nHurricane Michael has made landfall I Believe in Florida\nAnd it looks like it has just made landfall in Panama City\nAnd it is moving\nSouth east excuse me north east right\nNow and\nYou know it's just like everything else on the news they cover hurricanes and it's fake news\nAnd I'm not saying a hurricane is fake news obviously the hurricane is is a serious issue here\nThe flooding has already been devastating in Florida but\nNotice how there was no build up to this really it just kind of like came out of nowhere so it's not even as big of a story\nSo like the the last hurricane already forgot the name of it\nHuge build up weeks to build up days of build up and then it kind of came and you know it happened but a a guy who had like a week and have a buildup and ... you know it was okay but not the worst thing\nAnd then hurricane Michael no build up a you know nobody really talks about it and then it's actually like a really bad one and it's going to flood almost the entire northern panhandle and and it's like well okay\nAnd um you know it's just\nWhatever but\nInterestingly enough\nSome people are starting to understand how fake news is on a much larger scale\nStudy economic boom largely ignored as TV's Trump coverage it's Ninety two percent negative so it was Ninety One Ninety One we need to go up to Ninety two so you never hear about the record economic numbers the record jobs growth\nEverything else the record low unemployment and then Gallo passable only twenty percent of people have a great deal slash quite a lot of confidence and TV news even less in Congress and see folks and that's why everything they say\nOh you're the blue waivers inevitable blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah ... people aren't buying it\nPeople are not buying it anymore\nAnd so they know all the negative coverage is fake so so you notice though\nI mean the numbers pretty much correlate\nMeanwhile gay frogs is actually a real story\nAnd now apparently there's like a whole swamp of I'm\nIn San Francisco\nBut they make fun of Alex Jones reporting on that fact\nMeanwhile they ignore all of the real news is going on in this country but you know what\nOne thing I've learned here covering the most recent Trump rallies is that the Trump rallies don't make TV news nobody covers it Fox News Fox Business MSNBC CNN Bloomberg CNBC I monitor at all I Do it I Do it live\nZero coverage of the Trump rally\nYou know what will go out and play some clips from the Trump rally first let's go to a quick clip of President Trump or talking about the Democrat campaign to

that we saw in and I knew it when we when you know and I'm sure you didn't when we were watching it we weren't seeing the major damage that was being done in some of those areas because for example in Mexico beach and nobody was there filming\nRight you because you you just couldn't be there I couldn't show that um you know the the the conditions as a Michael came ashore on uh with with a\n... a very strong at a very strong category for uh you look at a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds and and just incredible I mean just look at the time span from last weekend up until\nUh the storm arrived or the unpredictable nature of the storms and ... and how Michael a gain strength and was still gaining strength I ... if\nIf the storm hadn't been moving as quickly as it as it was headed slowed down at all over water or there's no telling I mean there's a ... I'm I'm confident this thing would have been a category five ... yeah I mean it it came close to it anyway\nA mile a mile per hour away Riley yeah\nFrom from getting to that to a point and I they did say later on you know the analysis of it they could you know a revisit it and say that it was a fiber why lower for right\nAh I said when they when they get all the you know a data from all the instrumentation mhm uh they they could still update it but how uh\nHow terrifying it must be a whole blaming all I've seen so far still report I haven't checked in about twenty minutes for the last time I checked only one that so far tribute to right and that was a hurricane Michael and that was because of a fallen trees there may be more people but right just as at the moment just one\nWell and and the cleanup or as you just\nThere will be structures that will in some cases never be rebuilt a depending on their age and and and ownership a you know you go back and in the history of storms\nLike this and they were well very few that that can really equal this only a few that that ah that top it uh but uh often in these areas I mean it is it is that destruction and then I remember a ... you know 'cause we have along the Texas Gulf Coast I mean that's that has happened you've had strong storms come through\nAnd and then you see over the years a rebuilding and and new structures come come about or in in something like this with a you know a hundred and fifty plus mile an hour winds\nIt is you know often the case that those those structures those buildings are just aren't rebuilt and and ah there you know often will be or they're not repair of all obviously some of them being devastated but but people will choose to decide not to rebuild and uh and move on often\nAnd we need to go radical left and so this is obvious at you know that they're doing this this is obvious that the mainstream of the Democratic party have realized we can't beat this\nSo we are also last week there is\nNo are you there is no road for them to turn around basically and come back\nReverse direction we'll weed said that two letters again really well and and you know when we set it after the election\nUh you because there is that once they took that break and you know are considered going to the mid west for a moment [noise]\nThey came back from watching what wait what are we said before lunch oh we're totally not do not know on a plan to do in that we're not doing that\nUm but when you when you go you know back in and look at the history of of basically this this ramping up to this point\nThere at it there at this point now now ask yourself do you think they're going to reverse course they're not going to so what is next\nWhere do you go from here\nA new place to go to because it's just now they're going to get in your ... not going to shout well what is what is beyond that right now I Believe it's a terrible political strategy that's going to backfire it is I think it's already backfire and uh but you know this this is where they've decided to go which uh again\nI'm not surprised because once they're only as and we'll talk about this more coming up on the show\nWith a bit later on but there's really two places to go right either moderate may become more centrist and really become more centrist mhm or go to the left and if you go to the left the only place to go is what the tactics of Occupy Wall street antifa whatever right that's the only place you could go right eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nBucks more ready to do with a record ...

I I I'm surprised we all saw him um this morning he was actually streaming on our station in Panama City um and I believe is from Jacksonville television station um\nAnd um\nHe was in a parking garage yeah right yes\nAnd and and his coverage or was seen worldwide people were picking them up\nWorldwide and and we threw out um you know the TV station a that would be a W. J. H. G. or which did streaming coverage um um basically when when we went off the air they started their streaming coverage\nAnd and continued until they lost more than just power they lost power at their transmitter sites\nAnd that was pretty much game over for them but they were only twenty\nThey continued to keep an IT guy on board to make sure that they kept feeding that and so they set another sister station in our system through and this gentleman in that garage I appreciate his honesty because what he basically did\nWas documented where he was where he was standing yeah and and and and smartly I'm not going to go stand out there by the edge of the parking garage but what I found interesting was that that parking garage was also home for countless people in their cars yeah\nYeah I just the atrocity is his name and a lot of people were following him a Drudge Report actually even put up a lean a early Wednesday and uh and he had been during that time basically staging and showing\nYou know the well a calm literally calm before the storm\nAnd and ah so he was he was broadcasting essentially a through periscope ah for periods of time thirty to forty minutes or even shorter times\nBut then as you mentioned are going live later and this is something that again it it is too I think display the power of a storm for many of us that have never been through a storm and very few people relatively speaking\nHad been through a storm like this but when you're able to show people how powerful this is what it does and he's just going to be there by the way he anticipated being there for up to a week or longer\nBecause he knows that's going to be next to impossible to get out of the parking garage because of the you know the damage left behind and that's what you hope to do you hope to show people that this damage and how powerful this storm is now\nLook on the radar a Tom this thing right now a Michael everyone in the state of Georgia right now is feeling some effect of Michael as it's centered over a Georgia and moving toward the Carolinas what are we expecting next and the next twenty four to forty eight hours and beyond\nWell initially what we're going to expect his life you know there there still is a life threatening storm surge going on um to begin with a Panama City in along the coast there they still are anywhere from three to five feet a inundation going on right\nAnd so we haven't had a a you know the water to recede but we're also going to have tremendously heavy rainfall from Michael and that's going to be life threatening flash flooding and it's going to go across not just Georgia but the Carolinas\nAnd they don't need any more water right there still saturated and there are places that are going to become impassable it would not necessarily be out of the question\nTo to find some of the major roads Ninety five can I say Ninety five enough ah ... we're going to need to be aware of this is ... if if if you're if if you're working and your job is to drive somewhere bottom line is you're going to need to be alert to this [noise] uh\nThe wins a high profile vehicles we're twelve hours from now still going to be looking now we've got a a Seventy mile an hour wind and within the next half hour they are going to update that with a with an advisory they were giving one hour advisories this was the last advisory\nAt twelve o'clock eastern time\nThat we'll be moving on to uh just regular a three hour advisories\nAnd um and so it's going to accelerate and speed as it becomes a little more entrenched in the mid level jet stream and so that'll Pickett's speed up the I'm guessing a probably not by the time\nForty miles an hour forty to forty five miles an hour or\nAnd so uh now above the surface where we don't have the friction of the earth five thousand feet wins been already clocked I'm\nUsing Doppler radar\nOr at that level it eighty to eighty five miles an hour and so where there's a heavy cluster of thunderstorms in there is one currently ... crossing over highway six team which goes into making from savannah ah there's heavy rain there and\nThat thunderstorm translates those higher winds to the surface and so in those storms they could see gust to eighty miles or maybe even eighty five mile an hour gusts even though we're looking at it a sustained speed of Seventy miles an hour so we're going to drop about in half\nAs we go over the next twenty four hours\nTo around forty to forty five\nOf the speed of wins above the surface\nAnd and so right now as I said we're Seventy will be down to about forty five will still be in the tropical storm range and I believe that it will exit the United states or as we get up to friday morning out into the Atlantic\nAs a as a tropical storm ... wow\nWe're not it's not it's not going to become a remnant it's not going to be just a cluster of storms that are moving their way off in a in a general direction John trout great meteorologist or admire him a lot\nIndicated Ninety five court or and that's exactly what it's going to be following the car door although it will be on the west side of that court door and we've already learned that the west side of that court or\nHas some some some roots that are between Colombia and Ninety five and moving its way up\nTo a flooding and that includes going across Lumberton\nAnd Fayetteville and both of those areas um south of Raleigh which I think it'll scoot right past Raleigh\nThose areas are are we're going to have to be watching them as we go into today tonight and tomorrow or to see if we have more catastrophic flooding and damage we can probably we can probably say for the next time we talk\nAbout turning around and don't drought\nRight right exactly and you have to you have to proceed with with caution and don't think you can get through it as you mentioned yesterday you don't know if that road has been washed away under the surface of that water you it's impossible to tell that so\nIt has always best to turn around and certainly a we're going to keep people posted throughout the morning as meteorologists Tom hale\nAnd later John

the thing is I ... now that I wouldn't want to do something like that it's not a possibility it's not something I even ever thought of when I was young [laughter] it's like before though doing what they do on the weather channel or being a meteorologist like bad which\nIsn't the average meteorologist south and let's be honest I mean what they are they're\nNot the vast majority meteorologist but before that\nUh I I you know and as I got older I would've loved to be a geologist I really would have loved to study volcanoes now I took I actually took geology geology course in college and I got a D in it and I had no interest in it at all not zero\nAnd I would love to do it today and I started thinking as I get older I'm thinking to myself\nWow what would I you know some of the things I Would have loved not I don't regret anything I Love the way I Love the way that my life has gone let's just make that clear but you start thinking some of the other things that I could love if I could you know that I really love if I could have a few lives\nAnd I thought to myself you know it's coming I'm thinking of geology and thinking of you know you know what they do in the weather channel and thinking you know nature and everything else and what did I Choose I sit in a box knife elated from nature with me [laughter] with you and and\nDisagree with it but ah he's not insane like they are

these yeah what are we got her cook okay we got we got him into that we've got a little over ... yes okay a\nTexas Senate okay we're New York times Kurz fifty two percent or forty three wow that that that that I think that's the widest margins so far of a poll I if I if I remember correctly Tennessee Blackburn fifty five percent\nRight on forty percent and Nevada\nOr Heller up over rows and so the Republican leader in that one too\nWell I'm\n... it's interesting to do the breakdown I guess of of how many seats the Republicans might gain and the Senate and what's happening in the house with some of those seats are still I think most are saying that the the Democrats have a good chance of gaining control but\nI'm Wondering what changes in the polls that are coming out right now and up to election day [noise] or just under four weeks away now [noise]\n\n\n\nAre that are up that means people are really motivated and very anxious chomping at the bit to get out and vote\nNow in the the the New York times poll I guess is still continuing their ... it's called the light pole or the one in Texas right so they they start doing it again tomorrow but as of right now and that's the one that had Ted Cruz up by nine now using cruise up consistently\nUh you know in their ... I I look I I still believe Texas is different animal and probably wouldn't be the same as as\nDouble figures yeah I think he would have always won by double figures irrespective of the cabin our race yeah I I just think Texas is a different animal than than other states are in the primary what have you might want\nTwenty sixteen he won the state um do you look at a also\nNow look there was a period or where especially right around the convention time [noise] plenty of people in the Republican Party didn't like Ted Cruz remember the uh there was he got he voted right and and the word from Capitol Hill I mean he was being demonized by fellow Republicans\nAre at one point so this is someone\nA Ted Cruz is someone who gets the benefit\nI think maybe a to a greater degree than than others\nOf the Republicans coming together after the capital thing when there's a juggling within the party than someone like Ted Cruz who's been criticized by his own party you know the then he's going to get he's going to get that bump a little bit more or the benefit of that a little bit more\nUh than than others might\nSo I I'm it'll be interesting I think to to really watch this next three weeks three and a half\nWell yeah and and ... house races we can't tell because there's the you'll you'll look at it in the polling or they don't do a lot of polls for a lot of these house races and so you really don't have an indication now I'm sure inside their campaign they do\nBecause they're doing the inside the inside polling but you you know that's one of the complaints you and I were having her and her Mitchell meeting there are a little while ago saying ... really can't tell because the no polls in three weeks so or no pay into we\nAt the toss ups the number of districts right now that are that are classified as toss ups\nAnd they're not doing they don't do polls on the house seats as often as they do for the Senate seats and I have to wonder what has changed after the Kavanaugh hearing and confirmation vote and I have to wonder again in those districts\nKeep in mind a number of those districts or the race is is on to fill a seat that someone has is leaving a Republican stepping out\nAh what does that mean is the makeup of that district changing and we look at Texas thirty two uh that is uh the uh Pete Sessions\nOr the the demographics in in his district are changing\nYou know um that's that's something that will change of politics and it's much of that district is uh I think in fact I think all of it as Dallas County and Dallas County has gone balloon and well\nGosh going back to a Obama in two thousand eight so for a decade\nOr Hillary won in fact that district or buy a point and a half I Believe it was\nA so we'll see what you know what that means for Pete Sessions as see right now is only a while and it was a poll in late September by one point but he's been you know he's been somebody who has been a strong contender\nAnd years ago you would think well that's not going to change it does change in those districts when the demographics change\nYou know one of the things and and again you look for any type of barometer out there to see if you know the whole cabinet thing had you know well what kind of ... it's going to have an impact it's what kind of an impact is going to have and and and uh I look at Montana for example in Jon Tester and I I guess Charlie\nThe in July was up by three ... and early September he was up by two by late September he was up\nBy four but that was latest poll ended nine twenty to write a at a up over Matt Rosendale the Republican challenger what happens in you know bad state as we get closer ah a Jon Tester has never been over fifty percent\nIn any of the the polling ah a he is he is just over\nThe margin of error you know just slightly over in in his in his I'm\nA ... for example he was a plus for and that was a margin of three point seven margin of error and he was up by three that was a margin of two so he's over but now it's\nA Senate race it listed as a toss up and the question is in a in a place like Montana\n\nWhere conservative politics still wins in the majority of Montana and\n\nAfter everything that we obscene and and not just cabinet but everything that's coming out now you know the Hillary videos getting played everywhere they you know and we play down yesterday show the comments\nI'm of the former attorney general mhm are being played you know a well if they go low will kick him from Eric Holder and they're being played or the you know CBS News story I mean even the mainstream media picking up that\nDemocrats have said they're not going to take the high road instability now is there a politics of choice by the way had Sarah Palin said if they go low will kick 'em\nOh it would be the number one story and the mainstream eating right so you you see\n... because it's not\nClaiming you're going to be you know uncivil claiming that\n... claiming as we said during the whole Kavanaugh thing 'cause this is what to me that was the big message it came out of it the ... the criticism that Democrats put on Republicans or anybody else that didn't agree with them is if you if you believe in the mindset of due process\nAnd a presumption of innocence urine and ... ... you weren't able or a rape is that's what you do mhm\nThat's the message that they set out I I ...\nIf that's a great selling point in America today than we certainly are doomed yep if that if you believe that gives you an advantage and it does in an election then you're right we're heading down the wrong path I mean we are doomed as we've always doing away with civility\nWins in America\nThat will prove may right eight six six Ninety red eye [laughter]\nThe Sixers

morning thanks for being here ah All right a hurricane Michael is now a tropical\nStorm Michael stole a over a Georgia affecting a very very wide area uh latest we had was a sixty mile an hour sustained winds but direct tropical storm now and I'll go it will be going up to South Carolina and a portions of central to a western and southern uh\nIt's as easy how fast that it will be moving in the coming days relatively speaking we're going to talk with a meteorologist Tom hale at the bottom of the hour and we'll get an update as to what to expect there\nIn the southeast ah with tropical storm Michael and Tom telling us earlier or that he believes it will go back out over water as a tropical storm still be a tropical storm\nI won't be remnants that won't fall apart or that means still plenty of damage to be done by Michael and people need to be aware of that are that are in the path skill\nOf Michael I Want to play this audio cut because it does acknowledge what many on the ride him said this was on MORNING Joe on MSNBC\n... and\nThis was about a Dianne Feinstein mhm and if this had happened if Diane Feinstein was a Republican won the media had done and in tents investigation\nEveryone and peppered if she was a Republican her with questions and used every single source they possibly could inside\nOf the Feinstein campaign to find out what happened\nSo far but he's just taking her word for it and this is what they talked about her and this is where I get we talk about the biased media\nSometimes it's not what they what they cover it's what they don't cover and here's part of this conversation a from a Morning Joe on remember MSNBC and against the Supreme Court nominee\nThat [noise] ah five\nAnd then on the other side and I'm Talking about the stories and follow Dr brown story which would have been much stronger if in her doctor for\nA story would have been much stronger if Dr Ford story would have stood alone instead of\nUnsubstantiated claims that followed the stream of them but also on the other side Mike let me ask you what New York times reporter what Washington Post reporter was assigned a story\nBy their editors to go see what really happened when Dianne Feinstein and Feinstein and her staff said the sort of questions that would have happened if the Republican Party had done the same thing not one and I and I challenge the New York times reporters this morning not reporters editors I challenge the Washington Post editors I challenged\nWall Street journal editors I challenge editors across America right that story what happened with Dr forms agreement\nThe Hollywood Reporter I mean most people aren't going to read it it really is for that thirty mile zone or most of the most don't even pay attention to it it's all about well [noise] reporting on Hollywood apparently and most people don't really care if they want to know the real Hollywood they go to the um the um\nBut then but [laughter] and and the or

Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety or right I coming up on the bottom of the hour we will talk to meteorologist\nOr a Tom hale in case you're just tuning in right now are waking up a hurricane Michael is now a tropical storm a latest update was so about an hour and a half ago from the national Hurricane Center and a sixty mile an hour winds tropical storm now sixty mile an hour sustained winds\nAnd heading toward South Carolina yeah we'll hear from Tom\nAnd the coming days or as are the people of Georgia right now are feeling the wrath of tropical storm Michael all the entire state basically covered by that storm massive massive footprint\nAlso coming up and say about uh apparently the or the FBI getting that man who was going to build a bomb for election day mhm and detonated in Washington it looks like they went to his house and found two hundred pounds you know found some kind of explosive device it was like two hundred pounds\nYou know uh you you go back to a day or two and listen to a Senator Rand Paul\nA talking about where the left is going and of course after his attacking knows all too well\nUh what people will do when they're politically motivated\nBut talks about the greater potential love and and he said is concerned that there will be an sat there might be an assassination or in another attempted assassination or we go back to the um uh the the the ball field shooting\nOf ...\nAnd how that wasn't as we pointed out yesterday a multiple assassination attempt that shooter was out to get as many members of Congress as he could on that day so it's a real threat here is your national forecast brought to buy video road log\nWill see the devastating effects of what hurricane Michael brought to when the sun comes up today but the system is still moving throughout the forecast area of southwest Georgia\nMost of South Carolina and below country of North Carolina today as well as portions of the tide water and Delmarva Peninsula will experience rain over the next twenty four hours or so only about two to four inches of rain however\nAs the system continues to move inland and lose that Gulf moisture source\nAnd we have a frontal boundary coming in and out of Canada that'll usher in some cooler drier air force\nEaster it will be jumping some snow you had to force in sort of rats and central Iowa south of that snow line will see the ads for heavy rain and thunderstorms today for eastern Kansas and western Missouri\nYour national forecaster Retta radio I'm meteorologists John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety right on\n\n\nAnd and so and the last nine something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said it well is it gonna kinda lose some power that comes into shore and\nAnd I and my immediate reaction was no no\n[laughter] yeah I don't yeah can you were right because I I'd asked that question which brings me to another question that is just to just personal interest to me\nAnd and that is when you get it from ... you know ... ... tornadoes hurricanes get their energy from the warm water right yes All right so do does that mean that a hurricane like this does it then does it as a result\nThat it's taking the energy from the water does the water actually cool down\nA yeah actually it does because what it does this causes up willing or which by the way has a very bad thing if you like oysters\nAnd [laughter] just letting you know [laughter] might not be\nGood or Easter season right I hate that came in in Nineteen eighty five was the last storm that hit this area of Florida and and and Kate came in hold onto your hat\nAt Mexico beach wow the same place wow\nThe oyster crop of the Appalachian bay um you know apt to watch Kobe Bryant area\nWhile while in terms of the life of Michael\nYou know from the time that it was officially a a tropical storm too you know looking at the forecast as you mentioned a back out over water in the Atlantic or is this going to be one of the longest living storms in terms of the the life this band the time that Michael is active\nUm no I don't think so you've you've stumped me on that one because we've got some that don't even make it here but for some reason they just spin around in the mid Atlantic right we're in the western Atlantic and so I've never I've never looked into that yeah\nYeah um it it just seems that a ... and you mentioned this earlier talking about you know we always often we'll talk about a storm the remnants of the remnants of and as you mentioned\nWe this we're not going to get to that point in terms of it being overland here we're not going to talk about the remnants of Michael it will be still tropical storm Michael overland\nIt is to Charlotte to Raleigh and\nNorfolk and that's where I Am concerned about a lot when it goes to know for that whole area up there the Hampton Roads area you know that area just floods [laughter] yeah and\nAnd so I mean we didn't talk about it a lot with Florence but it was flooding in Florence it was nothing compared to the flooding that was going on\nIn in in central North Carolina right and so it never really picked up any news but when this goes over there I think we're going to hear a lot more about the Virginia beach Norfolk\nAnd Hampton Roads area as it probably exits somewhere right in that area and heads out into the into the ocean and you know we haven't even touched on\nFrom power outages from Columbia pretty much all the way up to the uh uh Virginia border to at least to pass Wilmington and and just where you start to get into the outer banks islands I'm this is widespread power outages\nThen we also throw in here the tornadoes now the tornadoes are kind of different they are normally super cells so where you see the large cluster of thunderstorms which currently are moving their way across interstate twenty\nAre heading toward Colombia and going through Augusta well that's not the likely place where you've got the heavy rain it's where\nThe feeder bands that are probably fifty to a hundred miles further out where there's individual cells and as we start to get into the morning hours where\nWe'll have an an up tick in the ah what's called the low level jet stream and wins and we get a little sunshine we're going to see some uh some possible super cells develop along in those ... and\nI'm a John Trump touchdown and he said when you get the friction of the land and you get this massive fast rotating storm and it hits the land or it kind of drags the bottom it creates wind shear\nAnd so the the the ah tornadoes are typically week they're F zeroes an F ones\nAnd um and they're they're shallow they're short lived\nAnd um and they're commonly in the north east quadrant of the storm so if you cut the storm in four pieces you've got your your northeast your southeast you've got your south west northwest well the the the one that is closest to the ocean and the ...\nAnd so that's the other area where we're going to be watching now yesterday we had a three tornadoes reported two in Georgia one in Florida\nI'm a long and near highway Seventy five as the storm was moving its way through Panama City\nAnd northward toward Tallahassee inland and the main peninsula Florida that's where we saw those feeder bands coming in and we picked up the ... the tornado activity but as as this entire system moves forward we've got these threats one\nOr the winds are going to topple trees trees are going to topple power lines\nA power lines means widespread power outages over the central sections of the Carolinas and possibly into a southern Virginia than we have flooding\nAnd that flooding is going to be a long and through Fayetteville to the west as we get up into the hill country I call it\nA up the Raleigh and so forth that area is is is is perfect for flash flooding because there's all kinds of hills ... ravines and so forth hollers and that all creates its own issues the flash flooding and it doesn't take a lot of rain considering all of a soaking it has had\nAnd and then beyond the tree toppling the power outages and the tornados that that we have with this thing um you know it's a it's a pretty complete storm and it it has enough energy to maintain itself as a tropical storm until it gets out of here leaving Virginia Beach and heading for the are\nHeading for the other side of the pond wow\nWow just incredible energy behind the storm and of course ah just unbelievable devastation in the wake of Michael and and much of that will still have\nTook a and I were just looking at at one website uh and and the power outages here reporting in the hundreds of thousands of course of costs seven hundred yeah uh uh being affected here and they they said it for some of them it could be weeks\nUh I I remember my ah my brother being affected they got to higher ground from their storm there on the Gulf Coast of Texas\nA and they went in they went inland but uh they couldn't go home for her it was a couple of weeks just for them and that storm was into the size and an intensity that Michael was\nAnd so it could be weeks and weeks before some of these customers have a power again like coming up here and just a little while we're going to get back with your Tom\nWe appreciate your time and we'll talk more about what to expect from tropical storm Michael at the bottom of the next hour thank Utah looking forward to our meteorologist Tom hale with us this morning and he'll be with us\nAh each hour at the bottom of the hour just to kind of recap what ah what happened with

parts of southeastern Virginia before it heads off\nOr in the Atlantic but ah as a Tom and both the John ... told us earlier a ... and and they predicted this was a storm that was going to stay

uh I guess central northern part of the Atlantic and there's still enough heat to keep that together all the way across the big pond which by the way it'll it'll reach you know near Ireland in Great

written the wall Street Journal and said investors really weren't surprised by this and I'm thinking okay well I don't put myself in their category\nBut just looking at everything that's that that has been going on things you know little signs out there that you and I've talked about when you see the bond yields and you see what\nYou know treasury bills we just happen to be talking about that last night right and and we were looking at at at how the the interest rates on treasury bills for the most part has doubled in a year that's just in a year\nIt has doubled that you know\nThat means there's more money that the government has to pay out just a four in ... she got the fed now are wanting to uh raise rates the story was out or did we do this on the air off the air about\nUh that uh because uh ... well we did it on their mortgages were going up and spend a lot of time on it but a mortgage rates now up over five percent which means uh the price of housing\nOr could be coming down to you know to make up for the uh the higher rates unless Eric's idea of the one hundred and twenty year mortgage comes along yeah you're\nKidding me I mean if they're doing that for if they're doing the what is it I think you can get a loan for Ninety six months what is it uh it's it's I Know it's well into the eighty a month cycle we're loan for automobiles or is it going to do that then you get the hundred and twenty year mortgage\n[laughter] well if they had only right away I mean we were talking about the ridiculous\nWell what you have here is you know uh the basically the fed going in and the the point Kramer was making is that\nIt was not Jim Kramer at CNBC in the street dot com was that he wants a more regimented and he wants them to do the homework on the economy he feels that the fed is not doing their homework and they should review the data because\nTo his point what do we know about the fallout from terrorists what do we know about a\nLong term effect uh you know you have ...

I was asking you the question kind of put you on the spot last last hour but you you actually answered it on the spot very well and and were corrected generally speaking talking about the longest lasting\nA hurricane and and I found a little data their weather dot com about ah this would be a hurricane John back in Nineteen Ninety four which had a a thirty day run a this thing traveled nearly eighty two hundred miles and all out in the Pacific\nA effect in Hawaii but then kept going and but ah roughly a thirty day run but I mean if you\nTypically and very often we see a that a storm or or hurricane starts to fall apart overland and then we we hear words like the remnants of but there are no remnants and again this is a well formed tropical storm or that is traveling ah right now headed for the Carolinas and wreaking havoc\nOn on Georgia and uh and then we'll go back out over the ocean ah we also\nWant to go or you name it extra tropical once it goes out over the ocean\n... okay and you know and right\nIs it's it's no longer in the it's no longer a tropical storm in the tropical zones or so forth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regained power and that regain power is considered extra tropical but it's ... you're right in in nailing it here [noise]\nThe it it may not be the\nThirty day storm that meanders out there and\nBecause it's making good time but it's definitely covering a lot of terrain\nIt really is traveling in the end and speaking of traveling up for those professional drivers out there\nAnd the high profile trucks I Know that ah that ah John trout mentioned this earlier it bears repeating for those truck drivers that are and they know if there are seasoned driver they know\nThat those those are the those sustained wins a of whether it's hurricane force even tropical storm force\nCan turn one of those trucks over that can happen very easily and we're not even talking about the gusts or as you mentioned the the threat of the tornadoes there those sustained winds at forty forty five miles an hour or can wreak havoc on those high profile vehicles there along Ninety five\nAnd as you mentioned we're going to see kind of that route over the next day or so uh with with Michael it will kind of plug I guess a Ninety five in a way a so those traveling along Ninety five need to be aware of that\nSome degree they are going to have the stuff that they're back the wins and so that the probably my biggest concern would be three eighty five or twenty\nUh although right now it's moving across twenty with very heavy rain in Augusta\nAnd but there are a number of those roads forty as another one going up into Raleigh Durham right Seventy four that comes out of Wilmington heads to Charlotte every one of those crossroads the ... I don't have a number four but the one from Wilmington\nThat that goes into Seventy seven through Florence all of those east west roads are going to have cross wins\nRight yes Tom where does this go on the record books\nUh it goes in the record books as the number three a storm to hit the United states while a and it it and it goes in the record book primarily because of intensity or low pressure at at nine Nineteen Mila bars\nUm just beyond that position number four in the record book happens to be Katrina\nSurprisingly enough and then behind that cat five Andrew is number five in the record book but what I found really intriguing and we talked about this yesterday about continuing to grow as it moved its way ensure\nThe atmosphere was perfect not\nIn the last hour it dropped from nine twenty two to\nNine Nineteen it was deepening and intensifying even as it was starting to come on shore wow I haven't seen that that I haven't seen that much of a change to begin with a three meal a bar drop\n'em and at the same time it went from one hundred and fifty\n[laughter] what are the higher up out of [laughter] a hundred and\nFifty yeah while and then it jumped to a hundred and fifty

you you're you're also talking about the debris\nAnd the need for the access to those areas are by those ah crews that will be I'm taking that debris out of that area uh the cleanup efforts\nAre going to require you know uh the end of the power restoration and everything else will require that that I'm a those roadways and and if I remember my brother here in Texas\nA from one of our recent storms he went in ah he he traveled inland with his wife but it was a couple of weeks before they could go\nA which which went out of course with the power or and so uh they they they were in contact with neighbors and and everything else that had gone back a few days before them and that's that's kind of how they knew\nA it was clear and and they were ready to go go back home uh uh I don't and we don't know about the the public schools in those areas but as you can imagine\nA they're likely going to be closed for a number of days or we don't know the damage of any of those schools are specifically but certainly it is going to be tough to to get kids to school impossible to get kids to school\nIn some cases so a number of things working against that idea of going back home I Can't imagine that um anxiety of of if you evacuated the area not knowing what the damage has been to your home\nUm my brother was able to assess it from afar but again they're storm was nothing like hurricane Michael now a tropical storm in fact we got the update or here at the top of the hour you were saying sustained winds where now it's at\nA down to ah fifty miles an hour and and ah Tom wanted to let us know that uh he hit it on the\nButton he did it on the button the we had our last hour uh he we expected it to diminish and he said yeah somewhere around fifty or he thinks it would it be fifty miles an hour and he of course I was spot on with that a sustained winds of fifty miles an hour very dangerous\nWell and and and I think the president was right to call out Saudi Arabia\nAnd and talk yeah I Know what they have been able to because they basically are now that I mean they and they have been for a long time they are OPEC if you if you talk about the\nYou know the controller inside the OPEC member nations it's Saudis and so they're talking about them increasing you know and and uh or in their case they had been up to now decree\nRate here in the U.S\nIs threatening to them and so they want to\nAh basically slow production to control the costs they do that and the global costs start to rise by the way another benefit to greater domestic production\nBecause when when we get to the point that we are producing as much as we consume every day as a nation than you ... you will look at the dynamics of a market and the Saudis and Iran and anyone else but I don't have that behind it\nBut at the store and we brought you last week because of President Trump mhm are they are opening up the spigot yes and exactly in Saudi Arabia\nAnd ... which is what he wanted them to do and and and that's you know for right now because the way what we're producing and how much we're producing ah we're not at that rate of Eighteen to Nineteen million

areas are going to get\nA on the west side of Ninety five back up to eighty five which comes out of Charlotte and around by forty that's up near drum that area it could be picking up five\nInches of rain there'll be some isolated spots running up through Raleigh and so forth could pick up as much as eight inches of rain but we've already had a few places pick up two to four to five inches of rain Atlanta\nOr you wouldn't think but uh and Lana is already over a two point eight inches of rain from this round so and they're they're out of the target zone and so when you start to come into to Charlotte\nAnd the the path of this storm\nAnd by the time we make it to the middle of the day it'll be south of Charlotte and in between Charlotte and ah Wilmington and then it'll be between Raleigh by afternoon and tonight this thing is going to be near a nor folk and the Hamptons or\nHampton Roads in Virginia Beach and uh as I pointed out before\nUm Hampton Roads is sea level or in some places below sea level a it's kind of like the New Orleans of ah the east coast and and that area there's neighborhoods there that just\nAre borderline flooding all the time and so when this hits that area they're going to have some very serious flooding issues as well and so this is a this is a\nBig storm I mean you can throw in on the side or the strong winds forty mile an hour winds let's say forty five mile an hour\nA wins sustained or go see the way that can be toppling trees because the ground saturated you could throw in a few tornadoes just for fun and um\nWhere they even stronger isolated wins um but this is a storm to be reckoned with a even including a sea rise along the outer banks not counting or a high tide of two to four feet right from okra coke to duck ... so while\nIt all points that flooding and power outages are the major two issues that we have to deal with with a few isolated scary moments from tornadoes\nRight or were they in high tide there in Florida uh as as Michael came ashore yesterday\n[noise] you know I'm not sure I didn't check that\nI heard that but I I did not follow up on that someone had said that it it it makes it worse than it was in a ... than it was high tide at that at that point but I I don't know about that timing if that helps\nWas coming off high tide ... ... and and if you if you've noticed in the last two hours everything got real intense in the last hour yeah yeah actually the very last one hour like we talked about right everything just went ... boy it's getting bad fast yeah\nI'm I noticed that a step in the Abrams a shout out to one great meteorologist I'm Stephanie was staying in a\nPort St John and that's where her crew in our team was and and each one of the\nReporters is responsible for as cheap as the met over the team is responsible for their safety but she apparently they weren't staying at a hotel they were staying with some kind of family or maybe a bed and breakfast or something like that and they couldn't get them to evacuate\nWow and so and so you mentioned you mentioned it earlier in the beginning of the show that\nThat you know a ... made the suggestion you don't get the heck out of here and ready to get where because we know where this is going to land and you also mentioned that the guidance show five days out that [noise] wow it it nailed it yeah\nYeah poor ... right yeah yeah the path that half of where it was going to where it was possibly going to hit at five days out and Florence was two miles off the target at five days out ... ... has done heard of\nYeah Florence and and and all of us meteorologist got goose bumps only heard this yeah and but there's there's there's some things that are going on in giant data processing\nWhen it comes to our models and our satellite imagery which has changed the way we forecast hurricanes water vapor imagery which allows us to see the exact point where the center is\nWe have some computer models in the mid west that forecast over in Eighteen hour period of time\nWhere there are going to be outbreaks of severe thunderstorms and potentially knowing the conditions we can tell if it's just going to be a thunderstorm if we have all the conditions favorable for tornadoes and and these models will pinpoint some things and I recall\nMay ninth two thousand sixteen pinpointed a little area\nI'm up near Duncan, Oklahoma and sure enough a that was five or six hours out\nA thunderstorm developed right in that little area continued to grow and turned into what was a became what was called the when he would tornado or that came rolling across interstate thirty five right a south appalls valley um and so the accuracy justice downs me\nHe's getting and like ... like over the last the accuracy now compared to ten or Fifteen Years ago\nSeven ... seven all over the last ... last seven years so\nUh the the H H triple our model is what we call it that was an experimental model and that was experimental seven years ago even five years ago but as we started to use it because they put it out and let all of his shoes it we realized and grew incompetence of that model being crushing only accurate\nAnd and so you see a lot of TV stations with the weather models that are called future cast and so forth these is a handful of private companies IBM included the owns the weather company\nOr not the weather channel they actually have their own proprietary model accuweather has its own proprietary model enterprise ah barons has its own proprietary models and then of course there's the government models\nIt's at but we're getting ... very very accurate and being able to forecast little whirlpool and the atmosphere which creates circulation lift and the potential for storms well\nThat's always an odd thing and\nAnd just amazing to watch it happened but again we go back to you know the basis of of why people do what they do and and why meteorologist or a ... like you mentioned earlier and yesterday talking about the you know the the idea of being able to warn people and if we can learn and the technology gets better\nThan obviously in future storms there is a greater warning which means a greater survive ability\nOf those storms so Tom we just want to thank you so much like a and you answered all my questions\nI got so many so many things you are a yeah yeah it's all about us we really you know but ... if you knew that coming into this one [laughter] oh they told you that [laughter] but uh you know\nHurricane Florence and and ... and uh and and everything you've done for re read I Am and the listeners out there really\nAre working for the Republican and getting the word out and and really breaking down what these storms mean and the danger behind such storms\nOr it has definitely been a pleasure and I will just say this I Hope we don't talk to you for a long long yeah [laughter] but I I Know I Know we will and uh and and we definitely will uh put your back to work here at about ...

from getting to the space station it was not an explosion and they were able to um separate from the third stage of the missile\nAnd were able to deploy their parachute and parachute back to earth but it was kind of funny not funny ha ha obviously\nI've watched the news anchor see the film and it was the first time that the news anchor realized that in the soil use space craft that they land on the

came down they landed in a very desolate area it's I guess like Siberia kind of thing yeah I've seen pictures of it yeah and\nUm there are medical crews on the scene there are emergency workers on the same way I've not heard anything negative about the health conditions of either the astronaut or the cars run out\nAnd we will keep you up to date they landed in a place called biking or ...\nAnd um basically it seems like\nWhat happened was the second stage did not fire but they were able to separate from the third stage\nAnd basically toss off all the garbage and go into a normal deployment

this dysfunction and this cast and there was this and they have struck that the Democrats are putting forward we like what Republicans are getting done three point seven percent unemployment the lowest since they put a man on the men and the numbers are being backed up by high\nFundraising dollars a small online donors they really are energized to win the majorities keep those majorities in

when it comes to a\nAbuse or I'm not saying if it's right or wrong I'm\nJust no no and I'm not having a real yes and I'm not saying I'm not putting the ah I'm not making passing judgment on it although I think everybody pretty much knows my feelings on it but\nI don't think there's a preponderance of women who happened to be Democrats more more abused or assaulted than there are\nWhen there aren't but what this is about is getting fifty one percent of the women voters mhm just say yes to the Republican candidate and that's how they can save the house\nAgainst each other to do the army is

storms and I think that ah you know they typically done a great job but I Know they're all hands on deck right now\nBecause this was not a storm a week ago people were really paying attention to even the even three or four days ago we knew that something was happening\nBut the fact that it matured so quickly into a category for I\nMean there was a law that's been done the whole life I think for\nYou know how many people didn't have the calls to evacuate and or were they able to hunker down safely or not and so I Know those first responders are going to be on the scene in Panama City beach in elsewhere in China\nA lot of key issues they'll say oh well all you knew was doing some blondes\nAnd then if you knew anything that that's a little bit different I was like oh my gosh are

deliver Florida is you know I have a positive relationship with the president to people in the ministry and\nFlorida has a lot of nice from our military for friends or transportation our water resources which have been a big problem here and we need to work constructively what the federal government\nI also think that something has to come over that's right we're seeing more and more of these kinds of storms that are doing tremendous water damage from flooding\nI think ... ... or federal government can impose upon insurance companies who are you sure it was okay start including flood insurance\nAs part of the coverage automatically I Know it doesn't pertain to a lot of states I mean for instance\nWhen you when I Lived in the northern Nevada was there was no way in the world like

asked if he wants that pasture out of turkey as well so the relationship with turkey is also tense right now to think about this story number one is a journalist is operating freely in America I think just should be a lesson to all journalists and all consumers of news there are so many people here stateside\nThat complain about the treatment of journalists you want to know what when bad treatment of journalist says go anywhere else other than America and that's what you're going to experience I mean it's interesting that this happened in Turkey one of the\nPlaces that has the most journalists in prison than anywhere else in the world and yet this is this you know the Turks\nAre coming on and saying you know the Turkish government's coming on and and trying to take a stand because they're they're not happy with\nSaudi Arabia so there's a lot of different undercurrents here I don't know how big of a stand the president can take on this issue I mean obviously clearly it's bad I mean what happened to this journalists you see some of the graphic reports it's frightening\nUm but there's a lot I mean there's just a lot ten packed are really looking forward to your conversation with Senator Corker I just don't I don't know what the I don't know what the right college for the president I think it it offers a lot of perspective for those of us who value freedom and the press and really\nWant other journalists to be able to operate freely so we can all have an idea of what's accurately happening in the far flung places of the world I mean we really important for I Would assume you're ... you're right\nWe have a ... you know one of the big stories that was sort of I mean because it's listen it's not the most exciting has been about ... you know gas prices\nThis is an interesting fact right every recession in the last five recessions has been\nCreated with a spike in oil prices sitting there you know you see what's happening with the markets and see what's happening with stocks and questions about interest rates and inflation oil as part of that so we're really taking a look at that and the president had an interesting announcement about wanting to make the fuel that's more mixed with ethanol corn byproduct\nAvailable year round and they're you know there's a lot of strong feelings about that it can actually damage your car Brian I don't know if you knew that but some cars can actually take that blends [noise]\nAnd um so it's really it's kind of I think that this story that's happening with fuel and the economy is a really big one it's one that we're really covering this week on smart and he's because it affects every part\nOf our life even if you don't drive so that's definitely one of our watching\nYeah and we'll see what's going on or economy's doing good tank yesterday losing eight hundred point to say because the bed raise interest rates 'cause every little panicky but it's weird to help you you are as an economy the more the interest rates go up ... to go down\nThat makes people nervous 'cause it's\nIt's a way that makes them more expensive for us to borrow money you know but let's see it's hard to watch the markets is every every other day you know you got to take it in a month period and see what's happening\nBut it definitely scared that people and when people start throwing around the world word recession I think we have to be careful you have to do it responsibly and we were nowhere clear that near that were near full employment but you know we've been on a ride for a little while everyone's wondering when\nThey'll be a little bit of a breather and I think that that's a fair question to to be\nDo Kanye West is going to lunch with Jim Brown and the president do do do a prominent African American want to detain bleed activists who was the president's agenda should be or who should be their agenda and there were two black communities agenda on looking back\nAt a at the black vote over the last three ... three Republicans all are under twenty percent McCain Romney in Trump and now the three ...\nThere's actually read the sleeves Nineteen sixties had the black vote up until Nineteen sixty\nI think when it comes to vote for anyone and whether you're talking about black voters women voters Hispanic voters I think there's a tendency to to try to think about all of them at the you know\n... these very specific groups that have very specific needs and and a lot of ways divide all of us I think there's some very you know there's some interesting analysis when you've got to dig into the way people registered to vote and whether or not\nThey vote but at the end of the day I think it's really about the economy for everyone and I'll be really curious what the what the um the results in the mid term election are when it comes to different categories based on ethnicity and then moving forward I just\nI I tend to believe that people are kind of affected equally when it comes to some of these major issues with the economy like ... you know can I get a job\nCan I take care of my kids and am I safe and those are really basic questions that everyone has answered so\nYou know I I don't I think all of that can change is it a long way of saying short short answer I think all of it's going to be changing and I don't think I'm just like we've seen as you point out in history different parties of represented different platforms\nI just don't think anyone's dependable every party should be fighting for a vote and they should not take anything for granted\n... would we are so how do

I don't mind you starting their conversation me going I was talking to Brian on the radio with that so I can tell me on the radio you as we use my wife and I don't want them to use I think it's like someone other Brian right like I don't know who else would I possibly be a pretty much don't even need a good idea actually because the electoral college one is about something that\nPeople talk about but they don't have a lot of they don't have a lot of the statistics behind them on the history behind them so that's what I tried to do with that and voter suppression and the issue of it I'll do that next week\nSo there's a big story out today people were making a big deal of Eric Holder saying what he should on top of would Hillary Clinton said there's no time for civility basically as long as we keep losing your lecture and until we get the house or the Senate [noise] so do you have a problem with this\nJust turned ... Democrats [noise] to be as tough as they are going to be an\nNo\nThey go low we\n\nGot this new democratic warnings about the president on boxing brands said this\nYou'd better be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's we're going to discuss things safe for them to make for him to make a statement of like that is a very dangerous state but you know they talk about\nUs we are exactly opposite you know the rally is where they send people I I heard somebody yesterday on your show actually talking about my rallies\nThat my rallies or really calm and and will run and and packed with people we don't have problems that arose and I would say this but it wasn't so successful for those protesters but they have to be careful with the rhetoric because it's very dangerous what older shows\nSo I ... and he says I'm totally blowing out of proportion that it is not a big deal with Eric Holder said Dana Perino way and you could\nServer I I'm ... and and looking at it so regardless of what I think Michelle Obama didn't like it right he was using her language and she said no no no that's not that's not what I meant that's not that's not what I'm born she's trying to be\nThe leader that she wants to be and that she would like to have for the country I oh I didn't know that Michelle Obama weighed in on whatever and yeah and I only thought on Twitter so I didn't say a lot but she was basically like oh now\nThat's not that's not where I Am I'm however I also think that there is a way you can blow things out of proportion for example when at all of the rallies Trump starts to chant lock her up or or somebody starts at lock her up and and not that the president does it but\nAnd it's it's a a laugh line look if you look at what Eric Holder's doing he was trying to rally up a crowd small crowd and a little room but they all laughed and so I can I I don't want to blow anything out of proportion\n... people and say nothing happened no but they're actually harassing people so for me when it turned goes from words ... that's a huge\nHuge concern so everybody's talking about a disposition which has got a new procedure because of prison United States or put them on the nurse who Security Council\nThe Mets who's open chair now ... at the un and a lot of people have their candidate you I mean we've heard or Ryan Zinke he was in the air for for an interview uh people are brought up senator Ayotte I've thought Joe Lieberman might be fined for this\nBut also the leading candidate he just thought to be Dina Powell aren't you you would deal with Tucker Carlson said last night about due to pow\nPow seems like a nice person lots of people like her is she the right person for the job that's the question\nWell she's worked on behalf of virtually every idea that President Trump ran against in his two thousand sixteen campaign Trump he remembers that it was time for America to act on its own behalf for one's internationally and to avoid pointless and counter productive wars ... they are not\nBefore joining the Trump Administration she was a partner and Goldman Sachs she was president of the Goldman Sachs foundation that the nonprofit arm of the investment fact while they're short extensively with another ... famous foundation the Clinton Foundation and they work together on various goals that most Trump voters would find repugnant\nShow me your thoughts on this well so um\nI I get I'm agnostic as to who the president supports um I hadn't heard that Joe Lieberman one that's interesting but I think the president is going to want some of that he knows and trust that is really important to him\nThat the Ryan Zinke he uh pick would make sense to me Dina power for him and I think that ... that he just had something wrong here like she didn't work for the Clinton Foundation and actually the program that she worked on she created what's called ten thousand women and it was a way to help\nYoung women entrepreneurs from around the world to figure out a way to become entrepreneur self sufficient\nSecurity Council actually wrote President Trump's national security strategy when that document came out it was widely praised by most except for on the far left and one of the things that she focused on most is or what the president is concerned about and because I watched Tucker I Know he's concerned about the number one enemy the United states identified as China\nAnd not the middle east um she was and not rush and she was really strong about pulling out of the Iran deal right supported the president on that so I think that um criticism about her on those things are probably a probably on this kind of put way back when when I first met her she worked for Newt Gingrich wow uh\nI Do get to be the main thing saying that she would be the best person for that job so and I don't think it's it's a it's it's I I don't think it's a small back to the Nikki Haley was woman and I think that he could have more women and more minorities in his\nCat he knows her and she's worked for him on foreign policy\nAnd so he could trust her right now I think that that's really important I don't think that he could go with like a as an outsider like a Joe Lieberman because or even Kelly Ayotte who I think you know because of the Gorsuch shepherding during the Supreme Court nomination but doesn't know her as well as he would know Edina pal he used to brief him every day well and\nBy the way Kelly Ayotte at first after the Access Hollywood tape came out and she says I Would not want him as a role model yeah I Know he got over the Nikki Haley snow but maybe that might be an issue I Hope it's not meanwhile about your issue about Mrs Obama coming out you're a hundred percent right the Daily Caller right to take the cold from their\nMoves Obama said she stands by her motto and things holders alternative is not a proper message for children absolutely here's a quote beer is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think about how you want your kids to be raised\nI Want them to think about life in their opportunities do you want them to be a breed of their neighbors do you want them angry do you want them vengeful which model do you want them to live by and I have to think about\nA ... a review of the comments but the thing is Brian\n... the Democrats are just they're so frustrated because they can't find a message that's working they're always on defense and the base the progressive base things that they're not fighting enough they think they should be more cynical meaner and it's not a great way to win elections even though they might be able to win back the\nHouse I don't think it's at them up while the wind back the Senate and I think they're in a real deficit going into twenty twenty\nSo a Bob Corker who's juice on and I never even though he's always been pretty candid especially now that he's leaving he came out and said that he was offered a few weeks ago a opportunity to join the Trump Administration I Want to share the soundbite with the ... and would you ever except for the Trump Administration\n[noise] you know who knows um\nUh you know they they discuss something with my three or four months ago and [noise] and uh it was a it was a you know certainly an honor um it wasn't a particularly tough assignment and you know as you know I mean yes of to me this is all about public service if the white\nTough assignment came up where you felt like you were making a difference or certainly I Would never say never\n[laughter] kind of interesting right I didn't I didn't know that um I liked the idea of people who want to continue to serve in some capacity\nEven Nikki Haley the other day when she resigned said oh I'm going to be a part of something I don't know what it is it sounds to me like Bob Corker thing I'm I'm willing to do something but I Need something more challenge of a bigger town I don't know what that would mean to him you know they have some of these special on boys\nThat are working internationally on the on some big issues that might be something that he would be interested in I don't necessarily think he's thinking cabinet secretary that might be a little hard for the Trump Administration to swallow but no never say never say never\nAnd you I I again he they said that he is just as tall as a president he's got a difference\nAnd then when he was clashing with the president they said don't look at the fact that he shorter and calmer and think these are just as tough and you get that idea to do something to get him out\n[noise]\nI'm Scott ... search and rescue efforts are now underway and Florida day after hurricane Michael slammed into that states panhandle governor Rick Scott will be

yesterday [noise]\nJust briefly but ladies and gentleman you need to understand what's happening here they're they're truly is a concerted effort to transform America that's what Brock Obama promised voters he was going to do back in two thousand seven fundamentally transform America [noise]\nAnd I think we have to understand something here what was the ultimate goal the ultimate goal and twenty sixteen and the the basic train of thought was that Hillary Clinton was going to be in the White House [noise]\nAnd when Donald Trump won the presidency when all of you people out there the the silent majority that's what they call you folks the the gun toting Bible clinging deplorable when all of you people rose up and you said with one voice enough\nWe're not going to allow our nation to be take

use\nAs it happened as it hadn't gone [noise]\nHi this is Todd ... you're listening to your home for Ghana horse in the White House\nRight I welcome back to the program ladies and gentlemen a lot of controversy over deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein or you might remember a couple of weeks ago and I we've been knee deep and capital coverage\nBy jump up for a few weeks ago there were reports out that Rod Rosenstein was trying to rally members of the president's cabinet to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and apparently Rosenstein was or even at some point\nUm allegedly joked about wearing a wire\nBut we we and we we say allegedly because we don't know all all the news make her line or good friend congressman Mark Meadows or the chairman of the house Freedom Caucus and congressman meadows I'm first welcome to the show and you've got some questions or that you want to ask Rod Rosenstein welcome to the show\nWell taught it's great to be back with you know obviously it's always great to be with you and your listeners 'cause you're hitting you well you're over the target in a ... year hitting the bulls eye each and every day so it's always great to be\nIs he planning to tape the president of the United states did he in fact\nHave conversations with other people we have a witnesses that would indicate that that was the case in that it was not a joke according to them up but I you you are right to say allegedly because we've got to give Rod Rosenstein is his chance to come before Congress and clear his name\nA sadly that's not going to happen today\nThere's there's a lot of confusion about all of this I'm a Fox News dot com has a report out that the former uh FBI general counsel James Baker told investigators ah that that Rosenstein was serious about ... what can you can you give us any um any insight into this shed some light on it\n[noise] well I Am I've been reluctant to give any real details but I think the report that you're talking about is one that I read a from Catherine heritage wanting to your colleagues and and indeed a here's what I Would say she is an excellent reporter\nI've never known her to not report the facts and and her reporting seems to be consistent with some of the testimony that we heard in a private confidential setting\nSo I Want to read this statement from Catherine zeta report and I want to get your reaction to it a Baker a further Baker told congressional investigators he suspected Rosenstein was coordinating with two people and the administration to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment is that is true what needs to happen\nWell if if that indeed is is true Rod Rosenstein needs to resign I mean quite frankly if he's having substantial and meaningful conversations with colleagues within the cabinet\nOr and and he believes and he is now said he's contradicted that he says he's never said that in or believed it ah but if\nThis is a this is an individual that actually serves at the pleasure of the president of the United states and he should indeed a resign if that indeed the case\nAnd yet the White House so it it seems like the White House is is pushing back a little bit here and they seemed to at least publicly they're they're saying that they they believe he was just joking that it was it that that Rosenstein was was not serious way what's going on there do you have any insight there\nWell I I I Do have some insight obviously I don't ever share my conversations that I have ah with the president and all this particular case I've tried to make sure that there's a wall between the administration and the executive branch in the legislative branch but here's what I Will say\nAh there's no one who is red and more pages\nOf what has gone on and not gone on a in a classified setting then and then\nUh my staff and and me personally\nAnd I can tell you that as you start to research this\nOr to suggest that it is just a joke or that it is not a big deal um is is the president being very measured and his response I think part of it as he gets criticized for\nWell you're trying to interfere with the Mueller investigation near trying to to you know put your hand on the scales of justice and I can tell you that that's not the case I consistently this president has said\nHe wants transparency but I can tell you that uh I I've read too many documents that would let me know\nThat there is something rotten still at the department of justice and something that must be cleaned out and\nUntil we get to the bottom of it um you know justice will not actually be the priority for the department\nAnd look I'm with the president here on the president's he's surprised um that uh that Rod Rosenstein will\nI Would not do that congressman\nWell it's not puzzling as much as it is a it it's suggest that rod has something to hide\nAnd [laughter] and if he's not willing to come voluntarily before Congress then he will be can tell that come before Congress\nAnd it's even more than that when he went through the confirmation hearing\nAnybody that goes through the confirmation hearing in the Senate they have to agree to one set of rules and that says that if there is oversight inquiries on behalf of Congress or will you be willing to cooperate\nAnd assist with that oversight\nThe answer is always yes because if not they don't get confirmed so not only is he a ... uh the the desires of chairman Goodlatte to come before Congress but he's going against his own confirmation hearing and we need to make sure that we get to the bottom of\nCongressmen are real quick I I'd like for you to weigh in on some comments a former attorney general Eric Holder made yesterday um he says when the Republicans when they go low we kick them\nJust again just another high profile Democrat that is is basically unleashing this mob on Republicans in specifically Trump's supporters\nWell I it's very\nDisappointing that Eric Holder would change the the monitor originally is when you know ah\nAh when we go low we we go high and now they found that indeed they never did go hide they've always been one that has tried to make sure that it is tit for tat and and here's where we are\nIt is time that we have civil discourse I've got a lot of friends on the other side of the aisle you know Republicans Democrats unaffiliated that truly need to have civil discourse we need to make sure that that happens but to suggest that\nSecond congressmen are they're Democrats on the other side that that are like minded that that that understand that we're heading towards a dangerous path here\n[noise] well I think there are there's a couple of them are ... that I honestly have started to speak out most of them are afraid to do that they're afraid they'll get primary to buy more radical left\nA but it's time that we come together as a nation and make sure that uh it is civil and and the way that we change ideas\nAre well said congressmen we're gonna have to leave it there as always we uh we appreciate you coming on the program\nGreat to be with you to take care of God Bless\nSorry congressman Mark Meadows ladies and gentleman chairman of the house Freedom Caucus a given us some insight into Rod Rosenstein he is refusing to appear on Capitol Hill to testify under oath um congressmen meadows and congressman Jim\nJordan had been demanding that he explain himself in regards to invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment\nWhat Rosenstein doesn't want to do that why do you think that is ladies and gentlemen AAA seven eight nine nine one zero is our telephone number that's AAA seven eight nine nine one zero the website again Todd storage dot com we'll be right back stick around everybody [noise]\n[noise]\nUm [noise]\nUntil they decide that they're going to tell the

for what you care about we're not going to let these people go through life on skates Sarah Huckabee has no right to live a life of no fuss no must after lying to them\nYeah a life sentence again ladies and gentlemen I said this up the at the at the started this program they don't want to just ... they want to destroy you I mean this is on the herd up\nAnd there's got to be somebody ... there's got to be at least one scene voiceover left who can stand up and say you know what enough is enough for your folks we don't really want this kind of a country [noise] here's Michelle Obama what'd you say\nHere is is not a [noise]\nIt's it's not a proper motivator\nUm and if you think about how you want your kids to be raised\nHow you want them to think about life in their opportunities do you want them afraid of their neighbors do you want them angry they want them vengeful\nWe want them to grow up with promise\nAnd ... model something different if we want them to be better than that yeah\nWell you know what she needs to talk to her husband and maybe they ought to have a little heart to heart and maybe he could be maybe he could be the one that would stand up and say yeah you got to tone it down\nBut you know what he's not going to do that because he's a community organizer in his heart apart but rock Obama loves this kind of stuff he loves it when people get out there and they caused all this chaos out there on the streets\nBecause that's what he used to do that's how we use to earn a paycheck he was a community organizer solar Donald Trump was asked about this the president was asked about this on Fox and friends is\nBetter be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you he's better be careful what he's we're going to discuss things safe and for him to make for him to make a statement of like that is a very dangerous day for you know they talk about us we are exactly opposite\nAnd my rallies or really calm and and well run and and packed with people we don't have problems that arise and I would say this that it wasn't so successful for those protesters but they have to be careful with the rhetoric because it's very dangerous what holder says\nWell it is very dangerous what do you think he means what do you think Eric Holder means when when they go low we kept them does that sound like a an does that sound like a call to violence to you because it sure sounds like one to me Lindsey Graham\nKeep it up keep it up Mr ... keep saying that you're going to you know you keep doing what you do and see how the American people like this this is the number one issue I think for American November Dina agree with what they did to Brett Kavanaugh I Do believe that what they did was okay and you think believe it was okay but Democrat if he thought it was despicable boat for us\nAnd again what else did they what else did they go after they went after due process the rule of law they said you know what no no no it's not innocent until proven guilty it's now guilty until proven innocent I mean you could literally somebody could walk up to you on the street and said you know what\nYou're a sexual predator now prove you're not that's what the Democrats want that's the kind of society that's the kind of legal system the Democrats want it's unbelievable Newt Gingrich Newt Gingrich hit a home run\nHe was talking about this issue and I think that what you want to listen to do\nI mean we see in the emergency room and very weird way brown sugar party\nOr to use the term for the people who in Weimar, Germany went out and literally dominant industries brute force\nOf the can't when they didn't win the Senate they didn't win the presidency\nIn my judgment are not going to win on election day and they're becoming more hysterical\nMore anti democratic\nHere in New York tap in New York the guy was building at two hundred pound bomb he wanted to explode that bomb on election day and the nation's capital\nAnd the reason why is because of his political viewpoints now I find this very interesting that the mainstream media has not explained to us what his political viewpoints might possibly be\nBut I suspect they are anti Trump you say well how can you how can you speculate like that\nWhile I can speculate it's my radio program but I'll tell you why\nBecause they don't tell us what the political viewpoints are the mainstream media they're hiding that bit of information they don't want you to know but I suspect the guy's a left me I don't know maybe I don't know but they're not telling us and so that raises suspicion in my mind [noise]\nBut folks this is um [noise] this is getting ugly out there real likely let's go to the phones Madison Ohio John listening to us on Syria sex them channel four fifty John

say we've got to stop this nonsense before somebody gets hurt\nAnd John brings up a very good point I Would say that a good number of the conservatives out there are law abiding conservative patriots\nAre are packing heat they they they are strong supporters of defenders of the second amendment\nAnd all I can say is this\nThose protesters better be very very careful because it's one thing when you're out there on the streets but when you start going after people in their homes why do you think Rand Paul's wife goes to bed with a loaded gun by her bedside\nShe's afraid of what could

I think that's happening again\nYou know who you're single yeah OK and when did you leave your parents' home\nHave been living um what happened is a than on my own for about a year and a half\nBut I moved to BC and once I got to be see I was in a car accident mhm but my money that I had for a place for my vehicle by vehicle mhm and then it was great in the middle of summer\nAnd I wasn't able to secure work until shortly ... maybe a month later I was living in a homeless shelter mhm and now recently the homeless shelter I extend my stay like it's been a month but um where is home yeah I I parked by the ocean and I don't know where where do your parents live\nUh my mom lives about three hours away but she has a boyfriend going through cancer for me being there isn't really\nA [noise] it's very tough tough\nLiving in a region on our beliefs than a ... a health issues right you know living in your car is tough they don't have another bed well I mean you don't pick up much space as long as you're going\nTo be like a smaller V.\nO. so they're basically homeless to\n[laughter] last fight there this was by choice but [noise]\nYeah okay\nYeah so I guess basically where she lives she lives in parks bill I live in Victoria for two and a half hour drive away from each other\nI mean I'm sure there's there's I mean there's there's two aspects of the ... the short term aspects\nBut if the train is coming at you and run to that obviously right and and what's the difference in those two events both like\nGet killed right I mean so that's hoping hopelessness and all of a ... me included face that or have faced that at times in our lives\nAnd it's amazing to me the power of our brain and our spirit that God gives us to do things that are way beyond what we thought we could do once we believe that there are possible\nThat's called hope\nAnd so when I show you look you know you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you got thirty thousand dollars in debt you feel stuck but gosh if we did that at a thousand dollars a month you're going to be out of debt and my ... and a thousand dollars a month out of a hundred thousand is nothing a swap thousand dollars a year you're going to be out of debt and little over\nTwo years and you suddenly go oh I see it ... it's the same situation you were in but now you can see it\nYou see what I'm Talking about ... and once you can see it that's called hope I can see my way out one of the things that steals your hope is when you have lost your perspective perspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things\nIt's happened to me it's happened to you\nI remember one time one of my daughters when she was in high school certain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was very upset like the world\nIs coming to an end\nAnd her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and comfort\nHer [laughter]\nNow why are we standing in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their\nHope ... well\nWe've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been places she hasn't been and have experience was that she doesn't have right so in other words\nOr giggling about standing and All right so we have perspective and so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it\nThen you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer\nAnd it it's going to grow some things in your future you know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you that there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different than when you look out ten seconds\nAnd the young man I was just talking to him and folks that have dealt with an homeless situation says one of the problem was the the desperation just to eat and not be cold\nCauses you to have ten second increments of thought instead of ten year increments just thought ... I can stand back from that sitting here warm and with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more\nBut he can't see he couldn't see that and how can you hear that you're a wasn't getting it\nLike go go go deliver pizzas go blow leaves go walk dogs go shovel something somewhere you know go do something go you know work all the time because as soon as you do that money come from work is where it comes from and I can't get enough hours woven work someplace else work more\nWork all the time but but because I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does mean when we were going broke I too little babies and wife houses in foreclosure were that close to homeless ourselves\nSo how we get out of it\nBankrupt but I didn't lose the house\nAnd if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that ... you know and and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter\nOnly thing is just perspective is like I didn't grow up rich but had a friend that grew up rich and\nBecause he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out 'cause it it always worked out and I had the perspective that ain't gonna work out [laughter]\nIt's going to be awful and but because he thought everything was always going to work out you know how it worked out a lot because I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes that didn't work out you say you set yourself in these traction these rights\nWith this thing but when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work through it it's when you can't see the other side of it that you don't want to work through it because you don't believe it's going to work that's called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same the only difference is you use your perspective\nAnd so I'm challenging some of your another think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you think you're stuck in this\nMarriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're not stuck\n\nYou're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film strip you're going to turn the page and something else was going to happen better or worse tomorrow it is not going to stay the same you are not stuck\nLook the other side of it look out there five years look out there are three years look out their ten months and say one of I got to do what's got to be true that's not true right now\nFor me to never be here again that's a question he was\nI helped him I was kind of bothered me that's why I Want to talk about a minute I'm not sure he hurt me\nBut if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you took my wallet away with with everything I have been through I had no identity no I ... and you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long\nBecause they don't believe that about me and my future and I know if I Do this this and this that I'll be out\nAnd I work my way right out of it I don't I don't know how I Would say but I Would get there I pushed my way through it and um and I haven't always been that way there's been times that I was so scared so beat up and show hopeless that I couldn't breathe and I couldn't see what I'm Talking about here is that is is vision site\nThat gives you hope when you lose your site when you can't see the other side of it\nThen then there's no you know that it's hard to take action it it's hard to fix it and the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you've got to do a series of steps you got to take to become unstuck wherever it is you are stuck wherever it is I'm stuck\nI think that guy's got to be okay I really do I think he's going to be better off than he thinks he's going to be I think it's going to work out great\nBook to read if you already called pizza tiger the guy that started um dominos pizza Monaghan came out of the army made some bad mistakes and ended up living in a

Mart and you have to remember\nKmart and we would go to Kmart and they had\nThis little box on wheels where the pole sticking out of it and on top of the poll was blue flashing light\nAnd they would roll that thing around inside the store and put it up next to some kind of an item and in some piece of merchandise and turn on the blue light and it was called the blue light special\nAnd\nWhich made all of us rednecks hillbillies get really excited and run to the blue light you know like ... like a multi attracted to a flame you know it's just unbelievable we would run over there and buy stuff we didn't even know what it was because it was on sale it was a blue lied special\nAnd uh\nI just Everytime I think about something being on sale I think of a blue lodge special so given that the stock market\nOver Seventy years is average going up eleven percent a year almost ... percent a year\nAnytime it goes down\nJust as a Seventy five year Dr Gregory going up anytime it goes down I always just visualize somebody rolling that little box that blue light over next to the stock market and turn it on and say it's ... there's\nSale on the ... the stock market's on sale this week people\nNow I don't suggest you try to figure out when to buy and wanted to sell out his by every minute I buy every single mind I found out that is what millionaires do and I wanted to be one of 'em so I started doing what they do they put money in their four O. one K.\nBut it's been a complete shell out for several months as a matter of fact a business boutique or our event was Christie right I'm coming up November first through the third over three thousand ladies coming up\nWhile because we always have a few shows but it is a shell out over three thousand tickets so thank you very very much um I've just been speaking this week at our entree leadership master series and it was sold out with over three hundred people we keep those events small so that we can\nHave interaction with the people there but I'm very very good stuff things are on fire around her without a doubt the smart conference today long I've been in Dallas January the twelve is an excellent that you can get into I'll be in San Antonio Texas November the fifteenth\nUh for our last smart money event of the year and that event will be a son will cast as well so I'm Will be a\nBroadcast over YouTube for free or no it's not it's a seminal cast I'm sure it's a um you've actually pay for it and they get paid Nineteen bucks or something or non bucks or whatever is very inexpensive\nBut you can watch it it's a great deal and we'd love to have you do that in a show ... screaming I don't know why I came up with some cash screaming we're going to get there are a Mara is with us from Battle Creek Michigan Mara how are you\n[laughter] I'm doing fine how can I don't I was\nCalling because I'm a fulltime and about a year left can call 'em part-time my ... my income is low and I happened to Iraq on quite a bit of credit card that over the past five years to turn a horrible spending habits\nAnd um lately I have than now extra to doubt loan she'll\nHave our own ... credit card that no longer a liar and check and you know ... yeah how um altogether right\nNow I got about fifty nine thousand dollars and ... I'm probably seven students about Seventeen I bet it in a car loan and then I have found and credit cards out mhm\nOkay [laughter] no you cannot use student loans to pay credit cards\nOh how do you have any advice on my income about sixteen and twenty thousand dollars a year like my ... I'm sure it's kind of on manage up All right now\nMhm okay well you're first goal is of course to eat and keep the lights on your second goal was finished school when we finished school\nUm I'll I'll be finishing next summer\nSo about ... about a year like OK less than a year good so you can tread water till then an ad no more new debt that's a victory\nOkay then the second thing would be to pay the actual payments on their credit cards just minimum and we'll call that a victory uh and then the third thing would be if you can actually start to make some progress paying down on those you don't you're not paying anything on the student loans while you're in school right\nHere I like his or her if I only have like ... half credit card you know how to stay there and it's a really really dumb idea of how you're making a mess and so have you cut up these credit cards\nUm I Know you haven't caught them all up [laughter] yeah I don't use them I switched I don't care if you use them or not drop 'em up I'll\nStop using them you have to stop this stuff radically and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you probably need to work more or at a different place\nWell it can't work more because of high school ... out of the fact is on probably make for an area where I'm located\nOkay well I a little more money I another thousand dollars a month to change your life uh-huh so that's what I'm looking at is what can I Do to create that just on the short term you only got about nine months to your income can change hopefully with a new um with a new job and a new career at that\nHe is in Seattle ... how are you\nBetter than I deserve thank you sure how can I help um so my husband runs a small business from home um and it hasn't been bringing in as much as it used to the for the past nine months it's been declining steadily\nAnd ah so I'm Wondering do we still are home to quit the business getting another job\nYes um what ... was dying\nI I'm not sure that you need heat we used to make a combined income at Fifteen thousand a month and now both of us with the business gets down to five thousand dollar home the mortgage is a large chunk of what we are now\nOkay I'm a little bit confused because you modeled everything together so how much of the Fifteen thousand was you\nI'm about [noise] three a month [noise] are you still doing that yes okay so he was making twelve and now he is making seven yes\nNo no no no no no nothing has been almost disappeared yes you do know what's wrong with it what's wrong with it\nUm I don't know what I have to talk to him I feel like it's just competition and that he he feels like the market it's a lot of online staff of the market flooded with what you've been doing um\nSo what what does he do he sells clothes on line okay\nIn in the last year it will go on so many people enter the clothing online business that weren't there before and I'm not going to grow up Ninety percent of his income\nThat yeah that could it appears to ... to break and there\nHe's got a job or needs to fix this business yeah selling to home and option 'cause no because there's an fix the problem the homes not the problem the problem is is businesses failing okay and we have to feed\nHave to get a job and close the business one or two I don't care if\nYou start selling something other than close the obviously knew how to sell something on the Internet at one point he was doing very well\nSo I get on our he's making a hundred and fifty a year yeah not a bad three years you know that ain't bad\nSo I mean he knows how to do something with marketing on the Internet some kind of digital marketing\nAnd uh it may be that the product line and he's in the space easy on gotta invaded or maybe he's gotten lazy with is is CEO and he's not handling is is digital marketing properly or I don't know I Can't tell what's going on but I can tell you this just sit in the head and the right way is it\nSo I'm going to give them my friend Henry Cloud wrote a book called necessary endings\nK. and in that chapter in one chapter in that book he says that when you end something a relationship a job business whatever it is when you in something it's when it's bad and you have lost hope you have no reasonable logical reason to think it's going to get better\nAnd that's when you end it right I mean even if you\nIf you're ... where the guy who's been drinking for Twenty years and he says he's going to quit there is no logical reason to believe him a unless there's evidence to indicate he actually has quitting this time\nAnd you you know you're married to a drunk you've got to make a decision at that point right in your case and ... with this thing this thing's trending the wrong way you have to give me a logical if I'm you\nYou and him when I look at this and say look at yourself in the mirror and say is there a logical reasonable good reason that says that that we can turn this thing around if we turn these three knobs and get this business working [noise]\nThen we have to change the business for something different [noise] or we're going to get a job 'cause this is not work [laughter]\nOkay things are getting

were\nYou have any air me Yes sir how can I help yeah so\nI'll Try and keep them straight to the point I'm I've been living in my car on and off for about two months or I was homeless for two weeks with my car had broken down\nUm and I'm just wondering\nMoney has become one of my biggest dresses and I'm just curious what advice do you have some ... in this situation again like five families are financially stable to support me we've always struggled with money\nI'm currently working to restaurant jobs ah one of them just caught by ships on the other one I don't make a ton of tips has a survey about I'm just wondering I'm twenty three year old I'm\nAt this point in life I don't really want to\nEver be in a situation because my physical health spiritual health mental health it's all going down since I lost my home until I'm just wondering for some advice as far as what do you I Would have prevented us from happening again\nYou know so you're single yeah OK and when did you leave your parents\nAlso have been living um what happened is a I've been on my own for about a year and a half but I moved to BC and once I got to be see I was in a car accident mhm\nBut my money that I had for a place one who wore a vehicle to fix my vehicle mhm and then it was great in the middle of summer\nAnd I wasn't able to secure work until shortly but maybe a month later I was living in a homeless shelter mhm and now recently the homeless shelter or extend my stay like it's been a month but um where is home yeah I I parked by the ocean and my I don't know where\nMe being there isn't really a [noise] it's very tough tough\nIn a smaller is up on a ... a a health issues right you know living in your car is tough\nThey don't have another bed well I mean you don't take up much space as long you're going\nTo be like a smaller V.\nO. so they're basically homeless to\nFight they had was by choice but [noise] yeah okay yeah I guess basically where she lives\nShe lives in park hill I live in like Korea so about a two and a half hour drive away from each other well I'm sure\nThere's there's I mean there's two there's two aspects of this this is the short term aspect in the long term aspect\nThat if you run to the lot you're going to get out one of you believe you run to the light you're going to get killed right I mean ... that's\nHope and hopelessness and all of a ... me included face that or have faced that at times in our lives and it's amazing to me the power\nOf our brain and our spirit that God gives us\nTo do things that are way beyond what we thought we could do once we believe that there are possible that's called hope and so\nWhen I show you look you know you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you got thirty thousand dollars in debt you feel stock but gosh if we did that at a thousand dollars a month you're going to be out of debt and my gosh and I thought I was always a month out of a hundred thousand it's nothing I swam thousand dollars a year you're going to be out of debt and a little over two years\nAnd you suddenly go oh I see it ... it's the same situation you were in but now you can see it you see what I'm Talking about and once you can see it that's\nLost your perspective perspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things\nIt's happened to me it's happened to you\nI remember one time one of my daughters when she was in high school certain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was very upset\nAbout the world is coming to an end\nAnd her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and comfort\nHer [laughter]\nNow why are we standing in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their\nHopeless\nWell we've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been places she has a man and have experiences that she doesn't have right so in other words we've been to our twenty year class reunion we know she'll be glad he didn't call\n[laughter]\nThat's what we're giggling about standing and All right so we have perspective and so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it\nThen you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer and it's it's gonna grow some things in your future\nYou know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you ... there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different then when you look out ten seconds\nThe young man I was just talking to and folks that have dealt with\nCauses you to have ten second increments of thought instead of ten year increments of thought ... I can stand back from that sitting here warm and with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more\nBut he can't see he couldn't see that you know can you hear that and here he wasn't getting it\nIt's like go go go deliver pizzas go blow leaves go walk dogs go shovel something somewhere you know go do something do you know work all the time because as soon as you do that money come from work is where it comes from and I can't get an of ours will than work someplace else work more\nWork all the time but but because I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does mean when we were going broke too little babies and wife houses in foreclosure were that close to homeless ourselves\nSo how we get out of it or your mind off and well you know you\nCan't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way out I went bankrupt but I didn't lose the house\nAnd if I had lost\nThe house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that ... you know and and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter only thing is just perspective\nIs like I didn't grow up rich but had a friend that grew up rich and\nBecause he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out 'cause it it always worked out and I had the perspective that angle Oregon [laughter]\nIt's going to be awful and but because he thought everything was always going to work out you know how it worked out a lot because I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes that didn't work out you say you set yourself in these traction these rockets with this thing but when you can see the other side of it it's\nCalled hopelessness the situation is exactly the same they only different issue is your perspective and so I'm challenging somebody right now that I think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you think you're stuck in this\nMarriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're not stuck\nYou're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film script you're going to turn the page and something else is going to happen better or worse tomorrow it is not going to stay the same you are not stuck\nSo look the other side of it look out there five years look out there three years look out their ten months and say what am I got to do what's got to be true that's not true right now for me to never be here again that's a question he was asking but he was having trouble emotionally buying it\nAnd I don't think I helped him I was kind of bothered me that's why I Want to talk about a minute I'm not sure he hurt me\nBut if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you took my wallet away with with everything I have been through I had no identity no I ... and you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long\nBecause I don't believe that about me and my future and I know if I Do this this and this that I'll be out\nAnd I work my way right out of it I don't I don't know how long would say but I Would get there I pushed my way through it and um and I haven't always been that way there's been times that I was so scared so beat up and show hopeless that I couldn't breathe and I couldn't see\nWhat I'm Talking about here is ... is is vision site\nThat gives you hope when you lose your site when you can't see the other side of it\nAnd the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you've got to do a series of steps you've got to take to become unstuck wherever it is you are stuck wherever it is I'm stuck\nI think that guy's going to be okay I really do I think he's going to be better off than he thinks he's going to be I think it's going to work out\nBook to read if you already called pizza tiger the guy that started um dominos pizza Monaghan came out of the army made some bad mistakes and ended up living in a homeless shelter\n\nAnd then he ends up owning dominos pizza\nSo it's going to be All right [noise]\nYeah it can be [noise]\nYou can choose for it to be All right [noise]\n... and it's not magic and it's not positive thinking and it's not easy [noise]\nBut it's perception [noise]\nAnd and it's one of the reasons I re biographies of successful people is he lets me know that they went through crap and they made it [noise]\nAnd it and then if I'm going through crap I'm going to make it [noise]\nAnd that that's what I'm you know that's where you are it's where I have been and am sometimes\nIt's gonna be okay\nIt's going to turn out okay

was chaotic Jim Brown was there to buy them so they interviewed Jim Brown afterwards and he said and here's a guy who was you know this is the guy who face\nRacism in a way that a younger generation\nHas not face no matter how much they want to scream and yell about all the micro aggressions and stuff if we're honest with ourselves a grandpa great grandpa and great great grandpa face raises and the kind of racism which\nIs thank goodness\nSlowly but surely it's never going to be gone but it sure the hell water isn't what it once was and they asked him and this was the guy who was an outspoken civil rights leader at a time and he had his issues as well\nUh Jim Brown the great football player but first of all I kept calling ... ... a ... a ... but\nHe uh he said like I don't think anybody should Neal we're a family and we need to figure\nOver the place and at times it was surreal Kanye was holding court and it was interesting but he said and and\nPeople always say why is the right obsessed with Kanye and they're so happy for him and I said it's not the fact that he likes the president doesn't like the president 'cause I don't think he agrees everything with the president I really don't know the fact is is he's got a platform\nHe like some of the stuff their egos match each other\nRight there ... both married to a powerful women and and and they may they get each other right like they get each other but\nIt's the fact that he doesn't go in step into with the left\nThat he's willing to go I really don't care I'm doing my own thing\nRight I'm doing my own thing but something ... and and and I said this to do a couple of ... to me it's like why are you guys so obsessed and I said ... it's because you cheered him what he said George Bush hates black people write you cheered him but now when he's not on that same kind of path you're pissed off and angry\nRight he then he was a genius now he's insane so that's what you're going to do but he said something day and I said even if he's in saying as is once you understand this\nJust because he may have some screws loose and he was kind of all over the place today doesn't mean that some of the stuff he's not saying it doesn't have valid points\nWhen I Saturday Night live to improve on on the liberals or improve on it if he don't\nWe don't look good president\nTrump told the truth is these rights and online and that is true some I've been saying something I've been saying over and over and over and over and over again don't want to see the other side's fail\nIs ridiculous it is\nRidiculous to want to see the other side fall apart\nThat the president fails to Bill Maher saying I Hope we have a recession the people cheering fourteen hundred points coming off the Dow in two days because they're hoping this happens is insane that's that is for that is not patriotic is at all\nThe roads ... not a\nIt's a it's a sad sad thing but he was all over the place he was a the hat thing was just just crazy they talked about all kinds of stuff uh you know and and ... to me it was it was again it was surreal moment in the White House\nWell we may or anything it's not an America that were cheating on our country and we're putting people in for a legal thing and she ... factory out the president [noise]\nYeah\nI mean it's different I mean he he said a lot of stuff that I think it was a bit out there like that's one of one of the reasons that people make stuff cheap everywhere and Trump even fact checked him on Foxconn and a few other things but some of the reasons that people do the things that they do like go elsewhere is because we hear demand cheap goods\nBut I understand what he was trying to do and I think he said some stuff today that was real and and just because you don't like him because he's not on your team anymore as far as what goes because he's wearing a make America great again hat just because of that doesn't mean that all the things that he thinks should be discounted because a lot of times\nIt's true right\nHe had to go off on some blackie tangents he did he did he absolutely did he went off in some crazy stuff and you're just like he said he's bipolar but not bipolar is a genius to test the Ninety eight percent dial he was all over the place to be shown Trump stuff on phones because apparently what design cars\nI don't know it is

that's what Kanye does and it was interesting was holding court uh but my question is you know why can't we talk to one of the stability is gone\nParty and here's the thing that's something I talked about before when it comes to authorities we don't need a third party that's equal you can make a lot of noise\nBeing strong and small meaning if you took twenty seats thirty seats in the house maybe five or six seats in the Senate right you take anywhere between you know you've got intend to Fifteen Percent\nYou can do a lot of things you can\nCan do a lot of things and I think we need a real party and I'm Talking about the Green Party right with Jill Stein I'm not talking about Gary Johnson because\nGod that he just it was awful can we just admitted right like can we write I'm Talking about ... insane although everyday film last and he's like he's not just wants to talk about it going that's why he's running for president block jade\nAnd said I'm Talking about what I'm Talking about somebody and the party that is real that I think could it you know can see all sides and is there more for the most of the times I think the referee and the random in the mature party will call [laughter]\n[noise] what do you think though would you be open it could you be open to a third party that's not insane that's not crazy about a real party fifty percent of you so far so yes I can four percent say nope\nForty six percent says depend on the politics and I think the politics would be very much an independent minded look at things and so what you're saying let's let's break this down how this would work\nSo you've got a party that is somewhat in power right that has the most ... just you are right but you've got a party that's got then you've got another party there so the Republicans Democrats one of those who is gonna have the most seats the second seats is gonna be the other one this is the third is the one that's going to be\nTo get stuff done and if you're able to say look I understand what you're doing there and I agree with this this and this but you know what if you want to vote you got to get rid of this you gotta get rid of this you got to get rid of this because I see it from their side too so it is a way to move things through and that might be the best way to break the gridlock\n\nIn many ways just like being an independent who do both sides cater to come election time who was the vote they need the independence because they're the ones that are going to sway 'cause we're so driven\nAnd separated right now they got to come and they gotta go okay okay okay ... we need your vote what do we have to do I think in a bigger way if we can do something like this I think it would change the law three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had mentioned show is your Twitter babysitting while black\nI'm babysitting right ... I got I got two kids in America to women or maybe soon as this lady across the street with the hands of somewhere warmer this lady over here she's following me because I've got two kids and the vaccine that Islam is white males\nSo that guy right there cordless his name and he is babysitting and it just a mentoring program and and you know he looks to be in his mid twenties early thirties kind of thing and he's got like a eight and ten year old\nBoy and girl in the back and they happened to be white and he happens to be black and there is a woman who was worried that these two kids have been taken\nAway\nSnatched from their parents because stranger danger is everywhere\nThis lady said it upon herself to say that she's going to say my place now call the police crisis\nThis is twenty eight the and this is\nWhat I got to do it I Can't go out with two kids that do not look like me and without something weird to see the way it is moving sees harassing me because I have two kids that do not look like ...

points of an TNT I find I'm going to teach me the gas station [noise]\nYou know Michelle Obama said when they go low we go high here's my view of the Democratic party regarding Kevin Oh going lo is a step up for you you in the gutter [laughter]\nI don't know if that's right either but I get what he's trying to do but Mr older you're not even saying let's pretend to go you're not even said let's get on the moral high ground you're saying let's throw down you want to get dirty huh let's get dirty you brought a you brought a knife to a gunfight\nOr keep it up to put up Mr ... keep saying that you're going to you know you keep doing what you do and see how the American people like this this is the number one issue I think for American November steam agree with what they did to Brett Kavanaugh do believe that what they did was OK you think believe it was okay vote Democrat if he thought it was despicable both for us\nYeah or better yet maybe step back and say I'm not quite sure what a vote for anybody based on the way that I see these attitudes that are coming out here and I find it to be ridiculous I Do\nI find it absolutely to be ridiculous and we're getting more and more and more and more and more and we're hearing things more and more from ... from Democrats like the ... like the Cory bookers goes to the hill today [laughter]\nPlease get up in the face of from Congress people and\nPeople like Cory Booker said get up in their face he he may think that that's okay but what he doesn't realize is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face what I'm going to be an stable enough to commit violent\nHe's right this coming from a guy who was attacked by his neighbor right he was\nThe baseball game you remember that\nThe guy shooting up the ball field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot [laughter] these glues was almost go he was yelling this was for health care he had a list in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill these are people that are unstable and we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratcheted down and say we're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK\nEver reason for or a means we're trying to resolve things\nNo it's not but that is I think what we're headed to and Rand Paul's right\nBoth sides need to take it down a notch I'm looking at the Republicans I'm looking at the Democrats we've got to have some civility and the fight that they think they're taking on you understand for a lot of them and we've talked about this before here\nWhich is you go on these shows and you you scream and yell at each other in the back a green room there you're talking about hey what are you doing this weekend as your kids you know the whole nine yards\nThe problem is not everybody buys into that a lot of them they take it seriously a lot of them look at the WWE Shakespearean kind of cedar that's going on in politics and they buy into it and they take it seriously and I'm starting to think that more and more of these people\nAnd I'm not talking about the the average person I'm Talking to more of the board of the people that represent us are starting to drink their own Kool Aid and are more than just rabble rousing their bases that they're starting to believe some of this stuff and what is it going to take for us to step back and go okay wait a minute this has gone too far\nI feel that there's going to be an assassination I really worry that someone is going to be killed and ah that those who are ratcheting up the conversation those were racks up saying getting their face they realize that they bear some responsibility of this over to our\nYeah let me ask you this let's just say for the sake of argument right that somebody goes out and does something from either side of the aisle that says something to that\n\nDo you think at any point in time that any of these people are gonna look do you know what maybe\nMaybe maybe we may maybe this is a little too much maybe maybe we need to step this thing that I don't know if it's going to happen that way you know one of the things I said is when I watched that whole thing with Jeff Flake and and several of these other senators and stuff for people coming up and screaming getting into their faces I thought to myself\nDidn't we just have an issue with ... and the shooting and it just seems way too easy for somebody to walk up to some of these people in the anger that they had and it's a very interesting situation but civility we need more of it\nAnd I don't think we have it and I think some of the stuff that I talk about ah with people is they are worried about the tribalism in this country they are worried about the way that the country's headed they are worried about how we're talking to one another\nThey're worried that the tools that we have that should be fun and enjoyable have now become tools we can go after each other Twitter Facebook all these things say horrible horrible things to each other with zero accountability and zero worry for anybody\nComing after you and that to me is not good it's not this mob mentality and mob rule is not good for anybody and it sure now not good for the next generation\nBut I agree with him I think somebody's going to pay the price the ultimate price somebody is going to be so pissed so angry so enraged by something and the fires are going to be stoked\nTo the point that they act on something and that they do something and then they kill a politician\nAnd we're like wow but it shouldn't be a surprise it shouldn't based on all the things we're seeing and hearing I doubt it\nYou can tweet us a loving caring for me a lot of stuff still touch on and again we're watching you know the the hurricane\nIs is absolutely devastating a but one of the things I'm marveling it continued to marvel at is first of all one of the things you're going to see is is is how fast they tried to build this thing back up but the reality of of of of how bad this is and the damage when you see it on television\nAnd you look at it and the debris and and just the eighties eighties it's getting regime of heat
