I'm In downtown proper right I'm On second in Los Angeles street I live in Studio city I take the entire drive home\nIn key at home in enough time to late ... you're not getting myself caught lay in bed and watch the end of the game\nYeah it was crazy it was similar with me in the lovely Christina because last night we went out to a movie oh yeah we went to a\nAnd I remember the name of it started with ... uh the submarine movie with Gerard Butler\nThen comment she want to go see that yeah she did her choice yeah\nA killer or what is it um killer hunter\nKiller hunter that's exactly what you both for we move forward it was it was okay pretty good okay pretty good pretty good so we were there and I\nYou know me from right [laughter] I put my phone on so I got notifications\nIf there were any scores or there was a final score\nAnd so I got a notification towards the beginning of the movie where Jackie Bradley junior hit the game tying solo homerun\nRight one to one I'm looking down at my phone bill\nWhole movie and I'm like no notifications no nothing I'm like something must have gone wrong you know\nWhat I'm seeing any in your survey if yeah if you go to the bathroom and called variety but hey I'm [laughter] I think there's something wrong with my yeah\nWe watch the whole movie\nAnd we leave and I check the score and it's tied up in the thirteenth ending I'm like what in the world they're still going on and they had all five more innings to play at that point it's crazy so we went back and saw the end of it so gosh saw ...\nYeah there is papa bear I always I was torn because\nAnd I was going to send a text papa bear but I don't want him to a you know really lash out at me or anything but I'll say it on the radio show you know [laughter] but that goes on a radio show I was told I was like do I want the Dodgers\nJust for papa bear reasons because he loves the Dodgers so much and we know how much he absolutely despises the entire city of Boston\nThat just the patriots Red Sox anything related to Boston he despises at that so I'm torn here he from I was thinking do I want the Dodgers to just get obliterated which would be good again just from a papa bear standpoint or\nDo I want them to prolong the theories maybe it's an game seven and it's hard getting ripped out a papa bears chest again you know what I mean\nYeah I I Would like a game that\nI think it's a it's a very heightened given in the midst of you know college football coming down the stretch in and it makes the full swing of of the NFL's season I think baseball is getting his shy shy and right now what you'd very rarely does\nMan I like to see carry out I Would love a game seven I'd be amazing\nWhat do you think papa bears reaction would be if the Dodgers lose the game seven and back to back seasons in the world series\nOh man you wouldn't see me a ever again probably [laughter] and by the way if there is a game seven it's going to begin to Halloween now my birthday is November first so if the game seven I guarantee you this is what's gonna happen there's going to be some type of rain delay so if you have to remember first my birthday\n[laughter] [laughter]\nYes if it was last night like at least getting past midnight\nWhen my wife is a fanatic and and the funny thing is\nIt's been a ... we have so much stuff going on this year it's kind of been a slow things so I was like okay maybe this year she's not really trip and of course we have two boys seven and four and so I was like well maybe this is the years she's not going to goal\nCycle when it comes to Halloween [laughter] and I promise you\nI drove home yesterday or the day before yesterday\nAnd I pass my house and I was like wait I just saw a backup and I'll look because when I came down the street I usually\nRight after the large Hedges is my house now pulled into the driveway and so on and so forth but I was thrown off because there was like Seventy feet of Cobb webs\nAnd stone that's an glow in the dark skeleton hand and pumpkin heads and day of the dead mask all over the lawn uh-huh\nAnd I was like I just left like two hours ago when it does happen to them in and I was like hey baby shoes I\nFinally got to Halloween decorations up I said [laughter]\nOh is that it oh my goodness man\nSo I I you know I don't know what I'm gonna be this year are you hearing we usually do a family theme to Halloween like last year because of my boys are huge fans of Super Mario cart\nOh nice my wife made the actual Mario carts\nOh that's cool for us to wear along with the costumes are for all of those listening out to eat out a picture of what we look like last year [laughter] ah so I'm not always ... by the ... yeah I'm ... I'm always vows her back\n\n\n\nFox Sports go mobile we'll see where it's going to have the holy land to visit I dont want to say that the dot com details of cells to seriously when no regrets for stars do say I'm Sorry I Know I'm Sorry forgive and use it for\nAnd the thing that will make you laugh\nWe're doing it all for you it sounds good to me they interview me any\nMore [noise] radio interest him killer gently oh you live in the eyes of the audience for ... years ago when we were the\nRaiders neither Thursday at seven thirty and they're not in law now [noise]\n[noise]\nYou know the ... because it's Fox Sports radio where someone from the studios what does it mean when I go to just sixteen minutes ... percent or more on car insurance means you're probably should have gone to a guy go dot com Fifteen minutes\nAgo and we got the actions that idea from goodness I got a\nLaptop or mobile devices all this stuff trying to catch up with all these games what games do you got going on over there right now these\n... ... there you go I have the world series uh-huh [noise] and I'm not sure my middle TV is on [laughter]\nCommercials [laughter] [noise] yeah\nWell that's not bad not bad lay out I Am interested in Stanford game them hosting Washington state and I'm keeping track on the a and M. game but ah I think I'm gonna switch that over to hook 'em versus Oklahoma State look more interested in that one\nYou know what I mean yeah by the way up one of the bigger wins the gate of the day was Georgia taking down Florida Georgia wins thirty six to Seventeen I don't know how they figure out these numbers\n... from you can say they're a bunch of uh hogwash if you want to malarkey not I don't know that we could really disapprove that you know your stance is wrong and there's this right but\nAfter Georgia launched to LSU last week their chances of reaching the playoff dropped two thirty three percent\nSo they still have the stranglehold on their division and if they're able to go you know presumably head to head against Alabama and take them down they're probably going to be in the playoffs they can run the table I just don't know if they're going to be able to do that\nYeah I when we talked about when they lost the LSU ... or you know I don't know if it's going to happen\nAnd you had some scenarios whatever the win out including you know be now a ... a and if they were to do that that would be the only way the only the area so I guess in essence you can still say and I was wrong when I said they don't control their own destiny\nBecause as we look at the top ten you know those guys are going to eat each other up so if you can be the one who has the last meal\nThen [laughter]\nRight if you're the one but still left that\nAt the table you know right now and Notre Dame controls its own destiny especially they don't have a playoff or anything or a championship your claims in Alabama and you know everybody else is vital for that fourth spot yeah\nAnd you look at Georgia they'll take on Kentucky next week on the road Georgia will be added ... good ... ... how about Kentucky number twelve in the ... and an old timer seven point under dogs on the road against Missouri and they get the wind Fifteen to fourteen\nLike old school football today throwback score you know you don't see many Fifteen fourteen finals and he got to have that when a man\nYeah they got it they got it done so uh that's a big game next week you suddenly say there's a big game toward the end of the season with Kentucky right All right then let's we're talking basketball yeah but hey man Wildcats planes and ball this year given ... that's right [laughter]\nThat would be for them\nThat would be a huge when our home against Georgia this guy be the biggest game and their school's history\nTo be in football in football yeah [laughter] they let them pretty big ones and other sports but uh in the foot football\n... ball coach colleagues at that like yeah that's that is nice and\nYou guys trying to win a big game I mean come on guys\nBy the way in terms of the NBA I got to get your take on this earlier and I got to weigh in on it as well\nThis Jimmy Butler trade ... proposal where the Houston Rockets are dangling for first round draft picks that's the maximum allowable first round picks in a deal and it's going to be limited lottery protections on the picks\nAnd the tea wolves or like I just think about it we'll get back\nPlay it on this one I don't see the value being better I get it where kids head coach wants to keep it gig he doesn't want a bunch of future assets and ... and draft picks and all of that he's in when now mode but I just don't think you're going to get a better\nProposal than that for the timber wolves I don't know why they wouldn't do it and more so I I don't know why Houston would I mean that's the that's an all in move but I just don't love that idea where you are absolutely mortgaging the future to go for it all do you like this idea by the the rockets\nSo I understand what the rockets are doing they're looking at their current roster and look who they have locked up they have James Harden they have the the three they have capella they have all of these guys locked up and then they have a bunch of ancillary pieces that can you know our our mobile\nThey're not looking to add you know they're looking to add experience in in dominance now right they are they're all locked up across the board so they're looking at the landscape uh of talent coming out and they've\nWager that there's no one coming out of school and the next couple of years\nThat can put them over the top like uh all star caliber player like Jimmy Butler could\nRight and so they're like ... it's risk reward we're going to live and die with this current roster because we've invested everything into it when you give Chris Paul that much money\nAs he's in his thirties and James Harden has two hundred million and you give Clint ... what they give him an eighty nine Ninety million by those three pieces are going to be there\nThing that's a you know as a whatever but they want to add an all star caliber player now\nRon draft pig [laughter] right who's token youth tokens very you know what have you spoken in the machine then they then they [laughter] so they they are the management there when they decided to sign that Chris Paul deal then you knew exactly what direction they were going and we needed to do what we need to do it now we have the team\nThat can compete where one injured drift Paul away from the thrown in Golden State that was their mindset but now as the season has started\nAnd they've been playing they realized\nThey've lost their what little defensive edge that they had and it's affecting the chemistry of a team like it's it's not they're they're I mean they're bad they're ... they're worse there and they all want to go there struggling\nBig time they are and we get it no Trevor read the new know Bob moot say and they were very good defensively last year so they've taken a step back but\nI look at this and look man on one hand I get it where Darryl Maury and the rockets they're looking at it and they're saying objectively we're not good enough to win at all\nSo what are we going to do about it or we just going to accept that or are we going to make this blockbuster trade to get Jimmy Butler over here so I understand why it's really difficult\nTo take this long term approach\nBut I also look at it and say you can be aggressive to a fault\nAnd if you look at getting Jimmy Butler over there yet puts you in a position to challenge against the war years but I look at it like this you'd Texas hold them guy at all from a U.S I Am\nRight so now there's no commercials they're not going to commercials as her walk into the next or a T\nH is there is there trash talk that already exist now feels that it is it right it is\nIn magic say a major right right and you're hearing mhm I Can't imagine they're like hey that last part yeah really bad\nBut you gotta remember golf as a psychological game it is right now you're not only playing your opponent\nRight like ooh that was a rough one off the sea ha by just those little things\nRight and so that gets into your head as you're walking to your midst hit ball in the Bush is behind someone lemonade cup\nRight right I I don't think it happens\nIn a major like lighter or two I Would love for it to you know I mean I Would that would be a dream scenario\nBut why would you why would you talk trash and invite the other guy to talk trash to you which could throw you off of your well less\nTrash talk I mean Gary Payton drug trash he didn't care for came back he just felt I'm the better draft stronger in um the better player uh-huh right Jordan\nBert sure sure absolutely but basketball and football they're not known as the gentleman sport of course not right\nI just don't think it will what tiger instill absolutely that's fantastic I just don't think you could have you know some of these golfers Mike in a major and ... they're talking mad trash in Italy yet that much better oh it would be so much about\nIt if you really would like whole he really not fair to them like I Am so looking forward just that little tidbit I'm so looking forward\nTo hearing them together right and I am in because they've I mean they've spent their whole careers together\nAnd so you know their friends their competitors\nThe whole nine yards so I Would love to I remember I was watching the clip\nOn line and they were seeing off together and you know they welcome\nYou know Tiger Woods the\n... name and all of his accomplishments every go there and then right in the middle feel was like OK okay we did we get it a novel enough already\nFor you don't really see that in golf or even think it happens in golf so I'm interested to see what that sounds like\nSure I think it'd be funny if they are just drop in so many up [laughter]\nTake a call ... ... it was like oh\nHey didn't know what they're thinking about this what Tiger Woods turns out to be one of the all time great trashed August and we didn't even know\nOh it'd be great it'd be great but I think it would just be for this event I don't think it would be shedding light on what he's done throughout his career you know right you're pretty much off in your own world\nNo but what I'm doing what I'm saying is what if we get a look behind the curtain and then guys Kamala oh you're tiger has been one of the most prolific trash talker last\nTwo decades or you don't think it would be the case he might be against Phil that's all I can hope for is I think that would be I'd be happy interesting yeah are coming up next the guy goes studios it seems crazy a

thirty three gain goes into overtime\nAnd they score on their opening drive and\nOn fourth and goal they stop Colorado so Oregon State they snap a twenty two game road losing streak wow by beating a Colorado and\nIt's just one of these things where\nThey make it harder on themselves right you missed an extra point you could have one in regulation but you go and do it the hard way still went in

just I Love [laughter] I think you've got to embrace the craziness of college football because if you look for quality\nThat's probably not the way you want to go [laughter] I'm not going to say you're in say there's no quality whatsoever with college football there's plenty of it but you're going to see a way a more miss cues and way more bad plays in college football than the NFL amateurs versus pros right and\nThreats of vigor despair or already in in in\nTalent as well in in in\nCollege oh ... no doubt about that but I think\nIf you're looking for a great execution you're looking at college football the wrong way you just got to look for entertainment value you got to embrace the craziness it's the same thing in college basketball it's a lesser product in terms of execution than the NBA there's no doubt about it\nBut if you just embraced the craziness of the random stuff that happens with in that it's way more enjoyable way more\nYeah you're just in it's entertaining right\nYeah I mean they're saying your expectations\nShouldn't be you know through the roof you know ... years ago on Appalachian State beat Michigan yeah you know what I mean that is awesome\nBut you know if you're Appalachian State you're not\nReady to jump off the top of the stadium if you didn't win you know that type of thing you just [laughter] you get to have those great moments where we see teams that had no business winning winning and I asked what I Love about uh amateurs boil it was not amateur sports but that's what I Love about college for it [laughter] yeah right there are we\n... we voted Amazon or we will whatever over\nRight yeah yeah yeah All right so uh we got the pleasantries out of the way from a town in time to get down to business\nQuarterbacks cleanly ya ... okay because there are some where you know when you started scraping the bottom of the barrel\nYou get into some you're splitting hairs here you know when you get to the bottom three\nSo I'll give you mine how about that I give you my bottom three currently and I look at this it's like college football rankings how they change from one week to the next in a team like Florida they're going to drop out of the top ten because they lost to Georgia we get that right so this this subject to change could change next week but\nRight here right now here's ... worst starting quarterback in football today you got to go to Derek\n... percent of the Buffalo Bills oh that's okay you know in five games in seven seasons you\nCan package him in a maze and beat him in the gather [laughter] like you can put them together so we'll we'll we'll count them as one [laughter] right [laughter] how ... how to do one yeah\nI'll go their number one number two I'll go CJ by third with the forty niners yep\nI put him as a second worst he's he hasn't had a whole lot of starts to get some more seasoning with Jimmy gene being injured this year and that maybe he gets a little bit better but right here right now I'd say second worst more interceptions than touchdowns\nIt's not pretty and as much as I Believe in this guy I call them pleaded Jesus for crying out loud\nJosh Rosen not all his fault bad all sense of line over there with Arizona but today I Would have Josh Rosen as the third worst starting quarterback and you'd be accurate or you agree with my like\nI Do one hundred percent agree with that was that was a great list um it it's just on in in terms of jobs Rosen ... we'll play the youth cart\nThe David Johnson that we thought we'd get a that defense isn't the same defense without Calais as the honey badger um and so it's more pressure\nYou know teams are scoring they have to be constantly fight from behind that's that's tough to do with the young quarterback especially when you're ... prize position on our fence is a thousand euro receiver and Larry Fitzgerald right it was tremendous don't get me wrong but that's not what you want you want\nYou know ... some young studs to build with your quarterback to have that type of chemistry like we've seen over the years painting and Marvin invading and Reggie and in\nIn you know just not to have that type of weapon\nIt's difficult for jobs and he's out there he's coming in and he's trying to do with what they ask but it's tough as ... ... it is not really tough let me can I ask you a question about yet list and I don't want to get all crazy I hear ya right I'm just going to ask you one question ... you're not you're on the go and I think you just give me your honest opinion\nUh-huh do you think ... better than any of those three four quarterbacks would just named\nAs of today absolutely not absolutely\nNassau and we don't have to go any we don't have to do more I just wanted to know where you stood\nThere right well yeah but as it you know it's not that simplistic I get ill but like I said be do are they going to\nGet any better the rest of the stuff sure sure because I Know where you're going to go and I want to keep

I'm sure you've seen your fair share of tears has there ever been a time where it tears were not acceptable\nTo you the majority of the time it's only two times when peers are except\nWell more while say three\nOkay Number one big one mhm do crushing defeat number three serious injury uh-huh yeah that's it so you get that\nSays so for um okay let's say Derrick car wasn't as serious injury looked like he was witnessing right didn't look like he was balling didn't look like the Syria to Oregon where it's going on\nThey're taking you to the ... you know did your season is done that the writers injury\nAbsolute like O L back in the junior high last June and you know\nThat what everything you worked for yeah get yourself ready for\nThis year is done that is a serious injury\nAbsolutely okay All right so I like this road we're going down how 'bout Derek car specifically he was when singing pain I Believe he was crying do you think that could cause something in the locker room just what we saw from their car [noise]\nYeah I I mean and it's changing it's not like it was when I was playing and I know oh guys always talking about or you know or read when I play I don't like to be that guy because I Know evolution and I know growth is necessary for sport\nUm but the emotional strength is also necessarily for sport\nBeing able to deal with tough situations is also\nFor support and you need that ... and you need to be able to emotion\nYou play and if you know if you notice the three acceptable\nReasons to cry in my opinion the game is over right we're not during the game because you can't\nIt's hard to be that emotional that's why I don't like the outburst of ... Bek I'm On the sidelines I don't like that because it's hard it's hard enough to focus and and do everything right in terms of\nYou know going out there and playing and putting your best foot forward when you throw those type of emotions into the preparation things you need to do to be successful it's difficult to focus\n[noise] yeah yeah that's a [laughter] I mean\nIt's one of those storylines where I look at their car and how tough ... Ben\nRight his career where he broke his leg against the colds a couple of years ago and it's in the ... when he was in the MVP race right in the running and he's like it's broke broke [laughter] he wasn't like it was in tears flying left and right we know he's a tough guy he's dealt with many injuries for\nSo for them to all of a sudden become a a huge story this is Lee Smith he's one of the tide in from the Oakland Raiders here's what he had to say about it a little bit earlier this week\nAll these reports about this locker room being fractured when Derek or is the most obnoxious and ridiculous thing I've heard ever it's or to the point to where it's comical laughable that I'm even sitting here talking about it um us as players\nAre have zero issue when Derek or he is our leader he's always been our leader we put a stay on his chest for a reason along with her on the Hudson and a regardless of what facing makes after a tackle or or or what everybody wants to dive into and and where him out about a attacking his character attack and\nAnd you know they they may very well be true\nBut the locker room is fractured and the reason is fractured is because you only get the fractured when the success isn't there that's right right right yeah Kansas City fractured no rams locker room and fractured\nPatrick ... homes where I Would cry after hearing you know sweet Caroline and he just gets misty eyed and these layers just something about\nThis song and it'll be like like we love the passion for Iraq [laughter] right either going off all\nYou know all of a sudden it's like oh we're we're fine well we know for a fact that guy's fill a certain type of way they felt a certain type of way when they traded ...\nThat's right right we know that for a fact so you can't sell me on it not being fractured one half or your team including your quarterback\nWas like my best friend really\nYeah gone that makes sense I agree with you because anybody who was out on Derek car\nAfter did he cry or did he now did he not they were out on their car before that ever happened right right was it because of the tears that they were like you know what\nNo thing they already go to a certain way absolutely you think of Tom Brady took this severe hit and his left shoulder was just killing them for a second he shed a tear that his teammates it'd be like out on this guy\nThank you and I really don't bring Tom which showed it to though just I don't ... but I I think that there is fractured all over the locker room I think it was fractured between some of the players I think it's fracture between organs\nNeed to find words in your best player you won't even talk to them in the trade him in the ...\n\n... ... and then you show you know sarcastic response to the lack of production from the from that position\nThat was never good 'cause that's the thing everybody looks at that situation and says if you treat him like that\nHow old am I going to be treated well you know you start getting into this individualistic minds that instead of team and they take care of a sudden we take care of each other and you're just looking out\nOkay [laughter] where do you live [laughter] there's no crying in baseball [laughter]\nEven if you lose an Eighteen in a game and heartbreaking fashion\nOnce again nothing there's no crying in baseball\nBy the way do you think that they should tweak the extra inning format based on the game last night there's some people saying oh a radical change is coming soon you want to see that any from\nNot let employment let them play\nIt's not like they're over exerting themselves yeah extra innings you start with a runner a him lay claim ... board where you can play\nBack to back games yeah we're in a in a championship varies yeah\nThat's it seven hours and twenty minutes is ridiculous what it is hit the ball right [laughter] right\nIt is very very rare that we see anything even close to that I wouldn't\nDo anything

right now\nWe're going to go with some college review some NFL it'll be all over the place man I'm looking forward\nTo it like er NBA\nFinal yeah I Know you want to get your Lakers walk in there\nIt was an Eighteen inning game last night that was two to one that they went\nAlmost ten innings without a run being scored through this is bad for it to be scoreless in the sixth inning ... on the heels of last night\nTell me I'm wrong on that [laughter] no you're not [laughter] not that bad like yeah see some off and it's something yeah\nI Would much rather be ten to ten going into extra innings because at least you had some excitement in a purist it'd be like a ... game and I don't know that I Want to hear [noise]\nWow [laughter] wow well that's what I Want to hear [laughter] right I mean I Love\nPitchers dual here and there I dabble in pitchers do ... you know you give me back to back pitchers dual Saddam like we got sees them off and so for him by the ... yeah let's hit the ball past the infield this is not literally going on right now but still\nNothing nothing in the bottom of the sixth inning the Dodgers have a man on first base with max Muncie\nAt bat so keep you updated on that he knew roll over last night that's right we will tell you about I'm going up though opposite man I thought that he hit the walk of home run earlier on I thought that was gone for short down the right field line mhm yeah ... it was\nAnd we had to get all of those innings of just to get to it at home right they've got to get up and actually hit the homerun later on it's\nCrazy um I Want to start with the NFL here real quickly the from because I went and I looked at\nSeason that Patrick mom's is having statistically uh-huh and I compare it to Dan Marino was Nineteen eighty four season\nYards passing per game Marino averaged three Seventeen point eight it's like point to yard difference right completion percentages almost the same pass rating is very very similar\nAnd so I looked a little bit further while I'm looking at the cheap this season to the eighty four dolphins that was a team that made it to the super bowl last against Joe Montana and the forty niners ... year\nHis second year like I didn't write for having a second year and he was unbelievable that year but the dolphins scoring defense they were ... seventh in the NFL and points given up this season the chiefs\nThere in the bottom forces [laughter] they're they're twenty fourth right now points given up on average I just I don't see how they're going to make significant noise in the postseason unless they fix their defense they just can't steadily out score\nThey got to get there Ed Rogers back together you know Justin Houston's been banged up I mean they do have got to be able to put pressure on quarterback they've always been great when they can do any team has been great but they have the officers have been with to do that once they can make quarterbacks uncomfortable\nAnd not a not have their secondary hold up for as long as they have to then there'll be a much better team right and we see that from the rams we see what the rams do defense of le as a team you know\nMaking quarterbacks uncomfortable pushing them all you gotta nowhere and Donald as soon as you focus on him down looking to write so it's a those type of situations where they can still you\nKnow right the ship they just got to get guys healthy and put them in great position to you know affect games defensively and not just put it all on the on the shoulder of his kid in the office of weapons which are [laughter]\nBecause you are on the field on the opposite side line against one of the best off fences ever in the Nineteen Ninety eight Minnesota Viking correct and they did not play great the sense that they know where's the fence John Randall was on the sideline throughout most of that game when he was injured so\nYeah you you've got to find a way and that was the Vikings formula was just don't get drug up and down the field right right and that's still came back to bite him you know you do it absolutely did double by Justin Tucker\nUh Turner goodness what am I talking adjusting Turner hit the doubled down the left field line and you've\nGot action you got married in third for the ... the Dodgers have been notorious\nThis postseason for leaving runners in scoring position and leaving them on base\nI mean their their response has been ridiculous\nYeah you've got at least sex life here pay ... intentional walk to many Machado surprised on how low it down to first base it's crazy\n[laughter] what what is what China don't doing\nWhat is he doing in the world series van like [laughter] you got to show better effort if you're not trying in the world series I don't know when you are going well try when or your dry and\nMan when you're just looking at a long single that isn't close to\nBeing a home run I I just don't know where you're headed that man\nI don't know where it's at already from\nThis could be a discussion that threatens to rip it apart I hate to do this but we have no easy from salon were coming to you live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios Fifteen minutes could they be Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance visit guy go dot com for free rape quote\nHave to ... not the case of little bit how these evening games might shake out right but the committee they reveal their very first playoff rankings this coming week it'll be Tuesday and so the question on this show where\nShould UCF be ranked we gotta action here as we got a ... and all\nOf Ballenger hit a ball\nIn the infield they went home for the forced out and then when they were trying to double up bell injure on first base ball one day I saw a\nField yeah bad throw Dodgers are on the board one o two out of it\nWe got at all ways of always to score run a scoreless game that's\nWhat happens you know come on Red Sox what does that\nCome on down to talking about\nGot to be sound defense which is bad parents with the nice throw home and then uh\nGoodness dude\nCatcher just throws it were the first baseman can't get to it\nEven possible to harder to bad poor socks oh no [laughter] I'm just\nSaying it's a bad play on their behalf that's all bad throw the catcher throws\nIt to the rights of Ballenger so picture Ballenger running to first base and he throws it to the right out of guides shoulder or is it running an ad do shades oh was he on the base\n\nNice nice yeah rarely yep there you go there who are from Machado do though from ... right there to get the third base it's right I mean he made it more difficult being indecisive but I'm\nGuy on there and wants to chime in here what are the ... you guys were talking about a lack of office of output so far in the last\nAre you still try and figure out from all the wonderful volunteer groups where you're\nYeah ... is that a court appointed special advocates for a foster child go to Costa of Arizona dot org ...

the road there playing Stanford's tough place to win and they had this emotional way and against Oregon\nLast week if they win this game it's built on and if I don't believe UCS going to be in the top ten if Washington state loses they've got a good chance to be in the top ten\nOkay\nSt the baseball game universe didn't interfere with that [laughter]\nI Know you were like you you come back on

... what do you got to do with the guy could I'd come for free great quote ... near\nWhat a great Saturday Night the beyond their base a start\nUp a little slow today Erin but man does it pick it up Steve and right now the Dodgers in the red Sox all I did for a in the city how 'bout that\nAll I wanted to do here Arnie was sit here watch some college football some navy Tripoli option\nWhat Steve Roberts doing what is he doing Arnie you live I mean you must be well I don't know if you love it or not out there in Boston do bring in your clothes are in a non saved situation it's really\nNot that hard we all know stop I don't have a problem with that but it's so funny because\nUm you know I'm getting blamed for this all of course you're yeah double are the big Dodger fan is now screaming bloody murder yeah yeah yeah yeah of course it's my fault then I was joking around and go well it's for three kids and then what could possibly go wrong\nSo I didn't know if that were not enough to get outta here\nJets and did\nA that's for sure because he knew what right when I was hit this has been a really good World Series you know I got to tell you the red Sox\nAre really came so close to winning yesterday's game at putting the series over I'm now look like the Dodgers were going to tie this thing up to two and looked like they had the momentum now who knows it's a four to four\nEngaged number for this has been lost some World Series okay so two questions so first question is did you stay up for all Eighteen ... no I I couldn't do it I mean it was over what three thirty eastern time is\nYeah I mean I mean that's that's a little past my bedtime I made it to like about one now I Do in and out and you know got up every like half hour or put it put it on my phone but uh no I I couldn't make it till three thought he was just way too much and they they got to do something about that it's\nIt's it's too much when you have\nAn east coast team in the west coast people out while you're always going to have that but you got started a little bit earlier you got to think of the fans that's ridiculous out there in Boston and step all three thirty in the morning\nYeah I mean I think when they schedule the world series I don't think they were planning on a game going Eighteen innings I could be wrong I I'm not very close to you know that you do know that ... you know he and I are not on like amazing terms I mean I you know I used text them all the time but now he's busy with the world's ...\nSecond question for you Arnie yeah maybe I'm being too reactive to the moment\n... does does Dave robbers have to be fired if the Dodgers lose the world series why is this is his fault because they hit a three run Homer that moral and hit the three run Homer or is it because they are brought in jets in the eighth inning\nHe has completely bungled the series in every way shape and form but how is that even possible they were for nothing they were so if they win this game and his two games apiece or they have the momentum in the favorite to win the ...\nFor back to back World Series appearances especially when you have one more than Thirty years of the franchise but going up I'm Sorry\nOh what happened last night when Kennedy Jansen got brought it in the eighth I forget can you can you refresh my memory\nSo ... so you say you're never going to use them again the same thing can be said about kimbrell um for the Boston Red Sox he went through\nA few peaks and valleys also about effect will get Izzy are re um and you can see that he had some trouble especially in the second half of the season but you don't quit if you can't go to your calls are well now you've got a big problem what are you going to do what I mean you're you're you're going through so many pictures you gotta use somebody on the boat\nThat Arnie you love analogies there was that one day where you talked about getting a cut and then it leading to an infection that lead to\nA I don't know amputation or something I forgot what was it was a it was a a crazy analogy so what if the boss decided on a Saturday morning you and I've been doing this radio show for eight months now together I think you like working with me I don't know I like working with you and the boss said you know what to night\nAll you're doing for three hours is full three hours of tennis coverage we need you just talked tennis for three hours we'd say you're out of your mind so what does this have to do with baseball\nCan lead Jansen was never asked to get six hours during the course of the season I understand it professionally is highly copy\nEverybody there was a ... or up to here just said there's a lot of uh starting pitchers that have come in relief that I've never asked them and do that during the course of the year but they'll do it because it's the world series all hands on deck\nAll hands on deck exactly so use the guys you got available to you're asking Kennedy Jansen first\nAll to pitch in a situation he has a pitch and all year to go longer then he'd go gone all year and I thought John ... brought up an interesting point or last night during the baseball broadcast or the baseball broadcast the broadcast it's just a completely different mindset that you're asking the picture to being\nKennedy Jansen but I'm just saying is that at a certain point it does fall on the manager by the way you have a long reliever who's been pitching well Pedro by as as you said already there are other guys you can go to whether it's a a a starting pitcher so\nThe point being you have options besides forcing you're closer in and then by the way already if he does blow to lead you got nobody to close out the game when you get the lead\nBut I guess if you go the extra innings it doesn't matter but the point being I just I just I don't ... he is so mismanaged the series is just driving me\nBonkers well you also gotta remember he's not picking the starting lineup either I guess that comes from a management above a at a ... and sometimes you agree with that sometimes you don't\nUm for all that's worth it's you know on the verge of are not on the verge it's got your back to back World Series appearances and right now it's it's two games to one and you'll notice that game for the back the tide this World Series up at two games apiece but the ... I was a little bit about what were the those two out Hitler killing the Dodgers the Dodgers also have the third highest\nPayroll baseball I mean let's say this is an a plus the underdog story that Dave Roberts rallied the troops I mean and it comes back to me it's just continual bad decisions based on the analytics\nYou know it seems like every decision he makes he makes the wrong one in terms of what the analytical decision is and then what decision he makes whether it was starting review in game two when everybody knows that he pitches significantly better at home when Richard who pitch well tonight has pitched in that cold weather in Boston\nThey they have the right rotation for gave number one sixty three for the first game of the playoffs you know for the for the a tie breaking game\nThough to do in the division and then the start of the playoffs I mean yeah I mean it it it's tough to win every came through the red Sox are adept good team they bought a hundred and they gave us ...\nBut I also don't think that it was that wider gap where you know you lose the two games but you have complete control of this game I'm not saying fire him off of this one game off the one decision to bring in Ryan Madison and then you're bringing Ken Lay Jansen I'm just saying it's the totality of things\nBut it is highlighted by the fact that he continues to bring in his closer in a situation that clearly can lead chances and comfortable and\nIt almost cost them last night it could cost and tonight I just I just don't like the way that he has managed this team and he'd go back to last year was a lot of decisions that he made last year as well including starting you diversion game seven\nOr eight right now it is for for their padding in the bottom of the talking about the Dodgers up in the bottom of the eight they got a ... first nobody out I Believe that the joke Kelly\nInto the game for the red Sox talking about ... or ... of fat um there are yeah you'll see if you either give up a home run or oh strike out the side so we'll see how that goes well keep you updated on that um other games college football obviously we got a lot to talk about their\nWhen they feel is down in New York and I promise you all are talking about football [noise] just for you know we're the ones that you have to\nFace swat sports radio sports when\nYou are the twenty four hours a day or so we got a job and what are we still forty alike\nRaiders nicer Thursday at seven thirty they're non law now these things\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI just think there's broad you might discover card member you buy discover card because we treat you like you treat you discover card Aaron tour is already Spanier Saturday Night a Aaron\n... will be on the air or will the Dodgers game in first so when a which one person that show or the game for for the top of the nice right now\nWell first of all you said you do stuff last night around ... am eastern time I really hope that doesn't happen yeah that'd be bad I mean I'm writing\nCould you imagine get your badge and it goes like another sixteen Seventeen endings and it said another three am game or something like that unbelievable\nI Know and it looks like we're headed there I Know we talked about it last segment I just don't understand bringing in your clothes or he has to get three out all year long bringing them in to get six out for a second night in a row after it backfired on ... uh yesterday\nI let's get to the big NFL story for Jacksonville Jaguars players were detained early Saturday after an incident in London where they are they're obviously to take out the Philadelphia Eagles in the statement that jaguars that the players were the pain\nOver a bill the restitution of a bill or the matter is being resolved I guess the players were going to walk out I'm not exactly sure\nWhat happened or what transpired um I don't see a these players are just going to a club running up a bill and from what I understand it was like maybe a fifty or sixty thousand dollar bill\nAnd just trying to walk out on it though anything's possible\nUm who knows I ever I already from say maybe they were saying hey we you know drank this much but not this much and you know didn't want to pay it either way though you can't have an incident like this uh ... if it gets to be like that you got a call the police\nSay you know will ... will settle this in court but I'm not giving you a dime or something like that\nWill correct me if I'm wrong Ernie but the first of all my bigger problem is well I mean I have many problems with this but\nWeren't the detained or didn't this whole incident happened like for am like I saw something like that yeah that that's my bigger problem there is a you know hey how are they supposed to be in bed aren't they getting ready for game tomorrow or so among many problems that was my biggest one is what are you got a bunch of guys out till four AM\nThings are looking good for Jacksonville right now the problems I wouldn't ... what are you talking about a ...\nThe game last year we shouldn't be surprised that they beat the patriots and week too but I have a feeling we're going to look back on that game like man that was the weirdest result of the twenty Eighteen season or they have they've won one game since that it was against the jets I think there one in five since day one game ...\nYeah All right let's get some college football uh first of all I thought it was a bad day now I don't know what it is or maybe it's because the weather's getting real lousy here on the east just miserable I'm no I I I don't know ... that was it a lot of two teams involved in the top twenty five ... I'm sure there was a few of them there\nI'm not too many games came down to the wire sure you had the Iowa Penn State game but um it was kind of like a home on Saturday I maybe it was a bad but wasn't playing um I\nI don't know what do you feel the same or my way off on this one I\nKnow I felt like that are we going in and I think part of it was just it was an unfortunate scheduling blip but I looked at and I thought about this earlier than we can said why do I feel so interested in these games\nAlabama has by obviously LSU would has a by they always seem to have a by the same week but then oh by the way Michigan has a by Ohio State has a by that's for the ... set out Florida\nThat's five other top a loving wow that yeah and and I would argue three of the biggest brands in the sport three of the teams that you want to tune in to watch\nUh Alabama Texas uh maybe for now if you think about horrible Michigan and Ohio State I mean I mean those are four teams it's tough to to have a weekend without those poor\nNote totally agree on that that's why you know it felt like it was a a an off weekend um reason I'm stumbling as\nI just saw the Boston Red Sox or get a double so now they've got to run around the second one out in the top of the knife tried to get a run and and tried to put pressure on the Dodgers to ten or this game and go three games to one so once again or they weren't guarding the why but that's a left hander up put\nWho got the double salt or keeping her eye on that All right let's get to your Clemson team because you are so excited like your text it because we we can we gotta talk Clemson gotta there's legal so great gotta talk once in a you know pump the brakes was they did play a Florida State team but Gordon\nRubbish about how great Clemson was today\nI mean Florida State for first of all it wasn't just about today Arnie I don't know if you saw last week\nBeat the NC State forty one seven you know we talked about it but yes I Am glad I'm Glad you were paying attention we're doing our show last week it makes me very happy yes they beat wakes sixty three the three a few weeks ago now you know Wake Forest or I don't know they could probably be\nAble to those what you've given me doesn't even that that that doesn't even quite if that's like starving and you're taking a radish and taken a bite out of it that that even close to what are you my appetite\nRight now wow that was a amongst all your analogies that was amongst numbers showed what now that was terrible but the point is is that they're just not just beating teams but their blood shooting them and I think to me the differences\nYou remember two three weeks ago we came on air we talked about the kid that decided to transfer out Kelly Bryant the starting quarterback right I think we're finally seeing why dabble made that move this kid Trevor Lawrence on how close did you watch this game because I'll tell you I got to be\nHonest I I was watching it up to what was your oh zero in the first so I'm a tuning in a little bit more at the end of the first I Know clubs that got that seven nothing leading the next thing I Know before I think it was twenty eight nothing at half time I'm like I don't have time to watch the second half of this\nFor you too busy watching Purdue Michigan State I mean you could just complain that there were no good games you got to a dominant Clemson team making their case we are ready for bam up okay that's a little bit much but\nThe way terminal orange twenty or thirty seven though also so it's not like he has the numbers of tourists\nFor an arm I mean I I Can't there's not many guys that have had this big of an arm in college and I just look at what he brings to the table that defense is phenomenal I Know we don't have a a draft expert readily available to us I think they got like four guys that people were protecting his first round picks\nNow if they can move the ball through the air\nI'm just saying I think that they are finally starting to look like the team that we saw it in the pre season that could match up with them a bam obviously has a tough this next week but I just think Clemson looks really really good and maybe they're ready to compete with the big boys\nI may give you some of the stuff on the earlier games I Hope you're not putting a lot of stock in the what happened in this for the state game\nUm once it got rolling it was all downhill after that and\nThings are not good at Florida State you understand that thought sure that it's it's pretty ugly down there and foreign for is not an acceptable record in Tallahassee I I can only imagine what the fate for say an out there so I got to feel and and I guess some people feel like the team kinda quit on today's game I I could certainly feel that way also\nWill cleanse it or if she'd be Florida State had won three of their last for the one loss was at Miami and the game that they were up by double digits and completely fell apart\nLook I'm not saying this is a good Florida State team this is not a we're not gonna be telling our grandkids about the twenty Eighteen knows here\nBut I also think that they are a a improving team athletically they you know they recruit well\nAnd clubs and just made him look like a Jay Z inter squad scrimmage you didn't come out of that game impressed already I Know for the state's not the uh business but let me ask you this do you always talk about Alabama how great they are ... you know what's the difference between Clemens in\nBeating Florida State by thirty nine points in Alabama beating a Missouri or a Arkansas and Ole Miss by the same result\nNo I I Would say you're close to that also I I I Would say there's a lot of similarities but um\nThe tenth score up there I mean like I said once Scott rolling against them but was all downhill it'd be the ones that got the what ... what are you going to stop keeping town thirty five forty to forty nine I mean they just rolled it up on them okay good victory there\nUm there's no doubt about who was the better ... not good that's not the argument there remember Alabama's out a whole different level though so why why is Alabama on a whole different level well first of all as clubs in face to the fence like Alabama's\n... Texas a m's like in the top twenty in every\nCategory oh come on now even even at that though even the number two team defense isn't close to the number one defensive Alabama were put out there plus two is playing on such a high level I mean jeeze we're looking at something that's unbelievable to play what in the fourth we were seeing something just remarkable here with him\nSo I think even in just the last few weeks Oklahoma has re assert themselves in the big twelve\nBut yeah no Texas will not be in the top ten going for it and I look at it it's not a knock on 'em it's Tom Herman second year it's been so long since they've even been this nationally relevant\nI think the key here not to go corny like coach speak but don't let this one last if if if Oklahoma State holds on don't let this one last turn into two or three because oh by the way you got some team called West Virginia coming to town yeah\nUm I don't know what's going on in Tucson but my Wildcats rub sixteen nothing in the second uh this is a very good Oregon team yes they do have to losses ah and I believe what was the what the Stanford we talked about that game uh which was or was it the ... melted down with that you write better right\nThey have a ball and they ... they had the ball and I think Stanford was out of time outs with like a minute to go and they had a fumble but they not only had a fumble Stanford recovered it they had to drive like eighty yards and under a minute and they did it and that's how the law\nOr we know Notre Dame well we don't know or expect the Notre Dame to be one of the teams in the top for by the way when we give our top four are we giving our top for what we expect we think it is going to be what we expect the BCS top for is going to be or what we expected to be at the end of the year I mean what what are we going to do out of the three\nWhat do you want to do already how about we just do both we do what we think it should be and and what the\nBCS is going to be what what would I Would end up though I think I think my\nOne of my teams I think of what are your teams are inside that top for a Notre Dame just taking care of business do up twenty seven they'll think at that time I'm sure coach Kelley not happy that the navy scored twenty two in the second half and I know that they've got to get a you know a a fun time it practice on Monday that's for sure\nI Would say Brian ... doesn't strike me as it gets very happy about pretty much anything so I Would not be surprised if he had some uh some things to say I'll be interested by the way we talk about that top for in a minute just about how the the committee we talked about Clemens in I Will agree with you that the schedule is a little bit underwhelming\nDoes it a team with one loss like LSU like Michigan start a head of Clemens in just based on the fact that they play tougher competition I think that will be a fun thing to watch as they reveal those teams on Tuesday\nI Will finish up the top twenty five when we get back we'll see what the Dodgers did a ... into the game bases loaded into outs oh well the Dodgers get out of it all the red Sox break it open all that's coming up next he's era tourism only Spanier ... says Fox Sports radio\nCollege football's\n\nIt comes to the LA football coverage on your radio\nWarning shots\nIs it Fox Sports radio\nHey it's been Mather here everybody's got to do is drop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk\nHere's an idea let's that save hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything all you have to do is go to guy code dot com and in Fifteen minutes you couldn't be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance\nThat extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding to do\nInformation technology I\nKnow what you're thinking but I'm not a math and science person no problem no excuses it's not rocket science it's my computer to rear go to my computer career dot edu and take the free career evaluation today\nYou could start your new life as an IT pro in as little as four months my computer career dot edu that's my computer career dot E.

big bowl games on the line and and a certain finishes in the big twelve they they have so much more at the finish of the season\nAbsolutely by the way kind of one game we didn't touch on the first hour we can get back to the the big ones the ... and the ... and everything you see the end of the Kentucky Missouri game\nYes how about that one how was that a little bit of crazy what'd you think about that one because Kentucky when said Fifteen fourteen low scoring game was actually fourteen three going into the fourth Kentucky gets to touch on what the two point conversion to go ahead and get the victory lucky to pull that without huh\nSo what happened was as you said they were down by double digits they get a punt return late in the middle of the fourth quarter\nThey it just feels like they they're just not going to the office just is not moving the ball at All right they get the ball back with about a minute and a half left\nThey drive the length of the field they get one play to win the game they're down by five points they get one play to win the game\nIncomplete pass but they call a pass interference and it was kind of a questionable call because it was one of those throws that it wasn't abundantly clear whether it was actually a catch all ball where there was too far to bounds but\nPass interference not review bull so it allows a Kentucky one extra play they throw the game winning touchdown was zeros on the clock when the game and now by the way they're playing Georgia next week the winner of that is going to be the SEC is Jim\nI'm and I'm I'm started just kind of change is real quick 'cause I Know we have a lot more college football to get to there is a runner on second and and a writer Ryan helped me out that I just see that correctly did did many Machado just pull the same boat\nI don't care what your name is that many but just step on me first basements leg I don't know how can I start telling you that you're you're just he hates me ... it's my fault that the Dodgers are are losing but I think banning but charter just at the same thing running out of ground or the first base stepping on the first basements leg\nOr which in this type didn't have it in the middle of the bag had it on the side of the bag and it didn't get them in the ... like a back of the hill or anything but it did get them in his shoe I I'd have to see the get on ... I just kind of caught the end of it but it looked like he did it all over again\nYeah we're watching the same thing here Arnie um I'm trying to piece it altogether as well many Machado by the way not a very good couple of days you saw yesterday when he [laughter] that it looked like a home run off the bat had yeah south rotting it ended up being a single they also showed it didn't end up mattering because we hit the homerun earlier in the game but\nWhen Cody bell injure had the hard hit balls that looked like it was going to be a double play but shuttle stops running starts running he thankfully you got to third which obviously help them get that for nothing lead when we hit a home run but ah he he stopped running it was a disaster\nNot the best couple days for ... by the way\nI I Wonder if this maybe I'm Crazy here but\nOther teams watching him because he's been kind of a low platform in Baltimore but other teams watching him that are thinking about investing twenty twenty five million whatever it is a year for that guy I Wonder if they're changing their tune after watching them a little bit\nUm because of the lack of hustler or the way it's because of the way the incidents at first base or just overall\nYeah I mean if you're going to pay a guy that much money to be the face of your franchise to be the guy that um you know look I mean when you're paying a guy that much I mean at the very least you would hope that he would run hard to first base when he hit the ball right um and so obviously when you're\nAnd I just don't know look somebody's going to pay him don't get me wrong but I just don't know if this is going to change how people view like is this guy ... we we pay him this\nExorbitant amount of money right you know what I mean like it just feels like one of those deals where if I'm a GM and I'm about to commit a couple you know a hundred hundred and fifty million over however many years I maybe having second thoughts just based on kind of some of the attitude in decision making that he's had during this World Series\nAll right this is what it's going to come down to um right now there's a runner on second with two outs but it's a full count on balance or\nOr it was three one\nIf he somehow gets a Walker gets on pace to put to runners on and they're down nine six who do you think comes up to the plate or representing the tying run none other than a tweak who obviously had the big three run Homer earlier in the game so can you imagine Dodger Stadium\nGoing ballistic if he comes up with a chance to tie the game\nAnd a couple of runners on so we'll see what happens but it doesn't look like that's going to happen\nBecause the red Sox have just one game for nine six Ballenger thanks lying out I Believe it was the best attendee it is over and the red\nSocks of take it they did the one the one more and there'll be World Series champs Dodger fans have to be with\nFor nothing but then again\nIt ended up nine six so can they say that they had the game it's for nothing or\nCan they say they slip away what do you think there and\nThey let it slip away I mean you have a four to nothing lead lead in the game too it wasn't like it they got up for three and the ... home run 'em\nOff Jensen in the eighth is is the one that was the crush her absolutely and then obviously there was a meltdown from there but yeah I mean it wasn't as if they they got up ... or ...\nTo me the most of the networks [noise] argue with goes\nHe's on Fox Sports radio ads\nSon one time event then cardinal mostly here I talked to one of the six points\nTo find one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com or detail\nI'd been up to do a good evening how about that oh wow\nWow wow you there in the morning you spend your um\nUm let's go right out\nThe guy go Fox Sports celebrity ... why joy to tell you about it the big ... dot com that's the big moves dot com or you can read them in Greek underscore get bored that's Greek or the score gambler it's our buddy biggest wrote or how you doing in Vegas rather\nNever better Arnie never better busy day busy weekend of course we have World Series action college football NFL tomorrow big underdog covers on the money line Oregon State being Colorado Colorado was over three thousand favorite meaning you had to put up three thousand\nTo win a hundred or on Colorado win the game outright a hundred guys get back around Fifteen hundred on Oregon State\nAnd that they were able to get the winning over time I don't know anyone that had that chicken in their pocket but it would have made a nice story\nOh that's for sure let's get to the world series first uh if you had the Dodgers and yeah the other you're looking pretty good it ended up with the red Sox the over what a tour around um I don't know if the way the slight came out on what you could bet if the Dodgers when the next three games in a row or what but it's not looking good if you're holding a Dodger ticket right now\nYeah not at all I haven't seen the the adjusted line yet they haven't put one out um it's going to be high I mean when when Boston went up to games to none at it they were about minus\nBoston was still higher than a two to one favorite\nTo win the world series because even historically teams that when that first two games at home they have going on when the world series almost eight out of ten times um that's a pretty high clip even um when they lose that getting three they still\nBeen able to win almost seven out of ten times I'm so I'm getting the wind today uh I think that that adjusted series prices going to be really high I doubt there's going to be any value a on Boston and I don't think it's worth taking a shot on the Dodgers either\nA this was the game they had the when and I I just can't see them winning three straight against the Boston Red Sox right now I just think they're better than him and every position and pretty much you saw that the betting syndicates line up and blast Boston up or the series they better game one they banned them again in game two\nAh so they've been doing well and books have been doing OK to in the world series and then they'll be playoffs as a whole\nNew biggest runner if GM's hypothetically had four players arrested at four AM boomers the night before game how could that potentially a hypothetical what's going on there\nThe first thing they're going to do is pull the number off\nAnd he plays a wage earner on\nOh yeah that that they're afraid to take a Batman I Wish I could say differently\nBut those days off of wanting to be the first they put that number out in and take a position are gone and what they're going to do is they're gonna rip that lying down off the board not let anyone bet into it try to quantify what those players are worth and then put that adjusted number back up there now granted\nSome guys will get that information probably before the books are able to pull that number off and they usually get down on them at a good number a more times than not in today's betting markets they're just not willing to take any\nOr even a future off the board um until they they know for certain what the situation is\nBiggest rather what's going on with Green Bay and the rebellion Rogers never been such a big underdog now the rooms open up to the point favorites I saw nine nine and a half now like you may be possibly dumb ages devalue gone everybody all over the Packers on them\nAnd I'm going to tell you why I'm surprised Arnie because as you know I put my banning accounts for multiple different groups that that when long term and right that that's what I Do um and I see what these guys back and I have a good relationship and I see Powell ratings from some of the top guys and I can tell you with one hundred percent\nCertainty that I Know most casual batters and I got text\nFrom a radio segments I Do and from friends asking me if it was a mistake\nWhen they saw that line the Green Bay was get nine and a half whether it was an error you know because sometimes don't put a mistake up on the board and then they'll they'll fix it um and I said that's just not the case in fact most power ratings of of wise guys show that the line should be even higher\nI'm home so I thought well what happened was the betting syndicates would sit back the public would that Green Bay the line would come down and then Sunday the wise guys would come in and take the rams thinking they're getting the best of it I got surprise because uh yesterday\nI I look into the accounts and\nPretty much every group took a piece of Green Bay plus nine and a half plus nine plus eight and a half that's winds down to where it's sitting right now\nThat's not public money that's wise guy money that force that that line adjustment now tomorrow I think the public's probably still going to come in on Green Bay is well you'll probably get a lotta rams teaser for them not to lose the game at home but I think Green Bay get more than the touchdowns going to be very attractive to casual batters\nSo it's going to be one of those cases where you had the white guys in the public on the same side and that one\nCertain that Sunday night game Minnesota for news about a point they run it looks like it's one of the other way in favor of the things obviously we know how good the the seats are but the Vikings have won three straight what are you making that\n... and here's the situation there in fact if you wanted to bet that game a week ago um the the line was around new uh Minnesota minus three\nUm and then they brought it out at two and a half and that two and a half lasted off twenty minutes on the open Minnesota mine's two and a half\nA groups betting syndicates were lining up taking that two and a half on the saints most believe that the saints are probably won and won a what the rams as the best teams in the NFL Powell rating wise meaning the only team that would probably be favored overdose rams over St Louis ... excuse\nMe over New Orleans on a neutral field would be the rams\nEvery other team New Orleans would be favored over power rating wise\nUm and I think that's why you saw them take a the saints tomorrow night and the thing is Minnesota's been money I mean the one thing you could depend on it it seems it remains been that coach Zimmer excuse me they they they really covered spreads I mean they've been a money maker\nA silk from to see that shark money coming on New Orleans is a telling sign and usually when the team's covered for in a role like that and there are a high profile authentic jog or not like New Orleans you're not getting down to be with them you're usually asked to pay a premium but because you have a Minnesota teen that's also coming in\nHaving won three and a real having covered three in a row\nUm I think that wasn't the case your premium wasn't attached and they took the value in New Orleans I think the only ones is the right side I mean usually back in the day it was easy you bet the saints at home you fade him on the road you're going to cash six out of every ten bats year after year it's changed this year they play three games they want\nA guy I spoke to there are hoping the public comes in on the over like they do on most primetime games and if this total gets higher I think you're going to see by orders come out from a lot of the sharp and they're going to take that under I'm expecting a more defensive game because you don't remember if you look the\nSaints I mean over the last three games they allowed only an average of of a less than twenty points\nUm and in Minnesota you know there are good defensive team especially at home so I could see this being a lot lower scoring um than that total reflects so I think there's some value on the under and I got to agree with the Sharm federal New Orleans I Do think this is the best if not the second best team in all of the NFL\nI was before we let you go what's going on with the raiders or it was a ... do you mean that was known with reborn favorite all the money on ... ... for obviously the raiders or in turmoil what's going on here\nThat's exactly what it is Arnie and this is a simple case of of of sharp money getting out I headed up by the market because when tomorrow coms and that's when Ninety percent of the public that's NFL on game day um you're gonna see seven to eight out of every ten tickets written on that game on the Indianapolis site\nUm and if this that the books are forced to come off that three which they probably are because right now it's three minus one twenty five I'm so if you want to take Indianapolis he got put up one twenty five to win a hundred it my three\nSo the next step is three and a half when it goes the three and a half I think a lot of those guys that got down on on Indianapolis at a pick 'em will probably take Oakland plus three and a half or a little bit and try to work on middle there\nI just I mean how does a Dodgers fans feel confident that in the big games Dave Roberts going forward is gonna be the guy even if you get back to the world series\nI think the Dodgers going to have a tough decision ahead I can see your point Ernie I'm not going to argue with you and say you're wrong you are often but not necessarily on this one but I I'm kidding but I could see the argument from Dodgers fans and I can't look at this guy I Can't watch this guy why\nIs this because that he loved one guy in two long or pulled one guy too short or\nHere's on is that what's going on here well I think it's the totality\nOf the last couple years and and I know look people are going to say that that he is\nA you know working on behalf of of the the front office in the front office hired him because they want it to work with somebody that really believes in the analytics I get all that but I mean when you go back to last year starting ... game seven when you have claimed her shy obviously it would have been on short rest but\nYou know your drivers had struggled in the world series and then this year obviously pitching reviewing game too when he has had so much success at home maybe a bump them back and start bringing up rich or whoever it is um\nYou could go on and on down the list by the way we were on air the other night when he brings in Clinton cursed Shaw for no particular reason in a mass when they have a massive lead against the brewers it just seems like there's all when we were asking\nA ... that's what I brought up the point that um he was playing\nShenanigans and bring him in when he's and he ended up starting clean car saw what a couple of days later I think a more exactly\nAnd so the whole point is it just seems like ... and again I get that the reason he was hired was because he understands the analytics he's working in conjunction with the front office\nBut you can't tell me the front office has gone down to to the to the um to the uh to the bench asking him hey change this guy have changed that guy pinch run this guy\nThrowing the lefty here he is using the analysts provided to him to make these decisions and I just think he's made too many bad ones on too many big spots\nI just I don't trust

I think seven of a runners on base all to score that's incredible\nYeah I I heard that as well I was blown away by that he put in Kennedy Jansen I understand he's the best reliever but you're asking him to do something that he hasn't done all year which is try to get six out and I ...\nHe blew the save last night too and so\n... that's one where you know I don't know who the pitcher is but you know I don't know ... I don't know I just ... this is why you have a five six men bullpen you got to figure out a way rye imagines not work in\nA I Know Pedro by a supposedly wasn't available today\nAnd put to putting Kennedy Jansen after what happened last night I just don't like to move and you add it up with all of the other moves over the last two years ... game seven last year bringing her show after it was too late\nThis year bringing encourage Sean game uh you know in in the clenching game in the end they'll see as for no apparent reason other than to be cute I just think he just doesn't have a big game feel and by the way aren't you know what you're saying about two straight World Series but certain ... guys can get you to the king gets you there but can't win it\nIs there a guy you have in mind that supposed to take you over the top two women that magic in the world series or interesting or we just make the move here because we don't like they Robertson I can see the criticism coming in on them I Love the Roberts I\nThink he's actually a good manager I'm not even a Dodger fan so I'm you know ... again ... yup peaks and valleys I'm a Mets fan look without going through um [noise] I I just\nDon't see this infatuation with let's get rid of days off then why don't they do exist there why was it okay to fire Don mattingley after four straight and I was titled um who said it was okay to fire him\nAlso and I also said it wasn't okay to fire John Farrell now sure it worked out in some people's case worked out for the Dodgers worked out for the red Sox um\nBut it's not a perfect example that sometimes a guy can be good enough but just not be able to get the job done in the beginning he spoke managers do the least amount that's why they get paid less than ... hours\nThat the the Roberts does too much he makes too many decisions he just he makes too many just\nThe news too you know who's behind the analytics and when you make the changes like that but anyway it's three games to one and you got Chris salad Clinton gr saw a well beyond the mouth or I wouldn't want to see the game start maybe an hour earlier but they would never do that because of the of the west coast they have to always be cognizant\nAnd make sure it starts out like eight o'clock in the east\nIs that honestly why they do it I I've I've always wondered why doesn't even just like a seven thirty because then I Know the talk is well kids can't stay up this\nHere's here's the difference they get better ratings if they have to go from midnight to two AM and then they would from four pm to five PM\nInteresting okay well you know on the west coast that's why they don't started early because they'd rather say okay we'd rather let it run late and let it get through midnight into one AM will still get a higher ratings that if we have to start at four o'clock in the afternoon and the west coast which is seven o'clock on me so\nOkay that makes sense I Know that you didn't make it to two am\nYeah though it was three thirty a would it be to a a ... you have to be up 'til three thirty in the morning that's that's incredible that you know that that's a that's a lot of ours they are ... ...\nOne last thing I was going to say I will I Will be positive 'cause I've been a little glass as half empty right now if the red Sox do in the world series based on today you know I'll be happy for\nNathan of all the after what he did last night to take the loss yeah after he basically pitched a complete game in our innings what six pause that was unbelievable yeah and and for him to to take the loss in if obviously if the Dodgers had one today the whole series flips them I don't I don't think he would have been a quote unquote goat or anything\nBut I mean he is basically officially off the hook at this point\nFor twenty specialist Red Sox have a better roster but only slightly the wins or have all been for the Dodgers are but they gave him away each opportunity stressful what am I saying the Yankees have the same exact problem um\nGave me the day Robert ... we've for us in every game that that's not quite fair\nWell and and I would ask you I mean at what point I get the analytics are there to help with all these decisions but at what point do you have to also go with your gut do you have to sit there and say\nRIAA Madsen just hasn't gotten the job done for us\nKennedy chance and it's a lot to ask him to get six out I mean I'm not sitting here and saying that I have all the answers and I hate to be the armchair analysts guy because I I Know that a lot goes into all the decisions that get made but I think at some point you got to put your big binder down and actually make decisions based off field based off\nOne of the red Sox did that last game where they sat been attendee down who was betting five hundred dollars on base percentage of what five sixty in order to keep Jackie Bradley junior they're not rally for hit the home run 'em but

I may maybe it's Eighteen I I'm five in two yeah there are five and to be a Nineteen my eyes are on that yeah no 'cause I was going to say how would they be a top ten to Yuma to losses but\nAh and going for a third by the way I was just telling Ryan Dennis this really quick or new producer how great would it be Washington state the only real legitimate pack twelve playoff contender they have one last how great would it be Mike Leach in Washington state made the college football playoff\nWhat he has done up there and took a take it over a program\nOr talking about that in the dumps he is just I mean one of the best coaches under rated ever I mean it's it's just phenomenal what he's done up there and they get the kids that go up there\nUm I by the way before we get into the NFL real quick tiger versus filled Nineteen Ninety nine or ... going up the money for that are you going to go ahead and pass\nI might I might I found it interesting and that no one put this parallel together\nThey're doing it the day after Thanksgiving which was the day that all the drama started with his ex wife remember it was the day after Thanksgiving that friday when she took the golf club to his car\nBecause of ah what what he was obviously doing on the side right I'm just amazed like no one's pointed that out that we've come whatever full circle whatever it is eight years later where his his life basically spirals completely out of control\nAnd then eight years later he uh he's making all that money but I'll ... I'll probably pay for them\nWhat's your name again ... air in the right now now that sounds like you have to some anyway so no but I Would say a\nI'm a ... whatever your name is again ... remember when we used to get the world series and the Superbowl for free and now we got to pay for it that's that's the way the future you know that don't you were gonna soon we'll be paying for World Series Superbowl uh NBA championships that's just the way it's going to be I Believe\nWell I mean don't we pay with our cable package though what do you mean like\nYou'll have to pay extra like if you want to get the super bowl it's like fifty bucks a or forty nine Ninety nine kind of like when you want to buy a fight or UFC or am I may or something like that and the pay per view and you have to pay Ninety nine dollars or something to that effect\nYeah I mean look I I don't I never really thought about it I mean I don't think so probably because\nThe thing is right is that I Do think that TV landscape is changing right but if people if a big company like Google or Facebook wants to stream games on line they're still gonna do it for free so I don't know I mean I I think the way we consume in is different but I don't know that everything's going to be pay per view you really think so\nOh I mean we've certainly have added a lot of pay per view and now you know doing the specialty things I'm not a golf guy and I would pay the Nineteen Ninety nine or just to see Phil and and tiger um I Would pay for that just for the entertainment value of oh\nOf course I Would pay fifty dollars for a Super Bowl I pay Ninety nine dollars for a Super Bowl I'm just wondering how will play out for the networks um that you know have the play by play coverage\nYou know how does that play out you know when people are buying it for Ninety nine dollars that's the only difference I let's get some football eagles and jaguars that games in London\nUm I was gonna say tell me a team that you think needs to win back against the wall\nEvidence five but mad talk about both teams doesn't really need of a whim though it seems like the jaguars or more desperate shape I think what they're doing the quake portals is completely unfair putting all the blame on him I think they've taken away as confident that's not the way to get back to the AFC Championship um and of course\nIt's not like portals fault that you have an injury to your wide receiver and you can get for net back on the field healthy so um I think he's getting a lot of unfair advantage in this one or unfair a criticism and this one air and\nOh absolutely and I mean look two weeks ago the defense gives up forty the cowboys\nA week before they give up thirty the chiefs and I know that she's bedroom homes that high scoring team in the NFL so it's a little bit unfair but I think the point still stands the defense has some part in this as well\nBut yeah you talk about two teams desperately needing when I Do agree Jacksonville needs one more just because that division is tougher with Houston getting really hot right now it feels like the NFC East\nI mean one at nine and seven is going to win that that that division whether it's by Philly right by the cowboys by the Redskins I Do agree that Jacksonville probably needs is when more although as we've talked about this London situation I don't know that I feel that confident that Jacksonville is going to get through it\nAll right let's get to the jets in Chicago a bear fans have come back to life real fast or I mean there were three in one or come back to earth is what I meant to say there were three in one they've lost two in a row\nOr the drop the three and three or their seasons I'm not going to stay on the line but if they want to make a playoff run it starts with the whole game against the jets there are big favorite and that's just one\nLook Michel ... running around and you know getting in the ads on some crazy runs last week that's fine and dandy\nHe's got to win games with his arm I don't know if if he's capable of winning games with his arm I think it's going to be a lot closer\nThan people think I'm by the way\nTim Mak is been hurt which is why he hasn't been as dominant also but I like Chicago still in this game\nYeah I Do too I mean look first of all ... going down the road for the first time in three weeks they had three straight home games the jets so he's going on the road but the other thing is we talk about ... when I Do think for the bears it is because\nThe bears that division it's so competitive and look is there a Super Bowl contender and that division probably not\nBut Minnesota's playing well they've won three straight games you know Green Bay is going to be ... is going to get better over the course of time if Aaron Rodgers can kind of get that new healthy I Know it's that can be pretty tomorrow necessarily but\nGreen Bay is still Green Bay\nAnd of course Detroit Detroit's kinda quietly playing well nobody's right yeah so I just think this is one look there are certain games that you look at it on the schedule that huge ... you gotta win and two weeks after you let broadcast weather and the dolphins beach uh\nThis is one of the bears have any shot of making a run at even a wild card berth you got to get this went against the jets at home\nThe buccaneers or in Cincinnati and taking the bagels do the bagels\nOr foreign one coming off a victory against the Miami Dolphins now they've come back to earth a little bit and foreign three last thing they need to do is lose it onto a buccaneers team like this and follow the five hundred a buccaneers of three and three and and right now or you want to talk about James Winston Andy Dalton both quarterbacks at a crossroads\nNot only in their career but how far they're going to take their team I don't know of any dog is going to be around much longer on Cincinnati I liked Cincinnati this game\nBut then the gate and they can't stand the loser slight favorite I Believe they're much better than the buccaneers but I'm curious to see how this gives you the go and play out there and\nAnd it's exactly what I just talked about what the bears is that with the bangles here you just can't lose this game the good thing with the bangles\nMaybe you could say the same about the NFC East where I wouldn't be surprised if any actually I I don't even said about the end of east but\nAny of the four teams I wouldn't be totally shocked if they won the division now obviously Cleveland the last couple of weeks they've come back down to earth I I\nI Would be somewhat surprised but I still wouldn't be shocked but so that's the good news for Cincinnati but I think what you said on anti Dolan is so important is even when they were winning games statistically they weren't as good as their record indicated they've come back down to earth\nLiving on bell I'm Still shocked the guy's not back in here I don't think it was going to go this long if on the Steelers I don't want them back I don't want to pay him any money I'm fine with Conor who's out almost five hundred yards rushing\nSaid someone costly fumble is one of them cause them in a tie against the browns but I think this is kind of role in this game against Cleveland\nI agree and it's interesting because it's not often I can say this but I actually think Hugh Jackson made kind of a good point this week which is and again that's very rare but\nHe said at some point you got to think that these overtime games are starting to wear on on this team is they they've now played for overtime games and the point that he made was we've probably played the equivalent of a full game in overtime or ... to it\nAnd I wonder if this is when we start to see like I said they've taken a step back obviously to losses\nAre in a row they lost the chargers pretty ugly a few weeks ago they bounce back they had the chance to beat the or the ... last week\nBut now we're getting in teams have seen them for the second time in the division I Know that Baker may feel didn't play the first time it gets the Steelers but I think it's a tough tough ask especially by the way when the Steelers you know they could have lost this team and we\nWon the ravens are in care whether to take on the ... took about eight months to a game for both teams to go ahead and uh take another step forward to the playoffs ravens a foreign three Panthers foreign to end this should be a game that the ... when I got to tell you cameras played better than I even thought I thought the ravens were tad bit over\nAnd I wanted to see Joe Flaco be able to get on the road I I don't think you could do without a care why did give me Caroline in this game\nUm with your grand a lot here already it's kind of scary but I the the Panthers I think are one of those teams like I don't think they're going to win the division because of how well the saints are playing but it wouldn't surprise me to see them get to the playoffs pulling upset place somebody maybe even like the rams tough now I'm not saying they would beat him but with\nThe way that defense plays and they kind of sneaky have a lot of weapons with the way Christian McCaffrey plays Devon punches\nA I just I liked the makeup of that team a lot and like I said I think they're going to be a team that scoops up one of those wild card burst and give somebody a problem in the playoffs\nArizona thirty seven Oregon Fifteen or when we come back we'll give your Fishell picks against the spread will finish going through the gate of the valley there and

years they've allowed me to remind your up close and personal so this is a fun journey every Saturday Night Olympian Pacific two am eastern\nAnd again we want you along for the ride why this is straight out of Vegas the pregame show you always want it now our focus is NFL preview and we'll get down to business and just a second but RJ\nLittle house cleaning the Dodgers in their history now they've won six world championships and three of those six were done after falling behind to zip they were to zip at one point even to one another three one is there any value remaining\nOn the series price on either side on the go forward bases\n[noise] you know nothing ... I mean to me there's something about this Red Sox team\nWhereas and maybe this is a reverse engineering hey look they just came back they they're fighters remember red sauce had home\nField advantage against the Astros and were underdogs entering that series even with the home field so this is not like an all time great team\nSo but to me the Dodgers it it it just feels like maybe the amount of scrutiny in the Twitter age and with ... Roberts managers approach it just feels like that everything's so much harder for\nThem I Would just say that the red Sox are a team that has now won a hundred and Eighteen baseball game since April the mold through to one hundred when teams on the way to the world series the Dodgers at one point sixteen and twenty six and may almost fell out in September give 'em credit for dinner Boston to the better team\nI think so and one of the things we've talked about\nDuring the Daily Show is that baseball really isn't about how well you do in the regular season when it comes to the playoffs\nBut there is that mentality said to me ... I made that something I'm probably probably won't be gained four have you I haven't even looked have you looked at the odds\nYet haven't looked ahead yet on it I don't go ahead continue and I'll pull him up and see what we ... well\nI haven't looked ahead yet ah because I I'm not sure if they've announced who the Dodgers starting pitcher is going to be we know what's going to be ... sale for Boston but uh and I I gotta I gotta tell you the the values on Boston tonight because the Dodgers\nSlaying Hans ... eight well outside of that group plus one plus one forty five coming back well but but to me is the idea that oh it's a must win\nFor the Dodgers are it was yeah and I don't think that helps you embrace no I think must win his most overused ... games left to be played well for sure but the and again let's not get to ... into the semantics of ... oh it's not life or death\nBut the idea of what the stakes are right and football is the stakes are high for one team and not the other that\nSo it's not about effort if anything pressure can be a negative ... so in general\nMy advice would be I like to bet on their dogs and baseball also have a team has a high stakes quote unquote much when I'm not anxious to play on them oh by the way the money did come in tonight on Boston as you said\nMinus one sixty opened up Dodgers got down to one for ...\nAnd there is no odds yet up on the next game though it looks like at least the expectation curse Sean Price is what's up right now for game five\nAll right in a second we get to the NFL real quickly are gee we're just hours away from the first four roll out of the college football playoff final for my malls are telling me Alabama will be one Notre Dame will be to class and will be three who will be for Jay hold on saying you got Moses how I got moles baby\nFirst off as David decided this yet\nWho who who they the plan committee oh I think I think you're very wet when did the playoff committees when do they make\nIt some claimed to an operation on where I think into thinking it's after the games are played right [laughter] so how can you have loans already well keep in mind [laughter]\nAlabama didn't play today and they're still still undefeated Clemson dropped so to Notre Dame the you're saying you're your own mall you're you're very logical\nMind\nWe will get the Freddie fanny pack in a haystack Hank later I'll tell you what what are we going or ours Mr papa Jo Jones you've got [laughter] very nicely done and you've got so much good stuff from this past week and by the way I Am not only\nVery happy to be a part of the show on Saturday Night I have a listener during the week as well so let's jump to it because\nYou got a good game tomorrow that's really gotten a lot of talk and you know if you want to step in front of this free\nSee this line tomorrow I Believe it's nine you know can are gaming headed minus three before the ... and started so that's what happens when you go seven oh\nOne let's think about that so they put out the odds are in June every game cancer does yep kudos for them on that three is the typical home field so expectation come in and year\nGreen Bay rams equal team's home field gets three now it's up to nine nine and a half\nWhich speaks to obviously the rams\nFar exceeding expectations and also quite frankly Green Bay fallen short somewhat\nLost like ... thousand percent this is a game everybody's got opinions on but sometimes it's best left to the pros handicap these situations which is exactly what our gene physic did earlier this week let's take a listen\nWhat we know is is having a borderline playoff team against the best team in the league and that borderline teams on the road this line and nine and a half has not crazy not unusual it is so Aaron Rodgers biggest underdog of his career he's never been this big of a dog [noise]\nAnother way to say that I think is Green Bay has never been this bad around them because even though the rams are clearly the best team in the NFL [noise] I don't think the rams are historically good [noise]\nYou know they're rated right about we're a Super Bowl champs typically wind so every given year you're going to have a team that's right around where the rams are correct so\nIdea that grain base played in Super Bowl of Green Bay obviously gets my Steelers day one and two thousand ten season and no doubt but I is it fair to say that the Packers are the worst team that Aaron Rodgers has ever been shrouded by oh I think so so what are they miss it\nThe sports a little while later ...\nRaiders neither Thursday at seven thirty they're not in law now\n\n[noise] back on straight out of Vegas ... you might discover card we treat you like you'd treat you Margie I smell a ... year\nWell you know what happened I already got you in my Web sleepy Jay or Vegas producer here reminded me we made this that last week I got ... again it too so let's repeat it ... and all the listeners can say man RJ another good bat in his pocket\nWho will make the super bowl for the AFC\nYou took the patriots I did I took the chiefs even money oh by the way ... took that bad to repress the green\nButton [noise]\nWhich means a bat and we'd better hundred on the right even money if I remember a hundred dollar okay now\nIf you look at the odds right now New England to make the super bowl plus two twenty five Kansas City to make the super bowl plus one Seventy five so once again I got the best of it\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nTo review the tuition paid maybe we are going to revisit this as the shooter you know the shows progressive throughout the fall when your hand the money over well it will no in January you'll have to wait that long but I still say the road to the super bowl do through Fox Pearl\nSo stay tune and we'll see who collects for the record RJ collected on the earlier but we had this year so I'm minus one hundred I'm looking to get back even on the loss is looking to get back even or gee\nWhat's being billed as the quote revenge game the same visit the Vikings Vikings beat them twice last year and I got to tell you there's a side here\nInformation favors the other side but let's go back to the pros ... jump some time on the game as weak let's take a listen\nMy rationale is me a lot a narrative about redemption from the Minnesota Miracle I'm not I think both of these teams are max motivated I don't think that goes past and\nI think the same just pay the physical game on the road against Baltimore they want to call you flap everyone's all excited Vikings have achieved the fender back thirty second early handicap on this game fast\nYeah I think it's a great spot on point that the fact that the saints won that game now they are on the road again so they know and against Baltimore and now they go on the road against another top team really difficult to win both those games on the Minnesota defense which was bad\nEarly in the year is improving gave up Twenty one points than ten points than Seventeen points of defense did the last three games they're trending upward you bring it up to their um past Russia comes back this week Michael and\nHe had a stat last three games the Vikings have allowed five third down convergence three games five third down conversion successful that the defense trending up\nBack here straight out of Vegas important point one of the reasons we do the show alive Saturday Night Bernie\nSaints have gotten even more money since Friday St her up to one and a half point favorites here and I've actually gotten less enthused about Minnesota early in the week\nWednesday let's call it Minnesota probably was my favorite part of the week now\nDidn't even put it in our super contest gold we had five entries or five picks we had to make didn't even make it why 'cause it was paid gum and now it's up to saints one and a half why defensive injuries were the Viking ... and to me when you've got injuries of non\nCasual fan Freddie fanny pack does not count oh there's some linebacker I never heard of out who cares well it matters\nYou've got Drew Brees playing in a hall of fame level against her cousin's a forty seven percent winning percentage quarterback as a starter in his career who's by the way for nine and his career against teams were the winning percentages seven fifty or better\nI don't want to you started this game Margie I just simply think Minnesota's loomed valued right now because everybody ... you still remembers what happening is buffalo almost obscene off this game\nYeah I I I don't think that's a bad approach I still would if I forced to buy the Vikings but I think that the defense of injuries or an issue and as I said last point of this game\nThe mainstream narrative of oh revenge hey both teams are motivated Vikings need this to me for a good playoff position or even make the playoffs which is uncertain if they lose this game\n[noise] All right let's move ahead a course raiders dumpster fire game in a sense raiders obviously on life support given what they've done in the last few weeks but Jackie Jackie's tenet for coming off of buying his career again RJ had some common who's jockey\nHe's got the name of John grew wise each hockey that's been his nickname for Twenty years 'cause he looks looks like the Truckee\nDo [laughter] I Do [laughter] me I can drop some knowledge casually but let's hear the knowledge\nYou had to drop earlier in the week as you analyze the colds raider game from professional perspective let's take a listen\nAnother example of a front office move that's a signal and again it's a negative single single for the raiders wait a minute max gone hot that doesn't make a lot of sense and now your number one or two receiver how you look at it with no sense\nThey're drastically the sense in Vegas is we're not sure if the raiders are really focused on winning right now burning who pick these cuts\nThe fine men back in Los Angeles 'cause I I probably misspoke like four times this whole week for five hours or ... I didn't hear anything and somehow they they don't you talking about they find one would expect stumble upon word how does that I can open [laughter]\nBy the way I [laughter]\nIs chunky like a ...

the bride's play the Steelers and weak one the\nTurnover margin so the net turn over in the game was Brown's plus five\nIf you go back Thirty years teams that are plus five [noise] far one fifty eight and six straight up and oh by the way one tie the browser so imagine if it was only six times out of a hundred and sixty four games that the team doesn't win\nAgain when there plus five and the browns or one of them boy that tells you Pittsburgh out played them much more than the scoreboard indicates\nI'm not in a hurry to a lady the points you're I think the consensus might be Pittsburgh's angry they're hitting the stride defenses as you said last week in food a Baker may feel but I think this game could be tight\nBe I think that it's usually dog or pass for me if it's over a touchdown and because the Steelers are awful by and the analogy I Would quickly give is if you're playing your eleven year old nephew\nIn basketball in the back yard and you can beat him pretty much any time but you're going to live in and it's like nine nine and scores to like unlikely shots\nThat next game I'm like the bond that had like ... he's going to be living in their Hedges All right so Steelers end this analogy it's the man and the browns or the eleven year old I think there's some paying comment\nAnd you could save Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance RJ the forty\nNiners visit Arizona and I I don't want to say this Arizona often is bad but I don't think they've got more than two hundred and Seventy yard per game in their last seven games I don't think that's good do you I thought you had like a Rodney Dangerfield Joe I Want to save that\nNow we've got to fall if you if you think Arizona's these bad it's like my well bad it was like I I mean I don't know I'd I I agree with you though\nAnd listen car does change all kinds of coordinators ... and we can debate how many pre season games are necessary the genius ... says he considers September to be his extended the pre season

are you talking about what is this your first day on the job [noise] here's Joe did not get enough\nPlaying grandma Franco game it right or wrong\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo there's going to be something that many of you are not going to want to do it's going to be sort of an enjoyable it's not going to be the norm for a lot of you but you're gonna have to do it because you got to be honest about what you're watching in the world of sports it took place again on Saturday Night all explain what I mean given up here momentarily I'm Jonas\n... this is Fox Sports radio\nYou can check out the show on the eye heart radio lab you can always catches on serious that examined channel eighty three\nAnd on all of our Fox Sports radio affiliates wherever you are taking part in the program we always appreciate a few minutes your time as you can be alive you ever need Geico Fox Sports radio studios were Fifteen minutes good debut Fifteen Percent or more car insurance visit guy go dot com or a free rate quote\n\nSo this is going to be a sort of an awkward conversation for a lot of you guys because it's going to kill a lot of what people like to do this time of year going to be very difficult um\nAlso mean that you have to have a crappy day at work okay you have a choice those two are linked together right it's not a package deal it's not a you buy in bulk\nLike it just became like one doesn't dictate the other you have a say in how this works out if you get into an argument at a bar with your lady\nDoes that mean you have to go and drive home drunk you don't have to you have control over this\nYou can very easily taken ... or make a different decision or figure out something ... and figure out your next step you don't have to do those things they aren't linked\nBut for some reason in sports and this is really funny when a player fails to do his job we blame the other people who put them in that spot sometimes\nAren't linked just because one is done doesn't mean the second half has to also be done that somehow this works\nThere are choices here there are different outcomes here it doesn't always have to be tied together so the Dodgers that aid for nothing lead on Saturday Night\nAnd they were rolling just had gotten the big three Ron blast ... big up for to zip\nThe red Sox after losing that heartbreak or a ... that translated into a seven plus our game we were on the air for\nOn yesterday show the red socks look to look out of it they looked uh disenchanted it looks I mean all the momentum as completely so long in the series so the Dodgers have got this for nothing lead and it looks like we've got a pivotal game five back at Dodger Stadium on Sunday night\nAnd guess what the Dodgers did they blew it\nThey choked guess who's getting the blame for it\nOh so that means that Ryan mats and has to give a ... a three run bomb and morph into a gas can't on the mound the entire series okay that's the Roberts fault okay I I guess those two things are linked\nYeah but he can lead Jansen inverse six out save already put Ken Lay in that position oh so that means because Dave Roberts put them in that position that can lead Jansen you know had to give up the tying home run\nYou have to use made too many bullpen moves like all these different moves in and moving pieces in parts in Alex word and all these other guys that are coming in on the bullpen like Dave robbers made way too many bullpen moves he's he's outside himself\nThis time oh so that means that that because he made all those bullpen moves that bullpen had to melt down\nOn the biggest stage so because he made all these bullpen moves because he put ... into the game ... had to give up a three run double to put the game out of reach\nThat had to have those two things are linked a debt that to this had happened so that's a hundred percent on day Roberts fault it's a hundred percent on him\nLike just because one thing goes wrong doesn't mean everything has to also go wrong\nYou keep trying to find what's to blame what happened here know sometimes people make mistakes sometimes people don't do their job\nBut ... Roberts is the guy that's getting crushed everybody's looking to point fingers and the guy they're pointing the fingers at our day Roberts here was Dave Roberts talking about the decision to take out rich hill on Saturday Night\nWe figure you got a chance to get a guy who measure really well against hole and then to potentially ... to the other guys off the bench it was more of just\nThe conversation I had and just realizing that members\nJob that they're capable of doing or they wouldn't be there if they fail that's not Dave Roberts fault\nHe can't see into the future\nHe doesn't know what the winning lottery numbers are going to be he doesn't know for sure whether it can lead Jansen is going to provide a six out save or whether he's not going to provide a six out save but he knows that the odds are in his favor\n\nI understand that regardless of what you hear about how baseball has changed and now it's a different approach in analytics the same thing goes that's gone in baseball for a long long time what do they call a good batting average in baseball three hundred you could even states to Seventy nowadays\nYou know what that means if we were to just break it down up three hundred batting average means that stepping out of ten times you're going to get out\nOf pitcher always has the advantage he's making moves with players who seemingly always have the advantage in the history of baseball there's\nBeen a couple of guys that have gone off the charts and only gotten out six out of ten times but that's rare so he's putting in players who have an advantage a built in advantage and they're not delivering that's not David Roberts fault\nIt's not his fault you know what it could have been avoided you could have just kept ritual and how do you read shown\nWouldn't have turned into a gas can towards the end ritual reportedly told them that they keep an eye on me seemed like he was a little exhausted seemed like he was a little out of gas\nSo Dave Roberts trust them professionals to get the job done\nThey didn't do it\nBut we always want to find somebody to blame knows it it's just easier that way well let's go ahead and some ...\nThat's in and Alex wood and all these other and ... there's just not enough room on the on the ah typing here there's not enough room in this headlines who should I just go day Roberts just easier sounds better rolls off the tongue we'll just go day Roberts if you put your faith in something\nAnd it fails it doesn't have to be your fault I got news for you if this shows sucks tonight if I lay a total aid for three hours guess who's fault it's not\nIt's not Sam the tech producers fault it's not Ryan Dan is the executive producers fault it's not Ralph or even the update anchors fault it's not the editors who are just tear Katie it's not my boss who's fault it's nobody else's fault except for mine I suck to own it it's not on them\nComing up later on Sunday I'll get to that here coming up momentarily I Do want to welcome in the crew though a ladies and gentlemen there'll be writing shock come with me until six am eastern time no World Series game live on\nThe air thank God [noise]\nSo we get back to a ... somewhat normally and normal and regularly scheduled program ah your technical producer Iowa Sam is in the building\nAre we doing their job that I should be I don't ... I should be asking the uh the Iowa was ... right um I was on that and um no not really bad you bend the elbow a little bit today I watch them anymore no that's the only way to preserve my body that there's a [laughter] ah\nFor people that are just tuning in you want all of me yeah no I got to preserve the body or\nWell for people that are just tuning in Iowa Sam is the number one Iowa Hawkeye fan in the country\nWhatever metric determines that yes and and there's been\nA real issue with his fatigue following some of these Iowa Hawkeye games because I feel like they always end up the same [laughter] I don't know if that's it and I don't know nearly as much about I\nAnd you always just seemed to shrug your shoulders and say oh I just I'm used to it that's just what it is\nYeah I mean they they play ... was a lot of NFL style kind of like Ben don't break playing not to lose it gets you winning records but you give some games that maybe you wish you had back\nYou know so well we did actually are throwing my shoulder and we did actually put together a special tribute from a Kirk ferrets to you I was in a bit of a surprise or Ralph urban hit it please\nThank\n\nThat was the right over the game ... yeah that was the last ... they got to go forty hours he flips as to the linemen because that's all they had left\nI mean around by the way route to UCLA fan and their their their bordering on eight man football and they didn't have all kinds of lime and yeah it's a it's a bad one and plus the Hawaii right now is this just to show ... why is Hawaii now they reenter oh five no yeah ever since I left the island man they haven't been the same I mean I can only do so much\nAh so I Would say I'm a zero we will be a fire it up all the way until six am eastern time with him or your executive producer everybody Ryan Dennis back for a night to here on Fox Sports radio\n[laughter] say you Dennis\nAnd that was me yeah it was right on the liberal I'm speaking of show a chance or a show losers how 'bout them Trojan sort of\nYeah ... it looked at that that yeah it's ... everybody on the shows a loser that's what I realize everybody's a loser my Hawaii ... rainbow warriors got blasted\nUm clay help might get fired for help might get clipped at the end of the season and then a standard I Walk I\n... here at Fox Sports rally at least we can all you know share you know just just revel mediocrity for tonight yeah why not didn't annoying it man it's kinda nice just y'all are losing together just\nOne minute look sometimes your do your do ... and you are a scapegoat tunnel of crap and you you rip your shirt off and you look up in the heavens and it rains and then sometimes you get stuck in that tunnel crap we are right now I'm lazy I'm In the most violent man in sports talk radio is your national update anchor he is Ralph or even\nTake any ... come on route there's kids listening all I can think about is at ... yeah that's a [laughter] who\nThat's a that's a very disturbing the way you said that I'm a A N and quite quite erotic to Ralph our you know goodbye you\nBuy ... will have the uh the world a premier of weird world of Ralph\nComing up later on in\nThis hour with imaging we did it once before a little bit of a test pilot this one is the official launch the weird world of Ralph with imaging and in in intro coming up later on in the hour you've cited Ralph absolute ... it's going to be fun\nI so I so that is the crew or we're going to be a altogether 'til six am eastern time a same shenanigans um some inappropriate behaviors offensive language some football talk just I mean we represent all food groups here on weekend overnight radio on Fox Sports radio\nAs we can be live from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios what does it mean one guy go says just Fifteen minutes continue Fifteen Percent or more and car insurance\nMeans you probably should have gone to a guy could ... Fifteen minutes ago so everybody wants to value\nA growing up everybody wants you wanted to get a value like have you ever sit in a drive through and they got the value menu like what can you get the most stuff for the cheapest like we all do that I grew up poor man my family was all about\nOr or you know like our thinking was well try a hundred paper plates as opposed to the twenty five that are going to last longer and so you get like the one paper plates to where if if if it just stays damp on there for more than like three and a half minutes it starts breaking through the bottom like that's what we grew up with\nWhat you want to get value and you want to get the most the ... the ... value you can get it right Cosco is still in business you don't need a thousand rolls of toilet paper\nYou don't need to like ... ... don't worry about it you're not going to crop your pants you don't need a thousand rolls of toilet paper you don't need Fifteen jugs of scope\nOne is fine\nOkay if you're going to buy a box of corn dogs just skip the box at ten you don't need the industrial size that they send to county fairs all over the country but people still do that because we love value if you can get the most value for something you're going to take it\nIt's why buffets are still in business I Can't stand buffets because buffets are a mind bleep buffets make you get fat\nBecause

when I go to a restaurant not but this is a better value for eight more dollars you can get eight more trips I don't want eight more trips okay I'm not trying to to win most likely to explode in high school I don't need it\nBut we love value which why the lines are out the door when you go to a buffet it always happens everybody loves value if you love value and you were raised like that a lot

the most healthy they're going to be all year long especially him and he's an all time great quarterback\nAnd you're getting nine points he's been hearing all year\nAbout well God you know there are a little bit outdated and it's the rams in there that the greatest thing going in there and this and it's that it had Sean McVeigh and making you know Aaron Rodgers maybe as time has ... he's been hearing that\nAll year long and you don't even need Aaron Rodgers to win the game you don't need the Packers to win that game you just need them not to lose by more than nine points he's never been given that many points in the history of his career never one time has he been given that many points\nSo even if you you you don't necessarily think Green Bay is good and I don't think Green Bay is that good and I know the rams are really good\nThe fact that I'm getting that kind of value how do you pass that up\nSometimes you're not even in the market for something but you walk by it at a department store and you go ooh ...\nFourteen Ninety nine for a Rolex I don't think that's probably not even a Rolex would probably came out of a gumbo machine and somebody spray painted up ... fourteen Ninety nine and it says Rolex sold\nLike I'm seeing Aaron Rodgers getting nine points at the rams don't they don't solve you don't know that this guy's an all time great player an all time great quarterback\nAnd I'll just roll the dice why not if it doesn't work out it doesn't work out but you're never going to get that kind of spot again with a great player like Aaron Rodgers I don't know how everybody's not jumping all over that that being said he's probably going to get blown out by fifty but it's still a good\nAnd to have a nine nine six six three six nine you can get me on

just\nNo not really I I Know I don't give a river budget grounding or Washington or they're done um I I don't I don't buy Washington whatsoever I think they had an opportunity there's their schedule before the season\nLeft them little room for error just based on who they were going to be playing and and what they could get away with it they still want a legitimate shot to get into the college football playoff um they have not delivered a lot of teams in the past twelve have not delivered and not and not been as good as what a lot of people thought they were going to be outside of Washington state\nUm who is looked pretty good at times during the course of the season um I just don't buy into I I didn't buy into Washington before the season ah I'm not surprised at that move was made they've been pretty underwhelming dad and opportunity in the play off a couple of years ago and it was a disaster so unfortunately I Do not give her rap\nOr write and finally here Thursday night

have the world premiere of a brand new feature on the\nShow uh we were talking earlier in the show about the Dodgers collapse the choked job the bomb bomb whatever you want to call it\nThat the Dodgers put together a Dodger Stadium day Roberts getting a lot of the heat for it um how 'bout you blame the or you know those are the pictures you blame those guys uh it's it's amazing how for whatever reason we think Dave Roberts is the reason that the Dodgers pitching staff or late in ...\nSomebody in a position to succeed if they don't succeed this on on you this guy to ten and he says ... as a Dodger fan who's seen many relievers over the years blow leads or give up huge backbreaking playoff um runs I couldn't agree more yesterday the Dodgers you seven pictures and they all allowed to run so all the six relievers are to blame for that melt down\nCommunication [noise]\nInteresting diligence informed talk one of six point seven\n\n\n\n\nTwenty one South Florida I'm Ralph urban [noise] the the cardinals play you know you're on the forty seven [noise]\nRandom caller what do you have to say about Joe and it's\nNot true [noise]\nThis is coming through your speaker oh no I was going to a\n[noise] I guess kind of know anything more in line [laughter] show with\nA guy go Fox Sports radio studios in show was\n... years old [noise]\n\n\nBrutal disgusting vomit worthy [noise] I'd disaster is [noise]\nI Can't come up with enough adjectives to describe what the F happened this past week I'll explain what I'm Talking about here coming up momentarily in Knox locks I Am Jonas\nKnocks it says Fox Sports radio you can check out the show in the eye heart radio lab you can always find this on Syria sex Sam channel eighty three and on all of our Fox Sports radio affiliates wherever you are taking part in the program we always appreciate if you met at your time\nAs we come to your life here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios were Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance visit guy go dot com or\nA free rate quotes and we will get to Knox locks coming up your momentarily that do it every single week on the show during football season ... playing with that is that ... was atrocious a week ago er here are on of us are but I I did we were talking earlier just about\nThe situation in the world series and it's getting a lot of publicity and it's getting a lot of notoriety and there's a lot of attention being paid to it because it's been a great world series so far because it's been so bizarre\nI mean the one year ago was crazy but it was almost not believable\nOr was it game five maybe whatever the game was it was in Houston where it was a like each team scored like Ninety runs and no lead was safe and it just it it you were watching it and thinking to yourself something's not right here there's something wrong with the baseball's there's something going on\nThis one I mean you've got a seven plus our game\nThey come back to the very next day they play another four hour game and it goes all the way down to the wire their scoreless through like five or six innings the Dodgers go up by four runs the seemingly have total command of the series at this point uh they're going to take all the momentum and it's going to be tied it to a ...\nJust a battle and just keep rallying and you can blame in and day Roberts is getting bulk of the blame for taking ritual out of that game to me and I said this earlier do not blame Dave Roberts for those guys in his bullpen not being able to get the job done\nHe is trusting that his players can deliver when he hands on the ball they haven't\nThat's not Dave Roberts fault\nAnd the point I was making earlier was look just because you have a crummy trip into work doesn't mean you also have to have a crummy day at work you do have some saying this\nLike you do have some control over this\nIf your dad was in a hole you don't have to be in a hall so you do have some control over this\nYou have some say so so just because Dave Roberts took out rich hill doesn't mean that those guys have to morph into gas cans on the mound they do have some saying this it's not Dave Roberts\nBut he seems like the the easiest gotta blame at this point and and he's getting a a bulk of the blame and he's getting crushed and President Trump is sending tweets out and I it just it's craziness and so the red Sox win game for or they take a three game to one lead now they look to close out on Sunday night\nAnd if not they go back to Fenway for two games a sees the series is over it's done and here's the other part of it as well too when you're watching this um the red Sox are really good man that just really good they won a hundred and eight games in the regular season the next closest team won one oh three that was the Astros\nAnd the red Sox vaporized them in five games and those are the defending champion they're just the better team they're the best team in baseball it's it's playing out the way it is the Dodgers have made several deep runs in the postseason they look fatigue time at times they've had to play an extra game and the regular season\nThe on the just the psyche the body the ... the the mind all of it for the LA Dodgers so well you you can you can point fingers at a day Roberts all you want but you start looking at the bullpen and ask whether or not those guys can actually get the job done because him trusting them to do it and then not being able to deliver doesn't mean that it's his fault\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox Jonas knocks Fox Sports radio All right so\nWe do something on the show called Knox locks during the football season and normally like everybody will do a pick segment they'll give you their picks a I don't really like to do that per se all I'll bet certain lines if there's a betting line out there\nAre all take it if it's there and I like it but a lotta times I'll be betting things that I think are going to happen in the game if I think something is going to happen in the game that's what I call for earlier in the season I bet uh in the box game against the bears that\nMore than one quarter back would take a snap for the Tampa Bay buccaneers I had a feeling Seamus Winston was going to get into that game and so\nWhat do you know James what's been gotten the game or we hit on that one well I've been red hot going into last week I was twelve and three in Knox locks going back to last week and a lot of these you can bet on these these are actual better ... plays you can find them on sports books you can take it so\nTwelve Fifteen that's damn good that's hall of fame good\nAnd then last week happened uh and last week and I don't know if you have any um uh you know like uh the music that you could make fun of me with a tiny like a Benny Hill theme or or anything out there you could fire up because that is well deserved it forty clown\nThat I put together a a week ago yeah I had the uh the bears plus two and a half against the patriots\nOff [noise] um I have the charts\nInsects the week before I thought surely\nThe LA Chargers of Carson could at least go to London and get more than two and a half sacks of course so where do they do they finished with two sacks another loss [noise] then I made the mistake\nOf buying in to the bad one week this week phenomenon that is Blake portals I thought the jaguars\nBecause I think the Houston Texans stink up the jaguars minus four it was a really smart play guess what lost that one too then I went on to do bills in cold [noise] and I went really far out on a limb here because I had a gut feeling\nI really wanted to trust my ... my gut feeling was telling me that Andrew Luck was going to have more turnovers and Derek Anderson [noise] yeah that was another lost as well too but at least I had Monday Night at least at the giants\nAnd at least the falcons too bad defense is a lot of injuries to why hammer the over fifty four points in the game [noise] and I lost that too [noise] old and as being five\nYou knock socks jackass\n[noise] I've never done that before that\nI was mortified to see the results 'cause I knew they were bad and I didn't feel confident I even said a week ago I'm leaking confidence when it comes to this this edition of knocks locks but I still roll the dice and I came up with zero so ... five we can only go up from here\nI Am not a quitter and not just going to back out of this I'm not going to lead to a last dictate my mood dictate what if what this shows going to be about when it comes to Knox locks I'm coming back for more it's time\nLong [noise]\nAnd bring a blanket and pillow to spread out on the floor folding chairs will be available for those who prefer

didn't get it done\nAnd they didn't get it done on the biggest stage\nThem the brakes and I'll just tell you I'm Jonas knocks here Fox Sports radio\nYou want to let you know we all brought to you by

Fox Sports radio\nIf you've never guessed that garbage before\nIt is a basic NFL trivia it sounds really easy it's it's your opportunity to showcase your NFL knowledge and it's all relating to things that have happened within the last few days in the NFL but the problem is every time you guys get an opportunity on the\nBig stage you embarrass yourselves\nI I mean if every single week you guys come up with the wrong answers you get the wrong divisions you guessing wrong so if you think you know the NFL and you want your chance to star on national radio eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox is the number to call eight seven seven nine nine\nSix six three six nine operators are standing by guess that garbage coming up five minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio so I'm ... ... we've already got one game in the books\nIn ... right and we watch what happened on Thursday night wasn't that great of a football game um\nWasn't uh it\nThrough and look at their when their flaw that we have the information let's not overreact like we normally do we have the information on Houston flawed and winning streak just everybody calm down don't turn them into all of a sudden the Superbowl contender let's just relax a little bit here now the flip side of that is what's going on with the Miami Dolphins\nAnd um and I bring this up because\nFormer NFL scout\nJohn middle cough was on with me on Fox Sports radio on friday I got called in and was er during the ... show within buyer and we were talking with Doug or with the John middle cough just about the game on Thursday night and he made a point about Adam ... and the dolphins that I think\nShowcases why one coach\nNot named Adam gays has done it the way it should've been done here was John middle cough from friday\nHe is quarterly and most of the voters are they know nothing about the effects of their neighbors huge last night that met her I think his name is due to the earth throwing his I [laughter] I like you you can do all that stuff but eventually if I can you tell your guide to cover\nSo to his point off into minded head coach knows nothing about defense and he's got a guy who's thrown a tantrum on the sidelines\nThat's what I think Sean McVeigh doesn't get enough credit for\nIs for how he bill that coaching staff in LA\nBecause I was talking earlier about how man I Love the Packers getting nine points in LA and I I I Love the Packers are Aaron Rodgers getting that many points you begin to gamble that you're going to bed it it was one of my knocks locks I mean why wouldn't you take that it's a great value pick Aaron Rodgers getting nine points at LA\nThink about the job that Sean McVeigh is done that Aaron Rodgers is a nine point under dog in LA uh place\nThe stadium's still under construction it's a rental and Aaron Rodgers is the biggest underdog of his career that is what Sean McVeigh has built there but to John mental cops point\nAdam gays doesn't do a thing about the fence so he hires a defensive coordinator in the guys having to melt down on the sideline\n... said doesn't get enough credit for delegating and checking his ego at the door like if you finally got your big break you finally get in whatever it is that you do when you want full control\nWouldn't you trust yourself more than anybody else in that spot if you open up a restaurant wouldn't you want to control what's on the menu I like everything on the menu every detail\nFrom the soda machine you use to the bread sticks to the salad dressing everything you want full control over the menu because you weren't your ass off of this opportunity\nAnd you're not going to let somebody else screw it up you don't want full control of that I Know I Would\nI I still I I I have a hard time letting it like and to look here's here's a

[laughter] yeah that's a ... like he'd go upstairs there's like a tree upstairs like a tree house it's really weird bizarre place\nIt's fun though it's a good time uh alright I'm Jonah socks here Fox Sports radio will at my Carmen our Fox Sports radio fantasy football correspondent I don't know why I said that I just wanted to say\nNow here on Fox Sports radio um I was saying are saying this earlier that Doug Peterson like uh people criticizing play calling and all of that stuff um\nAnd I and I was just saying man like why do we do this media members like we criticize these guys for play calling they've forgotten more about football than us it's okay to acknowledge that those guys are better than us and one of the examples I gave was you know I'm not going to\nIf if a woman has cramps I'm not going to tell her how to deal with her PMS I've never had it how should I Know some guy writes in and goes\nHow do you have a job you PMS seven hours every weekend\nTen hours actually\nYou don't crush my three hours ten hours ten hours of PMS thing\nI'm All right uh we are brought you I'm sure there's really be sponsored this segment by discover card become a new card member and discover car will match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more discovered dot com slash match limitations apply\nSo um that online dot AG release their current odds on the team to finish with a worst record in the NFL and we're talking about this a little bit earlier and so right now the team to finish with the worst record in the NFL is the Arizona Cardinals\nAre these are the odds Arizona followed by the giants the bills the forty niners the raiders and the colds\nAnd so if your to just go back and your to reassess\nThe pre season\nAll of these teams because as it stands right now the betting favorites right these are the betting favorites to be the worst teams in the NFL viewer to go back and re assess all these teams what are we looking at and and\nThey're over under when total was five and a half so Vegas clearly got it right\nI clearly got it wrong because I'm pretty sure I took Arizona did finish second in that division just based on what they had on the roster and I thought wow they're going to be better quarterback they they they should do better quarterback but it's not that hard I like Josh Rosen I I still think\nI'm the same Bradford it's got some ability to to to play well at times and David Johnson's there and like if it's Gerald and Peterson and\nChandler Jones in ... I was wrong but they just got it right um the giants\n\nAre at seven that was their over under ... before the year the the New York giants were seven and what's funny about that is people before the season there were some people out there who liked the giants is a sneaky playoff team\nA team that could surprise empty people because they did have talent there and everybody assumed that the biggest issue with the giants was Ben Mac do\nAnd so now you resurrect Eli Manning's career\nYou hire an offensive minded coach\nIn ... you get rid of the ... you know hanging over their head a discussion of old out back him and whether he's worth the contract and you pay him and you bring in what a lot of people felt like was one of the best players in the draft and said one Barclay it seemed like it was a quality fix\nAnd one of the giants done this week traded away two players on defense I think the giants completely misread their team much like I misread the giants because I think I had him to win the NFC East I think they misread the roster\nBecause if the giants were all about this rebuild and all about the future why didn't they take the future\nThan they actually were when they went into the season and now we're seven eight weeks in and the giants are looking around going\nGod we're not any good and it doesn't look good in the future is not as bright as we thought and now we've got to start slinging on selling a spare parts are ... snacks Harrison Eli Apple I think the giants totally misread\nHow good they were as a football team because if you're if you're looking at him right now I don't know how they're getting to seven wins so I actually think Vegas got this one wrong with the giants the bills are six and a half that was the over under when total amongst the teams right now that are projected to be the worst teams in the NFL there were six and a half understandable\nUm you know Josh known rookie quarterback Schama government he can coaches defense but you know they they lost a lot on the off season at the mall to his off season anytime I'm One of your best often some linemen\nAnd two separate occasions um is a is caught throwing the weights at somebody at a gym\nAnd telling them or that he works for the CIA only to like a month and a half later then be arrested at a funeral home because he was trying to remove is dead fathers had any ten that's happening right after a wide receiver tries to jump out of a window of a hotel\nUh you know it's probably not adding up to a pretty promising season for that team oh and never mind the fact that a guy retired at halftime never mind all that\nI'm so anytime that is going down and probably not a promising season or the forty niners are projected at eight and a half Jimmy ... clearly the injury that derailed everything there other raiders over under when total check this out before the season the raiders over under when\nWas eight what did I tell you a week ago everybody over rated the race\nUm minimum is going to be a five hundred team they're one of the worst teams in the NFL and projected to be the worst team in the NFL day right now got the fifth best odds to be the worst team in the NFL and the over under when total was age\nThat just goes to show you everybody overrated this team a couple of years ago and everybody a lot of people probably bought into the John grew knives and assumed that John crude and was going to be the guy and that did this this roster was better than they were\nBut for fantasy purposes you not that lock step guide depending on your roster you might be shuffled down far enough to where is the number three receiver for you or it might be a decision as to where you leave him out altogether but yeah it's it's Aaron Rodgers and pretty much a bunch of all around\nI'd ever go a couple of more for my comment Fox Sports radio fantasy football insider or the ... the first game ... getting another game while you're out on air it's beautiful yeah you're you're getting a jags eagles from London um fantasy or what's what sticks out to you in this first game from London kicking off and\nI only got like less than four hours it at a beautiful thing\nThe cow down is on a I think we're looking at the players like T.

...\nInteresting right there see anyone yeah you do know a lot about a little which means nothing it really does it says if you're on a quiz show like jeopardy that's where it goes back to college football but that's that's what we did yesterday I Know you're happy there was no doubt in your mind I'm sure when they were playing navy but Notre Dame rolled I'm forty four twenty two and I'm sure you watched that game but I guess the game of the day\nMay very well have been at Oklahoma State Texas game because Texas right now basically then knocked out of the playoff pitcher\nThey really are they're finished I mean I Can't believe I mean they certainly beat Oklahoma earlier this year and they somewhat control their own destiny to win that big twelve titled gay but that was a bad last with Texas yesterday\nYeah pretty much takes them out of contention and that hurts Oklahoma too it's not like the worst loss of all time where you go to Stillwater you lose Oklahoma State at night\nBut Oklahoma losing the red river rivalry slash shootout slash showdown slash fill in the blank you that hurts Oklahoma because you want to Texas to run the table if you're Oklahoma\nAnd beat them in the big twelve championship game we're now you're beating at best if you face taxes to to last team that's not good but it's not good for the big twelve as a whole because it does not look like they're going to have a representative they need a whole lot of help ahead of them to sneak a team into the uh college football playoff\nYeah and it does it get an easier to Texas either was next week they play West Virginia West Virginia rolled Baylor yesterday fifty eight fourteen so again I mean I'd rather have twelve I I Do enjoy the top because they don't play any defense that's why I enjoy watching ... for me just\nGloss over that was last week you know they are they different when this week they rolled over another two yeah West Virginia was killing it\nThat I Am at NBC show locate

think it's a\nIt's a little more than I wanted them to to trade in terms of a number one pick instead of a first round pick\nBut when you've got reports of the eagles tossed around the idea of making that trade the Colts were thinking about doing it thinking about adding I'm Ari Cooper and pairing him with Andrew Luck which makes sense I think about the jets jets were reportedly kicking around this idea so\nI'm for the cowboys especially if you look in the division I much rather have a mark Cooper with that cowboys team then to see him with Philadelphia and have to go see him twice a year so yeah I liked the move Andy and look at that age deep wide receiver draft\nAnd you've gotten the services of ... Cooper from this point throughout the rest of the season and I think that he's certainly a first round talent had you you know ... thought about it in let in the context of next year's draft where instead of going with the keel Harry\nYou know what you make a lot of sense but I was shocked because John crude and when he was a commentator for ESPN was hailing the move that they've Oakland Raiders got Maury Cooper so I was kind of like shot that he would just unload the guy\nThat that's what kind of made me crazy I mean you you love the guy when you're already SPN talking about it now you're as coach you got rid of him so I don't understand that and maybe the Sheikh help us and our number three ... maybe he knows a little bit more about this trade but if I may\nI'd like to go to go back to Thursday night because you a fish fell to the Texans forty tough\nWhen he finally had to go here by ... keep talking about America Cooper on I'm kidding I'm kidding about\nSean watching five touchdowns Texas now won five straight they play a Denver next and his thirty four touchdown passes the ... I have Dan Marino at thirty two for the second most and in the history of the Fifteen games and to me the Sean watches not getting the accolades that he deserves you don't even hear about the guy\nYou know more about you really don't when he got a lot of problems\nAfter that went against the dolphins the dolphin defense I don't know what happened to them they were just decrepit that night\nAnd you know to Sean Watson loses will fall or\nWho is the wide receiver the speed ... out of Notre Dame towards ACL against the dolphins that's going to hurt him going forward but the reason you didn't hear a whole lot about the Sean watching this year Andy is heading into that game he had ten touchdown seven picks\nYou know that's nothing to be like wow this guy is killing it hits that look a lot better right now after eight five touchdown performance against the lowly dolphins at least defensively right\nYou know Fifteen and seven looks a whole lot better than ten and seven but if you're not going to shower him with praise after getting the best of the dolphins well that's why you weren't before then because he hadn't seven right\nExactly right I won't I won't hurt you any more with your dolphins because they start out like a house on fire and they kind of hit it but you know Ryan ...\nIf you look at Patrick homes he's been amazing so far this year right right and some of the numbers that he's put up are comparable to what they're showing Watson was doing in a small sample size last year with those six starts so imagine if Patrick my home's\nGot hurting practice didn't play another game this year right not rooting for this but just a hypothetical here and he starts out next season what ten touchdowns in seven interceptions he think anybody's you're showering him with praise no\nNo way the way it goes that's yeah that's why it was in a love fest what the Sean watch and he's still trying to get back to form coming back from that torn ACL any showing signs you still incredibly talented but his numbers have taken a dip so far this year\nYou know and speaking of quarterbacks this talk about this game about three hours in London the eagles three and four at the jags three and four in London and the quarterback for the jazz obviously he is a problem Blake board was was benched\nFor Cody Kessler in their last against the Texans the eagles right now have the ... scoring defense and the league and the eagles did lose to Caroline I was shocked I don't know about you I was shocked with that and the eagles right now is giving a three as far as I'm concerned with the line today with the actual game\nNow it's up to ... and a half now\nI did you check these on Tuesday again Andy goodness he fell off the wagon again it was no no no ... and now you're off the wagon and yes good afternoon at you and and yeah the other day after you listen to us that good enough energy from the day of the day of this ... move quickly over here but I'll tell you this\nAnd a lot more than they go for one that's what they do right now because now ... now what though I mean if if you talk to my comment I mean he will tell you that if it wasn't that he'll go for the two I think that they do it it was a month or so more so than any other team in the league\nWell it's a better product it's more exciting I liked that it isn't a sure thing it is in a way up in the NFL having the the longer\nThe way it ended with Justin Tucker missing an extra point that was exciting it was interesting it was a huge talking point you know so I live in ... after a touchdown you don't just run to the fridge and like All right this is\nIt's already a done deal you've got to sit there and watch it like ... there's a lot of pressure on this kick is he going to make it\nAnd just talk or one of the ... field goal kicker ever misses the extra point and it just shows you it's anything but a lay up now I think that a guy on the matter for field goals to fifty or two more automatic medics in any capacity really it was shocking to see him is that\nIt it really was it really what I tell you what though there's another situation that they really got to clean up for Baltimore and that is wide receiver Michael Crabtree I I don't believe how many\nPasses he's dropped and I'm looking for ... I don't think they keep drops do they have you seen that that I don't see\nThat one of the common ones you know ... it's not one of the comedy categories you can find it but you've got to do some sifting you know you got to go in the back alley website and\nFind it on page nine instead of the front page you know what I mean right you got to really dig deep for that one but yeah I think that\nDrops should be one of your main stats they were you involved when you're looking at wide receivers I I don't know what happened to crab trees hand I Know you remember him at Texas Tech Andy that dude caught everything raising hands in college what happened to him in the NFL\nHe was even decent in San Francisco\nComing to Baltimore I don't know what happened to you I really don't but well it's\nBeen happening for the last couple of years I don't know if it's just the lack of concentration it's a lack of confidence that something's going on there maybe it's like writers [laughter]\nYou're not saying I'm just saying you know it's funny though you know when the Audrey Hopkins makes that insane catch that didn't count against the\nYour hand out there ... it doesn't work like that the ... century Hopkins that catch was amazing the hotel back um junior catch against the cowboys a couple of years ago was amazing it's not just a byproduct\nOf really sticky modern gloves Michael Crabtree would be a great example of that the dude wears gloves and he is dropping passes left and right\nHe may be better off not wearing gloves really is not working with the gloves that they have that right now we'll see what happens today and I got opinion downhill the he was like I Do like the re which in this game in a close one who do you like in this one\n[noise] gosh I

L. O. B. how're you\nDoing great Andy ferment always a pleasure to be with you here every Sunday you know that you're intros\nHave been just wild today you renamed the show Fox Sports Saturday and Sunday well we didn't look ... our yet you introduce yourself I don't know what happened there in the third person there's like a three man show we're doing it three men we've here apparently Allen\nWas good I had a question for you though ideas and I'll have one for you after that the guy\nWith President Trump criticizing the move by Dave Roberts to go to the man rich still had a one hit or did you have an issue with that\nAnd the way I did I mean the guy was rolling along on or was he had like a one hit are going on there I mean ... why\nWould you make that change I mean you know we are so I mean managers right now in baseball\nAnd I mean maybe he'll learn maybe people will learn right now you can get your rear end burnt you know if things are going well sometimes go when you got to go with the gut rather than go which stats\nYou can get your rump did is we ate it run the fields of a Bronx talk radio over there you know here's the thing Andy is this is what I always say if you aren't first guessing I don't want to hear the second guesses so\nTo be fair maybe President Trump and some of the people that are highly critical of they've Roberts going to the bullpen when rich he'll got hold in that moment maybe they're like what is he doing in Boise pulling a guy that's got to want to hear if you're saying that before you have access to the results okay\nI'll listen to you after you have\nAccess to the result right and I imagined doesn't get it done Kennedy ... get it done so forth and so on what the bullpen right\nAnd then they're like All right makes sense no big deal one Harry look good but bullpen for nothing lead they should be good they should be fine and then you circle back and you're like what was the kid if you want to be a ... at the time I don't want to hear it afterward\nAnd there's no game that could be second guess more than the game of baseball and you know as far as President Trump is concerned he may have gone after they've Robin because maybe they've Roberts is a Democrat\nI don't know I don't know why I wanted a robbery you just they don't get on with him you really don't but my heart or baseball fan and he had already words fan\nWho knows what he is I don't know but I Will ask you this you do that radio show on a daily basis and then one of the city of Portland, Oregon I have to know this how much World Series talk what's on your show this week just out of curiosity you're in a non major league baseball market it right World Series at one point in time but was\nV. event V. event uh right now no one's talking about it not many people are even watching it\nWell not a lot [laughter] we weren't talking about it\nTo nothing a Red Sox lead in the series you know\nAnd it wasn't like games one into there wasn't anything that was\nHuge you know\nIt wasn't a huge story line where like I got to weigh in on this it was one of these where okay why didn't they start their left handed guys why was there no jak Peters then there was no ... next month the who hit the walk off Homer in game three right there was no Cody Ballenger like that's\nThat's not a huge topic at all so it didn't have a whole lot of legs it didn't have a whole lot of traction now these last couple of games without what happened with Dave Roberts last night the marathon Eighteen inning game there are some layers with that that can be\nCarried around for sure yeah and it was funny because the Eighteen again I'm not so certain how many people even stayed up to three am eastern time to watch it but you make a great point is a great talking point but his people will go the office the next day and say did you watch it and it's a ... did you see that you know what happens things like that so yeah\nI I just think right now that baseball is just sort of a flux if you will as a downhill spiral and I don't know what they're going to do it I don't want to talk about it because I Want to talk about college football\nAnd what happened yesterday and I ask you right now let's give the first four teams right now and and the AP rankings perhaps this week I'm going to do with Alabama Clemson for one to arrive number three I got to go with the undefeated Irish\nAnd then another throwing the Ohio State even though they lost last while on LSU and what are you going to\nPut in their Ohio State Ohio state's eleven NBA people right now you got to know what got them in the way it's going to it's going to jump around I just don't do you do rise by ... and ... do ... lost by ten points at but what do you go on ... conference by\nI mean you look at Oklahoma they've got a week's schedule they really do do a pack twelve I'm not going to go anybody that impact well Washington state\nHim well ahead of Ohio State right here right now you'd have to go with LSU looking when Alice you've done they smacked around number two at the time Georgia\nThey smacked around they went on the road and beat Auburn and I know Auburn isn't ranked anymore but written statement when you beat a team that's highly ranked\nYou can't circle back and be like wow I mean look at their the ranking now where they're really low you're you're right about that time it's like it better it's hard to remain highly ranked if you'll lose the game or a couple of them you know it's impossible almost\nAt Michigan certainly has more worthy than Ohio State at this point at their only losses at number three at the time being right now Notre Dame you compare that to Ohio State losing on the road to Purdue it's apples and oranges\nThat was a terrible loss trials there but you know what though is could have been really interesting and ah it'll play out because the end of November Michigan will play Ohio State we'll see what happens there with the Big Ten and it was it a win that so it's kind of wide open but you still have some dominant teams and like the three dominant teams in my heart of hearts or Alabama Clemson\nI got a flu Notre Dame in there I really do that determine that right now during the ...\nYeah I mean when you do not put it on the team in there they would be in right now I just can't go with dominant when you're struggling and barely beat Ball State Vanderbilt\nHits you know these teams playing tough and or\nThe second game of the year for Ball State that's they're Super Bowl you know right\nAnd then they've got and roll but I think that only goes so far if you're truly a dominant theme even though these lesser teams get up to play you you still should win comfortably and they have it so I Can't go with them as dominant but yeah they would be one of the playoffs teams right here right now there's no doubt about it\nAll right well we move on ...\nMy line Chicago given up seven and a half seven and a half points to adjust to that when he got eight\n[noise] why do we mean handy to see why I don't get it every week it's called the Internet it was it was it their minor nine and a half that's two point unacceptable alright\nWell why am I getting this seven and a half then I and I don't know I don't know\nI don't know where are you at ... do you want to reveal the site of choice that you know what goes on and one of them out the site then okay [laughter]\nAnd the biggest challenge I guess right now is going to be for the jets rookie quarterback Sam Donaldson according to New York media reports he's getting the pull up faster and obviously when you do that that helps the offensive line for better pass protection so we'll see what happens there and and I'm sort of a press but I still don't see that just beaming the bears today because she's got to face ... Mac\n\n\nSports radio bill mobile mobile I visit I Know where do you think would would that would home for you to try\nBall cracks in three years [noise]\nSo blase ... when you buy bold predictions for college football in the year all the action may grain\nOf your seat covers right here on the box office right now\nBut so is your ... do you draw\nThe majors as they provide unique perspective and expert analysis on the ... election day of the Lebanese dirt on clock stand on Fox Sports\n[noise]\nAgain is like a mirror will take a peek at just about a minute twenty past the hour this is Fox football Sundays Brian oh I'm Andy for a minute by the way we're probably brought you buy guy go and I got some great\nNews is a quick way you could save money switch the Geico got a guy go dot com and Fifteen minutes you could say fifty percent or more on your car insurance now Mr no I got the updated lines okay I really do\nI Hope so I've heard that before\nOkay let's do this just so it was a sea hawks at the lions both teams are three and three she looks lost to the ribs us it was a good game thirty three thirty one lion speak you adopt as thirty to thirty one and as far as I'm concerned the line I'm looking at right now to Troy given up three to Seattle\nYes wow handy holy cow yes but do you mean what do you mean that is correct I'm Glad that the scores are up to date as well because you're worrying me with the point spread the or at least you have the scores of the games correct\nYou know they don't go there and here's why look let me just clear my name here if I may number one I Am not I'll be quiet on I Am not a gambler and I have no idea ... lions okay that I had no idea that I look I understand it's a public service that most people will watch games put a little shed a little too on the games and I've done that at times okay but\nThe people who listen we are obeying the public service of giving them the line on these games should all be someone informed\nOn what's going on yet I had no idea that these lines would move so much from last night 'til the smart oh All right Andy\nIt's good game day of course they didn't move a ton\nYes All right All right yeah yeah and this one I did I got editors ... what do you see going down in this game because you look at too good running attack surprisingly with the Seahawks you couldn't ball hardly at all now all of a sudden they've cranked up that running game with Chris Carson and you look at\nGames you've got ... Jay right coming back for Seattle which is big you get tied in at Dixon back as well so that helps you get the adult coming off of a Bible you can but Seattle is in play good past events and you don't have a real Thomas back there\nSo it it's a toss up man this is just they literally Vegas has it as typically the home team gets three points that's exactly where the line is there like hey that you call it\nWhat do you see you know I I Would say that is\nThe CEO of probably run the football more than any team in the league and they could have a big big against that porous lines defense we both agree on that however I Would say this alliance have more of a balanced office I think that Seattle does and they can out score Seattle's attack and I think that Seattle\nCould create turnovers\nBut I don't see it happening I don't see I I like the lions to win this game I really do not by much but I like the lions two in may but three or four\nYeah well you get snacks Harris than over their Damon Harris than coming over from the giants in a trade that should help out the lions horrible Russia's defense\nOr they've been giving up an NFL high five point three yards per carry the season thinking about that Andy finds the three yards per carry that's crazy you know I'll tell you this that\nThis is a spot for the lion's because they've got a much better shot in their division than the Seahawks doing there's what the rent or looking up the rams that's completely out of sight but right look at the rest of the NFC North from the lions point of view if you put together a good performance and beat a Seattle team\nWhich isn't close to what they once were and they're totally beat ...\nIf you win this game\nAll of a sudden you're foreign three you've got a winning record\nAnd you're at least neck and neck with other teams in the division the Packers could easily lose today at the rams the Vikings\nHome game against Seattle and it worries me because it would be\nA complete lions thing to do which just had not show up and lose the game at home after a nice performance last week against the dolphin\nRight and Seattle's got it on the football that's basically all they do because why they run the football because\nI think they're passing attack us somewhat weak I really believe that so I'm just one dimensional last chance and if they could run I think they can run against alliance and gain some ground heat up some ... run the clocks they've got a shot I don't see it happening even though the Detroit Lions as susceptible to giving up a lot of yards I don't see it happening in the Detroit was this game\nYeah [laughter]\nIt's rough man I Would go the other way it's not a strong disagreement by me Andy\nBecause I like the lions it's just one of these it's a classic spot for the lion's to poll of lions you know yeah at NYU and you don't have a great rush defense in Seattle can be multi dimensional offensively I don't love they're passing game nearly as much as the lions\nBut I Do love Russell Wilson I think he's dynamic he's completely capable of at least\nPassing for a decent amount of yard edge making some big plays you know it's not like jak Prescott before you got Murray Cooper in that passing often it's better than that and I just look for the alliance did they shoot themselves in the foot somehow some way did they do that today\nAnd I think there's a decent chance after\nChance and speaking of people shooting themselves in the foot I mean look at the Cincinnati Bengals I took them for a second because I keep on going back to what I was more of a toilet several weeks ago don't fall in love with this team\nThey're hosting the Tampa Bay bucks Tampa Bay is three and three Bengals a foreign three but more than that they've lost two straight and everybody was talking at Cincinnati Super Bowl Super Bowl there for three right now\nThey really all that crazy to me that they they were all over there they get they would just want to go to the playoffs\nNow they drop to this is one of those watershed games because it's going to be if they lose this game the players are going to be a rough road to hoe if they ... today\nAnd they're expected to win but these teams look of themselves in the mirror and they almost the same tremendous officers on both teams and what happened last week I don't know what happened to the Bengals office but they've got demolished in Kansas City forty five to ten bucks sweet the browns and over time so that was kind of a\nYou know as a walk in the state of twenty six twenty three\nBut to me Jim is Winston led the bucks in Russia last week and I see him running roughshod over the bangles defense today\nI yeah you got a lot of injuries on both sides defensively where you look it's happened they lost their middle linebacker Guam Alexander who's a good player might not have Gerald McCoy today which is a big setback their secondary the Tampa Bay secondaries incredibly banged up\nSo I think since he's going to get back on track offensively today I think you're going to have a big game from the bangles\nAnd yeah could Tampa score a lot of points to make it a close game being contention to win it yeah absolutely 'cause the bangles or banged up defensively as well but I just the Cincinnati rebounding at home\nI just don't trust Tampa at all and what their rash of injuries I'm just going with the home team on this one if you think about the home team typically getting three points\nIf their favorite by four you're basically saying it's simply a one point favorite at home if you look at it that way I'm guilty I must say I didn't see as a one point favorite at home against has what I Do\nI Do too and and I'd yeah my line has a bank Bengals given up three and a half the Tampa Bay today\nThe I've got it at four but again pointing to have no biggie no big deal right\nYou thank you very much and the most the Tampa Bay defence is as close to the bottom of the league so I think the bangles can roll with their\nA lot of yours and again I mean you talk about it it's not excused because it's part of the game as part of football injuries and that thing goes defense has really been banged up and I don't see them really doing much defensively so we'll see what happens it could be a high scoring game I feel like the ... I think that they must have more weapons on all things I really do\nYeah I Do too I uh\nJust don't [laughter] I thought said Tampa getting it done they could I mean it's not like the bangles are unbeatable certainly they are and I just don't know\nHow to Tampa figures out a way to slow down that bangles off and they've got so many weapons to throw the ball to I think you're going to have success running the ball when you're multi dimensional it opens up everything and you know that you play action game works the running games working that more deadly what the play action passing game who's going to cover\nRight yeah you just don't have that\nThat are up and coming quarterback that ... I ... you know fourth round pick hasn't been an act he hasn't been active [laughter] for a lot of gave the year\nUh so yeah it's going to be Eli by process of elimination\nBut you might be right on this pick daddy that man that just Reagan's that just seems like such a soccer line doesn't it or Vegas it's like when Vegas put their arm around you and they're like hey buddy hey would you like some spending cash here how about the red skins huh\nOnly a point now half favor to get the giant you know how bad the giants have better they ask you about a rat holder\nIs they start trying to do you a favor with the line that's where I'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa I Know Vegas doesn't do favors and with a line this low for the Redskins who are clearly the better team I got big time questions here\nI'm with you right there and say well you look at the reds because you don't know what team of shows up first of all they're pretty darn good at home and this was in a way game but you lose it the Indianapolis early in the season and then you'll be Green Bay the following week you just don't know what team shows up that's the problem with this Redskins team\nYeah and they haven't scored a touchdown in the third quarter for eleven straight games isn't that amazing eleven straight we know that the third\nAll the drive all the flu key things that could happen in a special teams ... nothing no touchdowns it's amazing to me but they're going to have to figure it out and be consistent on a week to week basis because they've had a couple of nice performances\nThey held Christian McCaffrey ... Elliott who I combined fifty four yards rushing the last two weeks it's really good so they should be tough against take one Barclay and if you make them one dimensional and Eli Manning is under center you've got a great chance but this does seem like a sucker back I wouldn't bet it\nBut if I had to choose I Would still go with Washington to win the game\nAnd I ... I guarantee you one thing I bet you\nThat this game will not be included in Europe it's three on those picks I Know it just reeks it just reeks of a truck or bad and I can't I cannot in good faith go with the G ... yeah I just can't do it can be one of my three picks I could go with something else that's much better I didn't think it would be\nBrian oh Andy ferment will live for a guy called Fox

football game now today I could flip back and forth or CBS Sunday Morning and watch the football game on the NFL Network\nHow do you like that so I got a bill to both worlds today I really enjoy CBS Sunday Morning it's a heck of a news program\nOr where are you going to go quite triple header today Andy that how you're going to get down\nI'm going to watch the ... I was thinking of going but I'm not going out and the wind storms and rain so I'll watch it on TV so I watched that game four o'clock game I'll see but definitely watched a night game tonight\nOkay are you looking forward to I don't know what it would be in your area or probably that Green Bay game you got the rams that's a that's a good one but then they get in trouble or you don't get stuck I don't think you would in that area with niners cardinals goodness can you imagine and then on\nI don't know anybody that they just said that they should save that game for like the penitentiaries\nAnd Britain you are in are you in jeopardy of seeing the colds raiders in your area I've led a Green Bay rape rams\nNo ... no I Hope not I wouldn't say so but it's not CBS I please no no I don't\nKnow that Green Bay rams game could get interesting I'm looking forward to that game\nAnd it could get ugly if there is like put their foot to the puzzle early on but we'll get to that a little later on but right now let's talk about the brown Steelers Brown's two for one of the Steelers three two one these teams met an opening day and it was a shock or at least to me\nBrown's this is unbelievably it's about bad luck with no luck the browns were playing Tampa Bay they rallied backward fourteen points in the fourth quarter then they go on to lose in overtime twenty six twenty three how on a fifty nine yard field goal I mean you talk about a team I mean I'd rather lose about three touchdowns lose life that\nI really would not oh\nNow you're in contention you know it can go your way you gotta be in those close games give yourself a chance going forward\nBut today Pittsburgh has given up eight eight points to Cleveland\nGame it's a tough it's a tricky game to pick because Cleveland defense has been pretty good and they're just trying too hard really anti they're trying to a fault because you look at your Brill peppers he had the ... in overtime last week\nAnd Baker Mayfield he's had a couple of big turnovers and key spots you go back a few weeks at the raiders or you had a big interception when they were right around midfield with about Thirteen seconds to go throws an interception when they're right there close to a field goal range\nHe had a big turnover last week against apple when he ran for first town fumbled it and it went out of bounds both for the first down markers the crazy play right there but I see that from this Brown's team where they're just pressing two will fall\nAnd they're just trying to hardware works against them\nAnd when you look at them against Pittsburgh last time they beat Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh butch Davis was the head coach in him couch was the quarterback and it came up against bill cower in Tommy maddocks how does that make you feel heading into this game if you're a Cleveland\nI'll tell you something else also with James ... got the job than the first time they play this year James kind of was unbelievable the first time they play in that time he rush or a hundred thirty five yards he had to touch down to fifty seven years receiving and I'll tell you something right now I look for something like that again today I really\nWhich ah help the Cleveland comeback against them but I I just can't imagine Cleveland getting six turnovers today like they did in the first meeting against the Steelers you forest six turnovers and still didn't win the game\nThat's crazy to me and when they haven't had any success whatsoever on the road against the Steelers\nI just don't see the brown winning this game the question is what the point spread of aids you like the browns enough to take those points Sandy\nNo no because I Know I I think right now I tell you what I'm going to go one step further what you should go to shock you really I'm going to give you the uh the total points over an under are you ready for that OK well forty eight and a half\nYep right around there yeah forty eight and a half the thirty five I question though any what do you think about that dealers defense where are you on them\nWell the Steelers difference right now I think that\nThe Russian they they've got a rush to quarterback and that's that's the key right there and I don't know if this deal is can rush Baker may feel I just don't know I don't think a force them out of the pocket and uh I like T. J. what he's pretty good year\nAnd I think that the Steelers right now I'm banged up in the secondary they got a corner of actual Hayden\nThat's other than that I'm not too sure I'm not really high on their on their secondary so they don't have the foreigners yeah this is Joe hey there's the guy but other than that but I don't think the browns have enough talent to exploit that that's the problem\nWell I I think they do offensive like I I think they do roster wise I think they've got the talent because\nWhen you look at that secondary the dealers I don't love them Joe ... still okay I don't know what happened to artsy burns I don't know what happened to that guy because he's literally been getting torched way too often already burst of the good player not too long ago\nAnd when you look at the browns weapons drivers Landry is a good receiver Antonio Callaway got a lot of talent David in joke ooh that's something the dealers don't do very well is covering tight and they give up a right around eight catches per game to opposing tight and so that's a lot\nSo I think that they've got the weapons to throw to the question is Baker Mayfield can heat grow up\nBecause you're not seeing it from him and we know they're going to be some growing pains we get that but when you're completion percentage is under fifty eight in today's NFL that's just not good enough I don't care if you're a rookie or not it should be better than that\nNo no doubt about that and say something else I'm looking at the the Cleveland Browns defensive and miles Garrett\nHe they talk about maybe he could put some heat on Ben Roethlisberger the Steelers quarterback I may be and this is a joke because I've been hearing this make this deal is one dimensional so what\nDo you make them want the metro James Caan or Russia the football season I'll still be did they have so many ways they could beat you it doesn't make a difference of miles Garrett put some heat on wealth is broke on Russia's him out of the pocket they give that both the Connor\nAnd they'll still be too so it doesn't make a difference that just a better team than the browns and you know where he is also they know how to win and the brown still have not they learn how to win football games\nAnd that's the thing though is look miles Garrett I like him as a former number one overall pick he's good player but he's not going to put heat on big Ben all day to the point right that just say one dimensional off and they can't throw the ball at all\nHow about let's say ... Mack the beginning of the year against the Packers he was on real in the first half he had a huge performance in that game and yet still Aaron Rodgers found a way\nTo have a big game and throw for a lot of yard throw for some big touchdowns so even if\nDown and up into the world\n\n\n\n\n\nGo ... one of the point seven million in Idaho one of the dot com to al ...\nCells seriously when no regrets superstars do say I'm Sorry I Know so forgive me do this or you\n[noise] and the thing that will make you laugh\nWe're doing it all for you it sounds good to me to me when you\nGo over there I got a six point seven ... I talk a lot of the six ... where do you say oh\nRaiders Niger Thursday at seven thirty Easter not by now\n[laughter]\nThis might be the game of the day that's coming up about Twenty one past the hour this this box football on the east\nAll the cash back you burn dollar for dollar\nAt the end of your first here learn more I discovered dot com forward slash match limitations apply now Alex ... will join you at the bottom of the hour he's five splits radios NFL inside as a thirty eastern but the game of the day\nMight very well be strange Vikings but before we get to that it's packaged Iran's package three two one I guess the undefeated ram seven to no end Brian I'll tell you the rams it'd be the pointed on his last week or the kind of a walk over thirty nine ten but that said mentioned going to get to decide what they're hoping not eight Nineteen eighty five all over again why\nThey're seven and over the first time since Nineteen eighty five\nAnd the rams have to avoid finishing light that Nineteen eighty five team they win four and five the rest of the way and lost to Chicago and the NFC championship game back in Nineteen eighty five but I don't see that happening this year\nAnd and they got shut out in that game too didn't they I Believe they ... yeah playoff game bears just rolled right over them had bears are so dominant in eighty five you look at what they did in the playoffs is crazy you know steam rolled the rams the giants crush the patriots and the super bowl\nBut focusing on this game Andy\nYeah the rams they'll look all world right now I think that's got to pay a decent tests for them today though you look at Mike mccarthy and what he's done with the Packers off of a bye week he's nine and three\nAnd that includes nine and two with Aaron Rodgers as the starting you be and they're starting to get healthier when you look at ... thin Randall Cobb you're getting some weapons back there for Aaron Rodgers\nAnd I just look at this rams defense where they finally showed up against the terrible San Francisco forty niners put on a week to week basis there are a lot of times we've talked about it openly\nThey been that great defensively so if you look at the rams and what they typically been like defensively throughout the course of the season with the ...\nThe current cousins in company when the Vikings played them in LA so I think the Packers even though I hate Green Bay the fence it's gonna be hard for them to slow down that rams attack I think that they could match points to the point where this is it leads to close ball game\nAnd I'll tell you something else as far as ... concerned the packet I mean ... right in the face Ramsey giving eight eight point out of the Pakistani that's a lot I mean I'll take Aaron Rodgers with eight points why not\nYeah I mean going into it I Would if push comes to shove I Would take those points because when you're getting over it touched down with Aaron Rodgers there we know it's the ultimate team game we get that\nAnd what Jared golf and that often has done what Todd early there all the weapons to throw to it's going to be really tough for Green Bay to slow them down but I really do I believe in Aaron Rodgers\nWhen he's getting weapons back that are healthy and that ramps defense not been consistent yeah I think that they can they can keep up it leads to the point where this is it a blowout and you're not going into the fourth quarter and they're down by three touchdowns I don't think it's going to be that type of ballgame\nGo one step further the Packers defense at least the rush defensive been great against the ... pass I mean they don't like two hundred and ten yards per game which is like fifth of the NFL against the past now the rush defense that's another story they giving up almost a hundred and twenty or to a game with rice right near the bottom of the leaf so you know right now\nIf they could get them one dimensional which I don't know if they can but perhaps they can and remember uh to me\nI I kinda liked I liked the odds yeah I'll take the eight points and I like Aaron Rodgers and I like the fact that they arrested in the coming back and maybe they give the both of their running back Aaron Jones a little bit more\nBecause I don't see it up you don't see him on tape a lot so maybe they won't be expected him to get the football Aaron Joe's he may be the best running back on the team Aaron Jones right\nAs for the Packers but it keeps that rams off and on the sideline and what they can score fast we get that but when you're on the sideline and it becomes more of a choppy type game in terms of you can get into a rhythm when your defense\nThey allow first down or two but they get the ball back to you pretty quickly\nThat keeps you in a rhythm offensively so if the Packers are able to have a couple of the steam drives and\nKeep the rams on the sideline to get them out of their rhythm that could be a big big deal today I just I don't think the Packers running game as consistent enough\nThey could have a one game aberration there's no doubt about that\nBut the rams they rank twelve in rushing yards given up per game they give up right at a hundred yards per game\nSo it's not going to be easy for the Packers to have sustained success running the football today they can find it that's going to be a big deal\nYeah and the best game of the day might be tonight New Orleans and Minnesota New Orleans to say it's given up one and a half\nTo the to the Vikings tonight and the last week the saves people more that's their fifth straight wins twenty four twenty three\nWas the score and that when the Vikings beat the jets thirty seven Seventeen it makes it three in a row for the Vikings right now my kids running game as soon as the desire but they're passing game is their strength but the states have both the passing on the wrong game advocate Mary I'm walking running the ball and the football on the ground but the the Vikings to me\nThe defense is tough and it's real tough and I gotta believe it's going to be close but I think the Vikings being at home and with their defense I think the Vikings win this in a close well liked by three or four\nI'm going saints in this one you could very well be correct Andy this game as close to being a toss up right I Do like the the same where you look at what they've done in the fourth quarter and over time this year they've scored an eighty eight points that\nTalking close ball games they are scoring and will really and you look at the Vikings are pretty banged up ... save your roads as Nick up\nYou know you've got some key injuries over there were Drew Brees could take a he could take advantage of that\nAnd you look at their running game with the saints they're running game as better as well right now there are a few reasons to like the saints and this one and you think about avenge ing the Minneapolis Miracle and I think there's something to that the bitter defeat last year you'd think that markets Williams\nHe's got something to prove in this game when he has the old late tackle and stuff on digs in the playoffs last year right I think that that's clearly on his mind and I think that a lot of the saints players want to pick 'em up\nAnd so I Would favor the saints and this one I like them\nWell you know and I think that if there is one advantage I see that the states would have is the one to running back punch\nYou know the album Camaro mocking room because you got that guy takes so much pressure of Drew Brees and we saw the several years ago when the states were struggling when it was just a one dimensional team with Drew Brees and now they've got a decent running it more than a decent running and really that takes so much pressure of Drew Brees it don't they could do it either way with through the air or on the ground\nThey can yeah and that's what's so tough about them they aren't one dimensional\nAnd when when you got to pick your poison it's kinda like it goes back to the rams you know we were just talking about them\nThey're leading the league in rushing yards per game there right at a hundred and fifty three\nWas funny because you notice that we don't have this with the New England patriots that we know about right and they were made the gold standard of the NFL and its teams that minimizes sort of drama are usually the ones that are successful right I mean you write a whole bunch of things you you mentioned a number of teams right there and the impact that it you know these types of things can have on them and none of them I Believe have a winning record\nSo you know that's that's what happens with bad franchises\nRight in the Jacksonville Jaguars are really sort of teetering in that direction I think you you under sold that story a little bit when you sit\nFouls in dollars in the u._k. okay and and then it raises another question does do more on believing a curfew or does he just trust his players that there's not going to be any problem because remember they practice Saturday morning ever walked through they're getting ready for again they have given up Ninety points in the past three games\nNinety point they've been out scored Ninety there twenty eight you're going club until four AM right for guys and it's very church is the only one apparently that's going to play today the other guys were an active but what's going on here right as an organization we know about the fighting that took place in the locker room last week\nI between Jacksonville players they'd open the doors up to the media to walk in hoops you got two guys\nAre about to go out and you ought to play as Campbell obviously the the\n... situation as a mess so out of all those teams I I think that the off field stuff with the jaguars as significant I think that there's real chemistry problems\nFor this club and they need to get their act together and before anyone starts to tell me about Tom Coughlin the disciplinarian and all that nonsense\nThis was the same guy who enable do do back from junior when it came in the NFL so please I don't want to hear about Tom Coughlin in his aura and how things change under him and the respect level obviously the players aren't respecting themselves are not respecting the organization by acting the way that they did\nWas over there I Love and a lot of ginger ale drills in the palace market anymore now is it\nIn ginger ale ... lots of ...\nYou know where we gate now in the NFL believe it or not and it's like the mid term but what's the midterm grades I'm Alice ... who's the de now and the IED that most surprised you\nAtop girl we would be my MVP um because I just think that that you know as a rush hour as a receiver this guy's been absolutely Brian I I just you know what he's doing it it's just a special you know he's really truly a game changer that\nYou know defense of have to account for the running back position I just think he's been absolutely splendid the season you know the jets of surprised me and I'm I Know they're not going to the post season but I really thought this was going to be a bad team and instead they're not\nPlugged their you know what's interesting to me is how the jets have become\nThe giants and the giants have become the jets because the giants where my other team that's really I thought this was going to be a much better team than what they ban and now the dismantling of this team\nDuring the season if you were going to make these types of moves like trading Eli Apple trading snacks Harris and why didn't you start to rebuild and the off season why didn't you dropped a quarterback at number two why didn't you start to move on from some of these veteran players that aren't fitting in with what you're doing instead you're having a fire sale right now midway through the year\nAnd you know you're going nowhere fast so I think the only thing I can gather is maybe the the you know they've got 'em in a patch or um or told giants ownership that look we're won't be able to work with Eli Manning and I think that John marijuana to give Eli Manning one more season to try to get it together obviously he can't they're moving on from him but those are my two teams giants jets and the big apple\nReal quick alec thirty seconds if you look at the niners in the Arizona Cardinals they're both won in no don't make me and the the the losers got the inside track for the number one overall pick\nAnd you hear all the time they're going to talk for like taking taking taking you don't see it in the NFL or their instances where you could point to and say clearly this team was tanking because you do not see that\nWell yeah but you know what the times are changing and looked at Cleveland I mean I think is an example of that to an extent I think remember to Tampa Bay when they pull players got out against New Orleans and the twenty fourteen finale to try to keep that number one pick so they could drop Seamus twins and I think that falls in the mix they're crazy part persona San Francisco neither team needs a quarterback\nSo that if they if either of them gets a number one overall pick there could be some pretty darn good equity there from a team that needs to move up and grab one\n... it's that time it's time for you to take a shower and getting ready for the games Allison it really is for\nMe to get ready for my own show I'm ...

I mentioned it to eat off the top\nAnd the reason I Do that is because we try to provide you answers within this show and we allow you guys to be interactive and we want to be interact with you\nAnd providing fantasy information one of the things that we like to do and one of the things that you need to know is we will read tweets if you follow us we're going to answer your fantasy football question if you send it to us\nYou may not have the exact players you may not have the three players that someone as their line up\nWhat Mike will talk about certain things with the players or their games or their match ups that you need to listen to because it can help you with your situation now I mentioned Scott Anderson tweeting at an early saying that they needed five or has five running backs and need to three he's got Jordan Howard and to recall one\nMark Ingram let's have used some worry and Marlin Mac who will go today for the Indianapolis Colts of those three my Carmen who would you play if you were one Scott Anderson what is curious as they are all\nOne way or another do these guys are a bunch up pretty firmly is back in number twos or except for one\nIt's the return of the Mac yeah it's a huge gamble last week you still bang up there's still some concern about him getting through a game but you know what a huge effort last week and you'll get a a a positive match up on the horizon here on the road at Oakland\nAndrew Luck and company played well that all fence of wine that had so many questions coming into the seeds in the last couple of weeks\nBlame for real keeping Andrew Luck up right I don't I don't know that he's had that law under his uniform he's been so clean so we'll take back we'll take Ingram because of the touch count not the greatest the match ups and now a grip and coming back\nMakes it a bit more dicey up front but we'll take them all you will take volume we'll take our goal line Dutch is and then that bears back you're you're taking going I Want to start 'em both on some level\nSo I wouldn't blame you if you're white Howard on over anger just because of the game script 'cause the jets are so bad and\nThis is a potential get right game for the bears with positive field position all game and some short scoring drives to where Howard could get involved not in terms of a huge shortage output but with a couple of a point blank range scores\nThe jets are just bang up on often says well there's no ... today Robin ... doubtful below ... career maybe over way out of his neck injury so the the jets are having problems they may have a problem today with the bears almost a touchdown and a dog in Chicago\nAnd obviously I Need this game a badly in my own personal life because otherwise it's going to be a really bad week ... Jason Smith\nA in these guy goes dude I was gonna say it is the rivalry reads in years\nYou know he conceded all week like he wouldn't talk about it just knowing that the potential is there a burial he certainly was it good to have you\nAnd it's an easy that we're going to bring up Cleveland as the Steelers today\nAnd there are reports that there is serious friction between Todd Hayley the office of coordinator and head coach Hugh Jackson and reports from the NFL Network that you could actually see a change maybe soon being made to the browns for an office excuse me the browns coaching staff\nAs Hayley and Hugh Jackson right now just not a mix\nI dig the fact that you got you Jackson when it up and just struggling everything's going on and it's like I'm going to be more hands on I don't know that that's what they need right now we're not that Todd Haley may look he's had friction with everyone so where where ... and ...\nAll of this right so in terms of what you're going to do a most likely you you have the the fall guy\nShould be Haley one would think but the other is well if you were looking to get rid of ... Jackson at the end of the year\nWhy not just record now sure finishing a year with Haley and get what you can out of the year and then double up and find your next off season\nThey do seem to have some pieces on defense off and she got some pieces as well but it has been up and down we'll see what happens today in Pittsburgh temps in the mid forties next fall day for football between the

but I'm Dan ... we've got kicked off coming up at the bottom of the hour NFL Network\nJaguars an eagles from London egos come in as the favorite jaguars come in and is the problem child because there are probably a accent bill and if you're just joining us maybe at a busy Saturday maybe a busy Saturday Night maybe you're busy early Sunday\nBill or a tablet put up by for Jacksonville Jaguars players apparently became an issue between those players and law enforcement everything seemed to be clear up\nThat they're maybe it was a misunderstanding but for players at a\nI don't know if you want to call it a run in with the law Mike I'm not sure if that's the way to do to explain it but safety Barry Church one of the for that is involved starting safety very church for the Jacksonville Jaguars just add this international incident\nTo the list of problems going on in Jacksonville and you've pretty ... pretty much wrapped up with the jaguars have been dealing with for the first seven weeks of the year\nSo you're probably feeling pretty good right now if you're you laid some cash down on Philadelphia 'cause there's a lot of anxious here\nUh I think what they tried to pull the move and I know you're not a huge movie guy but the the blues brothers move where you get the first beer\nAnd you know oh complimentary for the band hey you're in to play this football game sure come out in and then the bill comes at the end of the night after you've been drinking and hanging out doing whatever else you're doing it the club and you're like well I mean they didn't charge for the first one [laughter]\nWe thought it was you know complementary and here we're talking about many thousands of dollars being ... by this good quartets so a little international incident to start your editing now Sunday\nThey went up mix it up a little bit or as the jaguars have they they needed another twist and turn but this is a team Mike offensively that obviously had problems Blake portals finally they had to end that experiment midway through last week's game against the Texans but he's back starting again ... Kessler though\nAt the ready he he is ready to go is there is a reportage short leash with Blake portals who said that he's fine with being the scapegoat by the way this is all stuff that's happened this week this is the jaguars defense that is\nTalking about the eagles blowing their lead against Carolina and now having to go overseas and bounce back from that game that's how bad it's been in my mind for Jacksonville because we're even talking about the defending Super Bowl champions letting one just slipped through their hands last week against the Panthers an hour to bounce back in the game across the pond\nYell at some of that you just say well Caroline is pretty good team\n... so I think they got dismissed fairly quickly and let's face it what what if it bleeds it leads right I mean in terms of newsroom\nStuff I mean it's a it's crass but that's the general way it works what's the juicy your story is it or they lost the game no you got a night club thing you got to court embattled quarterback who's calling himself a scapegoat play better\n... better football you lost your running back and you played games with that for almost half a season an injury that was it going to get any better kept trying to get them on the field now Leonard for that we don't know when he comes back you put a band aid on it by bringing Carlos Hyde who barely was falling forward\nDuring his running leave one yep so how much ... D J yelled and it's not a guy you're putting between the tackles so you have you solved anything to make things ... and it was all predicated on having a bruising running back between the tackles you still don't have that it's better with higher\nThan it was without but that that's like getting to go on and all your wide receivers you don't have a breakout wide receiver in the bunch they're all ... and three yeah yeah oh so you're not better there and the defense as you mentioned not taking the only way you're not getting\n... advantage advantageous fuel position you're not getting the turn over for a touchdown all of those things that load last year or gone\nMine is twelve and take away the in the takeaway differential this year turnover differential I should say that again only five takeaways from the jaguars defense\nBut number one the eagles are in the division that's winnable and number two the eagles or the super bowl champions you can give them a pass if maybe there's a bit of a hangover\nJacksonville was on the cusp they had a chance to beat New England to go to the super bowl and the sea this drop in fall off the way that it did some serious questions and I I brought up the point\nEarlier in the week on the network Mike I don't know enough about Doug more own to know if it's going to be an issue but I Do know this that remember Doug grown at an option and his contract in Buffalo when ownership changed to opt out of his contract\nAnd made the business decision to opt out of their contract and still get paid for that season that was part of the deal when he said his contract to become head coach\nBut there are a lot of Buffalo Bills players that were not happy feeling that their coach quit on them because he had an out to get paid and they didn't\nNow I'm Wondering how does Doug ... handle the problems that you've got in the locker room in the in fighting I think it's a legitimate question\nHim sitting I'm not sure on how well dug grown handles those outside situations we know that he can coach football\nBut maybe he's just straight football guy because when he left to buffalo over that contract situation there were more than a few players that were scratching their heads are calling out in wondering why Doug ... ended up leaving and then leaving\nI Believe made me via text message wasn't ... it was ... it was an offseason moves but it ... where you wouldn't have the fifty three players around the point being I think that there's a reason to have a question\nSure and you go back to his end of his tenure at Syracuse and the twenty twelve and then when the pin stripe ball he walked away from that job curiously as well so I mean there's there's just a history huh you know when there was adversity or or something that he's not in in line with that he's gone Vegas blackjack dealer in the past\n... who did see some action with one Martian lunch being pushed on injured reserve but yelled and now with Carlos Hyde there how is that go into effect with the jaguars do against the eagles in a matter of minutes\nWell thinking that the games gripped as you're talking is that the eagles taken control your yelled at as a receiver is where I'm going to go with this girl with the raiders you still have Doug Martin there right Carlos Hyde still blending into this team you imagine his workload improved but\nIn terms of the passing game you jump off the yelled are probably the easiest thing of ... will be able to do offer that Philly off and looking at wins is back in number one quarter back looking at Jeffrey as it probably a mid level number to a wide receiver more touchdown dependent\nMaybe being somewhat pedestrian over the last two weeks with in Quebec well I think one of the\nThings is you're not getting the the lean right we always talk about getting a lean in and getting into that rhythm and\nMaybe ... the guy that they've got to make sure they get 'em is touches right to where you finally get that big pot that you're waiting on and you get that explosive this and that comes through that maybe you don't get that with just a a a couple of touches\nFrom game now with with anger image that balance that we're going back to the twenty Seventeen but clearly it's a different animal because Drew Brees as firing down field again\nLast year they went to the run game and everybody said a breeze is done he said not so fast and start weighing in and around again ah I think for ... you're you're just by now I mean he's he's obviously a start I've got I'm sitting at the number six slot\nAt running back for this week uh it's just a question of how much the scripted the game\nAllows for the ground in town with anger and do you lose out on the short short yards touchdowns I think that's the thing most concerned about if you're a Camaro owner is that you're going to lose out on the glory charges there are inside the three\nHe's my grandmother I'm dead by uh Regis on Twitter I'm at the end by or on Fox Mike they can get you a mail read swollen do gym gene tweets in needs three ...\nSo I guess who's the odd man out in that one now also Jeffrey obviously is playing right\nNow I'm at you know they got 'em as you keep\nKill out against Arizona would you keep the Sean Jackson always have been on the same page with James where do you what\nDo you like to show Jackson out now he's demanding a trade for early morning reports from Adam shift or do you watch out before the deadline not happy with what he wants to go to Patrick bag under center\nWhen they were just waiting around willy nilly and he was I said willy nilly [laughter] or that they had some opportunities over the top because as we've talked about which Patrick has no conscience he's going to keep going and the ball down field\nThe Jacksonville defense has been getting after Carson once early on ... early turnover in London we think will tell you what's happening in that match up in so much more coming up next year on Fox

you this still Philip Rivers this week that's because he's not by chargers cowboys falcons\nGetting the week off you're in a week eight we've already got a game on\nIn their second possession but it's jailing Ramsey what the interception of Carson once in the end zone so Blake borders and the jaguars will take over on their own twenty yard line and we've seen a running like ... today three carries Nineteen yards as Jacksonville has that three point edge my comment\nBut you and I sitting here and the guy goes studios staring at each other staring back at the TV looking back at each other wondering exactly what Carson when I saw\nOn that particular place through into doubled coverage mhm there's there was no window at least from the vantage point that we had a on our television screens above us here in Studio\n... job where he was going to be able to thread the needle and find the receiver and he was on the move but not under imminent\nThreat of being taken down and just forced the ball down the seem in the end zone and Ramsey just like humans hunt return I waited on the ball\nWe mentioned it last hour that the jaguars had just five takeaways is a defense so far this season\nThey've got to in the first to possessions of this game so Jacksonville turning Philadelphia over it was a sack or a strip sack bumble on Carson once the first possession and now when the interception in one more point on this and then we'll move on to the other match ups in the hot plays in cold sores\nYou don't have a ... billion playing today\nWhy in the world even throwing at jailing Ramsey you just had it you just had a big plate and also they allowed to set things up but in in Jacksonville territory you'd be perfectly fine with not throwing at him all game long I don't I think that the eagles have enough weapons\nWhere whether ... whether it be Nelson Aguilar Jordan Matthews already with a big catch that you have to test jailing Ramsey with a hymn Dardanelles John Jeffrey I just stay away the rest of the day if I'm Carson when\nI Believe that the graphic was first\nJailing Ramsey ... he's a he's always salty we I I Do have to issue an apology of there were any tweets that came in with the eagles jaguars start that we didn't get the players apologize for that\nPraised these tweets him doesn't have this dilemma but it's got one a quarterback Jim is Winston or Drew Brees that's a pretty good quarterbacking duo to have I Will say this\nWithout before your answer bike yep I of James Winston and Tom Brady on my team who I Am starting wisdom from here on out\nI I I Know brainy as Brady but I'm just rolling with Winston for all bad the buccaneers are ingenious who's proven to be an okay we're going to put the ball in the air also as a bit of a rushing factor\nWhere do you like breeze or Winston and this match\nI'm going to take breeze just a couple of slots higher in that shootout\nBut when we look at James what's saying you have no discernible running game you know to just talk about it a little more extent Bahraini asleep for guys that are\nAnd women out there that are looking at Wednesday on their lineup is still a top ten quarterback this week for certain in this match up against Cincinnati and like we talked about earlier part of a hot place they've given up Fifteen touchdown passes\nAlready have the bangles or if this worm prime time on Wednesday might be number one didn't based out of bankruptcy don't show up for primetime games but you got a little bit of drama to just Sean Jackson thing that's fine so push him to decide for him and he's still an hour and you still have great and you still have my Gavin shoes\nTouchdown regression or would indicate that he probably gets a little bit of red zone levine in here as well or he certainly a guy that\nWinston playing for\nLots of money he wants to be the next guy with a big fat contract so uh right now when the ball down the field back to bad games over three hundred and sixty passing yards looked for that to continue\nHis my comment I'm damn buyer again to reach us\nThat were brought to your by discover card we treat you like you treat\nLet's get to the hot plays a week's German Guy or we ate excuse me last week I Try and I was really good evidence that we just go on that one I was just ready to go does it got to get into a lot of that you want to start or we gave him the national football league season again they are your\nHot play for a week eight for we haven't much carbon saved me why I Would have had that encyclopedia dance it's the return of them at six yards for carrying allowed by the Oakland Raiders we figure we will get that song in a little bit later on by the hundred and fifty nine totally arts two touchdowns\nIn a huge workload last week good wants to play against the raiders obviously with Andrew Luck and afford a bite off that's why things are look it up there you'll get Michel ... he against the jets and a lot of judge down to the

already the giants have shipped out a couple of defensive starters the raiders parade of them are equal parts of the cowboys were first round pick J. Glazer you were the first one to two weeks ago the Cooper was on the tray block but how crazy or the next thirty six hours going to be before the deadline\nWe've heard that as you said three trades just this week which is really abnormal and GM's were burning up the phone lines this week and I'm told the next thirty six hours will be even crazier one general manager said hey there's going to be in a desperate teams tonight that will suddenly\nPush up all the trade talk and the asking price but here's some of the names I already know are on the tray block for your PR gr song a Clinton text ...

Football teams or ... corn around about today in climate teams are calling about Dante Fowler Leonard floored or they're trying to get that premium pass Roger and again teams are swinging away so much so\nThat giant sources told me this week the team's actually called about although back um junior cameras in these in office we're the same that we're going to pump the brakes in it for right now but yeah ... next thirty six hours I think it will be a little bit different a lot of calls\nI think it's interesting you said for right now when it comes to back and thanks a lot of Jay you know Jimmy it seems as though these are still potential trade what teams are more willing to at least discussed raised and they had been in years\nNow and you look at corporate trade you know I I I don't know that given up a one but the cowboys were criticized for not taking originally this year with a number one and they probably would've used a number one next year for receiver to help out Prescott though you know I think you know go against that trade but you know what\nReally surprises me all these players and I want to be treated I Want to be traded back when I coach said we were threatened we say hey you don't play well we'll trade you aware of where and\nAnd the raiders of the tub now five for Trump picks over the next two years\nI I think these players are today in today's game in contrast to

coach I don't like my contract I mean it it it kind of desert my power and try to try to get a forced to move forward movement\nI think players do it at ... cars players do understand the power now that that you do have but I think we hear about it more gym because when ... when it with the team to team trade teams kept quiet now with these players and I want to hear this system doesn't work for me now is they feel like the public\nPressure will get them out of the situation and not happy with it when you make more money as a player you feel like you have\nRuby going through that is one of the things a lot of ... players in the ... you look at the contrary to what's out there I never tried to trade you [laughter]\nYou're not out here you are trying to figure it out [laughter] you know

I'm really excited about this one Troy I you mentioned you want to call the game when I got some other stuff [laughter]\nYou know you mentioned Aaron Rodgers and I think he is the most talented quarterback in this league since uh we won't go that direction I Know what you're doing but but the rams the rams that they've got it all great coaching great talent\nAnd and there's no reason other than unforeseen multiple injuries that they can't take this saying all the way\nYou know I I look at it and you say well if they've had a couple of games that given up some points when you're scorn thirty four points to a ball game I think at the defense relaxing is just a little bit and I think if they get into a contest that defense will step up their things got it all\nThey had some tough contest the deepest has to step it up and\nYou know office gets all the credit girlie I mean running the ball catch it out the back to the bitter deep Corey and all that stuff but defensively you got

of them dropping to three and five so the eagles improved to five hundred record and that seems sub par considering where they were\nJust months ago winning a championship and the jaguars were minutes away from beating the patriots and earning entry to play against the eagles and the super bowl\nNot months ago so this all seems very odd to to the I I don't think any football fan would've expected

it's a roasting somewhere in the distance like very excited by the way this where football matters the most part of the season of five hundred record going in looking sloppy does not bode well\nI'll be at that division is down the NFC is looks looks pretty abysmal\nNo doubt at I'll give it to Carson went though as by the way will also pass along underway in Pittsburgh Cleveland wild the ball first get a really nice kickoff return out timid field but hold everything there is a fly down so we'll check that\nOut but Baker may feel might be starting off with really good feel position were awaiting the call bear the jets are going to have the ball first in Chicago Alex Smith in company\nFirst with the ball in New York to take on the giants today Denver will have the ball first against the Kansas City chiefs in a game that we were just discussing we'd really like to watch it while that seems to have the ball and then maybe the channel while the Broncos out the ball I I just the Broncos off ants I just I Can't get into it it's just not very far\nAfield Lindsey is the only good thing they got to go on right now and he came out of absolute obscurity and he's been one of those low key fantasy leaders at the running back position but outside of in this up and says\nThe struggles continue offensively for a Denver Broncos team which still has a pretty viable says if they get out or figure it out they may have a team\nAll right so uh we'll pass along that penalty was on Cleveland so they're backed up now inside their own twenty for the first session but back to that eagles jags game I I Do want to give it to cars in a way that guy that we've been watching a health wise do you look the same are you playing the same as you did did you change a little bit\nWhen you're going against the Jacksonville defense by the time I woke up check this came out we're getting close to the end of the first half\nAnd at that point the score was six to three for the ... and ... had been picked off and hadn't done much\nBut he really found a way this was a find a way a game for when\nThey open it up finally in the second half he finishes with seemingly the exact same numbers he finishes with every single week which is somewhere between two hundred and eighty yards and three hundred yards three touchdown throws you might turn it over once you did in this game but it work he's finding\nDifferent ways to play against different defenses and how it worked out I Know they've lost some of their games late but I feel like this was a game that could springboard them do a better second half of the year\nWell you just mentioned something about the Denver off and said I think is a it's a clear issue in the NFL when we look at ... teams in general is the one that we are the most excited about are the ones with the meat level pastors and then it trickles down from there of course a month is the lead\nA car someone is injured and he's coming back and he has a rehab through an off season\nThere is some Ross that needed to be knocked off the spokes that we'll before he really could get going\nBut he threw first sixty percent or better in this game and that completion rate was well under duress you was sacked four times he was harassed all day long you only turned over the ball once in a game where you really can't do that a lot against an opportunistic jaguars team\nSo really nice day for him also over ...\nWe gate All right I'm looking at some of the games that are now starting to develop\nA the jets are stopped on a fourth down and so now there'll be kicking in a way to the bear so we're going to see Mitt strip is key in company for the first time no Alan Robinson for them today\nThat got announced late last night yesterday so they're all ... or ... is down a weapon however you have been touting this off and all year long and they are starting to\nBoard games together string a few nice performances together a wire you such a believer in which you're based in this office this year the\nIt's just the the genesis of this often I'm such a believer in in the read and it's because he's such a terrific situational coach he's also a game plan or when he puts together an office of game plan he's looking at the defense\nNot just for what he does well that works again it against it for for what other teams did well against that defense and then adopting that to his own off and that's what Andy Reid has always done and now Matt ... as the head coach enough into play called for the bears\nHas done with this astounding we counted Chicago Bears a skilled position group and Mitchell Trybulski better athlete than people realize coming out UNC and it's on full display right on\nCue opening play they do or read option Trybulski takes it runs it for about Fifteen yards and really showed some some great speed\nYeah no ... and these big and he's got a Howard surfer an arm and he's coming along making appropriate reads improved Russians learning a new off and all these things typically take a lot longer he's not a really nice job working year one with this new coach who's completely gentrified\nThis neighborhood which looked a little dilapidated but you saw the promise and here we are we Kate and this thing starting to really roll\nYeah no doubt about it meantime Baker made\nAre opening job are going to move into Pittsburgh territory see if they can do something we're also about to see the giants office now for the first time much maligned all year they stopped the Redskins after one first out so here comes the ally manning and the group\nAnd you wonder you know Monday Night they were going against a a really banged up Atlanta secondary and they were able to do some things the typically they move the ball they still didn't win the football game\nBut today back home but another test against a pretty decent Washington defense I I'm Still not sure exactly what to say about the Giants' offense and how to get out of the problems that they have it seems like something they needed to address last year and they didn't\nIt's a passing league it's a line of scrimmage game\nAnd when you don't have the big pigs up front doing their jobs on a consistent basis\nYou're going to struggle all season long and the giants didn't address a big issue they brought in need soldier and free agency will Hernandez in the draft you as highly rated out of ... and he's been one of the higher touted guards in the NFL this season\nHome with golden motion that somewhat that goes with it [laughter]\nWhy it was the eagles broadcasts eagles radio network all day he goes if you are just rising and shining especially in the west eagles defeat the jags today ... twenty four Eighteen and that wasn't the only bad news that came out a lot and for the jagged [noise]\nBunch of guys also decided to go out and get arrested the night before right what's the hey how you know you're only London once well unless you're the jak venue there every year well right yeah sometimes twice a year [laughter] your job guys but offered\nA yeah look yeah I mean this is the fear of every single coach shop into coordinator defensive coordinator you know the expectation is\nWe may get beat because the other guys are getting paid to you know sure you're going against the competent defensive coordinator or likewise an OB GYNs coordinators scheming against you\nYou're going gets another head coaches getting millions of dollars but together as good of a team as he can and set the emotional tone and then when the off the field stop occurred in whatever capacity and you're limited from it\nBlotter that says you're starting defensive and or you're starting running back or star receiver can't go today because he's in silver bracelet\nI got to wonder about this and let's pass along a couple of stores Alex Collins a touchdown run for the ravens they strike for seven nothing Philip Lindsey touchdown run for the Broncos they're up in Kansas City seven to nothing or who would have found that ... they're off to a very good start 'em\nBut I Want is there something mentally\nThat goes on and I think that there probably is and I don't just mean athletes\nI mean people when you're on this huge trip I'm thinking of a UCLA Basketball team when I went to China right guys go to London we've seen it at the super bowl yup when a trip and I know these guys go on trips are almost every week every other week\nBut when it's a big trip when does something special there's almost this thought like hey I'm what's maybe do a little something extra we might stay out a little later we might go out a little bit harder the group might be bigger\nThere's some sort of mental thought of like hey let's extend it a little further today\nI'll give you the difference so notice the two things you spotlight and was UCLA in China the up and the Jacksonville Jaguars in London\nThe difference is these guys typically spend a lot of time with each other but it's relegated to work they go to the facility they train together and they practiced together then they go to their homes and they go to their responsibilities their families etcetera well\nWhen you're on a trip you're going back to a hotel filled with your buddies where you're all supposed to be responsible adults and figure it out as best you can\nBut you get together in ways that you don't normally have time to because everybody's got kids or other responsibilities that you don't you can't attendants you when you're overseas in London so it becomes\n... it's the work trip the retreat the ones Daniel where Debbie from accounting\nAll of a sudden get banged with the gene why and you're like yeah yeah\nWell it's because he normally she's got to pick up the kid through soccer practice after work and this time you know she had much time on her hands on with my ties later you're making that choice is what happens\nIn London stays in London or or except for sometimes not um so I I haven't feeling this is going to follow these four or five guys\nAre around a little bit even though of course it all happened so fast everybody was still able to uh to go out there and play today right not well enough to win the game eagles over the jak All right very very early we're only halfway through the first quarter but you mentioned a couple of minutes ago hey the Broncos still have a very viable defense\nOr we've gotten used to Patrick malls and the chiefs coming out and just looking like an absolute show especially when they're home like they are today a they have a not even so much has gotten a first down yet right and I suddenly they look like they're struggling right now\nWell and think about it [laughter] it's like so yeah job who was the first round are ripe von Miller as a pass Russia who is the first round her and these two guys screaming off the edges rocketing mobile quarterback and on\nThe guy who as limited experience playing the position that is a lot to deal with when you don't have the experience and so some homes is going to be under duress today if uh the chief's office of wind doesn't protect them well\nRight uh we've got a huge touchdown and this is something we've gotten used to saying\nIt's Mitt strip is key to to recall and four Seventy yards while and can I say that was about the easiest screens has Seventy yard touchdown like three Cohen is really fast is really good at making people mad he didn't have to\nStraight up in the field for Seventy dollars for its outsell\nScreams works the best when the defense isn't expecting them to be ran they're really truly he'll play it same withdraws all of a sudden you see somebody Rochefort eighty on a drop play it's like well how does that happen when everybody's thinking you're doing one thing which is you're inviting the past rush up field\nAnd then you're off and survive vacate and then lens the convoy in front of a player like a three Cohen who has tremendous vision and the lead speed that's the outcome so that was as much gain planning as it was\nJust a just having the though the horses and the rate\nWe're also got mad Stafford hitting a morbid Jones along touched down play or that was a broken play the lions hosting Seattle today in a game that I feel like\nKinda nondescript not a lot of buzz about this game it's a really important football game two three and three football teams that are laying in the weeds right now\nAh and I don't know Seattle's in the conversation for the division because of what the rams are doing but absolutely these teams are certainly in the wild card conversation big game today lion strike first\nAnd and there are two one at home and the lines actually have looked better uh then they have in years in my opinion I'm I'm a big believer in math Patricia\nOr the work ethic that he brought to the table when he was on the team that I played for the patriots or he was the defensive coordinator\nThis guy you couldn't beat him to the building he was just always there that big bushy beard and the pencil behind this year and the backward hat [laughter] he was a workhorse just like Bill ballot jak each falling off that tree as far as the store to toughness she's trying to implement in Detroit and it's starting to persevere\nThis defense is real\nAnd Matt Stafford look I I you know he's he's been great the stats say he's great it's kind of approve a couple of years\nNice often defensively they've left something to be desired if not Patricia can change that culture making whole teams especially in\nIn that very very ah offensive driven division that if the north we should see more success out of Detroit\nAll right as soon as we said the chiefs we're looking a little sleepy to start off the game\nThey're they come and they move right down into the red zone mobile homes to refill inside the five\nAnd so right now they've got a first and goal set up trailing seven to nothing now they're nice run by the age was one Adrian Peterson has the Redskins all set up at first and goal as well in a scoreless game against the giants the first in gold plated from the nine from Alex Smith will be a hand off the Peterson\nThey'll gain a couple down to about the seven yard line I Can't believe what we're seeing from that guy this year leave of all\nI you know I I Would say it's unbelievable if we hadn't seen it before now he he's just prove time and time again you can't count them out\nOr comes back from a vicious ... and he's the league MVP you know they just sees his occupants of output\nIn years where you've decided to write a mob has always been impressed and so this year is no different all of a sudden you have a situation in the Redskins backfield where it's looking fairly bleak and AP comes in and he's looking like a guy who's what eight ten years younger than he actually is\nSecond goal from the seven now for Washington and Smith is going to dump it Adrian Peterson makes a move and very goes into the end zone thinks they pay that made our conversation sounds super smart\nYeah you know say a bunch of formation down low and it was well covered they had men coverage on and everybody had their responsibility hand up Alex Smith looks back to the single receiver side\nAnd that's well covered too so what do you do you go to your outlet and that's the running back but just ran like a sit down route over the the left side of the formation he may one man miss and that's all it takes in the red zone because it's\nConverged for six All right so six nothing Washington mobile homes out to the right side is going to throw\nA bike or Karimov will fall out of bounds and about the for your lines for third in gold coming up there for free winters daily go to Vegas covers dot com\nThat's Vegas covers dot com

it or you overthrow it instead of under throw it you have a chance here see breeding give them a chance on the throat\nThird down for the Redskins coming up uh in giants territory by the time out on the field first so we'll check not coming up in a little bit and first it gives us an opportunity\nTo visit with some random in hope beyond the call later today with the Packers\nAnd the rams in Los Angeles Los Angeles sports equinox today\nAs the city will host five games one from each of the major sports and this is a big part of it Aaron Rodgers Tom I mean has he ever been this big of an underdog you know what what what are the Packers need to do to keep this one from getting out of hand early\nWell you know I mean look the backers have a good team I mean they they've been a little inconsistent I think it's safe to say I had a twice already this year and one game may look great in another game made it look good at all to Detroit you weeks ago you know they've had a lot of the weapons and is often hurt Randall Cobb has been out on a bow Allison than out\nBut you know the one thing that they have done I think better than most people you know even though I'm not going to say a hardcore fan 'cause a hardcore fan but no but they were all pretty well when they decided to run but all this year\nAnd and I think that they would have a chance to do that today and so yes what do they have to do to keep it for being a blow out\nYou know keep the rams all fenced off the field and the best way to do that is to hang on to the ball for a while and so if they can find a way to do that I think they have a chance to this game\nGot a kind of unique question here just about the venue the coliseum Aaron Rodgers been around the NFL for a long time\nSince ... played the Trojans in two thousand for how much of a factor is it that the rams have this odd home field advantage where a lot of players are coming in there who've never played on that field before\nOh that's a good question I I think there are a lot of them that are played collegiate Lee you just mentioned Rogers at least get that when he was cow\nUh and and what they are so many players in the NFL that come out of the\nPack twelve or teams that have come in here and played either and major you know major gains in the past against the sea or whatever the case may be I don't know at the end of the day if there was any advantage or disadvantage I I think the biggest disadvantage at any tape has right now coming in here is going into the they put together\nBecause all tend to believe we know what they're doing the second highest scoring team in a league ...\nYou know they just got some one dominant talented players on defense I mean when when you haven't gone back and sue and he's not even the guy you're talking about most of the time you're defensive line because of having Eric Donald around I'm coming in here to play the rams right now is obviously very cup and no one's had any luck so far this year\nSome random in one of those factors rams later today in LA Tom was there any conversation with a Packer staff\nAbout their run game we're always looking for Aaron Rodgers to have a little bit more help\nI feel like they've got some talented guys back there but because maybe they don't trust their and Jones in past protection or or what have you they don't seem to allow any of them to get a good slow going I'm I feel like you know maybe maybe they could look to that game a little bit more often was there any discussion with the staff about that\nI think you are one hundred percent on than those in your assessment about their commitment or more accurately lack of commitment\nTo any kind of a run game they got some good runners on this team I mean Williams is a very strong powerful runner Jones is a combination of guys who who can break away and have big runs he's had a lot of them in a short amount of time and his NFL\nThey were they converted wide receiver due to a running back and yet you know when when when they go to play Callie they rarely ever call run place I Know it seems you know very elementary but you're you're a hundred percent correct and and yes I I Would be very surprised at the day\nThey don't make it a significant point of emphasis to try to run the ball regularly because you look the rams\nYou know they're not they're getting the head of team so much where other teams rarely ever run against them but a couple of games where they've had at least competitive games let's put it that way whether or not blowing somebody out of the gym\nTeams have been able to run the ball on them so you know it'll be about I think that's one of the most interesting points to keep an eye on this game today is we'll Green Bay run it can Green Bay rotted\nOn stemming from last year ... Gurley has a touchdown intense street game prior to this Sunday's games being played\nYeah fourteen touchdowns from screws it's better than nine teams and then the NFL he scored four touchdown better than nine teams okay so how much is this about Tom ... oh Todd girly and how much is it about the scheme that the rams run\nYou know I asked point blank are showing McVeigh the question uh on friday I I said you know look\nIn this day and age where it seems like all the young guys coordinators had coaches whatever it might be a have completely falling in love with the past and rarely ever seem to want to commit to the run\nYou know I asked him point like I said if you read any other running back in the league maybe not any other any fact but just about any other running back in the league would you be calling as many run place as you call\nAnd he said you know I I think I might he says now girlie as a whole different cat we know that he's the best often to learn to leak right now um but I you know I I still think there's a lot\nIn coverage with the ... tribe as they say\nTheory is that the Boston Red Sox\nFan out to Los Angeles Dodgers [noise]\nOn new champion coming out they will it be\nShown track and we're all over and this is Fox Sports radio ads one\n\nBy one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for detail tap tap water [noise]\nLive free winter day we go to Vegas covers our biggest covers dot com Pittsburgh right now already up seven next on the brown fat getting we'll go to overtime that the rules\n[laughter] yeah yeah if I if you're playing the brown expects a play five quarters at minimum a touch down to the gym but they miss the extra point sixteen to seven\nTwenty eight seconds to go do happen the Broncos are putting on a furious run to get into scoring physicians gay seen him in fact will throw it all but it'll one hop\nIs intended receiver Sutton and so now second intend Nineteen seconds they are in field goal range but the Broncos are on the hurry Tampa Bay is on the board it's only one\nThat sticks James Winston who's been picked twice today hit the Sean Jackson under sixty are touched down\nBut just to kind of keep it twenty Eighteen famously extra point as well so Twenty one to six the Bengals are in front of Tampa big day so far for Joe mix than it was already a hundred fourteen yards and two touchdowns as far as the stat sheet on ah the rushing you already at a big day for\nAnd if a feeling that those guys names will be on it\nOh yeah there's no question about that and on the opposite side of that docket is James Winston\nWho looked like he was really shining off of that suspension fits magic went away and heritage aim is having a very kind of gene miss season so far up and down this is what we've come to expect from Winston\nEight of Thirteen passing a hundred and forty three yards\nTwo interceptions in a touchdown and you know the first interception was completely ridiculous it was down in the red zone he's got Mike Evans who's a toll receiver somehow find joy to overthrow him and that's his second red zone interception in four weeks\nYou just can't have those those are those are points off the board because you're down there and scoring area\nWell uh and now a throw it to the end zone from Denver and that is caught and that is going to be a touchdown for the Broncos with only five seconds left to go just when you thought\nThat Kansas city's defense was going to start getting healthy and starting to play well or they have a they turned out this effort there still leading today but ... ... the scenario here twenty five yard line Fifteen seconds to go and a half and a receiver gets over everybody's head in the back of the end zone what's going on yeah\nLook you know this was just a miscommunication on coverage Denver did something pretty sneaky they ran a goal route on the outside\nThe slot receiver ran a very deep out and so it just drew coverage you drew the corner he swapped off because he had zone principles that he was defending and then you had the safety get eager to jump that route as well and and they left the free runner down the sideline\nAnd so uh is it is Patrick\nPatrick gets to touch down in the extra point is good for the Broncos are down to in case the\nBit and this chief defense bar outside of just two games where they've really shined has struggled all season long so this could be a shootout and Casey\nSteelers thinking about going forward for one at the browns for yard line up seven six Fifteen seconds they will they'll throw it's a first out it's not a touchdown though\nJus just Smith Schuster where the quick shot gets to the to yard line Steelers so called time out eight seconds left to go still one time out on the board\nFirst and goal so the playbook should be open for at least one play\nYeah so you have twins too the the the wide side there where ah obviously big them was look and it was Antonio Brown and the slotted was Jewish misused drought wide and they were in that rubber out concept than they did it the right way the mesh wasn't good enough so the outside receiver comes in\nA brown from the inside slot goes out and they cross each other's past the defenders did a nice job switching off\nAnd they made a great tackle on Smith Schuster\nI'm All right so let's take a look at that play as the Steelers comes on line now for a first and goal from the two but are they put a couple of seconds back on the clock only ten seconds left office burger will throw Antonio Brown he's in touch down second one of the day for brown\nBottles screen and this again is an example of when the college play book weeks into the NFL what you saw was short motion the wide receiver was Antonio Brown working his way back in typically you're just going to three ... three men route concept but the two receivers in front of him Smith Schuster\nOr was involved in the blocking and they sealed up anybody who is able able are capable to make a tackle and he had to walk in touch down their\nScore yet again this time the extra point from Bullock is no good but they're having a day twenty seven six bangles lead the buccaneers adult and\nA couple of catches for twenty seven yards and one of them is for a score Bengals are pulling away at the buccaneers and you are talking about Winston earlier this is the kind of game that I feel like Seamus Winston cannot afford right now\nBecause the jury is one hundred percent still out there Sassaman is taking place you saw with its Patrick already did with this group\nAnd while they're in a year of trying to decide is Winston our future largely because of his behavior off the field more so than his performance on it if you start having performance issues on the field\nBased on what's happening off on this team going to give up on you\nYeah and I I'm not expecting him to be involved in the trade deadline or anything like that but Jason light the general manager there or a guy who I worked with in the past two different teams really talented skilled personnel voice in the league\nOr he has made some some he's been open about the fact that they're interested in shopping at the deadline so I'm curious to see what they do\nAnd if they do certain things where they're they're building you know an up and they bring in some key role players you don't necessarily think that they have to be building around Winston maybe it's building around a future quarterback they're taking the draft somewhere\nInteresting you bring up trades I feel like the NFL and I don't know if this is a one year thing or if this is going to start to be a thing\nBut it feels like with the trade deadline coming up on Tuesday yup the NFL is moving more toward a baseball or maybe even a basketball model where they were going to be more moves than we're used to there have already been some we saw um Ari Cooper just get shipped out last week\nBut you look around at the league Patrick Peterson has asked for a trade there Sean Jackson apparently as ALS for a trade I hear the name dumb areas Thomas a whole lot there are a handful of teams out there that right now might be sitting at one in six or two and five looking to the future and if it\nIn fact look every week is a copycat league the same way teams are in the NFL you see some some work on Sunday against the defense used a rule that said that the ... we're going to be game planning for them pretty soon so the same thing happens in we'd just starting in baseball this idea of tanking and rebuilding in trading assets\nTo to gain first round or ... or the opposite adding assets as you're making a stretch run\nWas popular always has been a base for I very least very recently has been extremely popular in baseball that trickled into the NBA where you have teams tank and then have re births are the mavericks are going through it we saw the gentrification with the LA Lakers now bringing LeBron James\nAnd they have a second overall picking Lorenzo ball they're hoping that pans out\nThe raiders or the perfect example NFL where this has happened ten year contract for good and he's going round up on this thing I wouldn't be shocked if one of the names you hear traded way at the deadline is Derek car\nYeah well they did a quarter or report this morning they physically told their car face to face you are are quarterback for now in the foreseeable future what we do know is maybe the foreseeable future just means tomorrow\nSo yeah I couldn't see Tuesday so I met one I said but now you're saying I I yeah\nThere's nothing with the raiders that I wouldn't believe right at this point or however there is that report or that it was a bouncing around this morning All right the Panthers and out Twenty one seven and maybe threatening

got to look at the updated stats I think still leads the NFL in touchdown passes you can get another one jeeze lead the Broncos\nThirty two fourteen really nice way call on fourth and won\nTo be a little less reliable you're seeing more and more coaches decide let's just go forward on fourth in short as opposed to a forty something or fifty something yard field goal\nThink it's more exciting and you're seeing a nice play calls like that in big situations and it's working out I think it's actually good for the sport\nWell this is also one of those things where analytics prove out overseas in right so if you look at Fort down convergence typically teams actually do pretty well on fourth in short\nAnd so when you have those numbers in combat compelling evidence that you should go forward on some poor towns and then you have Doug Peterson go on and win a Super Bowl with a Philadelphia team\nThat was the early ... down in distance yeah you're going to see a lot more than that it's ... it's got to get league it's almost like\nEverybody was waiting for the excuse and Peterson had provided a year ago so now you're seeing it in a widely more available and the kicking game the struggles that we've seen in eight weeks it NFL season has really just given another boost to the mindset\nAll right so you know once you get a safety you get the ball back in Pittsburgh did that however ah they've been presented to fumble right away deep and their own territory so the browns down by ten suddenly have the ball in scoring territory second and eleven\nAt the Pittsburgh Thirteen yard line so Baker Mayfield has not been able to get much going today just Ninety One yards through the air\nBut an opportunity to tighten this one off which I'm sure you will because we know the game's going over time it's a Brahms game he hits Jarvis Landry he'll work is way down to the six so we're going to have a third down along for\nFrom the six yard line for the brown seven ten and counting to go third quarter their Pittsburgh up sixteen to fix this goes back to what you said earlier when we were talking about\nThat you would expect but so far today this is by far beyond the game where he is statistically been able to do the least this is his best opportunity yet\nYeah you know ... missed opportunities ... management led the ... brown trout fourteen six at half time um so they really need to clean it up from two standpoints\nObviously capitalizing on second opportunity possessions like there in one right now but aside from that huge accent so tenuous situation you can have things like that on on your trail when you are when you have the record to foreign one after losing as many games as he has over consecutive seasons previous to this\nOne little upset with the Steelers de here because one of my fantasy tight end David in ... was the guy being targeted on the touchdown for Cleveland instead they interfere with them and it is cold and so the browser get first and goal but one but I don't get credit for that\nI'll tell you what that was the name of interference mugging and I I mean he was he really he really tackled by their numbers are secondary and then absolutely mopped up by another one but he wanted to play ball they were just added only eighty\nFive in the in in in the end zone\nThey got their money's worth all given that oh yeah I Want to get a penalty what the heck so first and goal for the browser the one here is next job he won't get in he's going to get right back to the line of scrimmage that's it\nSecond goal and I gotta feeling the browns are going to need to do something we were just talking about guys like Andy Reid creative play calling I gotta feeling in this match up you're not going to run the ball off the metal in this situation Steelers going to be ready for that take it off the board\nI I'd love to see the browns especially not waiting for a third down do something unique right here from the one yard line see if you can get yourself in the hands on\n... ... ... a little ah Philly Special maybe you know what I mean they did that earlier in the season in a situation like this maybe go for the gusto again you have a mobile quarterback up and they spread to form\nPump face and I was going to go down for ... all the way back in the tent yard line and maybe that's why you don't do it that way I see now that's the risk that you Iran and fall back from the one yard line or maybe something that gets the ball out of his hands a little bit quicker shoveled paths kind of a thing would have made more sense but hey that's a hindsight's twenty twenty always\nWell yeah and also here's the other thing about um the red zone when you are on the one yard line the windows to throw it in our so tight that actually occasionally taking stock\nOr maybe an all sides will pull you back and then you have a little bit more room to open up some of those windy windows that close quickly when you only have twelve or eleven years to defend defensive\n... however there was a hold on the Steelers on the plane so it's actually going to move the ball to the half yard line the browns get to do it again first and goal from the war and\nMay feel will guard the shotgun again job is in the backfield next door to a receiver stewards writing wonder was last may feel this back to throw he will throw back in the end zone editors caught for a touchdown that one is none other than Antonio Callaway hold everything flag down on the field yet again I think\nOr the season for a one eight hundred eighty seven oh two eighty

territory this was going to be there being jailed I looked at you said something about something I look back and the giants already denounced the ball again like they cannot do it and they cannot get it first out\nIt's complete ineptitude offensively for the giants and it has been all season long this is precisely why oh they'll Beck and complain\nI I don't understand why he did it the way he did because from the standpoint of how you handle your transgressions mini air it out with the guy you Rob issue with or the guys you're up in the white color your quarterback as opposed\nI'll never understand but his argument is founded because this happens has not clicked but it really starts with the the the guys and blew up front not doing a great job protecting Eli Manning or getting much going in the ...\nAll right and Washington going right back to the well with Adrian Peterson who now has them on the move\nAnd also the jets do indeed scored a touchdown Donald so hurt and so that's the one score game again where the lemon ten left to go in it so we'll keep you up to date on all that but right now let's welcome index Stockton who will be on the call for the forty niners and the cardinals today Dick\nThanks so much we really appreciate your time how would you assess in ... and how the cardinals assess the or the maturation process with Josh Rosen right now after getting a few games on it about what are they thinking and saying\nWell it's a good question I I think that Josh Rosen like all the rookie quarterback\nHave shown flashes and the ability that they're going to a good quarterbacks but they do make mistakes every charge Rosen is really a you know at a disadvantage because as you know a he has to do up at the coordinator coming into this game Byron ... which the quarterbacks coach is now the at three different coordinators at UCLA for years and now he's got\nA two in one year in his rookie year\nAnd that's a that's a big fight to fill their or for Josh Rosen but the one thing they like about him like instinct or he's going to get to a place called ... and early they're going to try to get David Johnson free on some of the ... the the route so I think that it's going to be an awkward thing for the cardinals eighty one so they got ... down the line\nAnd Byron will laugh which stepping in for MIke McCoy he's fired after you know fairly abysmal performance by this cardinals ... over the ... early weeks of the season he steps then how did his first we go\nWell that pretty well you know the players like him and one of the reasons they like fire left which is an easy one\nAnd as an intern and then the quarterbacks coach even had a recall of any place in pre season\nIn our audience last year here so he seems to happen electricity we talk to the other day you you're obviously can't revamp the entire plane well you know are from Thursday to now but he can do things to get their big claim acres going such as Johnson and of course Larry Fitzgerald\nLet's look at the other side of the ball as well with the forty niners and I think one of the real head scratcher is about a guy who out a lot of talk around them this off season a wonderful rookie year when he plays for Reuben Foster\nThen all of this stuff in the legal realm but ended up going his way he's come back he's playing but he doesn't look like the same guy what one on one of the forty niners saying about that\nWell you know he hasn't really broken out he hasn't really done anything Ruben Arthur ... dealing with the right shoulder injury\nA pen and you know a\nDefensive bleed the same as being a solid against ah the run but I'm not against the past but the big problem for the forty niners has been turned over his office in fact the last time with the car to beat them three weeks ago they score twenty eight point\nBut there were five turnovers and Twenty one of their twenty boy came as a result of turnover so that's not you know knock on the forty niners deep and so that it's been a big problem you know they ... they lost a MacKinnon the running back that's been a big problem but the turnovers have really hurt this team they are more\nYou have a ways than anyone in the league and the U.S take away\nYou know CJ bad they're now obviously has the reins of this forty nine or ... I remember when he replaced drop below early on everybody was appreciating his grading is they got some wins in some places to get them what is the narrative on CJ bastard entering this Sunday's game\nI I think he's under under a little pressure here and I'll tell you what a what a ...\nIn the pocket in fact he's actually ... because he'll hang in there and we'll lose the road turnovers that a growing of all the way are taking us back so that's the problem with that but here what are your what how China and did he pointed out to him\nWhen Shanahan was in Washington\nHe had her ... her cousins one died in the first game was Nineteen interceptions\nAnd you know the date better is one in seven ... Thirteen intercept that look quarterback who got big money and it's not quarterbacking the biking out a slow start to don't let your confidence get that\nAnd it was a comeback victory for the browns and it's because ah Adams in the defense of backfield for the judge said well we weren't prepared for may feel maybe the Cincinnati Bengals aren't prepared for fits magic\nThey'll kick the field goal it's now thirty four Nineteen Cincinnati leads it they'll get the ball back but still as we said\nJust under Thirteen minutes left to go in this game plenty of time Carolina has scored again the route is on for the Panthers over the ravens thirty three fourteen that was a Kim Newton touchdown run\nOut to get things done there so here we go down the stretch giants about to get the ball back down by

I mean if you had any kind of\nTime to work with this ... running identity ... back um junior could have you know Fifteen hundred yard year I mean I mean he's just that talented she he just doesn't he doesn't get the ball enough to to shore to make good on the town he provides and brings to the table\nWell can I mention something about back in because of the giants often has seemed on such hard times you know we haven't talked about it from the fantasy perspective a short time ago you were like yeah he was one of the early draft picks that's not performing well well the giants don't score a lot of touched down so Dell doesn't\nToday at six hundred and forty nine yards he's got a hundred twenty five yards receiving today this is his fourth one hundred yard receiving game on a season that's now edits halfway point like old out back to his point from a few weeks ago\nHe and say corn Barclay are actually the only thing that is working for the giants off so that was right\nYeah you know it's um the approach was wrong sure I'll give you that oh dealt back in June or didn't say anything wrong necessarily yeah why don't you throw the ball down the field why don't you exploit a deep threat receiver against\nSecondaries you cannot cover him Josh Norman is one of the best in the week he's been on him all day and he's out of it over a hundred yards receiving in a game that this fence could not get out of its own way so yeah truthfully those are valid concerns and questions that you should not be asking\n[laughter] should be talking to your office to coordinator at quarterback\nAnd getting on the same page organization only ah so that's the part of the message I didn't like his how it was broadcast it but the message is truthful Denver gets a field\nGoal they go for the armed side kicked the chiefs coverage thirty the twenty three the chiefs lead it they're pretty much going to be able to kneel down and walk and this one end of the victory column so the chiefs I Will get another victory and stay atop the AFC West\nAndy Dalton and the Cincinnati Bengals aha ha ha or walking off the field after not converting on a third in sixteen they try to throw the screen to mix in he dropped the ball and he had a combo in front of them so Yes sir\nThat's right ... point game there's three twenty two to do in the game [noise] the boxes you not have any time outs but there's plenty of time on the clock needs the money up magic are you kidding three twenty two is enough to within the regulation\nRight now I'm going all the ... way drive for Ryan Fitzpatrick are you always get mad at teams for scorn too fast who cares this time around Brian Fitzpatrick eighty eight yard touchdown thrown calling right now\nLook I mean I don't have a dog in this fight you know I I was like you do barely know any of this and that is bagels players I may I if I looked at the roster I I don't know Ryan Fitzpatrick guy I Know him up him through other guys I played with\nI just rooting for this guy to continue or whatever it was that curled inside of him and got them firing on all cylinders early this season it's been a lot of fun to watch\nAll I'm terribly wrong it's only attend yard cash so all you have to play by play now are Dr ... brother you can do this All right three minute mark we're watching the box they're down eight they got the ball at their own at Twenty one yard line\nI'm keeping an eye on other things out and about James Carter just scored a touchdown that's going to put things away for Pittsburgh the browns do have the ball but final seconds taking away and the browns will not go to overtime for only the second time\nThis year you know it's interesting it's a line from Dave Roberts\nAh who said over this World Series bid that he's a competing against the uh the Boston Red Sox the Dodgers are and as a manager he goes look over a series of bears out the better team usually wins and you could say the same thing in football when you're playing a team twice\nYour tie the first game what'd you think was good and when when the ... states rounds again their head or football team my assumption my odds my money would have been on the Steelers and sure enough that's how it started out and I got to tell you\nHave certain one how about my cabins for about twenty five yards at a pass interference that war\nHe had a whole way\nHe had a a fish of Jersey of my Kevin ... as they were battling on the sideline yeah I don't know how it caught that ball but he did right under its face mask you drops the turf and that's a long gain or a V.

ever get to witness cable forty seven yards a red flag on the field goal so they're going to miss it\nWay thirty four thirty four six ticks to go we're waiting on the flag however an adult and does not seem concerned with it he just took his helmet off and heading for the sideline and a sort of said the bully Carrie okay turn it over to you although now uh now the red rival [laughter] coming out on the field\nWhat is happening here we're waiting trainers are looking at the foot of aging green who just made the catch\nThe officials now making the call we got to delay a game on the buccaneers interesting so now we're going to attack that on\nTo the end of the play or because it's not at all at dad I'll tell you what how lame on defense is different than off and yeah not a dead ball foul\nMy guess was he was trying to hold the receiver to the ground out it was just trying to get through his feet so force them to take time out\nAll right so with they're going to put a couple of weeks back on the clock seven seconds to go up and they give the bangles their time out back which means the Bengals would come back out on the field no doubt to probably hand the ball off to censor it\nBring it all the way down to about three seconds called a time out so that there will be no further plays after the field goal but the balls all the way to the twenty five were already looking at a forty two yard or from Randy Bullock who has missed an extra point today I Will add\nYeah let's see yeah that and that's why one died yeah so look I mean down is up or nothing I sense anymore I I refused to give life or any any hesitation and said\nWell you know what they need to do the buccaneers need to put ride fitzpatrick on their field goal block team that's right I'm not sure if the edge I Want to see fits magic again I Want to see him win this game for that\nBut I just try and take all the other guys off the field [noise] let me just try and see how they can do All right five said oh yeah oh it's going to be a forty\nTampa Bay on the arms of Brian Fitzpatrick gym as Winston for pigs in this game and was benched\nUm I don't believe the buck Seventy time out so there will not be any uh hanky panky freezing of the kicker\nThis is just going to straight B snap hold kick and then we're either going to get a Bengal victory or we're going to get over time and I know oh what seems right in America we have out over time and every single early session\nOf the NFL so far this year this is our last chance for it or so we'll see meantime while the officials are figuring some things out there will pass along that a lot of the afternoon games getting underway\nColds already on the board in Oakland seven to nothing Andrew Luck with a touchdown pass through quite honestly someone I'd never heard before a alley Cox oh twenty six yard touchdown caring\nFor the colds so they're on the board first in Oakland or the trade deadline raiders as we're now calling them or even Louisiana was a beautiful one headed watch by Ali Cox whoever that is he's a very good football player okay\nI'll put that on hold there we go forty four yard attempt five six to go Randy bowl like from the left\n... snap hold cake is God\nOn be revoked wants all the hills everything there is a fly\nMartin Lawrence does not only does it really all timid fits magic\nThere is a battle there on the bangles this magic out on the field looking like a Halloween costume the Bengals now seem to believe they've got it\nWe're waiting on the call now Martin Lewis pulling wires around it is a personal fell on the ball go it has declined and the bangles well when and it's because it's\nAnd really honest I I like I say I don't have a dog in this fight I don't care if the Bengals when I don't care Tampa Bay wins\nI'm just so excited to see close football well executed Ender's Game situations\nFitzpatrick stepping into the game when he did given this team new life\nRunning a two minute drill like he did a sidestepping pressure on the two point conversion and throwing a chart to the belly of God when while to put this tide and then to see Andy Dalton execute in situations where he typically does not\nGet them into the fringe range where bullet can kick the field goal that was phenomenal football and the game\nI really enjoy good football hate stupid football that was a lot of good football being\nPlayed there are in the waning minutes of Tampa Bay Cincinnati\nBengals have lost a couple in a row and they get a huge victory to get to five and three keep pace with the Pittsburgh Steelers you already beat the browns today Brown's seemingly back in the rightful spot in fourth place\nAnd they asked the north the ravens lost a tough one today in Carolina there are four and four and so that division is starting to shape up or to be as it seemingly always is Pittsburgh Cincinnati in Baltimore really really duking it out or so we've got a good race and the second half of the year coming up there\nYou know in that final in New York I mean that's a sad one for giants fans who are elated when they got sick while I'm Barkley\nBecause a year ago it was Eli Manning got bench for Gino Smith and there was a roaring ah ribs downing no from the fan base don't do that that's our starting quarterback build around them they bring in Nate soldier will Hernandez\nTo secure the offensive line sake why I'm Barkley in the draft Abu ... back in the junior shepherds help healthy the season you're assuming better things out of our fence they dropped to one\nIn eight yeah yeah well one one in seven seven yes in the ...\nThat little blow you away yeah the Redskins or five in two they've scored fewer points than the giants yeah outside the giants are fence as maligned as they are they suck the Redskins have scored fewer points them this year and they're five into it it\nJust it it's it's not luck man ... you have to match with\nIn this league if you're going to play great defense and you're going to play close games you have to be buttoned up end of game and you have to get those wins if it's a ... it's a score festive it's a shootout you have to be ready for that to the teams that typically perform well\nEnd of a season or those teams like Pittsburgh who seemed to be mounted for the challenge when it comes to their doorstep patriots a Packers for many years these are teams that that seemed to have what's in them to to score points when needed and so you have to be that team\nA win win when called upon and the giants have not this year\nOkay the Packers and the rams are underway and three plays into the game or seeing something interesting already that I Want a spotlight and talk about and will do that coming up\nIn just a second what does it mean one guy go

and then all of a sudden\nWhether it'd be the\nEighth inning ninth inning or the fourth quarter you let a team come back\nAnd and when that I I just I Can't deal with it\nOr see this egg or has been there for every second of these games at Dodger Stadium a joined us a little\nOut of the years the yeah was broken last night and the Dodgers had never lost this year when leading by four runs at any point in any game they were the only undefeated team in the majors went up by four fifty for into they have a hot starter take 'em out in the seventh and they use\nAll six relievers were charged with at least one run\nI'm thinking about that for a second one is the last time a team you six relievers in the game and all of them were charged with at least one earned run and while the opponent\nDidn't score double digits it wasn't like one of the Fifteen to Thirteen type games either meanwhile the Dodgers team batting averages now to eleven this postseason\nRight so a Dodgers will try to stay alive and of course ... Shaw going tonight yesterday Kurdish all was asked if this game this will be for they lost last night whether he was worried about his legacy and he goes I don't care about my legacy\nIs anybody get anybody like that really I tell you what he is awful in the playoffs he is I wouldn't start him in the playoffs and I know you look at his body of work in regular season\nAnd the ... gene movement MVP

right if you're a senior owned them around it just for accuracy he's had plenty of ... at like eight to tabulate they'll probably season well let's\nRemember game five of the world series last year or two two series Alex ... coming up a one hit performance in game for and the Dodgers game Kurdish off for now the lady believes that then he gave them a southern for lady blew that\nThe back to back as you mentioned how did he do in the opener of that World Series awesome eleventh that or I guess so he's had plenty of great poets including this year including World Series last year\nYes he has in fact I saw a staff or he is actually a more\nUp three hits and one run that dynamic of ... at least six innings no more than three hits and no more than one earned run\nThan any pitcher in the history of baseball true he's had the most you know how all that well but however this is regular loving the IRA is two thirty nine and postseason about four points ... that's a dramatic difference\nSo we'll

still has that right [noise] they pee all day ...\nI Love it man I I I'm a I'm pulling for him\nYou know he missed a couple of years injury in jobs them off the feel of stuff so\nI've always said he still has tread on a tire oh you know you still have ... and\nHe's just if you look at Washington's record in there when right he's carry the ball is one of your more times and he's well over in those games averaging over a hundred yards you carry right I mean I mean a hundred yards again\nThe the amazing thing about the Redskins city at five and two right now meanwhile the giants are one and said\nWow fake ... by the rams beautifully done it works wow\nAll right well they're trying to do something a night themselves again it's ten nothing Packers right now eight minutes to go on the first job that Rahm offerings has done nothing but ... has a rocket or I could tell you that that was amazing the Johnny hacker is one of the best players this week we go ... put it in his uh Web home wow on the button\nHe's done that before by the way but if you look at the um the quarterback of the Washington Redskins\nWe're seeing the same Alex Smith in Washington that we saw in Kansas City he's not doing anything spectacular but you know what they're winning\nThey're winning a lot more games than they did with Kirk Cousins and that's the thing about Alex Smith Alex Smith even if he's just handing the ball off he is a guy at least in the regular season that knows how to control a game\nAnd put his team in a position to win and now he's winning just like he did in Kansas\nOh man\nRunning cooks who's on my fantasy football town we've got twenty nine seconds ago the first half raiders leave fourteen ten against ... go ahead\n[noise] um ... you won't turn them all over we know who's extra cautious with the ball he's a game manager when he's the leader he's the leader in the locker room and he's the lead on the field and at the quarterback position\nMore so than extraordinary armed strengthen talent you need the leadership ability because we have plenty or young guns out here we have tremendous arms but they don't they lack in a leadership ability\nAll right well let's find out about another game that happened earlier today the Seahawks impressive twenty fourteen when on the road against the lions joining us right now it was during the game with Kevin ... film in tennis bag Renee barber the future of famers joining us right now Renee how you doing\nI'm good I liked that pay\nA you know it was coming and it's you know or income and men very shortly around day I run a or the sea hawks very ... team this was an impressive road victory against the lion team they've been playing some pretty good football I'm curious you know next week Seattle is going to be hosting the chargers\nWe're going to come up all by week's show your impression of the sea hawks I'm not saying all the way back but are they Gary being back\nI think they might be all the way back man are playing so much better on the fence are obviously the the narrative around the team is that they got it running game gone it really catapult if he often but\nYeah I had these guys a couple of weeks ago when they play the ramp\nI'm In ... going to be able to hang in a shootout and they did and today are completely different story man came out random football for still will honor Detroit theme that you know that everybody was saying was kind of find in their stride well Detroit never found their strike because the way that Seattle played on the fence today and it it was a it was an impressive victory\nOn the road I mean there there are so dynamic what they're running game in in ...\nDown the road they roll through this game probably about as easy a one is they had this year\nLet me let me tell you know I'm a put a narrative out there and you tell me from spot on her from off yeah Seattle Seahawks and the ball they rushed of all forty two times four hundred and Seventy six yards Russell Wilson throws the ball Seventeen times ...\nDynamically accurate fourteen Seventeen two hundred and forty three hours three touchdowns\nBut the fact that they were able to hand the ball or forty two times puts them in a better position all fence of le\nEspecially offerings of line wise will you get those guys to move forward they get to be aggressive instead of always on their heels is that the Seattle Seahawks they we will see moving forward throughout the rest of the year ...\nWell if that's you must have watched our game because that aired just presented is the exact there we\nWere all day long [laughter] for the author\nCoordinator branch out and hammer he knows how to run the football I mean I think early in the year and it was really interesting to hear a Pete Carroll said that he was the one that was over ... may be overstated their ability to pass the football thinking that they could drop back and let Russell was well for one game for him\nBut the formula for success is run into football man they are so easy these days lucrative to guard\nHave been off this year and they're doing some interesting things up front\nBut they got to runners and of course Carson and Mike Davis don't even see were shot penny the rookie because those guys are run into horror and create so many extra yard is the game\nAnd it's the truth be told Russell Wilson is about a quarter back when you're on the football because of that stuff that play action or you know neither one of the receivers except Baltimore tired power like it or what you called dynamic\nBut they know how to get open and they work for this office and the guy that I'm sure when we look at the box or are you from you'll see this guy David or ...\nOr right I was just doing that yeah all those\nGuys gets touchdown passes to an end in spectacular fashion now at a chip on absolve\nTheir ... their ability to turn around and head football off on a power power run against\nFuture hall of famer Randy by not showing any of their ... now a now runs a a you mentioned was shot penny I mean this is the amazing thing a year ago the Seahawks head no running game none I mean hustle Wilson was they're running game\nSo they use the first round pick 'em right shot penny and of course even be in San Diego state alum I covered Sandy stale we're both big were shot penny fans and yet\nHe had zero touches a day and they still had a hundred and Seventy six yards on the ground so maybe we're underestimating the often supply to the Seahawks said they were just you know a quality running back away to get one again going apparently was already there\nIt was and I think the last year 'cause I did a couple of their games last year those products and you're talking about neither one of them stayed out of course Carson got hurt\nFor a number of games last year then Mike they've got hurt by it so it was on Russell of the football and\n... what was a little bit older now I think it's a little bit smarter saving himself running game they'll run that read opposite no poet every now and then just to keep yourself on it\nBut a lot of those rushing orders for Russell or because they were trying to force all down here and he does get to that scramble mode that back your quarterback mode and run around and then a scape out of pocket pick up the the ... yards play we get one you can turn around and hand it off you don't have to do that it's safer quarterback and it makes ... no\nThat's the thing that I see like if you look back to four weeks ago Russell Wilson was leading the teeming rushing if you look back to all of last year he was leading the team in Russia where they'd be scrambling plays are called runs\nHe had the ball in his hands the majority of the time he was getting banged up that is not a good recipe not only to keep them healthy\nBut the the team moving forward the fact that he only ran the ball ... times today up and they had a type of success on the ground that boats\nAnd I and I think you do to have a lot of respect for ... ... and what they're after the white football run the football play great because you know you've got to pass Russia or prank Clark and some other guys that are really stepping up on ... where you can get back to be in that the\nWay to run through the you know the playoffs so we're both recruiter ... every time a couple of years ago after they want to be just give them credit for you know accepting what their identity is first of all not going to be brought that quarterback if he's very good quarterback out of pocket scramble make some of the road\nNot want him drop it back twenty five thirty complicate football game boy they're doing it now it is without a doubt the way they're going to win going for\nI think that they will do it much better this time and I think they'll actually have discussions with the lie to discuss what's\nGoing to happen how you want to handle it and they have a little bit of time to get that done but I think it has to start happening that discussion has to be in play unfortunately and it might be the best ... because right now is getting beat up [noise]\nYeah they they have to make a change a quarterback who they got\nThey got to find out because if they don't know what they're doing with going into the trial [noise] then they then they've\nBeen irresponsible than organization and I know Dave Gettleman he is not an irresponsible math\nAnd the the the funny thing the narrative is going to be as good as the ... has been in spurts for them the fact that they passed up on a bevy of quarterbacks a yeah that's going to be what we're talking about\n... season especially if you've seen continues to disintegrate like losing ... members can continue to plummet\nThat that is true and that's going to be a big part of it what I Would caution everyone about doing with that narrative is letting it play out a little bit because when you look at these rookie quarterback that we're talking about yeah and you talk about the future yeah you're talking about building\nBut you haven't had any of them just absolutely flat out totally just destroy it lighted up homes feels like a rookie\nNot running and second year so he's been to a different field is added bumps along the way even though he's done some I think ...\nAnd then of course we're talking about Josh Allen who was who was getting smacked around like ... was his buffalo Juan is similar to New York so I just remember that part of it and I'm also looking down the road\nI thought James Winston and mark is Mario it at one and two I thought they both had you know pro ball potential would be that way I look at how they're playing right now and will the team's pick up their fifth year in their contract for the quarterback thing is always a difficult deal but I understand why people are\nBut I wouldn't turn out having safe on Barclay on my team I think they could go if they've got to find a quarterback for us we that\nYeah and it was magical in so many ways\nYeah Charles I'm just one or the ... ah since twenty eleven last couple of years with the ... years in Kansas City um he came into this year I'm Talking about Alex Smith Alex well a sixty six thirty one\nAnd one record and now he's five and two the Redskins show him he not be pretty but I Know this he knows how to win and he's weddings and he\nHe wins and remember this let me just add on to that as well when you talk about that type of record okay with Alex Smith when he got benched in San Francisco for collar and captured that he got hurt in the last game you play do you remember what he what he was throwing the ball that day you're Eighteen at night is Eighteen or Nineteen\nThrow out all that long I mean let me ask you believe he was a drug Seventy five percent wouldn't you know and\nAnd lost his job so what we can play it different ways in list I don't want the revisionist on that one because those first couple of years and ... capital pretty magical\nOkay he took him to a Super Bowl you can't say you can't always say oh why they do that well they did it that worker for them but that as you pointed out Steve that doesn't mean Alex Smith isn't a darn good quarterback\nAnd he does want a lot of football games and right now Washington five and two for the first time since two thousand and eight guys and the first time they let the NFC East this late in the season\nToday Alex Smith is Seventy four thirty three and one that's not quite brainy but I'll tell you what there are a lot of quarterbacks out there anywhere near that Charles you're the best man we always die\nHey he started the game five for the doctor\n[laughter] have you on that I just think of your house or Charles Davis joined his right there are so much on that box Bengals games coming I'm a little bit moose Johnson is going to be joining us a little bit later on uh we got an incredible again going on as far as the rams in Packers concern\nThe rams just scored on a safety so\nThey had just pinned the backers back they just scored on his safety the ramps only ... eating nine total yards and off fans with three minutes to go on the first half

Monday partly cloudy with a high sixty eight\nMonday Night school to be cloudy and forty five and low sixties on Tuesday so a bit cooler as a storm system arrived a meteorologist an holiday on I talk one oh six point seven games\nWhat we saw today was all for those interceptions are probably on gene this last week or more to the interceptions was because one of his receivers that on the wall routed brought a defender or that he did not anticipate to be there but I I think today that was a couple of overthrows\nUm he just he did not play well from the quarterback position he did not see the field well um so I I really think the Tampa Bay has no option right now but but to go with Ryan could Patrick\nMost you know this as a player or coaches hate when you continue to make the same state right or if you're a young player you're young quarterback or any position and you make mistakes okay\nBut in your fourth season as a quarterback you cannot the narrative can't be the same we can still be\nTurning the ball over especially in the red zone my ... you can't it can't happen no matter how much talent you have no matter how much on strings or whatever that is if you continually turning the ball over especially in the red zone in scoring position they can't you can't work with that\nNo no and and and that's the biggest thing because this is yeah they're doing great offensively they're throwing up all kinds of yards and doing different things\nUm you know for my explosive standpoint but it but as you pointed out you know when you start to lose points and then let's let's just say today that it was it was definitely the first few local uh uh the first interception costs in the ... the second one probably cost him some points there and then obviously the pitch six so\nUm yeah you're you're just you're mistakes are are are very critical so um it's just it's the sixteenth game he's had a multi interception game I I think I saw a graphic on our telecast day once he got the four I think it was the third time and his group that he's had foreigners\nThat means crazy so you know that that's just that's irresponsible and as you pointed out making the same mistake and not learning\nYour errors in the in the in the past there always Johnson is\nOr is it an emerging star all the controversy involving these young man coming into the NFL today is first hundred yard day uh the season ... what do you see and Joe mixing how good can he be\n[noise] how he can be very good uh I think I think he gives the complimentary element to Cincinnati is all fence um you know I'd ... or the defensive coordinator for the box was was concerned about John makes another one day um and and he proved why this afternoon so it was one of the points that that more of an\nReally emphasize with us or friday when we sat down and talk to the Bengals players and coaches\nAre ... and he wanted he wanted anti ... and in some of the run past option opportunities ah it it's a fifty fifty it's not a\nJust a real you know heavy past situation ... let's let's let's go with the ... let's let's try to get a physical element back into our office and and they kind of went that way today I think you saw on a on the opening drives horses that ... that they were they were really starting to see Joe mixing the ball so\nUm you know I I think he earns an opportunity to to become a bigger part of that I thought he ran well\nI'm ... there were several times when it wasn't a lot there are any and he was getting yards are on his own so yeah I I think that it's something today that they really need to take a long hard look at it become a little bit more about moving forward\nAnd we talk about a big green and we are I'm In the office of weapons did Cincinnati has\nThe the surprise for me and I've been for a lot of people is not so much AJ green we know what he brings me to say what the emergence of Tyler boys are really being a one a receiver for Cincinnati just talk about the importance of him or to a man especially for these big play for any donors target\nYeah without a doubt um you know you kind of disappeared and that Kansas City game last week and um but he's had a couple of big games or so far this year I had another one this afternoon or you have to have that call\nIt's there to be able to take advantage of that and\nYou know ... was that guy in the middle of the field from the tide in position and how it's titled void\nOr you know I I think that Alex Erickson as a guy that or is that she's in progress as before and we used to use him\nOr is that slot type receiver and and some of the jet sweeps and different things that they can use with his skill sets so as Cincinnati transitions out of that three tied in personnel grouping that there was so successful form in the beginning of the year because they've had so many injuries is hiding spot you're going to see this free wide receiver group start to become more comfortable\nAnd start to become a big part of what they're doing all kinds of show\nThe bagels are five and three moves right now halfway through the season they had a plus for internal margins today but they gave up five hundred and Seventy six told a yard sale the bucks so I guess Bengal fans want to know should they be taken seriously as a contender or are they still a pretender\nUm the the [noise] the the big thing for me is um\nKnow you look at what they're doing right now and there seems to be um an adjustment going on with her last coming in and trying to we're wanting to put his spin on what they're doing a defensively um you know this is very similar to what Minnesota does it's it's kind of that Mike Zimmer style the fence that they've\nThey've still really kind of leaned on 'em and terrible Austin with like the kind of tweak it a little bit I I think that they were waiting for the by week he's been trying to add bits and pieces um so I think we need to see what happens after the by ah they've got good players in place\nOr their linebacker position has been hit hard by injury or but they've got a good friends they've got a good rotation or I think there are secondary um is more than capable that they should not be a team\nThat allows people to get behind him a critical points in the game is to see the Sean jak said without a double moved to see Mike evidence\nOr at that stage of the game be able to get five yards beyond your safety um is is that that's nothing to do with\nI wasn't expecting it to this man for another way [noise] especially after [noise]\nNot end well joining us way once again from serious ex them NFL radio the one and only Alex Marvin as Alex your hopes are high for your gators yesterday but Georgia proved to be a a little too strong\nYes you would be correct about that strong like all the drinks that I also have a reason that they call it the world's largest outdoor cocktail party\nI Will tell you that it really is an unbelievable incredibly passionate seen ah you know in Jacksonville every year for Florida Georgia in Georgia the better team and\nI think with a nice perk for Florida's you have a little bit of a litmus test to you know with George or being a superior opponent we now know where we're at it seems like the SEC east as a pipe dream for the skaters team but you know again you just chalk it up hope you rebound next week against Missouri go at it again but Georgia was the better team no question\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what's going on today are a lot of things and the biggest story is what happened in Tampa where James Winston got bench after certainly for interceptions and look back Ryan Fitzpatrick engineered a remarkable comeback the Bengals did ultimately prevail\nThe question moving forward is what is Tampa Bay going to do at the quarterback position your prediction Alex\nMy prediction is Ryan Fitzpatrick now the question is who is making\nThis decision I Would assume it's going to be dirt cutter who is making this decision but you know when you when you think about Jason light the general manager you know he is tethered his uh\nHis boat to the gym is Winston doc so to speak right I mean he's the one that picked him and twenty Fifteen but the number one overall pick he's continued to stand by James Winston a during all of his off field difficulties have resulted in the three game suspension earlier this year but how telling is it\nThe Tampa Bay players when voting for their team captain did not vote Seamus Winston a captain I mean this is your quarterback right and and his teammates did not vote him a captain they didn't build your own Korea captain either by the way to think when I tell you a little something\nYourself to if something were to happen to James Winston let's say a torn ACL I hate to think like this but I'm just saying if you were to get injured playing quarterback for you right now and you're not committed to him\nBeyond the season you are running that that risk\nMuch like what Jason ... and the LA Chargers that you're going to have damaged goods on a player and you're going to be forced to pick up the fifth year option in their contract that would be about twenty million dollars in salary for James Winston\nI'm just really not sure where James says when I was just a terrible game for interceptions wasn't like they were tipped passes or things that you know we're ... these were just bad decisions and it just seems like the deep passing game is better when riot fitzpatrick is under center\nHe's done he can't you can't hit you'll wagon to a gym is Winston anymore in my opinion\nA given his inability to not turn them all over in the red zone that the the things that he's been working on for the past three and a half years he still doing those things\nAnd on top of that is also the bill and you ended in maturity you cannot begin to Europe and we were discussing what do they do about a quarter back in the future no matter what they decided to do it can't be with him and my right and that's amazing\nBelieve you are and but the question that is what are we doing this here as a head coaches a general manager where we act with his bucks franchise right now I mean Jason light has done some good things look at the office of talent\nThat he's assembled through both free agency a you know and also the draft I mean there are some really talented players on the squad that's why they traded to Sean Jackson it would hurt the fence and obviously the rumors flying about that but of course God when I was a guy to be starting on most teams you know as one of the top two receivers and instead he's the number three in Tampa so you know he might be ready to move up\nAnd start making some big plays himself but I think that's the thing that gets tricky plus the bugs are too good in this regard\nYou figure their team that's going to win six seven games this season maybe\nFive hundred but probably around that level that's not going to put you in great position in the draft necessarily get someone so you might have to give up ... to try to move up I'm not sure what the free agent answer\nSo right yeah ... you know what I mean so it's just\nIt's a curious time right now for this book's organization but I'm with you James Swanson has done nothing to show that that you want to pick up that fifth eruption pay him that amount of money unless he's to turn around a season he's got ... but then the question is is if he's not starting next week Wednesday starting again in Tampa\nAlex Jay Z whatever guinea a lot of acknowledgement his comeback player of the year and and rightfully so he might be defensive player of the year again but\nLet's talk about the comeback Adrian Peterson a while I mean I'm thirty three year old running back\nWhen they when he's dominance it's been very simple I mean look at the numbers I mean every game the day when he gets Ninety plus you had a hundred and four hundred and forty nine yards rushing today a John Regan's revisited hum but try to put in perspective Adrian Peterson come back\nAnd what it means for this Redskins team\nYou know it's funny you mentioned ... because I Believe it's ... and John Henry Johnson only running backs in NFL history over the age of thirty three that have rush for as many yards in one game as Adrian Peterson just it ... for Washington today against that hapless New York giants defense you know maybe if they had snacks Harrison\nOh wait they traded [laughter] the point that out and how\nAbout that you trade your best run stuff guy and all of a sudden you get gassed by this Redskins team but you're right about journalism and I'm I was you know I've raised my hand as someone that had really counted amount of took the NFL I mean think about it right and Adrian Peterson wouldn't be on this team if various guys hadn't gotten injured\nDuring the pre season he was supposed to be there a bell curve running back Adrian might be somewhere else but which you've got an Jake route and two things your number one he's trusting in Adrian Peterson running the ball J. when you look at the analytics he's one of these guys that cause more first down runs just about anybody in the NFL so he's allowing Adrian Peterson to try to grind it out\nOn those down so he's getting opportunities because that's the type of ... he's not a ten carried type of guy to be truly effective you know he's got to be a little bit more than that so you look at that and also using them as a password\nThe screen game is a check down for Alex Smith and then boom\nGood things are starting to happen one other thing we should mention about the Redskins as well they're run defense has gotten so much better I mean and you know you look at the Alabama connection that you know drawn pain Jonathan Allen those guys have stepped up I just think that this Redskins defense much improve as well it's giving them all to try to win this division although again is hoping Philadelphia at the end of the day is going to take it\nA year and just talking about Adrian Peterson I never encountered him out because I realized you had a couple of years where he was an active uh due to off to build things and then rehabbing from injury\nSo he doesn't have the normal wear and tear you would have on a running back at thirty three and I know thirty ... running back in any capacity now it's like oh Jet Blue\nBut the fact that he still has something to prove not only to themselves but to the league\nAnd you know you put them on a team that loses their number one guy and you bring him in him he's playing with house money right now he doesn't have anything to lose a step\nYou know helping this team does Redskins team who led by another veteran and Alex Smith really home that lock room together and galvanizes team moving forward\nI'm so glad you mentioned that because I thought to Chris Thompson the Redskins running back about this and he was saying that Adrian lights up the room is it was just such a joy when he first got there because he's a funny guy he's a fun loving guy and listen everyone knows oh my gosh we're playing with Adrian Peterson right I mean you're you're talking with Adrian was in the league this was\nTwo thousand seven right so let's put this in perspective he was drafted in two thousand seven some of the youngest players on this Redskins team or run the eleven years old when they were offering Harris made it into the NFL\nAnd it's like you get to play with a living legend in Adrian Peterson owned by the way physically he is back to where he he no he looks good I mean it does in the long run that he had today and the you know that he scored on I mean he was getting caught from behind that would have happened to the old Adrian Peterson\nAbout this back in the pre season or that he had taken up grass one not not wrestling like pro wrestling but ...\nYou know like he was doing that type of work I think he also did some boxing or this off season just trying to mix it up on top of the herculean type lips that he does you know all the time I mean the guy is it in a lot of ways it's like Russia Walker in that regard so you're just a physical free who's taken care of themselves physically to be able to reach the high said he has\nAnd speaking of legends Adam ... Terry ... today is the all time leading scorer in the history of the national football league you're a member of the hall of fame too many I mean obviously is going to be a hall of famer but\nHave we have we come to grass you know with the idea of the special is not just the ... miners you know how you try to put a their careers in perspective with other football players how do you approach that\nBy the way I don't know if you realize this but ... actually kicked off the Herschel Walker Nineteen men back in\nNineteen Ninety six and he made that tackle on the play is Herschel was running down the field so think about putting that in perspective right I'm going to Terry listen I don't think there's a punter that's going to gain a lot of traction going going ahead I think right guys going to be that person for a long period of time no offense to Shane Locklear I just don't see the momentum\nAt least right away for a punter but for Adam ... I don't think it's a matter of him getting in the hall of fame I think it's a matter of the first ballot\nHall of famer Al Pacino and and\nAnd that's you know to when you look at it you know those kicks that he made in the super bowl to do it twice as close as he's been the longevity setting the records I mean it's really to me a no brainer and I think it's the ultimate you know it would be the ultimate tribute in testimony to his greatness\nThat was less than a second but I Do go out to isolate Thirteen Years only how many people are still calling you from ...\nYeah all the time I I just ignored it just I don't even correct we don't have I have\n[laughter] my gr whatever\nWell my attitude about a hunger by law is if he walks away with a Heisman Trophy which I Would imagine he's going to consider he has talked about the record is twenty five touchdown passes zero picks\nSo far this year and gifts\nI didn't go up in the fourth quarter all season long\nHave you seen them plenty of sees that good\nOr it's just I thought he was a good when he came in in the national championship through that pat I I thought he was a good hour by going through this kid had this might be the first Alabama quarterback biggest drafted did actually is an NFL quarterback I mean when you consider the best quarterback Nick statements had has been\nAJ McCarron yeah turn to by law is better so get used to it it just sort of like a ... by the way markers Mario did not marry at a mall or a Yoda\nHad him on the show he said my name is ... ... it's mark is ...\nNo ...

forty five\nAnd low sixties on Tuesday so a bit cooler as this storm system arrives I'm meteorologists Dan holiday on I saw one oh six point seven\nTo get through this uh meanwhile where the two minute warning right now the raiders or tied at twenty eight against the cold so now that I'm forty two twenty eight a and once again it's been a\nPretty good day for a Andrew Luck twenty to thirty one two hundred thirty nine yards three touchdowns me wild cards and exactly been shabby Twenty one at twenty seven to forty four three touchdowns and know picks but the raiders are about to fall to one\nIn six one in six\nHow would you value uh do you do you believe that John ... and ultimately will get this thing turn around or you get a couple of years\nSo you think crude and still has what it takes to be successful well in this day and age well we'll have\nTo see if there's a method to his madness because to me personally the movies made in continued to making a statement right they've all been Bush league wow well we'll\nHave a very semi Bush because of the way he's he just had a situation now properly\nBest player but then you make light of it right guys in the locker room you know a guy in\nThat people respected in the locker room not only for his abilities on the field but his work ethic and practice in his work in the community you get rid of that guy and don't even given the courtesy and their decency to talk to him\nRight that's how you start to alienate guys in the locker room speaking of a locker rooms divided because of a individual\nToday the Steelers and I knew they cover against the browns watch out brown says is where it starts to unravel on him Steelers when thirty three Eighteen and in this game\nJames Connor twenty four carries one hundred and forty six yards rushing my guy and two touchdowns not to mention the old said sixty six yards receiving that's two hundred and twelve yards\nThat's like a guy that used to have the ability to put up those kind of yeah so what is going to happen and if you were a Steeler right\nNow what would you make of a levy on bill situation they don't make anything of they've ... they've moved on they literally this coming back here and then move they moved on whether he comes back or not they moved on he's not on the roster he's not on anything so that I have a chart they're not going to activate him or anything else may not use them I mean James\nConnors is is giving you everything that you need if you look at the stats them with a movie on bill and without him their numbers are higher right\nThere and I are they build a moment I'm writing a building momentum having games like he's he's been having this year right has made them completely forget about uh the great lakes beyond bill they're sitting here for two and one in their number one in their division\nSo they're moving forward there they're not even thinking about you know what's gonna happen when ... comes\nLet me ask you this and by the way that's three ...\nThere's no future in Pittsburgh\nThere yes let me on bell recognize over the last four years certainly as if not the best all around running back in the conversation right what kind of market is there for a living on\n... a huge market for him because he's someone who can you can add to your team and they can you can become dynamic right you get\nAren't you concerned about a guy that comes off as a me first team second guy well\nNo because as long as there you'll be paying players to play there'll be hold outs and contract disputes right so you look at the money to tie girl is making you look at the money that uh other top tier running banking and then you look at the insult of a contract that\nAh the Steelers made to live on bill right I I mean\nThey offered him ten million dollars so that is very much they ... it was only ten million guaranteed\nRight right exactly so our girlie is obviously set the bar would you offer girlie type money for ...\nWell he's that type of running back right so why wouldn't you I mean the market value is market value\nThat what you see a lot of people are listening right now are you from there saying yeah but you're rewarding that guy in every warnings actually quit on and just not what\nHappens when you're in a contract dispute it's not there's not as simple as oh he quit on his team is not like that the only power and the only leverage a player has is one he's made himself a top tier caliber athlete\nThen he gets to demand his market value that's the only leverage we have\nAnd if you give in to the liver you sign that ... terrible deal that they offered him that for the five you're Seventy million dollar deal with five or ten million guaranteed that that's that's that's an insult that's actually less than he would make if he signed the tinder the uh\nWell let me a bill first said that he would rather retire\nBut at that and and that he was going to set the standard for the running back position goes my legacy\nIs far greater a less than what I Do on the field on how I conduct myself as far as the money I'm being paid he said that I mean he set it up front no one believed him like really you're going to set out half a year lose all that money but\nHe's walk the walk man and the talk no and he may end up not plane at all no for the Steelers this you\nKnow Trey deadlines coming up um\nWho would be a team right now\nI mean there's a lot of teams up but here's the problem you know the the rams were able to afford the Gurley an air and Donald contracts because you have a rookie quarterback deal um same thing with the bears and get any clue Mac would forbid ski a quarterback on a rookie quarterback we'll see you look at the Packers\n\n\n\nAnd they've already from so um it was a guy goes it's just a few minutes Fifteen Percent or more in a car insurance means you're probably sure they got a guy got out a few minutes ago I updating your right now on this game between the Packers\nAnd the ... so the Rosetta now the only wraps came all the way back took a twenty three Thirteen ally seemingly and control\nExcept air Rogers is happening now the Packers have a twenty seven twenty sixth fleet we've got seven and a half minutes ago the ramps held the ball and they are moving by the way up in this game Nineteen thirty for two hundred Ninety five yards three touchdowns know\nDrew early in this game as a hundred and forty six yards a total yards from scrimmage\nWhat what is it about him I Want you I mean obviously you've been around a lot of quarterbacks over your career is from when we talk about different dynamics shapes sizes Armstrong all these different dynamics we talk about it factor what is it about Aaron Rodgers when you watch 'em play that sets them apart\nHe doesn't panic he never panics no matter what the situation in the game or the season whether he has weapons are not we've seen it all mhm he just doesn't panic he stays the same in that consistency and teammates know that they can count on him and things like that\nSo it's\nIt's comforting for your teammates when things of hit the fan who knows the\nBest quarterback went on all the years you play in the league who is the one quarter back that when you got an idle you had the most confidence\nIn as a team made\nThe guy that you know in the huddle I mean we talk about the radius of the world the Aaron Rodgers when you have that confidence in the huddle that this guy can actually get it done did you ever have a quarterback like\nThat I did I um my my rookie year Chris Chandler was like that yeah he was Ninety nine on the money the bottom yeah I'm all pro pro bowl that year I mean he was\nNo matter what happened when we knew we were going to win a game but that's just how it was until the super bowl and they don't know [laughter] I don't know I don't know what guys showed up there but it yeah yeah uh having three picks in a row that will pretty much take you out\nOf a that was deaf and the huddle when you've seen a guy do it like he did all year long and all of a sudden in the biggest game the magic gone yeah yeah it was now you're looking at them like [laughter]\n\nWay to make me really live on the air that it yeah I started my friend\nSorry about that either so the rams head of the ball seven minutes\nVikings who had a lot of hype before the season with the additional Kurt cousins as their quarterback and it saves team that was victimized by\nFitzpatrick in that opening game but since then that safety fences come around and the states had a lot since that opening game or the ... second best team in the NFC right now or are the Vikings in a position where they could re assert that so by the way the wind in this game tonight rate for this\nOpen is the Vikings a one point favorite now the saints or a to point favorite people are pounding the sayings in Minnesota\nThat the ripe late at night or the Vikings still in the ... there\nIn the conversation 'cause that defense when they're at home is is is ferocious right I'm such a tough place to play a but Drew Brees is one of the three bears quarterbacks ever play in the world of quarterback period so you can never count him out\nEspecially when you have a weapon like Alvin ... out of the ...\nAnd the ball off to them it it doesn't matter\nWhat what's happening with Arizona San Francisco I let's keep you updated on this one Arizona trailing by five there is under a minute to go and the game this has been the worst game one of the worst games we seen all year and the NFL to one in six teams the forty niners leading Fifteen\nTo ten but here's my UCLA guide Josh Rose in leading the cardinals somebody else is going to be a winning drive\nFifty seconds to go in there inside the tent yard light\nBurn left which offering to offer ... coordinator are playing with a yes or play would lift which in Jacksonville\nI sew Byron laugh which who took over for the fire to MIke McCoy still running that John Fox officer Nineteen Ninety three running up the middle so they're at the aid yard line right now and the cardinals are who are dog at home I guess a one in six forty niner team now\n... maybe there's a future a\nTown it's telling that there is just it's tough when it seems like the world is collapsing around you right and and that's what we're getting\nSo I'm\nWell Domenico Ryan's I didn't even know who was on a on the staff of San Francisco\nA cow Shanahan going wild on the forty niners sideline not quite sure why again the cardinals had the ball there's fifty seconds to go\nFirst and goal Rosen is out of the shock and and so we'll keep our eye in this game as the cardinals try to pull out of a rare victory Rosen thrown away on NGOs that out of the ... floor to someone who was ordering popcorn and he was for Larry Fitzgerald\nCan you imagine what Hillary officials trying to operate after this hall of fame first ballot hall of fame career and I'm stuck with this right now just hanging on\nIs there a time when you just say you know I'm going to fall back on my University of Phoenix a degree and just move on [laughter]\nYou know or you might as they may or maybe I stayed one year in year two long\nLine you're too long I second goal continually ... game right now again the Arizona Cardinals are trying to pull out a rare victory ... pads going nowhere at actually lost the yard so we now that ... kind of call was\nThat I don't know ... which [laughter]\nBy her lap when she was never been an offensive coordinator anywhere [laughter] any level All right so you throw by the end zone then you throw a shot to David Johnson loses the yard unfortunately he's on my fantasy team yeah come on come up with something here I Will continue\nOr so it's ... goal we're now at thirty nine seconds left Josh rows and the rookie out of the shotgun a third and go again this is for down territory there don't Fifteen to ten he's going to throw again he's looking he's looking and he\nGot in touch down there\n[noise] look at that he's gotta he's gotta can I mean we know that about him Larry Fitzgerald given a big hug right there [noise]\nI don't even know who that is we've got that fast\nI've sort of was dragging the cardinals roster any any clue there everyone has like a cow Shanahan\nChristian Kirk there you go caught the past that was an absolute missile thrown by Josh Rosenzweig a goal for two or so the lead is sixteen Fifteen they're going to go for today has tended to a three point lead thirty four seconds left let's ... we're looking at\nThe ... in this throw in the rams game because it's Ms Hill the room game\nFive minutes forty nine seconds left it was thirty six yes Aaron Rodgers dropped back to pass the ball gets ...\nKnow Aaron around him up the middle all my eyes it's so fast how do you say\nYou don't is there any question he's the most dominant defensive player in this league no no question for sex last week as an influence of tackle for snacks or defensive tackle All right and they to point conversion is good to Larry Fitzgerald\nThere it is so the Arizona Cardinals get the two point play to Larry Fitzgerald a future all of it like a Josh Rosen he's struggling right now\nEighteen Fifteen cardinals so they will kick off and the forty niners lump precious little time thirty four seconds left to try to get a time feel go at the very least meanwhile the Packers leaning Iran's twenty seven twenty six\nAnd the rams have the ball back\nSo he got pulled this\nOne out I think you can you definitely have the necessary or ... weapons to pull it out\nHe has a McVeigh calling the place yeah yeah All right uh were and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios let's find out what's trending right now is if our play by play isn't evidence\nHave a baby debacle of it\nOr not yeah that was one of those guarantee I'll let you you know you have money in the back what what what was the YPG three and a half four and a half four and a half of your money in the bank yeah Winston as disintegrating and then all of a sudden you see it\nGo away with God awful unreal touchdown pass in\nFor I Am the one of the big six and fits magical to Eighteen
