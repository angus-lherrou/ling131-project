arrested sees are say\nIn connection with this investigation as our investigation is still ongoing I may not be able to answer questions about his background or or about his motive what I can say is that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope of the greatest important\nOur investigation ranged from New York\nDelaware to Maryland to the district of Columbia\nTo Florida to California [noise] but as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division in our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico [noise]\nBut then I I really can't underscored this enough we did not act alone\nAs you can see from the agencies and departments represented up here today [noise]\nA threat of this go out of this magnitude requires all of us working shoulder to shoulder and today's arrest is a testament to the strength of our partnerships and what we can do when we all work together\nI Want to acknowledge the many partners who helped in recovering and transporting these ... these two are lab\nIn Quantico [noise] this is dangerous and highly skilled specialized work requires great care and were incredibly grateful to all those who helped us in that effort and getting those devices to our lab from around the country and\nWe can confirm that Thirteen Days for sent to various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe [noise]\nA small clock a battery\nSome wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material they give off sheet and energy through a reaction to heat shock or friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices [noise]\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work a lot of folks at the FBI lab based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelope containing ... that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is at ... or say\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different high eighties mailed in separate envelopes sample previously\nCollected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida [noise]\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure under an incredibly tight timeframe we see unbelievable work like this on TV and an Hollywood but to see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab\nFor their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nWe also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation\nOf this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work also want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert\nEvery to try to keep the American people safe from\nAnd who moved quickly and efficiently into action\nEvery single time today's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages and transit now\nAnother packages\nSo we

across the country because we cannot do this work alone everyone up here\nToday understands that and we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together about protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans\nLike to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from the NYPD [noise]\n\nThat Chris\n... every one of the men and women are the NYPD quite frankly all the people in New York City I Want to command and thank all of our local state and federal law enforcement\nPartners in this effort [laughter] including the attorney general's office and the U.S attorney's office for the southern district of New York\nOr in YPG detectives along with FBI and ATF agents postal inspectors York state police and many others they are one team on our joint terrorists task force\n... New York was the first of its kind in the nation it's been in business since Nineteen eighty today there are three hundred investigators from fifty six agencies hundred and Thirteen of them are in New York City cops\nWhen it comes to terrorism in New York City there might be doesn't do anything without the FBI and the FBI doesn't do anything without the NYPD\nBetter partnership that was forged in fire in my thirty six years in policing our relationship has never been stronger up his case told that story again city cops for a side by side with FBI agents many other agencies in Florida this morning together they brought justice as they always do\nThe wide experience of our agencies coupled with the individual expertise the members of the NYPD bomb squad\nAre highly trained emergency service unit foreign fell bureau or kind of terrorism bureau\nAre patrol cops were the first to respond to CNN fall help lead to today's arrest I couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day we said from the outset and we would identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts\nBut can make that promise because the confidence we have our ability to investigate it delivered a precise manner\nToday's arrest means that New Yorkers ... people across our nation are safe but as a threat to raise that there might be more packages out there so I went still needs to take caution and if you see something out there called nine one one and in New York City we have a number also won eight eight eight NYC safe\nI Want to thank them as the public to contact the thirties with information during this investigation New Yorkers don't back down they step up every single time\nDirector re this has been our number one focus of the agency is to uh find the perpetrators of ... and they're bringing the justice thank you\nWithout the U.S just\nWas rickety along the lines of how fast this\nWhen I finally saw the first part\nOf my reaction to hearing that we had a possible match\nOr just validated my unbelievable face a and confidence in the men and women of law enforcement and in particular of the FBI lab there's a reason why the FBI's lab is known as one of the very best in the world and the folks who work there are extraordinary and once I knew that they had a print I\nWas pretty confident that we'd be able to find the right person as far as the the devices themselves [noise] ah it's important to say as as is in the complaint\nOr that even if the devices and we're still trying to determine whether or not uh they were functional as they say is what we're doing all kinds of analysis on that to make a definitive determination but they did contain\nEnergetic material or which is subjected to the right combination of heat or shocker friction or could be dangerous to the public and the public should treat any device like that of course\nHow could you tell us plainly why\nI don't know and then uh what's your my uh normally expect a ah may have been a part of ... appears to be a partisan but that would be determined by the facts\nAs the case goes for now I'm not able to comment on that easy cooperating [noise]\nWe're not we're ... fans with this um\nAn hour and um [noise]\n\nMore focus not on the talk but on the work the work for the men and women of law enforcement here and the work that was done over the last week is something that should make every American proud and grateful and it's too early to stage for us to be discussing motivation in this particular test you\n[noise] worse\nOr about people committing acts of violence under any motivation\n\nYou made reference\nSo ah as I said at the U.S and and I think the attorney general's said as well uh this is very much an active and ongoing investigation or we do believe that we've got the right guy a but we also know that this is an ongoing investigation and there's a lot of work still to be done which means there's still plenty of unanswered questions [noise]\n[laughter] when you first\nOr the president I Will say that I received a very nice congratulatory call from the president shortly before heading over here\nAre and saw his remarks that he made at the White House and I think he like every American is and should be proud of the unbelievable work was done not just by the FBI but by all of our law enforcement partners across multiple states\nAnd that's how they commissioner Neil Senate well the partnerships that exist in a law enforcement profession right now in this country are are extraordinary are better than

yeah with toys lawyers and sour patch kids and gummy bears and all that stuff right because Halloween was in two weeks two and a half weeks and we would be good to go\nI then I made the mistake of opening it up to taste a little bit to take a little pack of Swedish Fish\n[laughter] and that turned into another package and another package and my husband started eating it and I started eating it

said I'd have to buy it again so there's that uh yeah sort of I'm a weak sister when it comes to having\nYou know a handful of gummy worms or whatever and it's a yeah on a let's see this is also a very big not just Halloween weekend it's a big sports weekend ... Floridians and I'm going to turn it over to ... because he's going to tell you what is going on on the college scene as well as the NFL it's all you\nThe good every time it gets hyped I now I hear at\nTemple is ah UCF not this weekend but next Thursday at seven thirty PM oh UCF is seven and ... for the season going into that game so look out for that one ... this week and what scares me we have coincident FSU Saturday at twelve pm\nAs well as a University of Miami will be at Boston College tonight at seven pm on a weird day is going on for some of these\nSo friday night next Thursday night ... mean Saturday I kinda get but okay but that's not the big game I'm waiting to hear so the biggest game\nReally good okay good that's a good idea okay doctor's orders are selling these are just kind of I'm a little bit silly UBS is just choose some gum um phone a friend that's necessarily have a good laugh of course uh um if if you can find somebody to make you laugh I have um\nAnd um but some of these are really good concentrate\nOn what you can control instead of what you can't control yeah a vest really I I Love that because that that kind of makes the stress productive rather than destructive\nThat's so accurate yeah use 'cause the again the stress even chronic stress you you can you can use that to your benefit to do something to try to try to relieve it and so when it's you know a focus on something that's in your control rather than out of control there's two different ways to take that message I mean one is\nUm I cannot do anything about the uh\nImpending financial thing I'm worried about you know I I decided to wait so I'm going to\nUh go work out until I feel real tired so that I can sleep tonight and um that's something you can control but then there are other things like uh the the thing I almost said and then didn't 'cause I ... and ... is this something you can take step was there are things that we can't control the whole thing that we can control parts of it I was going to say I can't control that my mother in law's visiting next week\nBut you can control parts of it you know such as the the schedule that you're going to plan for [laughter] very or if it's a very heavy work ... and uh and so there are there are parts of a you know I Can't control how does the occasion is going to go but I can control you know\nUh you know that I Know we're we're going to be at each point to all those things I'm being able to have control over over some aspects of it again relieved that one central feature of stress which is\nThere is something that I did this power over me that I Can't control anything about 'em but you've you've always got the ability to control some of it even if it's just your attitude that's\nReally good that is really good one of these says develop healthy affirmation Z\nAnd I'm not I'm not sure whether they're talking about affirming or the person or just affirmation of life like um you know ... is the ... the updated confusing version of count your blessings yeah um and and take a moment and and\nLook at all of the gifts that you have in life so that you can put at least the looming problems or in some sort of\nPerspective you know I ah I read this book where he was talking about and he wasn't a a a a any specific spirituality um uh he he wasn't like a a specific religion but he was talking about how before dinner\nOr he does what's his equivalent of grace uh and it's part of this whole thing of of of getting rid of you know stress at every place that he can\nUm ended its that before he takes that first by he looks at the food is on his plate\nAnd tries to appreciate the journey that all of that took to get to where it's going to nurse him you know the the this these were plants that we're growing in the field uh this this was\nIf you're eating you know the steak or meat or you know hamburger helper for for that matter this this was you know a this was meat that was you know an animal aid from the field in the sunlight you know in a cause the field to grow and I'm realizing you know your place within all of that and and now you're kind of taking part in it\nUm but it's not even that that would be great for everybody but it's a good example of that you know counting your your affirmation of the things that you that your your affirming or were somehow working together for your good or something that you've got that you might not have had other ends and\nFor those of us who are really people are fake it really does help I mean\nHere many times becomes just a a panic button I'm saying God you got to do something about this uh but on the other hand if you realize\nThat burned means you're not God I'm In is not your responsibility um and he has the power to bring good out of what ever happens it really does reduce stress or to the point where you go\nNo you know what I'm I'm OK yeah because because I really have confidence that God's gonna God's gonna work just to my good some yeah there are good\nAnd it's and it's a good example of of the idea of of of story and and and the looking at the larger picture looking at things in the right frame or with a with a wide enough frame you know that's a that's a a feature of humanity for forever you know so if you if you look at it\nOr the way that that we do where the the Judeo Christian worldview\nA then kind of ... burst into different fields of of of how people look at this the psychology of of this or if you are the opposite and you say that came out of it you know deeper psychology that was before the Bible was written and ah I don't believe any of that the part that we all agree on is this idea of\nThere's an importance to realizing you're not the center of the universe asked you know it's a a because at one way to be really really stressed is to feel that you're at the center of the universe doesn't responsible for him yeah I mean there's just so much stuff that you can't deal with so ultimately this stuff comes down to there are there are practical things that you can control\nUm and it would be really helpful to do I'm One of them are and this is so important that I hate to to just give it one sip it but\nI'm getting a you know thirty five sleep cycles in a week is a really really helpful thing and sleep cycle counts as either Ninety minutes of your sleep at night or thirty minute nap at some point during the day having that happened thirty five times\nThroughout the week a is a really important part about having the correct amount of neuro transmitters a which all have really complicated names but it comes down to one key point of view you have enough of the right ones in and a few enough of the wrong ones\nI'm doing that or and then uh not eating tons of white sugar a you know in general if your meals can have less than ten grams of sugar that's ideal and then uh [laughter]\nUh carbohydrates are different or carbohydrates are fine without the sugar a and then probably the most helpful when of all is helping in some way that you can help uh and so to do that when I'd encourage you to do as good as simple dot help\nAnd look in a way that you can help throughout the week those that are around you um that's the end at the end of our stress jury absolute thank you so much for listening we'll see you next time\nFor listening to the right side community outreach
