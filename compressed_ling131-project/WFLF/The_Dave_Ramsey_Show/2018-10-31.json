box dot com slash rushed Traverse City Michigan this is Kyle twenty seven years old and a happy birthday or hide\nThank you Mr Limbaugh wants shaking\nHey I Want to tell you why you want to go since we're all to uh people in my life besides my parents\nWhen I was a hearing I was in a call or two weeks in our life support and I had to learn how to walk on the part of a BCS how they're caught one is ten\nScheme of us will issue a radio station I went to college what routes for I Know weighing on about all all that\nOver the last my age like\nHoly smokes you were in a coma for ... you had an accident of some kind\nYeah why snowboarding and I want to be a professional snowball us um and I was a ... that was going to change my life and it certainly changed our life I laid out the bottom of the hell out reading all seizures and I was taken to the ICU and\n... and put in almost two weeks\nHow long that the ... or somebody with you at the moment it happened or were you alone and you had to be discovered\nI Know there was a there is a major loss and there was a lot of people\nSo people people acted quickly when they saw your accident\nTold us all ... him as white or worked in a hospital there are nurses and I found out he actually said my wife she my ... my ... suffocating\nHoly smokes a coma for two weeks and you had to read learn practically everything you needed to communicate\nUh yep I don't remember I didn't remember any of the general knowledge that I learned\nFor the last ... addition subtraction all that I have some a lot of memories by off\n[noise] um well my wife and I of and struggling for a few years to figure out how we should educate our kids um we'd love for them to be taught from a Christian perspective\nBut at the same time we'd love to pay off our house and um so we're not sure what the best movies and if it's financially responsible to do one or the other and I'm wanting to get your opinion [noise] um\nWell I mean typically a Christian school is a private school and there's going to be more expensive and then the question you've got to say is if we go that route it pays off our home in\nSeven years if we go the other route it pays off our home and three years is it worth four more years or whatever the number is you just run your numbers out I just made those up okay but in other words this is going to delay the mortgage being paid off if you go the more expensive school route in order to get that world view\nWhich is fine and um now I I Will tell you having educated a paid for the education for three kids that are now adults\nAnd having participated in this discussion a multitude of times with friends that are Christians and and we are obviously to um [noise] that you need to be very careful if you're going to invest in a a a private Christian school that they are\nActually implementing that belief system\nThere are some that have a Christian heritage that are no more matching with my value system that fly to the moon\n[laughter] I just ... they once had something that was Christian and and sometimes they are still holding themselves out as Christian schools but the values that they're tenured professors are bringing into the classroom at nothing to do with the values of miles hold\nAnd show if I'm going to do that I might if I Will be on the enemy territory I might as well know that I'm On enemy territory and sort of a wolf in sheep's clothing kind of thing so if you're going to invest make sure you're getting what you're\nAttempting to get here I'm not saying that can't be done it can be done there are great Christian schools that do a great job of a quality education with\nThe quality of value system but you just gotta make sure you can't just assume because such and such was a ... or such and such with Presbyterian\nBut that might have been many years ago and there and you know they've got that in their heritage but there are no more than fly to the moon anymore um and so\nYou know that then you've just paid for an expensive school with a questionable quality you know so they're not the second part of the equation as this and this is not the challenge you it's just a kid help you with your critical thinking and you decide which one you want to do in the process my three kids and sharing and I all went to\nUniversity of Tennessee a public state school\nWhich there is some bizarre stupid but stuff that happens on the campus\n[laughter] okay I mean crazy and some of those professors are proof tenure should not be there you know I mean there is some nut burgers running around over there\nMy university campus okay and I love University of Tennessee but there's some stuff happening over there that just make your hair curly you know so my kids went there though but here's the thing we figured out that our kids spiritual walk was not based on what happened at school it was based on what happened at home\nOkay and so our kids plugged into young life while they were in a public university setting and they already had their values and backbone and apologetic established because of how they were re used inside the remedy house so they were equipped to go into that\nEnvironment and not quote unquote lose their salvation in the process now I'm not saying no Ramsey kid ever did anything stupid I can promise you randomly kids\nRamsey are pretty much known for having done some stupid at one time or another but but uh but but you know I I you know you can do that in a Christian school too you know that right mhm right yeah ... right off campus was a bar\n[laughter] every one of those and so you can go get you can go get just as drunk at a Christian schools you can and the state schools all that to say I don't ... there was no bubble that protects them like your home does\nThe preparation you give them at your kitchen table is their insurance policy it's their fire insurance policy it's not you know the name of the door of the school but that's not to say you should never do ... I don't think it's perfectly fine as long as you pay cash for it and you're willing to say we're going to pay off their mortgage a little slower\nBecause of that I Would investigate and make sure that the values are actually taught in the classroom [noise]\nI put my kids in a private Christian school for two years when they were in uh\nElementary school and I found that some of the teaching they were doing over there and I'm like well this is useless is complete waste of money\nBecause they're just you know justice\nRaising is as a mainstream I mean you know so I figured out it's going to be made that does this this was that I ...\nQuestion I get asked all the time is do I\nNeed life insurance listen to the whole point of life insurance is to replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse or you have kids yes you need term life insurance is the only way to protect them until you're out of data to build up your ...\nYour only digging a deeper hole if you waste money on cash value plans since it robs you of their ability to make real progress and that's why I send you to ... insurance and I have for Twenty years that's where I get all my insurance and they only offer the plans I recommend it is not expensive it's not complicated\n... will be there as your guide every step of the way visit ... dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two you need to get this taken care of I can give you the advice and I can tell you where to go but it's really up to you to take that important step to get your family protected\nThat's Zander dot com or eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two\nHey this is Rachel created status always drawn to us that you can buy quality things and still get a great deal that's why I live test needle mattress and captain needle offers amazing matches for every budget\nAnd now they got a brand new ... called ... they took their best mattress and made it even better it's incredible try testing needle for a hundred nights rent free at ... dot com at CNN dot com I don't remember except for free at CNN dot com\nEra's some exciting news simply savers now valued at one billion dollars folks this company used to be just five guys working together now they protect over two million people and here's why simply slave system is easy to use and takes just manage to set up there are no contracts are hidden fees and twenty\nFour seven monitoring is only fourteen\nNinety nine a month visit simply say direct dot com my listeners get free shipping and free returns that simply said direct dot com you of LA\n\n\n\nEuro for like five five to five job and more of your life and your money\n... today comes from blind spots um find out for yourself why blind spots on is the number one online retailer of custom window coverings or\nYou'll get free samples free shipping and with the new promos they run every month you'll save even more used to promote code Ramsey to get the best possible deal\nToday's question is from Brenda in Colorado a she comes to a brand new dot com and says is dental insurance for my kid I was a gimmick or something I should keep paying don't or insurance is one of the most easy insurance has to figure out that they're charging you more than you are getting\nA question um maybe a better course Gary Coleman about my career uh I'm currently and buy food and I'm a welder I worked out of town and I'm Mike around a hundred and forty thousand a year ... and um\nI've got opportunity to go work at home but the pay is about a third of water on my working out of town and I'm just curious if you thought it was crazy to take all bought that I'm I'm not married yet I'm getting married and I bought\nThe making a hundred and forty and you'd make like fifty\nYeah OK at home um where are you where are you working out of town\nA member going on now come up with the world was on um [noise] you know my own they own mocking right now I don't know\nAnything other than a flower mhm mhm okay well\nI think the answer for me would always be see none of the above ... ...

want jump over there on Facebook or lots of interaction or over a hundred thousand folks in there talking all the time\nOr should we Heather says take out out from that community take out our retirement to pay off our car would still have somewhere for thirty one years old no\nWe never cash out retirement to pay off a debt unless it's to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure you're not facing either one of those where you would have mentioned that\nYou just want your car paid off here's the problem you pull money out of a four one K. they charge you a ten percent penalty flush your tax rate so if you're in a twenty two percent tax bracket as an example in the year twenty Eighteen\nThat would be a thirty two percent hit on your money so that's the equivalent of saying Dave I Want to borrow money at thirty two percent interest to pay off my car\nAnd the answer would be no that's stupid and so don't cash route retirement no that stupid don't do that unless it's just unless your backs against the wall and you can't breathe which case might be a need to sell the car actually if that were the case not\nStill not cash out the retirement but if you're looking down the lens of some kind of a horrible financial situation that would be the only time I would use some retirement considering how hard the government punches you in the face for doing this Christopher is in Los

two thousand eleven and a paid it off and uh April this year federal this house and everything this house and everything\nAnd your your did this in about eight a little under eight years\n... years four months I think yeah yeah okay well over at your\nExcellent why do you even still have a second job says no we actually got a second job now that we're ... which is an odd way to do it I actually just joined your ah I took a financial coast massive training this summer fun while but we let four or five a few classes wow I'm so\nI'm I'm a few months into coaching I Love it it's amazing um\nThe word from Boston so I called the ... money and there you go it's it's been amazing love it my wife just felt like she can tell your story ... butler\nYeah I mean I I just think that the business too because when I'm On I'm doing we only have two kids we got lots of free time I\nMean I came to already a full time job and but yeah I think that's the end skin care on the side and but I Love my Don highly both the same place and the pharmaceutical in Cambridge on\nAnd we've been really blessed I mean part of our ... is on\nLearning to live on much less and less you when you make that we've been blessed along the way I'm as they get a shot out tonight parents may help us out so much out okay we didn't have to pay daycare for the first\nCouple of years wow she's amazing amazing wow very animal ... without a lot in the Boston area that they can get\nIt's a big deal anywhere on balls are sure how much of the four forty eight was your house or three hundred and Seventy eight okay All right wow\nYou guys are going to bring the ball yeah yeah\nHow old are you guys\nAm thirty four years old and I'm thirty six with a paid for how ...\nHow I feel\nPretty amazing actually I think you\nTalk about a lot that idea of something relaxing when you don't\nHave any debt that you maybe you didn't know was there and I think for us that's been surprising I think I think I academically understood\nBut I Do think that there's a sense of peace that you get that I mean you got it right on about financial piece that something relaxes you didn't know was there and all of a sudden we we don't feel like we're at the end we are at the beginning oh yeah I mean I think I didn't realize baby step seven is a real step son at the end we get to actually build wealth and do all kinds of fun things now and I think that's what I'm most excited about\nA man and having such and having kids that are so young too to know that we can do whatever we want and we're not we're not tied down yeah you know\nWe don't count it I mean you're making two forty here you've got no payments that were Thirty years mark ...\nTouch gr age you know and I don't\nYou know we had some hard times we did not happening was not easy you know wasn't it wasn't a just a cake walk the whole time but but we uh we work hard and I think it brought us together for sure we um we always had a goal that was\nThat was right in front of us and that that was one thing we didn't fight about I mean like any other company we fight about stuff for sure what that one we were I Know that one being one of the most important ones we were not around the same page\nLove it yeah that's one of my biggest thing even with a telling people when we when we're hosting a leading a few classes biggest thing is I get on the same page and we never fight about money mhm also\nLining the stand here I stand on you know further versus you know this is just polarization that's completely unhelpful\nWell it's first of all this is a reoccurring problem from the beginning of time you know because\nI'm the original um creation story has the serpent\n[laughter] that creates suspicion um toward a God who was all good and meant all good um but yet suspicions soon and so\nThe problem that most of us start with is that after some discipline mental life we develop what ... what was called a Herman new Duke how many bees interpretation of suspicion ... so we're we're always kind of suspicious of the other person\nI'm and throughout the history of the faith\nUh we do we have a ... we're pretty terrible history\nUm I mean even from from giant religious leaders like Martin Luther um hated Jews had his Jewish people and he did he know hated the Jewish beat it people he had a John Calvin you know he ... he hated other Protestants um and so there's this combative noticed that all of us have\n'em and even when we come out of a relatively peaceful time I mean the fifties it was after World War two um nice neighborhoods are but I had a good factory job I'm\n... you don't ever you know we had our problems but but basically we we lived in relatively be ... role to peace\nAnd there was a church on every corner ... and the church at least tolerated each other but as we went into the\nThe sixties that got very rioters literally um and protest um the church took on that culture of being against each other\nUm and and then we went into um the the the whole you know our our view you with suspicion again um I think what you think is not what I think and so therefore you are a threat to me um and that's what happened not only among churches\nAre but that's what especially happened with people who were in church and people who are outside your church yeah and and and those who were outside of church or didn't have a toe the line um you know western conservative\nI'm even Jell Ikle understanding the scriptures the we're undermining the faith yeah and they weren't real Christians\nAnd to this day you know there are people who if you're a Democrat you can't be is a a a Christian yeah no never mind that Billy Graham was a Democrat yeah not many people know that by the way and so if you're trying to tell me Billy Graham wanted a Christian we we can't we we can't really ... I guess\nI actually knew one guy or one time who was a so holy or that he he spent some time heated like trying to tell me why Billy Graham was not in fact I'm ready to end or and so I I think that yeah you you just look over the history of the church uh and and you know more generally look or the history of people in power\nAre and and there is a tendency towards autocracy and and uh\nIt's it's not a far cry from\nYou know bringing Galileo in front of you and saying you need to you need to recant on what you saw through your telescope or versus what people say today with a lot of different scientific you know a discoveries you know some people are really really\nA take it personally or if if people present evidence for evolution no matter how well founded that evidence is and that's where the that's where the divide light lives on the other side you know as the generation who\nI was raised by your generation ah everything's you know everything's reactionary to you know I the the typical person that's in my generation\nAre and not going to church every week is somebody who sees\nChristians as they these poor these poor these poor guys they were probably meant well at one point but sometime in the eighties they were successfully gathered into this right wing that in mind somehow oddly Christianity\nA government size reduction\nAnd a military prowess or like him and like with his three those three ten pigs held up this whole right wing side and so now\nIf you if you say do we could we do anything to decrease the size of military that somehow related to your Christianity or you're American this and so it it it becomes this thing where you view anyone who identifies as I Am a Christian\nImmediately that Herman new to suspicion it's yeah well this person must be insane uh and and must not read books that aren't you know just the Bible and the commentaries on their Bible\nBut that's where our ... my generation fall short because I'm One of the great things about this show has been being able to interview people are where you can't possibly after having conversations with these people I'm uh in in in my case growing up having a my life as I was talking to you\nIn doubt their heart and and what they want to do a and and how much people really are reaching out rather than just building higher and higher wall you know it's always that uh that uh that voice the ... the loudest um because ultimately we really are deep down at our best and some people are at their best more often than others\nYou know you can hear a lot of shouting on traffic but it's it's a it's a crazy liberal Democrat letting a crazy hard wing a Republican into traffic they don't know each other but that that's what they're doing\nA and and so I mean I think that's part of the idea you had behind simple help uh it's yeah it's this um simple that help is is you sign up you get an email and are ones that we can get an email and it tells you Monday through friday here's the simple help for that day and it's things that are simple like let someone and travel it's it's in the whole philosophy\nIs you can't fix the world but you can make the world better ... by becoming a better person and by treating someone else better and I think that cuts to the heart of what\nUnites everybody most of all no matter how angry people are ... everybody would really like the world to be a better place and the easiest way to do that is what's next right in front of you and uh and that's just doing the next right thing the next nice thing and helping people so that that for tonight's bright side we will see you next time on this show\nFor listening to the right side of humanity outreach program designed to help you\nSide can be heard every Wednesday Thursday and friday as at seven GM news radio Ninety three point fine civil the last ally [noise]\nBright side is sponsored by hunter ... discovered that freedom of lasik at hunter vision dot com\nNews radio not every one WFL a still on a um ...
