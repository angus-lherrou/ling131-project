income or capital gains also aren't capital gains tax much lower than earned income\nOr that is not considered earn income it is considered investment income\nAnd it depends on what the money's invested in as to whether there'll be capital tax capital gains rate or tax on an ordinary income right if the investment is paying off on something that is less than a year old it will be at ordinary income if it's coming out of a traditional i._r._a. or it's never yet been taxed\nIt'll be on an ordinary income if it's coming out of a four O. one K. traditional not Ross it will be taxed at ordinary income as it comes out all of the money will be\nA hundred percent not just the returns because none of it the growth has never been taxed nor the money you put in has never been to act on a traditional so you'll pay ordinary income on those if you have investments simply invested\nIn the piece of real estate you don't pay any taxes until your salad and then you pay taxes on capital gains

business boutique founder equipping women to make money doing what they love joins me for a couple of segments if you've got questions ladies about business you can join us here\nThe phone numbers triple eight eight to five five two to five you did a new talk that I'm nursing you do I'd I'd actually seeing little pieces of some of that talk and and you kind of stitched it together in a different way and book ended it with some stories on opening store and a closing story that\nHad everybody in the audience crying knock rod commercials so I'm an I'm an easy target right but uh I'm a I'm a ... a crowd and everything but and you and me ball on out there it was ...\nBut a powerful story about your talk was about overcoming fear yeah a great ...\nThank you yeah it's a it's a really important topic and I've I've really taught on this topic for years of business to teach because it's the number one barrier to why women don't go for it why they don't taste their dream or use their talents or start a business or a you know try something new it's really fear that hold them back and see if I can help them\nGet to the fear and through the fear that can give them all the help in business that they need but when we started dreaming up smart conference tunnel nice balance for years\nAnd then okay let's keep it fresh let's do something new and are jailing Jamie ... you know my leader and myself we're talking how can we apply this\nContent that audience and really we realized that so easy because everyone deals with fear whether it's in your marriage or or in your relationships your career and so I worked hard to take that talk and adapted for this audience ... ... I was really happening without turned out\nWas really really strong ringing awful stuff and so much of it I mean I I've been uh I just was editing a blog up the commercial where Ike a couple of commercials ... by the content people on a blog article I'd written them a few weeks ago before I even heard her talk and they had you know the element of overcoming fear because I think there's so much\nWe talk about transforming around here a lot of transformation transfer forming and getting yourself out of debt transforming your marriage outlets parrot talks about that ritual and less with marriage and money a van or a you know Anthony with transforming\nKind of perfect for your furniture building business okay right [laughter]\nThat's awesome first of all I Love how you introduce yourself he said I'm a young entrepreneur and right there that mindset\nIs already going to set you up for success you already see yourself in this space that just screams confidence and I love that I Will tell you one of the great things a million I see a lot is you don't have to wait until you graduate from college to start working on this this is something that you could have a side business\nAnd start while you're in college to help you not only pay your bills\nBut then you're building up demand building up your brand by the time you graduate this could be your full time job in fact um I worked with a guy that did that he started his little T shirt business Dave in college little T shirt business that was a multimillion dollar business before he ever graduated now and that was his full time thing so I mean you can do this I just want to encourage you\nThe idea that it's difficult to get in this space because you're a girl I think is more in your head than in reality if you build great pieces people want to buy him if you solve problems for people if you\nHad a great product and you take care of the market place they don't really care if it was you or do some old someone young they just love the furniture\nI I'm I'm an older that doesn't buy furniture but my wife would do a decorator and how can just tell you either my wife or I were we buy a piece of custom made furniture made by a lady that would actually be a brand advantage because we would think that was pretty cool\nYeah that you had that you have a good eye for it that there's yeah that's I think a million that you this does it have to be a barrier for you if it gets that had been I just you just get started because you're going to get the most confidence when you saw that first piece even if it's small piece even if you sell it to your aunt I don't care\nJust get started dip your toe in the water Amelia will make sure that Kelly sends you my book and you can follow that plan it's a step by step plan to grow this business\nAnd start small start on the sly side and you'll see your confidence growing up promised you a ... that will be a non issue it won't even be a fear in your head anymore because like Dave said you'll start to see it as an advantage that you offer the marketplace through your business that excited for you the fact that you're even asking this question and making that phone call grow you got big things ahead for you I'm so excited for you\nSo let me tell you what happened to me a million when I went broke and I wrote a book about how to handle money I'm a broke a show on a book about money\nThat's kind of a disadvantage in terms of who\nWould want to read them money book from a guy that went broke that is what I used to think and after seven Fifteen million bucks a kind of figured out everybody wants to buy among the book from a guy who went broke and learned his lesson\nAnd so it actually turned into my what I thought was my disadvantage what my my insecurity that felt like a disadvantage\nEnded up actually being my brand differentiate or\nBecause I Know how people feel I've been there done that I got the T shirt you've got a brand advantages you've got the female touch on the furniture\nUm ... and you're going to put a a different kind of look different kind of feel to it\nAnd uh and it makes you different you're not just another group making furniture it's really cool you know ... it makes you stand out I just love it I think you need to get some really cool pictures\nWith you with your power tools and yet you don't get in there with the ... or whatever and safety glasses on and that's your business card\nI I think it's an advantage I think it's a ... the opposite of a disadvantage but when I started\nMy in security\nI thought was a brand disadvantage has turned into one of my biggest brand advantages because it might be different and you need to identify that when you're doing a business right\nIt's interesting to we just had entree leadership master series last week and I was on a panel with Suzanne stand in the ... and ... and a very common theme we heard a in the audience asking questions is how do I don't think the women women leaders women leader now you know how do I succeed as a woman in a man's industry\nAnd there are certainly some industries where you need to be aware of what you're going into but the reality is so often\nIt is bigger in our head than it is a reality it's to your point if the thing we think is holding us back when that's the thing that's going to set us apart and make people want to buy from us and so I I Love the whole perspective Amelia uh that that you already see yourself as an entrepreneur now you just need to see yourself as a successful business owner and start to take that step\nWell I mean I think about somebody like um you know where Condi Rice because we ... and I got to spend time with her obviously female obviously African American\nObviously super brilliant oh you got smarter to ... oh yeah with a woman so unbelievably smart [noise] but um I mean a\n... successful I mean ... state right the United states of America I mean you know this is no small job here yeah ... and\nBut what ended up happening with her what what we we were asking her about the same thing the barriers you know the racial barrier the sexism racism all this kind of stuff and she used the line from her neighborhood\nShe should growing up in a segregated neighborhoods in Birmingham, Alabama that her mom I told her it doesn't matter where you're coming from it matters where you're going Mm that's good ... and ... other people with their prejudice beside\nMy fate yep I decide my ... and it was like coming out it was just very calm but yet heard loud and clear confidence when there but again it comes back to that that um you know you're going to I'm going to own this space and I'm going to turn what you think is a\nDisadvantage that race sex whatever it is you know into an advantage because it's a brand difference raider\nOh I Love how you've been talked about you and sharing buying furniture if you look at most American household the women make the purchasing designing decorating decisions\nOr what I think of a a woman that makes plans she's known in the spaces are creating furniture and plans and all white and I buy her plant like bunk bed plans or a fork in the backyard plans\nAnd I love hers more because she has that female touch via email design so far at least you think should be done in my mind I got you got you connected we're best friends you know she gets me so uh I really will will draw those people based on that she didn't even realize that\nYou know that's that's very very important I think this is a good information the book is business boutique it is a number one buzz shower and you can see why Christie ride is with us the founder of that you hear her speak all over America\nAnd teach and you'll see her own media you'll see her a business ... dot com and those of you that are members of the uh business boutique academy regularly get coaching from her uh and of course now the crusty right business podcast yes very well right\nIs it is taken off and it's amazing how when you can encourage people and inspire them and teach them while they're living their lives so like listeners writing on the radio show they may be driving in the car on a commute they may be going for a run or they may be cooking or cleaning or something around the house that you're able to encourage them and give them\nI Would just dictate whether I keep that house but it wouldn't dictate whether Russia which the baby steps\nRight and is there an unconventional thinking that maybe we haven't thought of as far as the house I Know where we didn't do ... um [noise]\nOh you call it a a a harp alone you know several years ago to help us out with a uh [noise]\nYou know I'm blown rate decrease that was good good but um you know we've got we're still twenty four into it I Can't see paying money to go to a Fifteen even at this point it would cost money to save money it seems like it would just be well\nI Would go for it out for you to pay extra on the house after you've gotten college for sixteen year olds lined up that's what I'm saying right and so you're paying minimum payments on the house right now until we get this college thing\nNow if you don't me had a one year old and a three year old I Would say well let's just start something for kids college fifty hundred bucks a month or something so we know we kind of exercising their college muscle\nAnd then we'll reach over knock the house out you know uh but but in your situation what your household income\nRate at a hundred ... a little bit of bunker that's good okay and you go to something on the house still no we're one Seventy seven oh good okay show and the the the kids are what age sixteen and\nNo they are uh a fourteen and Thirteen\nFourteen Thirteen or ... sixty might okay uh well so you got for years and five years before they go to school\nIf you watch what you're doing and they choose in the state schools you probably could get that funded by the time they get there and then you're done\nAnd then after that there was the last five years you just whatever's left on the mortgage we reach over to start beating on it Yes sir and of course during that time typically your income is going to go up\nThat's what we were for everyday right there when we typically incomes over time go up unless you know plus or minus\nSituations you know but but typically that's what you're faced with so you're you're heading in the right way you do this stuff right I'm just gonna move that college thing up because you got teenagers and I'm just there's not move it up I'm On a loaded up before I Move on past five maybe steps off shady is in Olympia, Washington high shady how are you\n[noise] how are you better than others are what's up\nI'm really we're listener and probably maybe ... maybe ... and ... I moved here so I got in the winter I might add that we had been I our our back porch and we have about ... million dollar that we're having the route that\nAmazing when you put on all their baby steps that you've done all the baby steps him okay great\nWell I'm a I'm a forty and I'm thirty six or we can have a two year old ... year old at high ground and and\nAs we are\nWe going to be an okay and it it ... ... ... ... if not operate right now we're\nWe're gearing toward operating that was kind of are making it came back and make it grow and when we got her and I wasn't the kind of get your take on ... and then we we have a bearing on right now here in town where we now\nAs they were very\n... should you should be living off of investment income\nIf you've got two million dollar networks don't you have some income\nWell\nAt the growing ... we go we go to how can we come back to me that when we set aside for ... years okay and I think kind of\nHard to argue with you but\nI Would hope if you have a two million dollar network that if you were making ten percent on that you'd be making two hundred thousand dollars a year on your on your investments\nUm or at least a hundred thousand dollars a year I mean surely your investments we're making your something anyway my take on franchises doesn't really matter much because you've already done one but here's what I Would tell you you're going to find it to be a love hate\nRelationship most franchisees do and most French ... love is they teach you how to do something that gives you some marketing ends from brand awareness that you might not have had\nIn the marketplace and the processes to show\nWhat to do business is all very valuable\nBut most of the time was why you may want which is I\nUsually only Rochelle you stand\nFor a while you start losing you deserve by yourself\nTo\n\n\nGet a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped\nYou can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just getting rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nLegally in forever is with timeshare exit team they have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've accepted thousands\nOf timeshare owners this year alone they're the best in the business because they simply a more options for exits than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and timeshare extra teams so confident in their acts of service that if they don't get you out you get a full refund called eight for for nine nine nine ... and schedule a free consultation eight for for nine nine nine or ... or timeshare ... team dot com\nChristian having affordable incredible way to meet their overwhelming healthcare costs it's Christian healthcare ministry the original health cost sharing ministry I better Business Bureau credited organization the eight ten members share in each other's medical\nInsurance Christian financially and spiritually supporting each other it's like the tennis stand for over thirty five years learned more at the apes ministries dot org than the apes ministry dot org Christian healthcare ministries ... months or as Dave Ramsey live events\nJessica on Twitter asks if certifications or trade schools are a good alternative to college well Jessica they absolutely are but even better is getting career focused training from my friends at career step career step all first training to quickly prepare\nYou for a career in healthcare that will get you a job you may even get to work from home and get this career stay up helps with job placement for a special offer visit career step dot com slash Dave\nRamsey solutions sunny from\nSan Diego California drop\nI ...
