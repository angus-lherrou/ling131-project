Bush didn't care about black people because of the way he handled Hurricane Katrina now the left hates him because he is embracing the president and saying to black people\nAnd after Wednesday's landfall hurricane Michael which world up into a category ... storm in what seemed like a really short amount of time one minute tropical depression boom next minute a name storm and a major landfall\nWhen it hit on Wednesday in the pan handle some communities like Mexico beach gone I mean not a little bit ... gone completely gone gone yeah [noise] uh and we have a full schedule of things to talk about with you today as\nWe move forward there are gas lines forming their evacuation still in place FEMA says it's too dangerous to even get back in to do any what I'll call rescue and recovery\nThey've finding people still alive in the shell of a home they're finding people alive still the death toll that latest report is Thirteen lots of facts lots of data lots of restoration is the other our word that we're talking about rescue we're talking about recovery but we're also talking about restoration and let's start right off\nWith a spokesperson for Duke Energy ah and we welcome andme McGovern to live in local thanks for being with us a news radio Ninety three point one\nAbsolutely thank you for having me\nA we talk a couple of weeks back after the last storm went through I guess it was Florence and the Carolinas and then give this world up into our pan handle problem described how many customers do cash and what the status as as far as restoration\nShores so we've got about twenty six thousand Duke Energy customers who are currently without power but of course as I'm sure a lot of your listeners know that really doesn't tell the full story because some of those\nCustomers are and really the hardest hit areas are from hurricane Michael so you know we're looking at heavily damaged areas a lot of places as you mentioned that are still hard to reach though and that seemed like a big number but you know our hearts really go out to those customers 'cause those communities have really been devastated\nYou share power service with Gulf Power right you're not just the only provider in that community or in those communities along the panhandle is that correct\nThat's right and one of our big challenges is not only to restore power for our customers but we're also working with the collapse of the ... are the other utilities like Gulf Power and southern company to coordinate restoration and make sure they can you know we're swear power for their customers is well\nLast report in the whole region a I heard there were at one time a million people without power and you're saying now you're down to only twenty six I say only it's oh it's only only if you've got the lights on but twenty six thousand for for Duke Energy customers is that where we stand now\nThat's correct and and again most of those folks are concentrated you know in the air that pan handle you know especially bag Gulf counties you know that that area that's been really hard hit\nWhat is it that you need to do next I Know the governor has\nA is giving utility company some extra help to restore power more quickly I guess um he's sending 'em some what he's I think I probably heard the description of it's called a push through which is basically a head of the utility workers because you can't even get in there\nIf you have debris blocking the road if you have power lines down and you have trees down you can't as Duke Energy you can't even get in there to put the power line back in place or the grid if you've got stuff and debris all over the place how does that work\nRight right so the first\nStep and storm restoration is really assessment and while we would like to be able to do some of that on the ground um as you mentioned a lot of areas that's not possible so we actually are using drones and helicopters to do aerial surveillance to just try to get a handle on the damage and sort of how\nWe might begin to restore power so that assessment phase is really the\nFirst thing that we are still working on and a lot of that's hard hit areas\nAh when we had other storms in other parts of the south where Duke Energy serves a lot of customers millions and millions of people we had a cruise from all across the state should driving up to the Carolinas if that's where we were talking about or whatever are there other cruise helping us now that we have a problem\nSo we do have cruised from other areas and the Carolinas because I area was a it was you know affected over a large geographic area or um but in Florida since the outages are more concentrated we certainly have\nYou know a lot of cruise in the area I definitely you know all of their resources that we need 'em but at some point actually can have too many crews and an area um just because there's only so many people that can be working on a particular line or a certain part of the credit at a time um but we definitely have you know\nUm have as many people as we need out there you know working as quickly and safely as possible to describe\nOne more time we have a limited amount of time here but if you could briefly describe how the priorities for restoring the power you do it to the main areas first the first responders of course get it back first and then how does it sort of filter down to everybody in rank and file customers of Duke Energy\nRight so after you know we do focus on critical infrastructure and then after that you know really we start with the big transmission systems are transmission towers sort of work our way down the distribution lines until we got to individual customers\nUnfortunately and a lot of areas um that were hit really hard during Florida you know in Florida um we're gonna have to significantly rebuild a part of the system so it's not just a matter of reconnecting lines it's a matter of rebuilding towers and polls substations a lot of that big infrastructure so that could take some time\nThis was a major catastrophe for the state of Florida and we're glad you're on the case this is an McGovern from Duke Energy joining us alive and local and thanks for being with us thank you for having\nMe All right thank you uh that was in the governor and she was with us during Florence and now again during hurricane Michael\nA which was one of those storms were and I heard somebody described this today they said when it's you know that and one is coming to you you make a different plan then if you knew that uh for was coming so at one you think all hunker down but all of a sudden it's a four and maybe I'm not so prepared after all the time to do right now we have to evacuate and use it too late\nDo people wait until the world's up into something\nThat then they can't get out of the way we're gonna continue to talk to people out in the field where we have all these people lined up for you today on live and local but there's lots of news going on that other than storm recovery and storm restoration as well a woman left her child in a hot car again Orlando police has a brand new chief of police\nA dip because John Mina that currency is retiring to run for Orange County sheriff lots of things going on locally and across the state of live and local news radio Ninety three point one\nOne thousand dollars\nNationwide gee word when you'll get a text confirming injury plus I heard radio in\nThe data and read the book when two hundred and two hundred\nDollars for all the answers on radio news radio not every one\nBarrier they live and local\nUh my name is Moira pigment and I are here with you and we'd like to open up the phones if you have something to say we're talking about of course rescue recovery and restoration\nIf you've made contact with somebody in the pan handle some of your can live up there we would I have an aunt and uncle who who live there and I have been texting them now they can get taxed and they can always get taxed out\nThey can get power restored and then I have Tallahassee family\nWho said oh we're up on a hill we're we're golden we have a generator ... and now I find out just moments ago on my my phone that they had so many trees down that they are now screwed and they have no power\nSo the people who were on the beach in Destin\nSeem to be All right the people in Tallahassee who thought they escaped the bullet dodged it they are now with power down in uh relying on a generator\nFor service if you talk to people that you have a a little bit of insight into what's going on as far as the restore recovery restoration a rescue a here's the number to dial for oh seven nine one six fifty four hundred or out of the area toll free eight six six nine one six fifty four hundred\nCounty Florida and new and so there's no infrastructure there to support you um and quite honestly it's a dangerous area to go back into a you know when you have this type of destruction there's gas lines that are there there's power lines that are down\nRescue operations continue Florida task force for a member literally couldn't sell us as this is a different situation than Hurricane Harvey where he helped last year\nThis was a big storm storage and wind driven a lot of a lot of destruction from the beach side locked in a\nLast year in taxes Beaumont, Texas was all flaws\nMore than forty eight hours after Michael made landfall consent us as they are still conducting initial rescues he says his team came in contact with two individuals who were trapped inside their home in Mexico beach\nThey did not suffer from any life threatening injuries but they were transported to a local hospital most of Mexico beach has seen massive structural damage
