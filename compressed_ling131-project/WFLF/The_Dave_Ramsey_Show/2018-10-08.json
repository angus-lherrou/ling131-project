paid off thirty one thousand seven hundred dollars some bright love it\nAnd how long did this take it took three years almost to the days since I started the financial ... very good and you arrange your income during that time about forty seven thousand two fifty thousand ... what do you do 'em by day I'm tech support at travel and expense software\nAnd by nights and weekends I work in the film industry mostly doing onset audio a button or other things to find good for you very cool what kind of ... was the thirty two thousand it was mostly student loans but then also a a car loan and the car repaired alone to\nGotcha okay so you a single guy making forty seven thousand payoff thirty two thousand and three years which is a you know basically a thousand bucks a month give or take during that time average and that's the that's really watching what you're doing your roster casual and the whole thing\nYes it was it was a very tight ... when I was a at least at the beginning stages I figured it out that um if if I budgeted everything out and all of just the basic bills in food and gas I had about forty dollars left over for months while do it was it was tied\nUp some extra jobs not help but you're over ... got a little bit out of film but some doesn't pay too much [laughter] okay good deal good deal so three years ago you said you started financial ... personal journey began and other than that I'm\nKind of a story well first of all my sister who's here um I did uh did your program and did or debt free scream and that's where I first heard about you and I was and so I learned some of it by us most is kind of but I also we're like oh that's good enough I got it um which wasn't smart or [laughter]\nUm so then it was in twenty four teen which is when I moved sixty miles away from home just you know getting by myself doing apartment a signed a lease everything figured out everything was good and\nI had to move on the seventh of August and the third of August my car broke down completely engine died everything is done wow and so I'm like I Need to move I Need to move now I have no way to get there in a way to get my job when I get there don't know anybody up there\nUm so I was just ran out and bought a car and I end up to that point I had been\nSmart in only buying a cash or using cash for cars but at this point I was like\nEvery girl I get breaks down in a year I'm tired of holding like Paul ... and I like I was just like that kind of looks nice I'm going to get that one [laughter] I paid too much for it I'm pretty sure and um and so\nBut of course I'd already signed a lease so that was something I hadn't taken into account right and so moved up there and about four months later my that car the engine fry broke down the exact reason that I bought a new car is what happened\nAnd so it took out a car repair alone and um because I was like oh this guy just got a four months ago I'm going to keep it\nAnd um so yeah so replaces the engine at that point in time it was like there was I was over drafting it was it was it was bad and um and because I wasn't budgeting and um I think I don't know if it was for moving gift or produce or um\nOr for a Christmas gift corny gave me a uh the box for financial peace but I was still stubborn I'm so like I put it on my dresser and I'm like I\nI'll probably do that I'll probably go to sleep in the same room with the box it'll be okay I just want to actually learn it you know by his most has\nAnd um it it didn't I didn't [laughter] so um I was still over drafting and actually it was I Believe it was April twenty Fifteen when she came up just to stay over my parmesan she could fly out of Minneapolis to do or debt free scream\nAnd I'm like she knows my situation\nAnd she ... she will see that on open box as you will give me a lot of crap because she knows and I can't have that that's a good sister rules are exactly [laughter] so I'm like before she gets here I'm signing up for a class and that was the motivating factor so I finally got it so I asked her fault [laughter] for a whole new\nWay to do her debt free scream you get shamed in the process that causes you to be here to there your debt\nZach Zach I'll take it that work such good family stuff right there and I should say it ends up being a pretty good book into because I went out of 'em\nHow old are you at all I'm twenty four of them now how long you been married five years you all had this discussion about the way your feeling about this track yes absolutely what he's trying to\nLose any we uh we just need to pray about it and figure\nOut what what's the most wise decision\nWhich I how much on track for [noise] twenty seven five will not pay off everything I'm\nNot quite but we do have a five hundred and savings or we could take a I think maybe the area of that and be done with everything\nEverything but the house yeah OK yeah good and then begin your emergency fund sure who passed away\nMy grandfather okay All right well there's a couple of gauges we want to do a number one we want to be biblical wise which is what she was saying and pray about this and the number two we want to do something where there's money that your grandfather would be sitting in heaven and so you're doing this and smile oddly enough these are actually the exact same things\nUm because when you start doing more things with money that's going to be honoring to his memory in other words right there and show paying off the debt would not make him mad as long as you had a process to never go back in\nAnd that's what\nYou a little bit so what I Want you guys to do is I Want you to go back through financial peace university and I want you to heart this money in a side savings account that\nIs not attached in any way to an ATM card a debit card or your checking account where you can't do it without a better for the bank\nOr you have to physically go down there and make it hard to get to and parking there for nine weeks until you go through the classes to gather you've got the one year membership I'm going to pay for it for you to go to financial position where she okay and natural bees university is a one year membership you've got nine lessons in nine weeks\nYou've seen some of them some of them have been redrawn since you saw them\nAnd you go through those then when you get done with that I think you'll know what to do and you take that money and worked the baby steps\nBut uh the problem is as you said the get out of jail free card if you don't change your behaviors and have something more than just a promise to yourself you're going to straighten up then you could really cause a problem later um and so what you want to do is proved to yourself during this nine weeks that you have changed your behaviors\nAnd when you all are looking at each other going okay we're really doing this\nWe're not screwing around were not goofing off we're not going to issue\nWe're really going to do it no itching Dave Amish financial ... ish wise ... we're not going to ... and so that'll get you into a mess I and so you know I Would if I knew I Want to prove to myself that I'm not going to do this up\nAnd that's what I'm telling you to do\nA is so go to the non classes in nine weeks\nAnd then stay you can watch the videos and you can go on keep going you go the legacy journey class online or you can you can get into groups on line and stay you know should continue the discussion with the tribe and talking about it you got every dollar plus connecting to your bank on line and that's there with you for a year I'm giving you every bit of that\nUm we sell all that for a hundred and twenty nine dollars just about five hundred dollars worth of stuff though\nAnd it's a really really really incredible value and it's all a church and we want you to take care of it all we ask is is that you follow the stuff both of you plug into this and\nSome day when you're doing really good find a guy who um feels like a product and you help him out and that's why I'll ask you to do things for the call Megan is in Chicago Hi Megan welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I Am a newer and listener forgive me for my ignorance I Am on baby step to we have our um housing our savings that are currently working on our we have about thirty four thousand dollar\nA minute and quick our cars we do not have a mortgage we currently rank now my question is um we're going to have paid off within the next two years maybe even a year right\nNow we have a plan that we wanted to take our children into an RV for about two years and travel the country\nUm however we would have to finance ticket Harvey and something to tell us when we feel like kind of have to ask them to her kids are getting older\nI'm terribly would not like to wait if possible but I just want to see what your advice for America to be\nA sneak dream I live in the dream cool very cool well I'm not going to I don't tell people to borrow money because every time I find people borrowing money off on broke people\nRight and um and if you borrow on something that goes down in value as fast as an RV does I'm going to find really broke people\nHave you ever tried to sell used RV and now they're people most jak possible to get rid of them are they're hard to get financing on and they go down in value faster than almost anything what wheels and motorists they are mathematically horrendous\nA just a mess and so um the other the other one is a big a medium sized boat if you get a hundred million dollar boat you can get financing on it and if you get a cheap ... you can get financing on it but\nThe middle range of boats the fifty two hundred and fifty thousand is a difficult product and a show you just about have to have the money to just consume it and be able to afford it so what I Would tell you what's your household income\nAnd into the thousand\nOkay I Would get myself out of debt I'd worked extra jobs and then I Would save up and pay cash for an RV that would um\nThat was her five for the two year period of time and then if you sell it at someone of a lost at least you got you know what I mean dead on it and you don't get caught in it it's not a problem it doesn't ruin your life going forward because if you take a wonderful dream like you have an EU finance it you're going to turn it into a nightmare\nRight it's going to cause a problem for your family 'cause I mean you put a hundred grand and an RV by the time you get home is worth fifty\nRight and you're going to be stuck in a wing all that money and you know you're going to mess up your kid's college plan you're going to mess up your retirement I mean it it could be disastrous if you do this wrong and so what I Do save up and buy one or look for a program where you can rent one for two years if we can do that for two years and just turn it back in\nA doubt there is one they're probably very very expensive I Know you can rent them short term for the weekend and those aren't bad deals but a two year plan is a different\nUm and when you add all of this up it might be\nThat you guys could stay in your you could travel in your car um or your SUV or whatever it is you own and stay in hotels cheaper by the time you add it all up\nBecause you're going to lose so much money on this transaction and again I'm not trying to ruin your dream I just don't want you going to be a nightmare so do it with no debt you do it used to\nAnd um and do some mathematical analysis on it and you got some nights to do that while you're working to get your other debts paid off right now\nAnd then if you want to say about fifty grand and buy a three year old or a two year old hundred grand thing or something and and then it becomes more twenty five by the time you get home I'm mad at you for that that doesn't ruin your life\nBut if you if you just go ride a check and finance something you're going to be in a mess kiddo and I don't want that for you I Want you to win a thanks for the call\nWas fourteen almost Fifteen million of
