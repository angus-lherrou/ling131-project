not good for you and your range of income during that time\nI think the ... a thousand cool what he'll do for a living\nI Am a middle school teacher and deliver medical equipment cool\nAnd what kind of that was a thirty five thousand\nStudent loan\nAll of it yes you kicked all ugly Sallie Mae out on who I Love the kicker another car\n[laughter] she's gone well done well done so what happened twelve months ago they put you guys on his journey\nWell day that goes a little bit farther back then that emptied out of an eight hour we went through the financial ... and we actually had about eighty thousand dollars and that at that time and we never added to the debt and then we never really got intense like getting rid of it\nSo young I laughed and sorry you took the clash ten years ago and formed it\nWe didn't know okay we ... we had an ... and we paid off very maintaining very eye out and\nShe knew what to do but you're just reached a point you got okay we got to knock this out now\nExactly\nSure what what caused that final conversation twelve months ago\nWe were making too much to be in a situation that we are in\nOkay show whose idea was the issue who said we're going to turn up the heat you are to\nMine [laughter]\nOkay so temp she walks in and goes hey whereabouts all of a sudden get serious what'd you say\nA ... and like a great idea to do and I think it just kinda clicked to that point I think just want to be able to bring it up and she brought it up and went at it\nCool what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is\nA thing you do get a thing commitments focusing on the go and have a commitment to do whatever it takes to get rid of that\nGood for you gosh well dawn how they feel\nVery\nFinely there don't you wish you'd done at five years ago\nLike Zach Lee that the hardest part of the whole thing is that we could have done it for a long time ago\nAmazing amazing oh very cool good for ya\nWell done we got a copy of course ... book for you retire inspired that's the next chapter in your story to be millionaires and are outrageously generous as you go alone or well done you two very proud of you to him and Daphne Joplin, Missouri thirty five thousand dollars paid off in twelve\nMonths making sixty or Seventy do counted down with zero debt free scream\nVery why\n\nWell done\nAnd that is absolutely fabulous [noise]\nNo what do we think mutual funds are going to do in the future well we don't know the only reasonable way to forecast investment returns\nUm is to say what they have done in the past over a long period of time is likely to be what they will do in the future over a long period of time plus or minus wonderful and tragic events\nOK okay which we can't predict those so the economy booms in other words you can't predict that exactly\nIf the economy tanks you can't predict that exactly if somebody fires a missile at us and it changes the economy you can't predict somebody's last a couple of airplanes into a couple of towers you can't predict that but it will affect the economy so\nWhat we have to just give our best shot on that but the whole thing you've hurt you know a past our results are not indicative of future returns horse crap orange they are\nOtherwise you would buy and they buy a house in a ... crummy neighborhoods instead of a good neighborhood\nRight yeah and so what we have here is what's known as a crummy neighborhood [laughter] gold\nAs as not got a good track record long term as a matter of fact it sucks as an investment over a long period of time\nAnd so what's this gold and silver worth today if you catch it all in around a hundred thousand so if we call a hundred thousand dollars in the military but would you buy gold and silver coins with it no no [laughter] okay so the same reason that you wouldn't buy them again you would sell them today\nNow let's decide what we're going to be a hundred thousand oh you'd like to pay down the mortgage sure I'll go with that\nBut they're ... they're separate decisions do you see what I'm saying\n[noise] kind of and to me that confusion as Matt I don't need the gold and silver like licking just plod along paying our mortgage and they'd gotten three and a half years\nNo no no no no it's not about the more it's not about to ask one more time on a hundred thousand dollars cash hundred dollar bills laying in the middle of your kitchen table uh-huh are you going to buy gold with it I don't need that money but are we going to buy gold with it you know\nIf you keep this by tomorrow it's like you bought it again do you understand that mathematically yeah making the decision to keep it as the same as making the decision to buy it\nI mean how other people that when it comes to things like I'm OK borrowing come that far away can pay to pay off a mortgage if I had no other implication like sitting there okay\nDoes that mean implication forget the mortgage mortgage tent pretend like we were going to go to Disneyland but the money All right I don't care what we're doing the money the point is the way you properly analyze whether to keep the goal\nIs to say I have a hundred thousand dollar sitting in the middle of the table would I buy gold with it\n[laughter] [laughter]\nAnd if you keep it tomorrow you bought it again and if you keep it the next day you bought it again\nEvery game keep something it's as if you made the decision to purchase it again for its current market value\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that as long as you don't mind buying it so let me give you an example if you if you and I both thought or if you thought gold was going to double in the next year and you had evidence to make you actually believe that\nWe're going to turn a hundred thousand and the two hundred thousand and one year and you all and you and I both believe that are just you believe that and we had a hundred thousand dollars cash sitting in the middle of the table and I said would you buy gold on crappy ass 'cause I can turn a hundred and the two hundred right\nBut we're making the decision then not based on what we paid for it we're making the decision based on what we think it's going to do in the future\nOkay the decision to buy or sell or hold\nTheirs is based on the future not the past [noise]\nOther than we used the past to project our future but then when we do that with gold it tells us to sell yeah ... sell it take your last take your lumps you might have dumb investment you lost a bunch of money that stupid tax now you've got a pile of money in the middle of say well what do you wanna do with that money well modeled path mortgage what the heck\nOkay different stations are two different decisions are two different buckets\nTo do ... proper critical thinking on this Jonah is in Dallas texas Hi Joan how're you\nHey there how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm a college student uh I have about ... between eight and ten thousand dollars a year is coming in that I don't have anything to pay for with parliament bang for everyone um if a merit scholarship so that I get a bunch of extra money\nOkay good for you very cool man for a merit based based on what your your\nGrades or your citizenship or what\nUm my national man had a I'm a national merit scholar OK and can you do anything to mess that up [noise]\nUm I can but pretty it'd be very high\nWhat's the or could you do that would mess it up if my GPA drops oh well All right well that that that's not that hard that's fairly easy okay yeah you can drop a GPA pretty easy\nOkay so what would I Do if I were in your shoes I Would call up that money in a savings account as an insurance policy to ensure that I finished school with no debt you are your best investment no I Would not invest this money\nOkay\nAnd um because you're you're the best investment mathematically what are you studying wrecked\nEconomic\nDo your great investment you're going to do really well and and you're right you got all these great bass scholarships so you're you're a smart guy so yeah I I don't need what the ... I don't need you to have the money that the eight thousand dollars would make you\nDuring the next two or three years I Do need you to graduate\nWith these honors and there's a wonderful degree field and pay cash for with no debt\nThat is very very very important and that's exactly what I Would do in your situation thank you for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five
