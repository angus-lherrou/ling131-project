conversation earlier with a doctor who\nSaid as you're talking about irritable bowel syndrome and uh how it seems to be more prevalent and women and then she suggested the reason for being more prevalent and women is that women go to their doctor more often than men do\nTo seek out answers to questions do you find that to be the case in your practice or lay cardiology down in Florida and more women come to you with a hard questions or problems and a correction and men\nWell in general women a little bit more than men tend to go to the doctor and often a reason why some married or a couple of men do better is because a good woman behind them get them to the doctor but I see pretty close I say probably\nSixty forty women but I you know I I see a see pretty close even\nIf it is I Do think that's because of your specialty more people are ... cancer that sort of that old you know I Know you have cancer but you know you know getting kind of it's not as easy to recognize cancer

look at it as something that we can be overcome\nBut is there in your experience or what you're reading and some of the journal is is there a long term impact of you know kind of following up on we're just said about processed meats I'm eating this stuff getting attacked by these bacteria\nCan it have a long term almost fatal impact on you if you have enough of it or if you don't really get it all out of your system\nWell those who have\nIllness their immune systems are not working up to par [noise] in a very young these illnesses can be a life threatening but most of us in middle age who have good immune systems we get sick but we get better\nYeah but this instance here brings about a focus on kidney failure apparently the symptoms the diarrhea and they are to above syndrome which seems to

institution manage your money and they're competing for the same way that you and are competing for there's a divergence of interest right there but what happens is some Wall Street firms now going to

this is about you learning to manage your own money you learn how to self direct you will and if you learn the skills it allows you to make better returns\nFor less cost think of that and that's what we're really hear about and that's why if we don't tell you this no money managers going to tell you that you should put your money and self directed they've got to tell you put it on a management with me with us of course they are because they have a vested interest in your participation\nBe careful folks you can learn the skills of self directing is not a complicated process you have to go through a learning curve but it's available and what I Love about our sponsor\nThey teach people how to do it more poorly learnt at somewhere learn how to self directed make better decisions yourself

doesn't go up dramatically enough the fees that they're charging you take up the profitability that you do get so we've got a plan in place where you can make money regardless of direction more

that just is hysterical I mean we've this one of the fun of the hours now is that I Am every ... just sitting here I got it so it is one of the best parts of the week she\nWas having a good time but you know what one of the things that we need to talk about is there are individuals out there that are trying to figure out how to generate additional monthly income there are people out there that aren't financially where they want to be I mean husbands wives all the time they're like man if I could just make another five hundred thousand bucks a month\nThings would be so much better for me let's take a moment let's talk about how someone can utilize the market really and talked about trading for income how someone can do them\nWell most people being seen ... traveled the world I've been all over the planet\nTalking about trading and investing and what's universal is that people want to make income they want to generate additional income and the markets are a great way to do that and the problem is is that a lot of people when they hear the word trader they check out they think Wolf of Wall Street the movie Wall Street greed is good some guy in suspenders\nSitting on Wall street overlook in Manhattan\nAnd that couldn't be further from the true some of the most successful traders that I Know people for income that generate an income and the markets on a daily weekly basis\nOr people just like us that you blue collar white collar stay at home moms I mean pizza delivery people barbers I mean scientists we have a lot of surgeons that have had success in the markets so what's important is that it's a skill set that you learn over time but once you learn a skill set think of the benefits there's about forty million\nTrading accounts in the United states you know eat trade Schwab GD marriage rates got trade\nAnd most of those traders based on our knowledge are not successful they love the sexiness of the opportunity\nBeing able to sit at their home and speculate on price change in a marketplace they loved that but if they don't have a good system in place are good set of rules\nThey normally aren't successful and those are the stories you hear so people think the market's a casino and it's not if you understand\nHow to play the game it gives you a unique advantage and the problem is is that many people have this preconceived notion that the markets are nothing more than throwing your money and hope it works\nAnd it couldn't be further from the truth there's ways to generate high probability low risk decisions and if you do that consistently it could turn into a compound and growth curve I seen it personally I've seen people that have come through the process and learn the skills and transform their life with trading and they had no knowledge coming in they didn't understand the first day and even what's the difference would have stock and bond\nAnd yet they learn the skill and what's great about that is it opens the door for people instead of having to get a second job to punch a clock somewhere go wait on tables not that there's anything wrong with doing that I've done all that\nBut what's important is if you could generate that income from your home you know in in your spare time that's the opportunity and many people don't get it because they have this preconceived idea what a trade or is\nIt couldn't be further from the truth well and you know what a lot of people think that it requires a lot of time to think it requires this high IQ\nAnd it's just a skill it's like any skill you say it all the time you used to be a framer champ\nNo understanding how to use the proper tools a professional grade broker dealer understand how to actually minimize risk increase probability just a checklist of things that keep you safe in the market and a lot of people think is just so out of reach that they can't do it and it's not I mean I tell people you can drive a stick shift you can learn to be a successful trader because it's nothing more than learning the skill\nAnd repeating it over and over and over again one of the most important things I tell people is trading and investing shouldn't be exciting if it's exciting you're doing it wrong it's just a decision\nAnd when you have the ability to make that decision what's great about that is the doors open anybody I mean I meet people that literally have very low capital I mean they might have a few hundred bucks to work with and they're able to go into the currency mark and start to make money and make\nConsistent money in a decent amount of money futures markets such great opportunities to trade futures and in this country people don't understand how the power over those assets we focus on stock stock stock in this country futures a tremendous assets and sometimes I can use food as a trade stocks\nAnd I can use reaches a trade stock indices like the S. and P. and make a bigger a troubled less capital on the same moving price there's so many opportunities out there and when people start to realize that they can generate an income in the financial markets it's a game changer for them and it has nothing to do with your I.\nQ. or where you went to school what your GPA is I tell everybody you don't have to be smart to be successful in the financial markets you just have to be teachable and this living proof in this studio of that\nExactly champion you know what a lot of people out there that don't realize that this is an opportunity for them there are people out there that are trying to figure out how to make extra money was I mean how many Hoover drivers you meet your they're an executive during the day and they're driving New Britain I there's so many easier ways to generate capital than doing all that stuff and trading for income is one of them are sponsor online training academy\nThey know individuals out there wants to generate additional income they also know that people don't know how to do it\nThat's why they have a class specifically on trading for income from our sponsor online training academy\nThat allows an individual is brand new the market or been in the market for years but if you don't
