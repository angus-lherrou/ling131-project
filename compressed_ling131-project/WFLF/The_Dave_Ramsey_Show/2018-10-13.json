don't know what I mean like you know the Internet and diet weight loss pills and only like you know every sort of thing that's supposed to be urging me grab your attention\nAnd then I feel like a like a little child because we're talking about the Stephen Covey book in every single one of his things that are\nA urgent but not important are all there are so business either so adult there like some

where we can kind of activity do you imagine is not important and not urgent\nYou would think of things that would be like I don't know go sit and stare at a treat but many of those are very alluring

figuring out what to do next give me a call it doesn't matter if you haven't even started yet I Love entrepreneurs love entrepreneurship\nAnd if you missed a if you're not watching us live a courageous radio dot com then you just missed a really exciting segment\nA during the commercial break on Sears and Brad out a lot to to say about it and we we really I think we kind of did a little boardroom battles action actually I Do and that we're trying to fix them so up one of the things that I wanted to talk about uh you know we just came off the c._e._o. cruise a couple of days ago and\nEveryone's different and every single Cruz is a different experience based on who's there and you know there's probably\nTen to Fifteen Percent that are the same ... that come on every one which which I Love and I think it's actually I think entrepreneurs need to have a three day tonight break every sixty to Ninety Days I mean if they're in a I Need a race then I don't want them doing anything in the in that right but\nOnce you kind of hit your stride and every Ninety\nBy George I was not spending that five dollars at that point we the only thing you care about with me is not my life or my business\nAs a customer as a regular customer if you care more about the five bucks that somebody may or may not have charged with your regular place there yes oh wow yeah yeah and so it it it was it was somebody who just does not care about people they care about the process and things like that as opposed to well here's what here's here's the deal ladies and gentlemen if you were in a business\nYou were in a business to solve people's problems\nDo not create more problems for your customers help them solve their problems help overcome their problems don't be the problem\nRight that's right so anyway that's my hot list you're the only one this week but you deserved extra time my ... my my uh are there you're on the hill holiday yeah my my uh hot list is bombers paradise cruise line\nThey scared me to death when they told me four days before that we were going to sweat ships but it was a much better ship they upgraded all of my people to ocean view a rooms and they\nTook great care of us in the crew or is ones that I've been using for awhile and they are phenomenal\nA love working with them and uh you know it it's not an easy thing to host a seminar and see if anyone's ever done it they've never hosted a second one because you're going to lose your shirt it's very difficult it's very hard to get people on there I heard of a a entrepreneur who was hosting a\nRenting a luxury home bringing some great top speakers and a limiting it to like twenty doctors or something to come in at five thousand dollars a piece for three or four days a chef was going to be announced all these things\nAnd uh they had to cancel it ah people don't understand what it takes to host a conference put on a conference and especially for people to get on on a plane\nAnd come to you and take several days out of their schedule\nAnd then to do that over and over and over and over a and it it it it's a lot more work and so whenever things change I I Want them to have an amazing experience I was going to have something that you know words can even summarize and that's what happened\nAnd I still don't even understand all of them still processing I'll be traveling tomorrow and Saturday and so I'm going to really be able to process a little bit about what actually happened all I Know is that it was defined it was anointed\n... their stories and the pictures coming out of the c._e._o. cruise why does it work for you you've done I mean you you you just said most people won't do a second one you've done multiple these you got ready to got another one scheduled yeah why are they working\nWell I it's not because of me you know is because I'm being obedient to what I Believe my calling is my purposes\nAnd I'm ... and that's what's really ironic is I whenever I Choose to speakers and and and most of the attendees are all these things are because of either speaking engagements or because of influence they have on other things and other platforms\nAnd in relationship or there's there are some some new people that you know come in and that will get to know uh but but there's always a core group that is because of relationship sometimes their new relationships uh that that that happened\nSo I don't even know who will be the speakers that's why some people say well who's who's gonna be the speakers ... who who cares who's going to be the speakers\nSpeakers are not why you come on this boat access is why you come on this you should care way more about who the attendees are and who the speakers are and you can go to any business conference in America you could have a town of five hundred people you know the local chamber of commerce has\nOf how to grow your business seminar my goodness go to go there right right right you don't need you don't need me for all of that kind of stuff\nBut if you want access if you want favor if you want the supernatural if you have mountains that you've got to overcome and you want people who are in it for life these are not this is not a networking event you know this is where it's going to go deep\nThese are lifelong friendship I Know because I'm a few years into this now and these are people who have who have gone to battle they have died on a hill for me before they've taken it in the back\nOr they you know taking the ... they will jump in in a line of fire that's the kind of people I wanted to do life with and you can't find those people very easily they don't go to the ... the community networking events they don't show up to swap some business cards they're not business lunches their heads are down there doing at the stuff\nAnd and they're not usually available but they recognize the value of something like this\nAnd that's why they're there so that's what I find with and the and the ship really a ship stuff really does a great job ah with that and they've they've taken care of me they canceled one of the shows so that our group could use the theater which I really appreciate them or they had a a a screw up on Sunday night\nAnd uh they told us the wrong place for dinner ended up having to move our entire\nGroup to a different a dining room and uh after we'd already ordered a author menu you know I'd already ordered you know the nine ounce fillet and all that\nAnd they moved us completely a had a completely different menu and you know what everyone was totally had a sweet spirit wonderful but they ended up moving to only show which they've already canceled one force they moved the other show that was supposed to start a nine to nine forty five so our group\nCould or could it could go ahead and finish\nTheir dinner and not miss the show at all although can you imagine our group walking in um with with eight hundred people who are like been waiting for forty five minutes because because we weren't there you know it was it was still favor everyone was wonderful we had a great time entertainment they never disappointing to give us a phenomenal experience\nBut um you know one of the things to that that Peter low and I uh he's he coached it with me and we launched a uh the travel program that I've shared before on the radio which gives you know Fifteen eighty percent off like hotel rooms and car rentals and\nA resorts stays and things like that around the world\nAnd it was phenomenal is a huge hit and uh there's\nA lot of businesses and entrepreneurs are just starting to use it we had one that purchased\nBack at the beginning of the year from it from a company that we had brought on\nAnd we ended up purchasing the entire travel program after that because it was such a such an incredible thing and we felt like entrepreneurs and especially those with the king the mindset of going forth\nYou know that includes ... that means travel you raise it at home so ah we we felt like it would be a very strategic move and so we really introduced it and launched on this and it was just an incredible time you can learn

did you sell any cars or did you just pay them off no we just pay them off in the car got us into the travel okay very cool but nine months ago some kind of a switch flip cars menu with all after it you went game own hair this is a pretty serious numbers wild on tell me the story what got you started\nSo probably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car needing right um other when you're going out and we decided to baton for ... yeah the emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we wanted and probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we did the brand new\nAnd it was then we're just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills even over to pay it no problem that we just we didn't want to any more um we one we're more excited for the future and that was just going to be in the way for the future so we just we won\nThe ... intensity near term so ...\nSo how did you get into where in this process to connect with us\nSo it I'm a huge following pod cast a lot of time on the road and always listen to and it's like they'd we can do this you know than us and I we're we've got this no problem so we started doing that at the same time it always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church ration center and so we uh\nGot that started right about time we started we got everything in line to start a few in January at our church and we did that and so it was kind of we started it and then as we got a few we were learning for the first time was the mentors and now on her second session and loving it\nSo well thanks for leading the class yeah very cool well there's nothing like leading to make you do it I mean that ... you can attend and may be kinda slough off right but are not hardly it's very difficult to do that but it's almost impossible to lead it and not be game on\nExactly and I think that just kind of stems from what drove me to it because I Believe in modeling all behaviors and if I'm gonna model what I wanted my children have in the future I had the model at my house\nNow my daughter ritual cruise always says that when you're teaching kids Morris caught them taught yes the modeling thing is a big deal they're going to do what you do how many times about open my mouth and one of my parents' voice came out I mean oh my goodness you know it's happened much happened on this show and you're much [laughter]\nSo well done you guys very well done so when you have someone in your class and\nTheir show up for financial peace and they're not game on because they're scared and they don't think they can do this the the whole peasant kicked in yet the belief housing kicked in yet what do you tell them they need to do\nTo be debt free one of the things you need to do if you want to pay off sixty nine thousand dollars and nine months\nWe did we don't do it yeah and\nYou start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell there's kind of a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team that can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as long as to if you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nThe main things that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just flies in the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much [laughter]\nWell that's true but generally true\nBut what happens is all the characters have a carefully crafted lifestyle and something happens that really like poll so wrong well gone to them you know and what they were doing and then they get paranoid and I go into a tailspin\nAnd I can relate this to like road rage I think like from what the guest was saying sometimes people on unfamiliar territory maybe they're not used to getting into a road rage and for them and then when that happens say they become like ... you know and faint almost like the ... got 'em [noise]\nAnd if it was like a more common occurrence\nThey wouldn't be is a more more familiar territory they react maybe more calmly\nRoad rage is unbelievable yeah\nI see it happening all the time it's it's worse here in California than any place I've seen\n[noise] yeah it's pretty bad here in New York but the movie is burn after reading George and I'll give you an apple George Clooney and and the movie as a CIA agent but he never actually shot someone\nAnd he gets into this minor thing what Brad Pitt's character shoots them kills them and then after that like he was just like paranoid like all that anybody find out I did this like\nReally good acting performance but you know it showed you how how we had a set route teenage job do all the time at a certain\nTime of day ... location and just this one incident so disturbed his lifestyle on his routine\nI bet it would not do when did they kill off Brad Pitt no movie earlier or later\nA little bit earlier surprisingly summit why\nDid they do a flashback when he came back in or or that was it for a\nNo no ... and all the words that was it for him that's that's usually they don't do that when ... know them around

William Henry is an investigative mythology just gone through a number of books and DVDs his\nLatest the watchers last secrets simply ... resurrection and perfection William will come back how are you\nA wonderful George thank you so much for having me on the show again to any traveling\nI've been in Connecticut I was in LA uh on Monday doing some new interviews for ancient aliens really excited\nAbout that you should look this up while you were a year\nWhile it was such a fast track and um so I just there overnight and a personal note I had a sick cat who passed\nAway yesterday so it was kind of a really emotionally are very very difficult time he was my beloved buddy he's on his journey now how old was he he was eleven\nNow ... and that's not tools for a cat is\nNo it's not as that I was really hoping to be here a few more years and um\nBut his time was it was time for him to go sadly and I'm gonna miss miss him dearly\nWell he's out there somewhere you know that he's here with us now yup\nAbsolutely tell me about the watchers\nThe watchers incredible story very much very controversial of course there's a broad range of of viewpoints on the watchers ranging from the third demons they're evil they're controlling us people want to know\nThat is their mission\nAnd along the way they brought with them they're ascension teaching state the the ... are very clear that some of the watchers brought in various crafts and technologies with them they clearly taught humankind how to use various tools and and other implements but along the way they also\nAnd this is a big beef that the church has with the watchers they taught the secrets of heaven\nAnd the secrets of heaven are how humans can transform into angels ride the cosmic conduit and dwell in God's throne\nAnd that's the really big question right there George why would any why would the church have a problem with this why does the establishment church have a problem with a group of beings coming to earth and teaching humans to become angels\nYou would think they would walk them that\nYou would think they would welcome at the problem is is that you cut out the church in the scenario you have no need for the pope send the priest and the whole church establishment because in fact the church doesn't teach humans\nCan do it on your own right\nYou can do it on your own and that is the big question can humans\nTake it upon themselves to perfect themselves as the term to become more whole to become more holy to become more complete if you answer no then chase them as demons chase them is giants if you answer yes\nAnd you really you now you're you're getting into the innermost esoteric secrets of the most closely guarded secrets of all human kind the secrets that the day whatever government or new world order type authority you subscribe to these are the secrets they do not want you to know about these are the secrets of the aluminum ... ultimately\nWell you mentioned something to is there any evil and all connected with the watchers\nWill there isn't in perception I mean the the the the scenes were absolutely clear in their writings that there are two currents or forces of the watchers one was represented by the arcane journal Michael who's also sometimes referred to as ...\nWho is who established the priesthood of which she says was a member of the other current or force is led by ... who was referred to later as the anti Christ and they were they were all of the belief that these two forces are currents are active in our consciousness at all times this is kind of the Christian concept of\nThe devil on your ... on one shoulder and the angel on the other\nAnd it was all about harmonizing these forces and recognizing that through our the power of our own consciousness and our own thoughts we can actually become angels\nIs an amazing possibility or how did you uncovered this\nI've actually been on the trail of the watchers for some time I mean I've been of course on the on a knock you trail for Fifteen Years or so and then I started researching the Sarah from uh several years ago these are the highest order of angels and\nThey watch or guard God's throne and in fact during the Renee sound so it was a belief was developed that the Sarah from were actually humans\nWho would transform themselves into angels or perfected themselves that the book and the Bruce describes the the heavenly thrown a God referred to as ... and they tell us that it's inhabited it's an inhabited by joyful angels and the angels are the lord the watchers and just humans made perfect\nAnd I'm reading this and go why are these people ... and ... what did they know how did they perfect themselves how did they get to turn into angels and go and do well in God's throne and can I how can I and that's what started me on this real path of of trying to uncover the secrets of the watchers\n\nWell I never knew I had margins in my garden and and I never knew there were aliens on my ... I got shadow people and they live and in my\nDay man not a funny feeling John ... here soon I\nWhy why why\nI'm Down by ... by ... things I Need to know now I can see them and die on the go\nWell you never knew that\nYour baby was a high bringing the crew you began to me that clean now you know the time he learned to find joy nor me while you sleep you got Martians ... yeah\nI can die by bank in the middle of the things that need to know I can see them all\n\nCamera world\nDown by radio Oh yes I have things that need to know now I guess I'll\nOr damned belonged to tone down eyes or Lisa ... who are the Sean law to shore Stephanie Smith horse balls timber was George that by George Norris somewhere out there on the coast to coast am will she won her next edition told them to be said for everyone\n[noise]\n[noise] we got each day with good morning or lend me too movement in bloom right now enlisted for men who are guilty of sexual misconduct\nThere was no difference and I would never offered one having said that do we need to heed to most ... we're still have some innocent man from being what I call\nKavanaugh good\nLender weekdays sexual ... use radio Ninety three points on WFL a hard\nTime or even how fat ... family has a camera on them right now is trying to re entering\nProtect the\nWater got really everybody at making her\nFamily didn't think it can happen in the hands on the record addict can earn always protect what matters learn more about your blood risk and plus ...\nHi I'm Johnny Carson taught all\nThe other day I got the pharmacy to pick up a prescription when I noticed a sign\nThat read only six for ... income [noise] have to say I was a bit surprised because many years ago a person with a disability like me would have to discreetly shop at a specialty store for items like undergarments embed protectors\nBut now companies are marketing these products for the general public with big TV ads\nAnd over the counter drugs and products made readily available at your local retail pharmacy and that's a good thing\nBecause urinary incontinence is very common there all the G care foundation estimates that one in three adults have bladder control issues ... and the number is even higher for people with disabilities who have diabetes Parkinson's disease can be more about your inner incontinence and what you can do to help\nDisability campaign dot org\nWFL I find ... door Orlando news radio Ninety three point one W.

want to keep it with NO PLAN to pay it off fast\nOkay and then here's the other thing no more Home Depot credit cards no more sign up for dental rentals if the best way to do it has to live debt free than actually live debt free\nYeah stop it yeah\nYou got to decide which way you're going to be like you got one foot on the boat one on the dock philosophically yeah so um you know decide\nBecause I think you are really doing good until we got to Home Depot and then borrowed money for rental and then you kind of like lost your mind for a minute\nOr\nThat's what it sounds like ... now you can clean it up I mean you cleaned up the Home Depot which moved over to this deal now we can clean it up by either selling it or we can lean into it for two years\nAnd I have no life and clean this thing up and is this rental wars that we love that rental that much\nI don't know if you do or not you might I like real estate I might do it but I wouldn't do it again the next time you get ready to buy something at home depot pay cash for the next time you get by the ready to buy rental you pay cash for it regardless of what you do with this rental but I Would do one of the others\nThat's what I

and that is a story and your range of income is about eight hundred grand okay [laughter] my goodness gracious ... so what in the world this was a ... bizarre numbers\nYeah Dave it's a it's a long time coming so we were the Joneses [laughter] so um you know for a long time we had to have\nThe new everything and the nice everything luckily for us bus for us that we had a decent income to what I'll do for a live with all that well I'm I'm just I'm I'm a I T cells guy\nAnd Tiffany I stay home with these two little lady awesome okay an auto um\nYeah for a long time we got caught up in that and I listen to your show probably for about eight months leading up to this and\nYou know for me it was pride and ego just you know I'm too sophisticated for that that's best for other people and um I came to realize through ah through a lot of prayer and a lot a lot of just\nListening and thinking and knowledge in reading that this was the right way for us so we sold\nA a lake house we saw with a beach house and um\nWe were beans and rice for eight months much to the chagrin of my family um but we made it through and knocked it out and so excited\nGoodness gracious [noise] so I don't or thousands your typical year's income\nYeah I mean I guess over the last ten years this range between eight and one point to run\nKnow obviously ... wild on so how much of the one million and ...\nAngel was the sale of the house was what the like ALS bring with the Beatles\nRanks so the the uh the net all still lake house was only like one fifty but the beach house was paid for and it was about four Seventy\nAnd kind but the ... I mean the one point five included the pay off all the mortgage or the other one right yeah sure okay so what was the total on the two properties\nWell it says that would have reduced the whole thing by the force Seventy in order to reduce the yeah the other ...\nThe cell or the property was seven eighty on the lake house and we are about a hundred and twenty less than that\nAnd that but that that are\nSix hundred thousand or so is included in the one million paid off for a sure okay sure so mostly a big chunk of this then if I'm hearing those right was done with these two properties oh yeah okay yeah wow\nYeah on Iran and all of the aisle of the extra staff which there's a challenge when every or when you were me and I and we were used to doing it where you sit in the summer is being able to go to the lake and how and mark caught me on board finally\nWhat made you decide because I mean I I'm kind of thinking I I might have tried to keep one or two of those are one of those the cheaper one the four Seventy one interest worked our way through given your income what made you decide to go show radical yeah also and you did it wrong I'm just curious\nYeah I mean for me I I think about like eternity as all the lifespan and I think you know were given maybe Ninety years if we're lucky in that full eternity which is like a a glimpse in time and then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids mhm\nAnd so for us it was you know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were at the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and\nMe wasn't that way on one of those ads [laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you ... or a hard thing to beginning so I mean I'm\n... what's your all's income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the force rainy one would you like\nIt was really difficult to to give up something that\nYou know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that ... but it also kind of oil down here they are getting older and we have\nYou know what do we want to do with them as they get ... and and what do we want to show them and we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart has you know we needed to see what was important\nDown to three thousand dollars okay\nAnd you understand premium offset is they're using the three thousand dollar cash value to pay the premiums\nCorrect\nNow that's not offset you're using your savings account instead of your checking account to buy your premium\nTo act like I said there's no also they're ... they're getting their dad gummed money you can count on that\nBut they're taking out of my pay that debt and\nYou know it's hot Sony is my point he made it sound like it's free\nRight which and I went back to the candidate you know policy the rates are low\nAnd you know I Know and when you die you know what happens to the rebels in dollars they're going to keep\nIt now they don't keep\nIt so how is this a good idea there's no way this was a good idea so you show you do whatever you want to hunting but those qualities are crap and I wouldn't keep a thirty seconds and it wouldn't have the big\nDiscussion was stupid whole life insurance agent about it either match on the line in Los Angeles I'm Matt how are you\nA fabulous ... thank you for taking my call\nSure what's up\nSo um my question revolves twenty five percent rule that you use for the mortgage my wife and I bought a home about a year ago\nAnd I'm I'm One of those people were all I did not include the property taxes the homeowner's association and the insurance as part of the payment to the bank I Do all of that separate way mhm so my question is is are you supposed to include the H away\nThe property taxes and the insurance as part of your twenty five percent role in the way that you teach\nI generally just say principal interest taxes and insurance I joy no but most people as you know we're paying that as one payment and the whole point is not whether it's twenty five percent or twenty seven percent or twenty three percent there's no magic number there the point is is trying to keep people from being how poor\nOkay where they got such a dead gum payment they can't breeze and then they wonder why they're broke right\nYeah well we started here class about six months ago we actually purchased the house about a year ago and and the numbers like we we actually get a thirty year long but\nAccount twenty percent of our income so I'm way out of forty thousand less than a day off and then we are looking actually where you find that you're in one\nArea can ... if you've got a good interest rates you can just pay that loan like it's a Fifteen minute will pay off in Fifteen\nNot sure we have the option to do that as well\nEither either one is fine I don't know if I go to refinance cost if you have a competitive interest rate but it sounds like you're fine I mean 'cause you're you're twenty percent is in great shape right now you gotta clean up this other bad but I mean the thing I don't want to have somebody with a you know six thousand\nDollar income take home pay and in a in a four thousand dollar house payment wondering why they're broke you know Hitler\nThe whole the whole point is big numbers here not the ... and not splitting hairs on it the ah in our senior splitting hairs you're being wise to ask for details there's nothing wrong with that but but I Am saying my formula of twenty five percent is not so perfect\nBut if you're twenty five point five percent oh God you're going to you've messed up everything no no no the point is just to not be house pour that's all it is it's kind of a big number philosophy in other words big chunky numbers not fun to numbers other things I Do I Do find two numbers on but that's a good clarification thanks for calling in\nJackie's in Oklahoma City Hi Jackie how are you\nGood how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nOkay I'll just start off really clay I Am twenty seven years old I had a a a total of twenty five hundred that I or twenty five thousand a day or that including my mortgage and\nAccess that and my question is would it be worth it to save an add on to my house or to save up and buy\nAnd or at least save up for the down or if it would be more ideal per se but\nIt's going to continue continued on sweets complete every single stat and then by our dream house later on\nOkay I'm a little bit confused you you you yeah I Know ... it's okay you're wanting to add on to this house or move up and house you\nKnow add on to the house I live in a gray area I work from home is ... ... neither based\nOn what I what I have a house that you're living in worse um\nRight now it's probably worth about Seventy thousand I bought it for forty\nOkay and if it's worth Seventy now um what what size edition what'd you do how much money would you spend on the addition\nAh why spend about twenty grand just to add on an expert ground because I work with children and that's\nGood and so the homes in your neighborhood on your street and then the next street over cell for what price range\nAnd they sell for about a ... and the Upper East side of my neighbor had just because it's a really small street has pretty nice out I mean they're they're they're pretty darn nice and like my my part is and\nAs somebody looking for a house that's worth Ninety thousand dollars it wouldn't be unusual for them to be on your street\nRight but you wouldn't want you want to come on you're straight to look for a hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nRight okay so don't put more than twenty into it cause Seventy plus twenty is Ninety and in order to be able to get your money back out you don't want to overbuilt the neighborhood okay right so yeah and yes we're going to pay cash for the addition and what's your household income\nUh it's about five thousand and my mortgage is about four hundred dollars\nYou know and your mortgage in all your debt is only twenty five thousand right right yeah and ... are now much of that is mortgage and how much of that other debt\nAnd there is only three thousand in that and then there's twenty two and a mortgage\nOkay and you're making like Seventy thousand dollars a year right household income All right well and so how quickly could you come up with forty five thousand dollars to be dead free and have the twenty to do the ...\nWell I I I Can't think of myself but and I know that we plan on eliminating the access that with an excellent yeah and then we're going to kick off and start paying a falling out why and an extra fall now between the lowest in life\nI mean how they felt my ex if it takes two years from today for you to be debt free and you have the addition done and you paid cash for the addition is that okay\n[noise] um well I mean that's where I'm kind of ... I just I Want to do with that\nSo I'm just trying to set up watching it takes two years from today and you are dead for it's not a trick question is it okay with you if we if you have the addition completed and paid cash for and you're a hundred percent debt free and it's two years from today is that an okay\nPlan\nI think so because I I don't play by where I live\nGood yeah I think you can do that because that's too that's twenty two thousand dollars a year out of Seventy thousand and you paid\nOff everything house and everything and you pay cash for your addition you ought to be able to do all of that within two years so I think you've got a great plan I Would become debt free and then I Would say about that on the couch so more than twenty thousand I'd sure you get contractor beds and everything down so you know what you're getting into\nThat puts this hour that Iran's you show in the book we will be back with you before you know in the meantime remember there's really only one way or the financial peace in that storm daily with the purpose of these crises\n\nKelly we bang horse down\nCat to be here thank you for\nHelping spread the word\n\nWe use the phrase part of a teacher to describe our real estate ... because we only endorsed agents who care more about helping their clients that are earning a commission\nBut you don't have to take my word for it here's what Paul one of our listeners from Boise had to say about is a Yale be part of a teacher is the perfect description for Matthew the E. L. P.

you get your other debts paid off now much all the data you got\nOnly got fifty four thousand left on their own\nOkay right\nOkay so she moves out you move in and run it you sell your house oh how much where you're much equity we got out of your house\nUm maybe Fifteen thousand not very much at all\nSo accelerate the baby ... baby step to a little bit he re read the payments not too high that doesn't bother me a when you ... what's the ... you have any idea what the interest rate is on the loan\nUm lets her she writes refinanced about on two years ago and I would imagine that it's not very high\nIt's reasonable so it so it's reasonable to show you could get a mortgage that was a very similar rate and payment when you get ready to purchase it after you get out of baby step to and get your emergency fund on and baby step three but it's going to get a little while to do that a little bit longer because you're a hundred bucks it's ten thousand dollars a year or more to live there\nRight [noise] well I don't know if I Would do it uh just because of emotions but this is not a bad\nThing you're just a renter here's your worst case scenario you're a renter you've sold your house you're renting your mother in law's house and you realize you can't afford it and so then your mother in law will do what she would have done if you say no now\nAnd she will sell the house and you will have to move as you say no now she needs to just sell the house right\nAll right okay so you could try it and say no later no harm no foul okay\nBut you don't have to be ... you don't want to sign a contract to be obligated as we're going to go in Iran try it we're going to rent it for the payment and we want a written contract that we are renting it for the payment or brothers or sisters anywhere\nUm there is a brother\nIn and get on a body going to be pissed off about the fact you're getting all this like would've given to you\nKnow you sure as far as I understand that now there\nYeah I think we're all having coffee in one big pile and talking about this\nThis is how families end up not speaking to each other generationally okay so\nYeah we're all going to talk about it and we're going to do this in writing I Want you to lease it with an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance\nLease it for the payment was an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance and then just like you or rent or somewhere else and you decided you couldn't stay than she would just sell it then and that's no different than her selling it now accept it may have gone up a little bit in value and she might get a little more money out of it\n\nDoesn't hurt to give this a try the only thing it hurts is eight hundred bucks a month more rent but it's if there's if this was a place you see yourself living for many many many years like the rest of your life maybe I'm probably given Iran at this and partly because of the emotion here emotions okay\nPersonal finances personal and that doesn't mean it's situational e ethical or that the truth changes it just means you look at it and you go to them that item\nYou know that the car sitting in the driveway I rebuilt it from the time I was Thirteen to the time I was Nineteen when my dad and he died two years later I'm not so in that car\nThat car sitting in the driveway about three weeks ago when I was stupid and smoking crack when I bought the car I'm selling that car\nThere's a difference in the in both of them are car both of them are sitting in the driveway both of them are transaction that needs to occur\nBut we're going to

tell me the story what happened five years ago they got you on this journey\nSo it probably goes back a little further than five years but uh we were at a point in our marriage where we were paid attorneys and we were headed for divorce so we have a huge family we have six kids between the two of us feel a lot of stress with a blended family mhm a lot of chaos and\nBoth of us spend money like crazy and and um were paid six thousand dollars to attorneys and we were I left the house to\nTook our youngest child and\nA friend of mine invited me to see you and you were doing a tunnel a makeover event and she had invited me to go see you and I didn't know who you are but I didn't want to be at home with him I said sure I'll go see you\nAnd I was at the arena yes I was like five thousand or a policy of and a friend yes uh-huh and so we I went to go see you and I'm\nAt a lot of issues that I hadn't dealt with from my childhood and from for life and I just stuffed them down and I was spending like crazy and I didn't know that I was the majority of the problem in our relationship and then when you said um if you have a problem with money it's not the money you\nIt just kind of lifted blinders off my eyes and I realized okay the problems and\nThat I had to do something to to get all that out take to fix myself\nSo I went home and I begged him to give it a shot and I bought your starter ... when I was there and um and we started our journey\nThere were ... were retook the Thirteen were a few class at our church that were started back to church or off along separation from somebody in regular tenders and went through a marriage recovery program\nAnd we just go to a really awesome church churches\nCity church that hands what city church ... yeah it was it was God just working and our lives from the moment you know forever but really from the ... we started this plan it just everything started\nGetting better and and we were closer together and we were on the same page and um it's just amazing\nAnd it took us thinking Fifteen months to pay off all all of the non mortgage that a hundred and almost a hundred and ten thousand dollars we sold everything inside and that wasn't nailed down in our house when\nThe show which flipped with ... foot up doesn't it yeah I Know you went from a whole whole spending stupid all the way over the wide open smart yeah yeah wow that's a true one eighty\nWe just it was like the horses that you talked about in your ... classes and then we just got together and nothing was going to stop us and we ate beans and cheese everything [laughter]\nGoing to we're going out to dinner tonight at a\nFairly extravagant good and we're stressed out good no woman on days we've we stay plugged\n[noise] I thought about and ah I'm ... I'm already starting now planning on um I'm trying to get jobs or or at least one or two jobs over the summer work ... hours really keeping them the gear to get off with credit cards\nAnd you're you said your college professor or what subject do you teach\nI teach theology and specifically for individuals with disabilities\nWow and I would guess that would also apply to athletes would it not\nNo my athletes it can be disability sports but my research specifically for people who have the ability of cognitive disabilities and they have trouble getting out of the couch and exercising or being physically active about more towards the competitive fun yeah\nOkay I Would think an independent practice separate from your teaching where you worked hand a hand in glove with some therapy people in the therapy community a would be ideal for an on going extra income and your jacket up a lot during the summer\nA in a sense you're you're a tutoring if you will your own students are but you're using your research and your expertise and your information that ought to be very valuable\nUh and that you could build a coke business consulting business working with therapists are that you come in and and you know supplement what they're doing it and move things alone so I think you've got a real upside there on your income that's exciting stops\nWesley with us in Pensacola Hi Wesley welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThank you day by day better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so a little background my wife and I graduated college last year a completely debt free I'm and I'm looking into trying to get a separate vehicle because right now we've been driving or like you said a ... you got a a United States marine driving a hundred thousand ... Prius so thanks for that\nBut I [laughter] I drive into base but whatever [laughter] I\nLive in the car payments because I told my buddy as just struck me told me about sixty thousand dollar car and I'm like we need to talk\nAnyway or somebody watching is I'm trying to figure out what to do next because I Want to get rid of the press they don't want to replace it with a\nTruck and I've got a Nineteen sixty four Chevy back home um and my uncle is willing to you or your labor for me for free or to get it fixed up when he knew engineers when you're training in all kinds of stuff it's really sweet looking shot truck\nA problem for the is that you know it's not going to be quite as reliable probably never gonna be reliable as a moderate are what the law which would would you consider going down the road and you know\nDumping a couple of thousand into this truck to make it you know what you know driving around\nOr do you you know save up and wait for a vehicle layer off\nI think the trucks a keeper and it's a project truck that you work on after you get your financial straightened out\nOkay um so I I think that previous was gonna say I hate it too I'm with you but [laughter] but I think it's going to be a lot more reliable than a fixed up sixty four I've got a ... I got a Nineteen sixty that does rebuild from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ... to ... dual start for barrels on it it's a beast\nOr not but but it is a project car I mean they you you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere I have to be it's more of a fun thing to have\nIn the garage and I think that's what you're sixty four is going to be some day um but if you want to sell the Prius and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car was what you would have spent on the truck motor and that kind of stuff\nAnd move into a little different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a hope move up kind of a thing then I'd be okay with that if you want to do that\nBut um but I don't think I'd let that truck get away and I want to do the project 'cause it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is one of those Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin Hi Josh how are you\n[noise] I'm good how are you do better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so I've got a question um regarding a credit card for business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here 'cause I'm looking for some by um my wife and I have never been through a few but we actually just recently paid off all of our debt and then about two and a half weeks ago\nGreat congratulations\nThank you um [noise] I work from home with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in a while and we are required basically it's you you know pay for someone else\nThis expenses during the trip that money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to be paid for that what we have to kind of want that money had the time um [noise] we pulled out all of our credit cards\nExcept for the one the business trips because we don't have money\nYou know set aside to be able to pay for these expenses\nI might have been much of the expenses run a month\n[noise] well I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but there I mean every time I go on a business trip it gets anywhere from a thousand two thousand dollars coverage and the hotel\nMood and then you get it and get the money back when you get the money back within thirty ...\nYeah OK correct so mean we're we're paying ... to pay that off and on obviously we're not going to using the credit card for our own personal use to\nThe end of the ... you need to see that one time you need to ... from the ... one time with two thousand dollars in a separate ... new checking account that as a debit card on it and it's used only for one thing reimburse ...\nTo get your household income\nOne thirty year that's good\nOkay and you're for paid for rentals and they have this one okay yeah um\nHow quickly can you pay this one off if you really lean into it like you did before\nI rarely mentioned in it [laughter] any here every three\nOkay yeah I Would think you could you know that sounds right\nAnd then what I Would do is I Would build up cash and I would never buy anything else again so what I Would ask you to talk about tonight turn off the television and sit down at the kitchen table tonight looked at each other and go okay do we want to sacrifice really deeply out of our lifestyle\nAnd make a hundred and thirty thousand a year we got for paid for rentals but do we want to act like we're broke people\nPour it all on to this rental for two years is this rental worth that to us so we can knock this out really really fast\nAnd then never do it again or kind of a no\nHorn and we want to sell it but I don't want to but I don't want to keep it with NO PLAN to pay it off fast\nOkay\nAnd then here's the other thing no more Home Depot credit cards no more sign up for dental rentals if the best way to do do it is to live debt free than actually live debt free\nYeah stop it and you got to decide which way you're going to be like you got one foot on the boat one on the dock philosophically yeah so um you know decide because I think\nYou are really doing good until we got to Home Depot and then borrowed money for rental and then you kind of like lost your mind for a minute\nOr\nThat's what it sounds like ... now you can clean it up I mean you cleaned up the Home Depot which ... moved over to this deal now we can clean it up by either selling it or we can lean into it for two years\nAnd I have no life and clean this thing up and is this rental wars that we love that rental that much I you know I don't know if you do or not you might I like real estate I might do it but I wouldn't do it again the next time you get ready to buy something at home depot pay cash for the next time you get by to ready to buy rental you pay cash for it regardless\nOf what you do with this rental but I Would do one of the others that's what I Would do so Hi thanks for calling in sounds like you guys got a lot going on I mean you're making good

wife and I can bomb bring home about six thousand among okay\nNo I mean I wouldn't sell this car you know the cars out not out of line it's it's a it's a Seventeen thousand dollar sale to solve a two thousand dollar problem you've got thirty thousand dollars in cash so what I Would do is ride a twenty nine thousand dollar check towards that student loan not pay off that other three thousand by
