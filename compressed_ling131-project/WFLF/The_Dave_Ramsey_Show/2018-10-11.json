I. N. N. I. A. wealth dot com\nA billionaire and the shark tank guy Mark Cuban announced that he's pulling back on his market exposure he sounds a little nervous I'm Down\nMaybe four dividend owning stocks too short and Amazon\nAnd ... and I've got a whole lot of cash on the sideline there's no way where you can just say I just trust everything that's going on and that concerns me\nOkay he's down to two stocks and a lot of cash so Mark Cuban is a billionaire he's really smart guy so Sharif should we follow his lead what do you say\nI don't know you think he's got fifty million in each one of the stock [laughter] prominence through you know\nI'm just so we are not Mark Cuban my listeners are not Mark Cuban so here's the lesson to to to really listen to when it comes to this story\nWhen he is doing the question is should you be doing it so here's the differences Mark Cuban he has many many streams of income I mean he does the shark tank has the basketball team and he has many many streams of income coming in\nSo he can do whatever he wants he can says money in cash if he wants and he's still going to get his income and he's probably still saving and dumping more and cash right\nSo the question you have to ask yourself um are you are you in the same scenario you have other streams of income that are out there for you\nBasically that will provide income do you have that working for you the biggest thing is you don't want to have to worry about losses and retirement not on all your money and that's how I feel if you are not sure how to do with Mark Cuban is doing and get these extremes income without going and buying a basketball team [laughter]\nI mean it'd be a part of the owners of the shark tank on we\nDo suggest you come in and sit down with us because we're going to show you how to get those other streams of income without all the worry without all the fuss and simplified manner do I believe people should have all their money in the market\nI Do not believe every single dollar should be exposed to market volatility no so it's now time to start carving a piece of that market exposure off the table reconsidering some of these other ways to get an income [laughter]\nThe biggest fear and retirement Randy is running out of money right\nI'm In the world goes round and round and round and it's all about income we get income when before we're retired and how do we get income and take this lump sum when we retire and throughout retirement so our goal is to get you to retirement and through retirement but it's all about income I specialize in that\nThe political identity or political issues but\nMan is she right on the money with this the feminism she says she admires never\nSought to denigrate and destroy managed to miss current was never a male versus female thing\nAnd she of course this and she you know she is a she's an art expert an analyst and a cultural professor University of the arts in Philadelphia I'm\nHere this this one this next bite from the same battle of Ideas Festival in London a couple of years ago this I predict will sound familiar\nTo human beings need religion they need only just perspective ... perspective and getting rid of the orthodox religions because they were they were too conservative and simply led to the new religion political correctness and at the same kind of fanaticism I may have found that the second wave feminists now if the Spanish Inquisition I'm not\nYou're talking about the building\nYou know the practice itself on sale I have a I have a hundred thousand have in ... and the practice it'd be five hundred so it'd be really tough to [noise] great together another four hundred thousand dollars\nIn a year I mean if you could ever get tied up for a year and close that that's\nYou know\nUh and then by the real estate the second year more than a lease it will for the first year and Lisa so here's the problem I I heard one I'm struggling with you you haven't obviously have a and B believe Lee fabulous income\nI mean crazy wonderful income but I Do not tell people to borrow money to buy businesses\nAnd I'm not going to tell you to borrow money to buy this I think you can save up the money and a year and I think you'd be just didn't you know negotiate with this guy put together a deal and\nEven if you um took it over ran it for a year and I had an option to buy and put a hundred thousand dollars that down as your option to buy the practice and then clothes on the practice in one year in cash for it and close on the real estate the next year and pay cash for it and that's how I Would do it if I were in your shoes um\nI Do not borrow money mark and I do not tell people on the show to borrow money for business purchases\nUm I don't believe in it I think it gets you into problems and I'm a you know if this guy wants to sell this ... this practice to you that show they'll have to sell it if I were negotiating the deal\nBut I mean certainly you can do what you want to do I think that practice um you know I suspect it's going to even add more to your income and then in the third year of this discussion you probably pay off your house I didn't ask what your mortgage balance was but um\nI don't go into debt to buy to do business\nWith this business has too much risk with it and even dental practices have too much risk with them especially when you're completely changing the format of what you're doing in that you're picking up a whole second location and practice management comes into play them\nAnd so there's risk here there's a real risk here I'm so I'm paying cash for it or I'm not buying it and that's how I Would go about it a good question I don't know what you'll do a you certainly got a lot of income and that that covers a lot multitude of sins\nBut that's how I Would do it thanks for the call open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five uh Melissa is on Facebook and Dave Ramsey a Facebook dot com slash they ... what exactly does it mean if the\nTerm insurance is Twenty years I'm forty three should I go for longer or shorter term\nWell that means that policy will not change for Twenty years\nIt's called twenty year level term and you don't have the same premium and the same amount of coverage for Twenty years after Twenty years the premium will go up dramatically um or you can go have another medical exam and buy a new policy that will not be\nGo up nearly as much as that one would go up now the question is how long do you need\nLife insurance if you've got a six year old and a twelve year old in Twenty years you'll have a twenty six year old and a thirty two year old hopefully they're\nGone\nThat's the idea we train them to leave\nAnd come back with grandbabies that's their job okay that's the process here this is how life works so kids are grown and gone Twenty years from now you would be a hundred percent that free because we never tell you to take out more than a Fifteen year fixed rate mortgage\nAnd Twenty years from now if you were doing the baby steps that we teach you'd be putting have been putting Fifteen Percent of your household income away for Twenty years\nWhich would probably make you well in excess of a millionaire [noise]\nDepending on what your household income inch so let's just say you have seven hundred thousand dollars and and paid for house and no kids at home\nAnd you die I think your husband could struggle through or reverse it he dies you could probably struggle through seven or eight dollars no kids who don't pay for our point is being out of debt and building well does away with the need for life insurance you don't need a journal life they only live live insurance is needed\nThere's cause your age and needs to commission his whole life and this is the day Ramsey show\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial\nNeeds that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are in your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well as stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace a stay at home parent\nResponsibilities I only recommend term life

don't know what to do with ourselves now gas we've always had you know the nice thing about following your plan there's always one step at a time and you always have a goal that you're working on and now that we're like done we don't really know what to do\nNext [laughter] shows some invest some of the ... about all you can count on it oh well done you know\nIt feels really awesome a it's a long time coming it's a lot of planning but now it's just you see one bill go and then another bill go another bill go into more it's counter comeback one month in another month to month and it feels really good\nCool what do you teach a law oh good okay so a law professor and empty ... not bad to have a long way to go\nIt was a lot of work to get to where we are a bit and uh I think you know coming out of medical school it's Sam\nHugh you have this big lump of money that you know and I remember getting statements in the mail from the loan company and I would just kind of open them and put them and put him to the side because it's so overwhelming yeah and um I I was nervous about having\nTo make an Eighteen hundred to two thousand dollar payment every month for ten years and end up paying almost double what I'd have borrowed ...\nAnd it's basically like paying off a mortgage so um we were\nWe actually had a great I'm attending physician that during my fourth year med school actually sat us down and said\nYou know we're we're going to talk about money and we were thinking oh you see any teachers out billing or had her in her practice and he's like no seven day you're going to make a lot of money and you need to know what to do with it so you don't end up like me and my sixty then I Can't retire because I\nBecause I have that still wow and so he's he's the one that I heard your name from and got the total money make or a book and read that then\nI'm probably it was another year or two before I really started the program 'cause\nBeing in med school and not having any income living off loans it's kinda hard to figure out\nShow you're committed to probably many you're just planning on putting a lot of miles on it because you're out there running the road\nExactly in the last two and a half years yes\nOkay so here's the thing we know about putting miles on a car and you know this is the more miles you put on the core of the more you destroy its value correct\nCorrect\nAnd so if I'm going to travel um or for instance people who travel for a living people road warriors I call them they you know there there have to travel for work all the time I'm In that case you want to drive in that case you want to drive the least expensive vehicle to get the job done because you are destroying whatever you drive\nI mean you wouldn't want to grab a hundred thousand dollar car you is going to be worth nothing by the time you've finished traveling\nAnd so I'm unless you've just got millions of dollars and you can afford to lose a hundred grand but but you know most people don't have that so basically what we're saying is is you're going to take the Seventeen thousand our vehicle and you're going to cause it to drop in value faster than anything else what's your household income\nUm I make about eighty thousand until you're single ... single bachelor rankled ranking a small little okay All right I'm always hanging out you have any debt or just the car that ... ... um eleven thousand okay\nAll right well there's nothing you know I'm hearing here this crazy as long as you realize that you know the Seventeen thousand dollar car might be worth um you're going to lose a few thousand dollars extra on it just because you're going to travel in it okay\nAnd as long as you're willing to do that ... it with the kind of money you make you should be okay let's get the car paid off as soon as possible so your preferences keep it in drive it is that right\nUm I probably could keep it for five or six years yeah but my friends and co worker whenever the fate betrayed and betrayed it you're crazy to keep it to trade it in for what um last night on I I was running around the brand new BMW forty uh-huh exiled falling in love with\nRight well that'd be easy to fall in love with that but the but that's even more expensive so we're going to destroy even more expensive car if you want to travel and that right\nYeah and to upgrade to a brand new one you know that would be twenty percent less\nWell number one they're in ... and you don't have the money to do that so that's ludicrous we wouldn't do it on that basis alone but\nOn the idea that you're going to travel in it no you don't want to you know you don't want to upgrade and destroying more expensive cars about how you know so if you if you're going to travel you need to run the wheels off for something that's not going to cost you as much\nSo we don't upgrade in order to lose more money when we don't have any money that that doesn't make sense at all so whoever your friends are I mean they're they're encouraging you to do stupidity but I've had friends that have encouraged me to do stupid him I didn't have to do it though [noise] uh Brian's with us in Bakersfield, California hey Brian how are you\nBetter than I've been there Dave how are you\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\nOkay Dave so far I found you at the beginning of this year I impulse to and purchased they ridiculous car [laughter]\nAnd and as soon as I found you I was like crap\n[laughter] [laughter] well did you buy\nUm we bought a two thousand fans must let's fix with all the bells and whistles\nSo we eat yeah\nWell not fulfilling because my pocket hurts\nYeah well I guess but I mean the cars great now okay oh yeah so what what do you owe on a similar thing\nWe'll thirty five thousand mhm okay and what's your how fan I'm\nHere will be making the the the five maybe touching Seventy depending on my overtime oh yeah there's just you know\nSo and I'm next year I'll be getting into a Fifteen Percent raise plus another ... percent raining down the road yeah I'm so she is my ... I'm calling to see if you what if you're OK with this uh me and my wife finally agreed to let it go\nGood and sell it good it's worth Twenty one thousand oh God yeah so you're you're all ... down into it or die that bad\nYeah and I that that it only took like three months good lord so Twenty one guy on trade in\nYes well I mean you know twenty three on private sale\nSomething that's not enough says the spread on private so she was saying this car went from thirty five thousand uh twenty three thousand in one year\nActually technically over forty thousand two thirty five thousand I I also canceled the warranty on it\n'cause we had any extending warranty yeah and and we found out back and it's funny how when you pay a vehicle or do you reach ... miles to all of a sudden a it starts to fail on you and do our chief counsel 'cause you or did it\nThe cars one or old\nAnd I almost eight year old yeah\nAll right so yeah when you get rid of this thing for so many reasons so so what's your plan\nFinance a name like looking around and we saw some four thousand five thousand dollar cars I'm I could save up that money and I already have it by next income refund but what I was thinking is because our monthly payment for ... at the throughout the whole month and it's like eight hundred dollars\nSo because I also have stood among and assuming famous I won't succeed but almost done with that and we have like six thousand dollars left over\nSo what what if I just go ahead and sell this car mhm filed a difference and goats and the guy who are on the car that showing for like four or five thousand dollars and just make payments off for like a hundred bucks and the monthly payment will go down to four hundred dollars to making a mess\nMhm yeah I mean we okay with it yeah sure but I I I'm not sure I understood how your financing your second car\nThe ... of the\nUh the five thousand dollar car that you're buying how are you financing it\nThey'll just go on me it just like you know just like if you're going to go buy a car for a little down payment on it oh okay I Know where the you know what I mean\nYou know that's fine if you can just get a regular car loan on it that's fine let's do that because we're still reducing your debt by half\nYour right\nAnd um by doing this and then you can concentrate on getting that car paid off and then getting the whole that your dog with this other car which is absolutely horrendous it's a great car I'm surprised that thing has dropped that foreign value um make real sure you got your numbers right on that\n'cause I I mean I [noise] the\nCars are horrible as far as going down in value I get it I I'm I'm a card guy but they and they go down in value rapidly but that one is like a black hole for money on or something like that's incredible\nWhat a horrible horrible\nCar on holding its value so check out and make sure your number your numbers are a little high\nOn terms of ... money I think you maybe you have lost as much I'm hoping you have a lot of so much you think you've lost so let's dig into that a little bit further and you do not want to sell it to a dealer at wholesale you want to sell it private sales it should be in this situation about a five thousand dollar difference\nIn other words you should be able to get five or more out of showing their profit show than you would for a dealer on something bad expensive um so I really check those numbers I'm not sure you've got correct stuff there but\nWow what a dad gummed kicking the teeth man you got hammered amazing\nAnd good luck with it but yes I Would get out of it for sure it's too much car it's a mess it's going down in value it's breaking I mean there's nothing that is good and the story thanks for the call [noise]\nSo that was this hour
