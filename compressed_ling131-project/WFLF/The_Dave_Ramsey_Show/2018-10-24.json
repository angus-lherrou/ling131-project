estate and making good money\nA specially paid for real estate it's very very nice shook up much of it but if you don't know if it was all that and I just get I Would pick some good mutual funds and go that way\nBut at the point is there is no shame and your game by keeping it simple\nSomehow people have the idea that primitive or simple is bad\nAnd the contrary to the contrary it it the truth is the contrary to that the truth is is that the typical person who builds on net worth of up to about ten million dollars a does keep it very very clean and very very simple\nSarah is with us in uh Seattle, Washington Hi Sarah how are you\n[noise] I'm doing well thank you Kelly is taking my call\n[laughter] we'll we'll let Kelly answer your question if you want [laughter] what's something Sarah

turned\nSixty a couple of months ago and a couple of months ago and we're talking and my dad says well\nI Am now for the insurance doesn't fit in our budget and with my mom says that short term thinking ... and I'm thinking that you need at the budget which there how income\n[noise] um [noise] well that's a good question they are retired missionary power they have not made a town and my dad is now retired amount of work has a receptionist I don't know exactly what he\nDid not fit in their budget okay\nI mean there may have to buy very very limited policy if they don't have hardly any income why what's wrong with your dad that he doesn't qualify\n[noise] um he has made us have had a kidney transplant\nAnd so he's attempted to get it in the past and hasn't been able to\nSome I've tried to do what you said the Potter but who knows her or whatever you know say you know what works for me to try to stay out of ... really he doesn't get to get in front I get too much into that but apparently um like last year I encourage them to look into that and\nThey talked to ... back they kidding off at that point out\nSo if you if you can't talk about this what are they going to do it or not I mean how can I help\nOut my mom called me and told me all that so I think she's on board of trying I guess my question is um [noise] how can I have had to convince them that it's an important [laughter] you know your\nMom already knows it's important not only question is I don't know if they'll get the money to buy much of a policy sounds like a pretty broke to me\nUm with what you're describing I don't know I mean some people come off of mission field not broke but but sometimes they don't and so you just got to you know um it it sounds like you're trying to fix something a lot harder and they're trying to fix it you can't make them do this\nAnd so I think you can enter your mom's question and the yeah I mean if there's any way I could get it into my budget I Would get it into my budget um but it sounds like his health is he's an older than her about Fifteen Years and he's are no I'm Sorry about seven years you're saying but I'm In his health is worse\nThan typically

just kind of get that out on the table residual income is income that comes in steadily that you don't work for\nIts own earned income it's investment income as what real residual income\nAnd or you

what I'll do for a living\nI'm an assistant professor\nAnd I'm a shop manager about auto body shop very good cool cool so I'm guessing with the size of that that and it being six and a half years you're paid off your house yes I did\nPretty bold good job are you guys well done well done very cool so that's how you got no payments in the world\nRight how's that feel\nAwesome up at so tell me the story what happens six and a half years ago they put you on this journey\nWell my sister in law was telling me about the financial peace university class\nHe was attending and she was telling us about budgeting and paying our credit card and I kinda just pass\nIt off at the time because we already followed a budget and then I catch it on the radio show a few weeks after that and\nUm I really liked her no excuse attitude for paying off debt so I came home and suggested they told me that we should go to a total money make over one day event\nAnd so we did that and we decided to give it a try and\nSo we were in where was that have been held Kansas City okay very cool\nVery cool and I got you guys going you know\nWe started to do that and we finished baby steps two and three ... and we had just finished baby steps three in October two thousand and twelve and then just a few short weeks after that\nOur entire world kind of fell apart\nWhen Toby was diagnosed with brain tumors whoa\nSo at that time we went into survival mode for a year or so while he was in and out of the hospital having surgeries um during that time we also cash flow to about Fifteen to twenty thousand dollars mhm and medical debt\nAnd medical bills ... and we also made the difficult decision to sell the family business are closed at at the time and so we liquidated that and we've got about fifty thousand dollars from that sale after he was back in good health and working full time we sat down and looked at our budget\nAnd how much we had to pay off on the house and we just knew we had to finish it with his health history so we just made the commitment and\nKept moving forward while she'll go ahead and just be brain tumors in the process yeah\nGood for you and thank you will on man\nThat is awesome ... gonna do it without these guys that are ... are you guys are fall push 'em real stuff and paid off ... very very cool well life does\nRight okay so your questions what\nUh what can I Do they tried to help him or you know get on the right track as well as making sure I'm preparing myself for my financial future so I don't end up in what he does yeah he done\nOkay well I think you're already preparing yourself for your financial future you're Seventeen years old you actually know the day for him to show exist go figure\nSo [laughter] I mean that that alone is is um put your way ahead of the game of most people so you know what to do and and and you're obviously observe some things you don't want to replicate from your dad even though there's probably some things that he does that are good\nThings not necessarily the money but but and he's probably got some good traits that you do really Kate and carry forward [noise] um so uh um\nWell the first thing is is that you learn to stay on a budget you learn to stay out of debt you learn to save money for emergencies and invest for the long term\nYou don't spend more than you make 'em you don't get any credit cards and carry them around so that's how you prepare for your future and obviously you're gonna have to handle your own a school ah and you know on your show you have a lot of work ahead of you but that's okay you'll be fine\nAs far as you go now as far as him on there's not many men on the planet that will take financial advice from their Seventeen year old middle son\n[laughter] absolutely\nYou have the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder but they really don't want your opinion about money or sex\n[laughter] and so he's not looking for your advice even though he knows he's probably wrong [noise] ah so you're probably not the men to speak up and caused this to happen that's my guess\nShow what are we going to do well there's a couple of things you could do um one is is there a person in his life uh particularly another man that he respects is their\nBusiness ability their money ability or even they're just they're spiritual walk\n[noise] ah well definitely our pastor in the past there have tried helping them in the past but it seems like no matter who's talking to 'em or what or how they're trying to help and he just doesn't seem to either comprehend any of it or want to replicate any of that and the very stubborn and being his own man mhm\nOkay well I think if I were you ever talk to your pasture again\nUm you know I I find people every day I've been doing this for a lot of years and I found people every day who\nTwo years ago ... wouldn't listen but now they list or five years ago they wouldn't listen but now they listen so all of us you know the stubbornness comes and goes with all of us and be in our own man comes and goes but if the past or you know just a leans in and and I think\nI'm most pasture as if they're going to make an error it would be on the side of being too soft not too hard\nAnd so I might if I were you ask her past her to turn up the heat and just a little bit more\nAnd just spending time with your dad and push on your dad on this subject and not mentioned that you are involved because you're not involved\nYou can't fix it and you keep your mouth shut down you're not gonna do anything but make things worse\nVery true yeah because he's going to go he's going to do whatever he wants to do and then uh you know at the end of having done everything you can do I mean you know if you wanted to give him a total money make over ... book or something you can do that but you have to be\n... I was thinking about doing that for like Christmas there's I don't think I Would just say no this is something I read that I liked I thought you might enjoy it 'cause you like business [noise] or something like that not like a hey you're really fat here's a book on how to not be fat\n[laughter] that doesn't work right that's insulting you follow me and so you know instead you would just say are just kind of\nBlow it off and make it not might not make it a big deal that it would change my life I Would feel so good if you would read there's no don't do any of that crap\nDismissed kind of keep it nonchalant and just go hey I read this I thought you might like it because you like business stuff or something like ...\nAnd and just see if he picks it up he may throw it away he may put it on the coffee table as a coaster for the next two years and then open it we don't know how this was going to work but at least on a minute outside expert your pastor is an outside influence\nThat does have or could potentially have the credibility for him to listen to\nSome people aren't listening to anybody and so you have to be willing to go I Love my dad in spite of his um incompetence than this one area of his life and I'm just gonna love him where he is it's all I can do\nAnd a writer and have you made that you may do that your whole life ... you know he may go to his grave doing this in ... and so your love is not conditional upon you know whether you handle money well or not your respect for him there's not even conditional on that\nBut you're not gonna take financial advice from somebody that's misbehaving with money so he's not going to speak into your life on money issues but that's all that's all you know I don't speak into people's life on growing hair because I Can't seem to do it on top of my head\nSo I don't tell people how to grow here so if you can't do something you shouldn't tell people how to do it right\nYou shouldn't have any even have an opinion this loud about it but people try all the time so just kind of keep that in the back of your mind their joy hey thanks for calling in Mount open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Jay is in Jackson, Tennessee Hi Jay how are you\nOr I Am doing ... better than out of there and working on getting better good how can I help [laughter] oh I just wanted to say a birthday off I'm a lifelong with nerve ... thank you my mother and my grandmother always playing you in the car when I was a kid wow at a now and to you as an adult\nHave not always practice as good as I should have but I'm working on that ballot gotcha how can I help today\n[noise] ah well I'm I'm calling to ask about that that I'm working on paying all\nI'm pointing out like Maggie I'm Bad at it that way okay maybe weren't that many hours a week and actually deliver pizzas specifically\nOkay I have called the office to make an offer on there that they have given me a counter all her ... Seventy five percent of the balance which I Know is a little high that never had anybody hurt anybody asked you about\nA debt over a judgment on an addiction which is what this is over mhm no I understand that may be a little different yeah it is but they have refused to give me a written agreement on the way\nKinda I'm so even if he were to brown them a check they will not hands you an agreement\nOr he said if I come in to their office I Will get a receipt but they will not give me I have an agreement beforehand\nAnd that's fun that's fun but I get a receipt I get a a a statement that says this judgment ... dad is one hundred percent clear it upon this payment not ever seen that as you pay the money a receipt to says you paid money doesn't mean that you paid Seventy five percent you're still owe twenty five percent\nOr what he said it is it would be a he called and they were the by all those things that that what would be sent to the county clerk or to mark that it is idle and\nAs long as you have something in your hand that says the debt is settled in full and it's in writing\nYou would on you'll be fine okay\nSo I don't know Seventy five percent on an old eviction that it sounds to me like you're dealing with an individual landlord not a corporate landlord I'm dealing with\nLaw office that has representing the are no fast yeah you probably got about all you're going to get [noise] how can I take the deal and and I'm willing to pay that amount that you probably find go go in there and play on and get her\nA family that if you had an ... job that pays you forty grand would you be calling mhm\nOh heck yeah I Would do it\nThey would you be calling the show and asking these questions or ... that would have to spot\n[noise] um [noise] I think that would have thought that the same time I have whenever I did nanny I kind of feeling like maybe I should be doing more oh that's awesome because a lot of people look at you it's like a babysitter yeah now but the wind you know yeah but but\nThere's no shame in work all workers honorable so I think Rachel really hit the nail on the head if you didn't have the\nA fear of peers and you weren't worried about the money will see the money was there and you could take care of kids and make the money you need to make you'd be pretty darn happy when you\nYeah yeah so you're over thinking it and I think you are clear and I don't think you need to justify in your mind\nA bit that being a nanny is okay I think you need to say it's awesome I mean uh you know and again maybe one day she opens up her own daycare I Would dream with in this passion right dream what could\nBe out and even say because we have help with our two girls so that I can work and travel and all that and so to have someone in your life that is walking with you and your kids that you trust your invaluable to family like that role is not just a babysitter like that and if the if the family you're working for\nTraits are like that like then that's that's a cause I can tell you they're going to help us we were like we are all the time like we could not do this life without you like she helps us so much and so\nFiguring out a family that fits you and that in that vein and trying to find the money for it so like maybe you say hey here's my ears max like if you want me as a nanny and I'm the best nanny are going to find I've been doing it for twelve years I Know exactly what to do this is what I call you know what I mean and kind of have that gumption to your tennis\nIn Columbia South Carolina I can tell you actually that if you stay with it and look long enough and hard enough with twelve years meaning experience there some wealthy families that would need you to do maybe a little bit more than just nanny that's right where maybe you're just doing some light cleaning laundry helping the image that how how they and they say life assistant ointment\nThen are you oh yeah me and you can make more than forty yeah home for more than forty yeah I think you've got to own that this is what you love to do and find the best place to do it that's a game changer and having the confidence right right you just you just detect a little shame I'm thirty one kid and Rachel\nAnd I'm a nanny mhm wait a second\nI mean this see that's the shift yep and you know think about oh pears you and I have a mutual friend will show her name and remain nameless yes who is very wealthy and has a new pair pay that lady big dollars yet so again you know there are some limits to what you can do they're really really can't\nEven like for families that are looking for that kinda thing not to drag goes on but but it is such a vitamin I care dot com for instance it's exploded because people are in need of that so even if you started a service where you had been working for you that you helped train that's right I mean let's say that that the options are ... it's great creative\nAll right let's go to a social media question from Facebook Angie types and I'm not sure what to do I'm plugging away and my first snowball which is third which has thirty eight hundred dollars left on a loan and then some smaller medical bills are coming in and do I put those smaller bills in front of the Thirteen hundred dollar loan on the debt snowball list\nYes as as more lines are coming in and just go ahead and reevaluate does something that comes in say okay where's this with the thirty eight hundred and put it in its place say you can keep knocking it out for and why\nIs that why because I think the question is very calm and they go and work on the snowball nuggets of so let's say it's a four hundred dollar medical bill yeah well I Do that\nTo go out and get it out of the way it's still momentum yeah you're still building the idea of okay I can do this and that that thing is just tagged along at the end you know what I mean like there's no purpose for it you know if you have the money you're going to have the money that point you've got them all especially if you're almost done with it you're going to have some cash to be able to throw at it and pay it off and then probably still put money on the pay off the other day that\nOkay this is a little bit shocking but I'm a put this out there next segment we're going to talk about this are you ready for this Rachel the current total of us consumer debt as of June this year was three point eight seven trillion\nDollars that's trillion okay unbelievable but here's what we're about ready to share a new study out\nWhat people are willing to give up in their life

I'm calling for a career like I'm twenty eight years old I've been working and bank ... which are uh several years and been able to narrow down my passion which is a financial coach hoping people do blow\nBut in my current roll my own aligned with a belong at work um banks or bankers language that on the right thing for\nFor everybody [laughter] so I I like talking to people how to read another teacher ... and my question is how can I pursue a passion of the financial coach without like\nWell what do you make right now okay\nSo first of all I think you need to to a deal with the guilt\nI absolutely love where you're coming from and your values and I understand you're having to sell something that you don't believe in\nBut in in a temporary a you know don't take on this massive guilt what you want to put your energy on right now is how quickly can replace that eighty thousand dollars so that I can step over into the financial coaching space or ah like one of our smart vest or prose your Dave Ramsey fan you're part of the tribe you know about are smart ...\nI think one of the first pieces advice I Would give\nIs to go sit down with one of those folks locally in uh Miami area of all those folks are listed on the website I'd find two or three of them tell them you're Dave Ramsey fan tell them your situation just the way you laid it out to us\nAnd and say can I take it a lunch or take you to coffee and learn the best path to get where you're at to do something similar they're going to give you some very very practical a knowledge and some next steps\nThen you do your own homework how much training how much qualification certification or whatever that is that you need to be able to do that that's something you can do and then once you know that you say OK how much is that going to cost me from a financial standpoint and then from a time standpoint these are basic\nResearch questions\nAnd so once you get the answer to that you've got the formulation of a plant and so you take that wisdom and knowledge from somebody who's actually doing what you want to do\nAnd then go do your own homework on what is going to take and you've got yourself a timeline an action plan and and then to to the extent that you can go work for one of those people\nAre and go work in space like that and get in proximity and learned the process and get good at it uh and when maybe you're doing your own thing one day is that something you'd ultimately like to do is have your own business\n\nThen I read in the twenty eight I Would do for somebody else for a while and work your way up\nRight now are you wanting to be a financial planner or a financial coach\nA parent or coach\nCoach okay 'cause a financial planner you'll have to go get your CSP and like there's a lot of that stuff\nDown the ... that started doing it go down totally agree but the financial coach it's more almost like counseling you know type of situation\nA cause you'll have to get referrals and all of that so I Would definitely say we have a lot of those that have gone through our financial training or financial um master coach training here every decision I Would say that's a great first step to uh to come here go through that training Chris Hogan teaches a lot on that and it's phenomenal\nAnd they'll go through that and and try to figure out people in your area that are doing that and then even get connected like even some churches some places that will have\nPeople in the family that need this specific help that that they can give you the referral a cause that would be huge as well so that that takes a little bit of time to kind of build up your book a business that financial coach but it's totally doable and to make that money for sure and so I definitely would go through our training on that\nRoute and I think you bring up a good point racial Chris at twenty eight I think you do need to look at the differences even if they're somewhat nuanced somewhat specific between the coach\nAnd the plant or because I think you can be a financial planner and make that money a lot faster and it's still a coach mean Dave says all the time\nWe go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that's that's one of our local guys if I sit down with Jeff and I we want to do these got the heart of a teacher well let's hope ... right well I Do think you've got to do some specific research there Chris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me\nWant to go for yeah well I like that idea so much of this this whole idea of you know the assets that somebody else is bringing to the table because when you say it like that you know what's what is right would you what you know and how can we how can we use the assets that you have\nIn order to help get through the situation I'm\nIn we said it seems so obvious what do you think it is that makes that so it's it's not ... I don't feel like it's commonly thought or is it now and I'm just out of the loop because you're you're in all these circles where were you know all of these efforts to you know fix homelessness need in poverty and all that stuff is that is that whole kind of asset based\nA charity is that is that where it's like how can the community help itself is that something that people are turning towards a it is because\nUm all of us see that I'm simply addressing the problem even though we're very naturally preoccupied with disaster\nA ... that's ... that rectifies us nationally that prayer buys us personally\nAh but if that's if that's all we try to deal with things never get any better and then smart people eventually think oh well this isn't working because we we just have we just have more problems to deal with and so they say\nOkay how do you how can you fix actually fix and find a solution to these problems\nI'm In ... and and you start to realize\nI'm you know for personal faith like me God's already put\nA certain amount of gifts into those in people they know that can can be um productive and developmental and and and so you start looking for those things that are positive things um and and um every person I Know\nThat um has started to look at themselves as a resource instead of a problem um as a um a person that might help others instead of a victim that person gets better yeah\nUh you know what's interesting about is when you when I hear you say that I I think back to everybody that we've had on this show that came from a tough situation and and then turned it for good they all have that common thread through them of\nUm I have I have gifts that I Want to share you know I I have I have and that's a it's it's a much more powerful a motivation the idea of hope or fear as much wrong or a short term motivation but not nothing compares to hope for a long term motivation\nOr you know as one wise man said hope is a good thing\nMaybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies that was a that was indeed do framed from Shawshank Redemption yo yeah uh and uh in ... but it is true and and the idea of of of changing it from this year a victim you need help to let's figure out how to how the you know ... release your natural potential uh is different\nSo uh is there is there a specific way the seventies listening to this right now ah and I literally don't know if there is so is this putting on the spot I'm Sorry is there a specific way that somebody right now that we're there like I like this idea like this idea because I liked the idea of people helping themselves\nAnd I realize not everybody can because they don't they're not a good place to do it\nWhat what type of place with somebody look to plug in and help with that is that is that a community a effort that's already going on to some degree\nThere are I mean it really resource network we have training um uh that's asset based development that's what this is called asset based because everybody has assets that is the you know strong things of that they can", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "24"}
