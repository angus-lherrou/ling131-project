[laughter] oh mushroom process or keep them in the dark for the manure tried to grow mushrooms um [laughter] so\nAh he ... the deal is this just a cash value life insurance policy there\nAre three types her whole life universe very boy universal live and just verbal life and a universe alive or verbal universal laws and the variable universal sometimes has a mutual funds to lecture on the inside of it ...\nYears ago yeah okay and so what happens is though of course that you you know you're not a fan of it because you're not seeing good return ...\n[noise] no it's about eight percent returns but all the fees built into it I think that it it's not more yeah yeah well and\nYou usually if you're in a good mutual fund that's making ten or twelve you'll ... somewhere in the seven range or after fees which if you\nIt just bought the mutual fund you might have made ten or twelve in your case you're making eight and their fees are getting you down probably in the ... actually would be my guess usually are gonna eat four to five roughly in those things\nAnd so instead of buying a mutual fund directly you're buying it through the stupid policy and they're kicking in the teeth to the tune of another four or five percent that is when it comes down to that's problem number one problem number two is the ... the life insurance portion of it is what's called an A R T an annual adjustable term\nAnd uh the cheapest term insurance you can buy his term insurance for one year based on your age that year and then it adjusts up every year as you get older okay that's the cheapest term policy by the year for one year\nNot the cheapest way to buy it over ten years or Twenty years okay but you know if you buy just based on your age this year so you're paying in X number of dollars\nSome of it is going to buy the life insurance and some of those going to the investment that we've already ascertain just doing poorly okay less and less every year is going to the investment more and more is going to the insurance because your insurance costs just increasing every year because they are the have you noticed that as well\n[laughter] I have not okay\nAnd uh because ... and so what we have always suggested that I don't sell any of this I don't give a crap but here's the map on it I have found that a Fifteen to twenty year level term policy locks in and gives you less expensive term insurance\nAnd when you invest the money directly into the mutual fund you don't have the extra fees and you get a better net of fees return\nThat makes sense and plus when you die with the Wii U L they're going to pay the face and keep your investment that's the worst part of it\nSo it's a horrible plane when you die [noise] but uh it's\nJust really bad while you're alive then it gets really worse when you die so what I Would suggest you do is get the proper amount of term insurance in place and then drop this garbage into your investing somewhere else does that make sense\nIt does I think the reason I haven't done that yet because of the surrender charges\nWell you're you've already bought that I mean you're just add that just right who got ripped and this also means you're probably need a new financial advisor\n'cause I think I think you have a life insurance salesman this calling himself a financial advisor\nIt's certainly possible [laughter]\nSo it sounds like it doesn't sound like most of the people in the mutual fund world don't solve this crap\nI say they will neutral funds and some of them sell term insurance too but most of them do selfish crap because nobody believes in this garbage except the life insurance people nobody anymore nobody there's no one in the financial arena in the financial spaces that says buy whole live life insurance or by cash value insurance on any kind of there isn't one out there\nThere's a just cause some math is just so horrible and you figured that part out but this guy's doing smoke and mirrors and hadn't a pea under a shell and keeping you confused as to teaching you\n'cause he knows if you've ever understood at that you drop it and him to probably\nSo I'm thinking you need a new advisor and you need to get some term insurance ...
