Eighteen very cool what are you gonna study\nUm possibly um [noise]\nPretty much anything that I can get in through and we're at ... I can\nI T yeah she said okay so you like technology yeah All right\nWell um I I think the first go before you go start your education process is you need to have an idea of what you're going to study because that will change the answer to your question that you asked okay so let's say for instance that you wanted to be a Web programmer\nAnd um I've got folk guys on my team that make 'em in\nExcess of a hundred thousand dollars well in excess of that that that are right ruby on rails code\nOkay not I'm not a bad career and uh that's an example of an ... type of thing okay in a Web programmer writing code now if you're\nGoing to do that you would not need and it would not be preferable for you to get a four year degree in information technology that's not necessary to do that\nYou would need to take some classes on how to code and you'd want to learn you know some of the basic IT things and so I Would probably direct you towards a vote tech type school a which is probably a two year degree\nWhile you're studying doing that and I would tell you to work your tail off in the technology field uh and if you can\nUh you know bring coffee for people who are doing code and just watch over their shoulder and learn from them and hang out from them and you're a new hobby is hanging out with people who are world class code riders voters then uh you know and you're taking some classes that'll get you and they're more than a four year degree will get you and then it's a lot cheaper\nBut it depends on what I mean when you say a tea but you could change your mind about I'm ... I'm not going to do I T I Want to go into business well then you might want to do a four year degree with a degree you know the specialization in marketing or finance or something like that and\nIn that case the answer would be different on how to pay for it here's the thing you want to number one carefully select what it is you want to study and that it makes your eyes light up when you talk about it you kind of smile down inside when you talk about doing this\nThing whenever the thing is okay you know once you've selected that then you decide how to study it if it's a four year degree if it's a two year vote tech degree\nOr am I going to go to a community college for two years and then go and those credits all transfer and then go to a regular school I mean for your school for two years to finish up or that kind of a thing\nCommunity college is a lot less expensive and you can get your basics out of the way for the first two years for\nA four year degree if you want to show the second thing once you've determined what you want to do and how you're going to do it then the second thing you do is\nCollege cost\nIs the number one cause of student loan that\nThey are and what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a huge to pick up truck both our transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nListen\nThe insurance world is full of gimmicks\nParticularly the life insurance world and any time you hear a gimmick it's almost always a good idea to run you know ... ears on the one you should have long term disability insurance everyone should have long\nTerm disability insurance if unless you are in in in an industry where each such high risk and you're just it's nutty it cost you ten thousand dollars a month to have it you can't because you know you're\nA high rise window washer or something like that right you can't get long term disability insurance but other than that everybody ought to have long term disability insurance for most of the time you can get it through your work and it's not that expensive if you have a long term disability insurance don't buy wave your\nPremium on your life insurance all\nThat does pay your life insurance premium for you if you become disabled so what is that it's a little tiny baby\nMiniature long term disability insurance policy salt is and it's a very expensive one very expensive\nIt'd be better off to use that same amount of money to increase the coverage of your existing long term disability or help you buy it if you haven't bought it yet and you heard me today and you need to get long term disability\nOr you go just like that again gimmicks they're everywhere particularly around the life insurance world and just buy insurance\nSo you know I don't want friends with that no one else ... with that I just wanted a hamburger no I don't want for us with your friends with it\nThere's always an upgrade there's always an up so stay away from it Benjamin is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Benjamin how're you\nDoing great how are you today better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] have a question for you my wife and I are currently working on baby step to uh we have one more quote unquote non mortgage debt to pay off what should we paid off by the end of the year then we'll have um [noise] ... it's technically is technically a mortgage because we bought a house to use it a rental\nSo that would be true\n[laughter] right so I didn't know of that for rental um if that's considered a debt and should be paid off as part of baby step to six\nOr we should move that not sick she mortgages are insects\nOkay even if it's not my home even if they're not your heart the rental even with all your home because it's ... it's typically you know in most people listening if they have a rental property is a large that and we're we're done with a baby\nStep to as we're getting rid of all the ... and or consumer debt sometimes are large but ah we're trying to get rid of all of that and that really gives you a huge amount of cash flow to do baby step three finish your emergency fund for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement and five kids college and six\nOh go ahead and pay the mortgage off or out on the rentals and our personal residents Emily is with us from Cincinnati Hi Emily how are you\nHow about yourself better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um my I mean I we sold our house and purchased a um fly rental flash home we buy horse farm and so we are renting out the horse farm facility but living in the house\nAnd renting out and paying our mortgage mortgage is very large now\nAnd I'm kind of panicking about that 'cause I don't like that at all [laughter] but my husband is working at it as a business and investment [noise] um and I want to pay it off really act that we've heard that we don't want to pay that off very yeah it got the tape that that ...

pay it messes up your whole world\nThat's right that's called ultra high risk should you pay their solve yes as soon as possible ladder salad one of the two this is an accident looking for a place to happen I Hope you get out of this intact\nBut I Would I Would do everything I can to reduce the debt as fast as I possibly could as quickly as you can get it paid off and then it's not a big deal if they don't pay the rent 'cause you don't you know you don't fall over dead but financially\nI mean you take five thousand bucks a month out of your life you got nothing left some bad bad situation so

Orlando news radio Ninety three point one WFL a and I heard radio\nBecause you're struggling with some self doubt but I Want to put you on the spot tell me what do you do\nSo what have you always just done well maybe it was a subject became easy to you it's a task that people have said Katie are really good at that I Know there's an answer you do to say it\nOn [laughter] well I I did well in school mhm I like now um and I've always done well with children you know I did the air and things like that and I feel like though their strength but not necessarily complimentary I guess but\nWell but there's a string was math so what about math what were you good at with ... it's the solving problems it came this idea of how you solve a math problem very difficult for me Christie I mean I'm not kidding I'm terrible at math my brains are wired in a way to be able to break in algebra problem down but Katie you are good at solving problems correct\nCorrect All right so that is a starting point now what work have you ever dreamed about doing or you just wonder if this would be amazing if I could do this at some point in your life you wondered about something what'd you wonder about\nWhen I was a kid I wondered about no rocket ship than you know getting into space and you know what would it take to get them up and you know the whole NAFTA mhm idea when I when I was a kid was really fascinating\nOkay so here's what we've got we're not going to solve it on this call but Katie here's what got you got a starting point to go take those homework questions I gave you the people that know you and get the answers and here's what you're going to find\nYou're going to find that there are some patterns and there are some themes that continue to develop so there's already Christie a tie between being good in math and being fascinated by rockets\nBecause every NASA person I've met a lot of men about four or five every one a very good in math and science so you're beginning to develop some themes here and you're beginning to see some pattern now for you you have a very specific challenge you need to work ideally from home so this is on line work\nThis maybe are not available to you and an online forum but the reality is is that you begin to discover different jobs that you would enjoy because it allows you to do things that you're good at like ... like the science like the problem solving and then you begin to see things waste I could I enjoy that because I'm good at it but I Know you run into this a lot\nYou know here's the thing Katie I just want to speak to you from mom to mom\nIt's so easy to lose herself and mother had like I hear that voice and you of like I don't know I felt like I've lost myself it's so easy to become consumed with your kids can seem to supporting your spouse it's so easy to do that but actually encourage exactly like Ken's that you're still in there\nYou're still in there you're you're things that make you come alive does things that you were good at are still good at and maybe have just\nLost touch with are still in there and so it's going to take a little bit of suffer flexing and discovery just like Ken said oh I heard you that I I wrote in my book Business Week five e questions that help you know your strengths them in a given the really quickly what do you enjoy\nWhere do you sell what do others encourage any what gives you energy\nAnd what types of things come effort less to you and your answers to some of those questions will start to lead you in the direction of your strengths exactly like can talk about and you can ask other people or what the you know what what are the patterns of what people say hey you're so good at that are man you ought to get to do that for a living you know what are the things where you excel in relation to other people just like Ken said what are you good at I Know you're good at things and so\nSometimes we get really overwhelmed with identifying are trying to get all squirming like oh I just wanna be humble I'm not good at anything\nBut you know what if God made you good at something Katie own it and lean into that and I think as you start to explore that those questions that ... talking to people and just remembering and having confidence you are still in there\nEven though you love this kid's like crazy uh you're still in there and you can lean into those things that make you light up and I know you will and I'm proud of him excited for you because it's at the beginning of that discovery thing can was just talking about\nYou know there's a lot of doubt there because you hurt in her story a lot of people listening and under you experiences with with your tribe\nShe supported her husband she did everything to help him\nAnd what happens is

[noise]\nAll right we're going to get to your business questions your career questions you're stuck or you're confused scared got an idea you're ready to launch but needs some advice from Christie we're here for you triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Katie who's on the line and St Paul Minnesota Katie how can we\nSay hey can I yeah I'm On a secret\nYou know try to scare you might happen I mean I got married problem I'm married three kids I work uh about four to five job primary in the architecture field ...\nAnd ... and their primary breadwinner right now and they cited and about what I Do my passion architecture and very ... my ... and however I have no idea how long I can barely keep up with this ... about a year and a half five and working at about sixty hours a week which is\nA lot for me to the housing you know a husband and my life about what you know but you'd recommend I can do I don't burn out but I you know we didn't want to pursue after being there and played architect yeah hopefully in the near future\nLet me ask you a couple of quick questions here I'm ... years ease our league contract jobs four to five of them if I understood you quickly you got four to five that you're spending like played all in architecture is that right\nSo one of them than on is a forty hour salary job on the other three are yeah contract project by project hourly from here you know long distance [laughter]\nOkay so the reason I'm asking this is a it it'll it'll color or advice a little bit uh what happens if you back off do you have to work sixty hours to make a certain number for you all to be comfortable with that what your reality is\nSo right now he asked my husband will be returning to work and then at the beginning of next year we had to pay that they only had a baby about a year and a half ago and so our financial situation will change at ... kind of gang Uri but right now yeah kind of out of the beast at work I have to\nAnd just to clarify for Christian I the ideal dream is for you have your own architecture firms that right\nCorrect the only self employed\nOkay and you want to know best path to get their correct okay I'm going to say one quick thing let you go here's the deal hang on until the hubby gets back you know what I mean you got to hang on and you can do it here we are in October first years coming right now you have to do it so I think that motivation just hang in there and of course he's gonna were well known about the plan to get their\nQuick quick question Katie that contract jobs you're doing in addition to the fulltime salary job or those things you're running independently already or do they go through the main company was paying your salary\nSo they're different companies okay I'm not clear yet two of them are kind of action I own projects I work on out here in Minnesota the other one is there a company I used to work four years ago that you contract court for\nPerfect okay they don't have that yeah\nThe the reason I'm asking is because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part\nTo validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can run this whole thing without having a boss that kind of back me and you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited in Haiti because you're just going to do more of what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken that\nAnd we we have them on a list and\nWe have a bind name list we know who these people are and we know things about them and we use that information to identify exactly who is the most vulnerable and by that I mean ... who's most likely to die on the streets next if we don't get them help and we that's how we prioritize our limited resources\nWho's the most vulnerable on the streets with almost always is synonymous with who's the most expensive to the public dollars yeah and so it's a win win either way um\nAnd so we have we call that the coordinated entry system and we have a list of people who are chronically homeless than we have a list of literally homeless families and we have lists of\nA homeless veterans and we work on this list and we identify the most vulnerable and then we take the ... and we tie them linked them to available when there's availability among services and availability for housing support and then try and find a landlord who's willing to work with them and um\nAnd so how how do you mark the ... I think you have a housing located or is that right I mean I tell us how you find open units in such a tight market we\nBag really well I don't have a lot of presentations go you know speaking to realtors groups and other landlord associations investors groups\nAre going out knocking on doors chasing down signs you know a taken leads from other community members and taken leads for some of the clients themselves who were out who were also trying to help find housing that they can live and\nGo and talk to those landlords and talk to them about the benefits of participating in our program that we're going to be able to but they the rents pretty solid they're going to the rent\nIs let's talk about let's do a little\nInvitation here on a mayor of for both if you're a landlord or or if you'd know of available house in um tell us why you would be a really good idea to think about uh being open to a permanent supportive housing folks\nIf your landlord that that works at a low income families and individuals then um you know that that can be tough work and part of part of what we bring to the table is again we've got guaranteed rent\n'em so you're going to get paid your rent we've got assistance with families to help them and individuals to help them with their deposits and those types of things but these families and individuals also become a case managers and so it's not a puts in my in the unit and never talk to them again and you're ... you're responsible", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "03"}
