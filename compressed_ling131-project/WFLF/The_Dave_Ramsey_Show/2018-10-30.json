lives my personal professional wise and I'm I'm also in the process of building a defense contractor and building up a business you know within that\nMy question is are the same personal professor ... professional lives I'm able to be forklift it over to business wise is that it is that a good way to make a foundation for business um mission statement\nYes um it directly or indirectly your your business your career mission statement as a subset of you\nWrite gotten him so you've got a personal reasons for a living or why what is it um what's my no but what caused me to nobility right what\nWhat am I doing this for one of ultimately and we know it's not just power money okay the reason we're piling up money is what you know and what are we going to do with it what is that we're trying to accomplish that your personal thing and then a subset of that is your\nYour why in the different areas of your life the reason for your your mission statement show yeah you'd have a a personal mission statement so to speak um that that attaches to who you are and and then your career your marriage your parenting your\nPhysical activity uh your intellectual growth your spiritual growth are all subsets of that down\nAnd so you create a holistic look at things but no they're not compartmentalized or department allies like you don't count at work [laughter] saying you know it definitely forklifts a over a in other words my personal\nDrive is underneath of this one this organization's mission statement and wise and reasons for doing things you know um and so\nYeah it's an easy question I don't ... Noreen by asked that but that's that's my view on it um and of course my opinions are always worth what you pay for it but ah it just seems to me if you had a\nBusiness reason for being that was different than your personal reason for being\nOr was not somehow connected it would be income grew it really does that make sense absolutely I mean it would be at cross purposes with each other if they weren't somehow running can ruin or parallel or subset or something but in ... the way I visualize what the easiest for me a subset\nThat make sense it does thank you very much thanks for

uh two years ago my family was there and you're lobby and we did a debt free screen and a and then I feel like we've really been able to you know a clear outfit opened up for our income to double in and out of really positive spiritual or you know direction sort of opened up to a\nUm and those are you know that those things but we really thought it was sort of a recovery is opening up because we are starting to do things right and really what I Do now is that he was preparing to throw it was what was about to come which is that we have a we have three boys the youngest is ten months\nUm ending up with a you know six thousand square foot home I'm going to only four twenty happy and and also the value of the home at that time what would be somewhere in the upper nine hundred to a million dollars [noise]\nWhat is the ah if I go home so for ... and within a two or three block area of your house\nAbout the typical homes and there's not really a typical home in our area it's all over the place because the tours property there's you know Fifteen hundred square foot home and then there's also three million dollar homes across the street so I come from my home is about four four ten or twenty\nYeah that wasn't when I was asking I was trying to determine if you're trying to over build the neighborhoods doesn't sound like a no causes scenario not an area that's got this wide diverse a price range and that doesn't mean it goes I don't want you get building nine hundred thousand dollar home on a six hundred thousand dollar street\nRight you know and I couldn't get out and we do have a to point three million dollar home just throw it around the corner and then there's an eight hundred and Seventy catty corner to where I Am at you know when does the baby ... baby it'll do in the end of January\nOkay well sure when it started before then\n[laughter] no no we're or have you go and play\nHave you got some plans for our own yet\n[laughter] yeah I I've been working on that with an architect um were were you know running around what we're ... we want to do but or just um you know I've never spoken with any expert about this and I'm not sure if\nThis was a building you know I mean there's two or three factors one is um you don't want to rebuild the neighborhood we address that too is you want to seek in your family handle you know construction noise\nFor a whatever time it takes you to put this thing up shouldn't be a nine day project may be so two or three months can they put up with that well they ought to be able to ... that's what we're going to do 'cause moving is more disruptive\nThan that by and this project that we are considering doing just because of the the industry that I man or thinking of going to be more like a fix one project so I mean we're we're considering adding almost four thousand square feet to the home\nOh wow you're just almost rebuilding another home\nWe had to basically tripling the size of the home now you know\nUh so you're going to end up mortgage when you're done then\nWhy a bigger mortgage or maybe I think we're going to end up somewhere in the four twenty four thirty\nAnd what's your house ...\nHousehold income my my wife makes about ... about fifty five\nSix grand a month and I'm self employed so very that can go from ... last year last year we were I was somewhere in the two twenty area\nOkay well you got to worry about her income and you can afford a mortgage on a Fifteen year fixed when you're done but basically what you're going to be doing here is getting a construction\nLoan and then you're going to um reset the construction alone in a permanent mortgage is almost like you're building a house\nCorrect\nAnd you can email you when you're done you need a fully you need a regular\nFifteen year fixed rate mortgage or the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay and if that's where you're going to end up and you've got a process to get there then yes I Would do that um I don't see any problem with it it's just a massive project on your living next door to it um yeah that probably is going to take six months um\nMost of the time when I think of an addition I don't think about four thousand ... the force I was referred addition to a Nineteen hundred square foot house\nGinger is with us in tech Dana Hi ginger how are you\nI'm doing right good how can I help\nI don't want to now in my husband and I we have work constantly are ... ... and we finally paid off our market here on our cars everything everything we own our great we have so much I'm\nStill working that we are we have been trying our security ... are a ... a year and me I'm a ... year how my ...\nAnd I think now we have and play well now last night we had been saying all that entertaining mhm flash not\nTo not get hit by we had been putting our income that we weren't at saving living off of the security okay my question to you and when our retirement or I was there I mean\nI'm Out mhm and what I think it would be fine how are you here we are in my house and carry\nWhy when he got much retiring and up next year\nYou know how old are you ... how old are you I'm sixty six seven okay and how much do you have in your ...\nOkay and the one we don't have a hundred and twenty out in our next egg when he had arrived at another hundred out\nMhm okay that's two hundred and twenty thousand and uh just round numbers I mean if you made 'em ten percent on there'll be twenty two thousand dollars a year\nOkay okay I figured\nYou know and so if you invest and we did that if you invested in it did that and then you add your Social Security too\nThat um I mean you're not going to be living lavishly uh I mean you you have\nA few thousand dollars a month political but I mean you got Fifteen hundred Eighteen hundred bucks a month coming up this money is what we're talking about here and um and plus your Social Security and if you can live on those numbers\nThen you can retire if you want to but a ... that's not going to be an easy I mean it's not going to be retiring and luxury uh but you shouldn't have fairly low expenses because everything's paid off so that's good\nUm I Love for you to have another hundred in there anyway but if you work a little bit more and knock it out that might be up not be a bad thing but if you guys are just you know you're done and you want to you want to live on that that's fine but I Would not set up a thing where I'm draining down\nThat two hundred and twenty systematically just to retire now because that's there's an end to that game called hunger and I don't want to get there\nYou don't want to destroy this do so you just live off the gold and eggs only so whatever you know you sit down with your investment professionals you don't have one sit down with one of our smart buster pros and talk about investing there's two hundred and twenty thousand in a way that you do that creates an income that you can live off of that plus your Social Security\nAnd if you can do that then you're in a position to do it\nAnd um but again it's not going to be um a a a\nA luxurious retirement you're not traveling the world and\nUh you know and that kind of stuff on this income um but but but\nI think you can do it it's just a matter are you willing to live that frugally\nTend to put your budget together and say these are the numbers and I'm going to live on less than this and that's the only way we can retire and then again sit down with a smart best are pro clicks Mart best or they Ramsey
