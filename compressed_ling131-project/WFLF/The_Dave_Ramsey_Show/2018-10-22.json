Google Plus never amounted to much of anything but they did have some people who signed up and a half million people private information was lost so rather than things that they shut down the platform or not it wasn't on purpose of course but the glitch in their software was there for nearly three years\nThat nobody's reported being an identity theft victim yet and it may be a matter of time before it's determine whether it be exposed data will be used against somebody but for Google it was enough to shut\nDown Google Plus band is just another example of how much personal data is available online\nAnd how hard it is to make sure your data is protected and we we keep circling back to this but folks it really is the case lifelike is the answer to this\nIdentity theft as a crime that most people are unaware when it's happened to it can be months before your stolen data is used [noise] but when it is is when having lifelike counts because they spotted\nWay ... you become a life like

school guy yeah cool yeah\nWell the other thing you can do is if you don't do that and you graduate from high school are you still can go to community college about a third the cost of the typical in state college four year college\nAnd the air for two years if you don't have your first few years just up studies out of the way 'cause most of that just core stuff anyway and and you just make sure

residential home builder\nAnd product marketing\nVery good good for you so what kind of debt was the dreaded thirty thousand ...\nPretty equally divided between student loans and in both of our cars okay and we want to mention that in that Thirteen months we had to hit pause and our debt snowball twice and three months into it on fourth of July\nOr I or I unfortunately was celebrating a little too much and uh apparently I had appendicitis and I thought it was more than something different so I thought it was bad food\nAnd having a pet is I just had to get my appendix removed so that put us on a screeching halt yeah wow yeah so that was an emergency surgery that we had to cash so I mean we did but everything on pay that off started up again we're back at it filling out our our thermometer\nAnd six months later lucky man had kidney stones so yeah so I had the double whammy yeah the only thing that didn't go as the gall bladder I'm\nUnder this word on greater burden than what I Know\n[laughter] I Know that a lot\nMore efficiency appendectomy you almost ward area oh my goodness\nAnd it happened the kidney stone last two months and the new year so we had to start over that ad hoc sell the but it can be weren't stressed out because we knew how much we can pass you know not so\nLong have you been married five years on ah the December the first so what happened that put you on this journey Thirteen months ago\nWe had our little guy he's too right now that I had just gone back to work some attorney lease and we always plan of big annual trip and so\nHaving him we thought oh we'll go to Disney cruise or something and\nI are planning that trap and then I kind of stressed out because we only had maybe three thousand savings and loan just didn't sound right\nAnd we knew that you are his parents actually given us I think there's a ... when we got engaged okay Manhattan but it just didn't click back then and then watch them no no well as a senior we watch we watch them that we stopped at a ... and just didn't stick to it on a\nCell and I knew that you went on line found that you had an ad and I had about an hour and a half hour commute each way to work\nNow I listen to your pod cast than I Am yeah I heard\nYou tell a capital that was on base that too that they're ... they can't go on vacations and that's when it's ... like we can't do any of that stuff we need to really buckle down and pass our debt so that's when I came home to him and tell them no vacations we're going to get started to which he was really excited to hear all the wrong side of\nA I was thinking dang a payout payoff dead or go golfing and Florida Keys or something I'm like\nOh [laughter] our choice I guess is that I I Am but the good news is you're out of debt now and I'm like no one else later you can ... it was like no one is now what do you tell people to key to getting out of that is you're paid off thirty thousand and Thirteen much\nFor me at that budget sticking to the budget bill budget that we never and stuck to it through the ... that always change we knew we had or can we do that in spontaneous spending\nAs a planning the for each month happened and loves the every dollar happy that all the time cool and so yeah just sticking to that budget and planning ahead and just delaying send the air and things that you'd want and just waiting on them\nYeah and for for me I Would say it's just you know everybody's different in the way that they approach\nA this debt free journey Lindsey over here she's an excel guru in geek in loves to see a split out I'm a put a thermometer up there and let me hold her in the whole thing and get me to the top ah and I go more goals driven in that way but we do about it I'm going to\nFar but on the refrigerator right where we are on the refrigerator so that everybody can see that we're in that it's kinda like you know when you're a\nEither way you do have a higher to duck double with a nature say and they lower premium as a result\nBut you'll have to just find out what they're offering do they have a hundred percent pay after the ... um and if they do and you're healthy or you're sick either one it comes out better kind of in the middle it doesn't necessarily come out better\nBut if you're close to the doctor will every year and then they pick up a hundred percent that's a great deal if you got like a chronic illness and or if you're hardly ever sick Ramsey is knock on wood we hardly ever\nEnd up at the dock then in that case obviously we save a lot of money because I'm only pay what comes out of our pocket and we never go to the doctor ... so we just end up with a cheaper premium is what ends up with us\nAnd the ability to put money into the health savings account which creates a tax deductible account and you can use that money of course to meet your ducked ... or any other\nHealth issues that you want to cover as you go along so good question good to talk to you Annette thank you for calling in Dennis is one of those done is is in Rochester, Minnesota I don't show are you\nWilling or seltzer\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] [noise] well my wife and I started your program back you know and I'm Wondering where are where are where they just have to\nUm we have some whole life life you're sure policies um each of our parents took out like I'm sure it's about us when we were younger and we still have those policies Miller we got married we each took out a policy for the whole life\nUm the cash value on the policy is about ... thousand dollars mhm and we were wondering if we should cash out the policy is after getting a her policy\nAnd use that money to put into or that snowball\nAbsolutely\nYeah they're horrible product they're just um you know the whole life has the payday lenders in the middle class I mean it just as a ... a ridiculously low rate of return on your money and the worst part is when you die they only pay the face value the policy they don't pay the the cash value also\nWhich means the extra money you pay to build up savings in their disappears death\nThey keep your money you know and so it's just a bad bad product the math on it is horrendous and you're you're much better off to buy inexpensive term insurance and do your investing anywhere except in a life insurance product and so\nThat's what I that's what I have done for you know Thirty years\n\nThere'd be a tax implications on the money are we pulled out\nVery doubtful and the reason is is that your basis in a cash value policy for tax purposes\nThe the in other words what you paid into it is everything you paid into it throughout the entire time the policy has been open so if you add up all the premiums that you've ever paid you don't even get that much out and so you really end up with a law she can't ride the law but you end up with having put more into it\nThen you get out so there is no game now yes um and it happens about five percent of the time with an old with a very very old whole life policy\nThere it is possible that the cash value is greater than was paid in which you would only pay taxes on the difference and so you know you use the figure eleven thousand so if you if you found out that the all the premiums added up to only ten thousand than you'd pay taxes on the one thousand dollar difference will be still do it\nRight\nThere in Ninety five percent of the time Ninety eight percent of the time they lose money 'cause they suck you don't make money you know and so you end up losing money on the transaction and of course that's not a taxable event when you lose money no question about that Catherine is with us in Danbury, Connecticut Hi Katherine how are you\nI'm doing good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nUh my husband and I just got married in August and we're combining our finances and everything else [noise]\nUm and we're working on paying off all I think that we get paid off his car like three days ago hey hey yeah have nine should be paid off by the end of this year which is great\nAnd the next thing we're going to tackle something I'm I'm April ... paper on 'em and then after that guy I can tell the\nMarkets that remain that way planning on saving up to three to six months of Americans say fine but we're not sure how much we can save\nWhere it to income family obviously we have no kids on but if both at my tenants leads rental property fat out require like a really different amount and then if I have to remember how we're trying to figure out how much a fair shake hands\nWell given that you have two properties that can have stuff break down on them um you could set up in your rental accounts some savings just to cover the rental issues a vacancy or repair I assume you keep a separate account free rentals do not\nGet much out of work that\nOkay I Would I Would open up a separate checking account just for the rentals and put pay all the bills associate with rentals out of that account only and then um and of course by the payments out of there with the ... in there and then you can tell if you're making money on the rental cars what's left in the account as your profit right\nRight that's a taxable a that's a portion is going to be taxed bleach here uh because everything else is going to be the duck the ball all the expenses associated with it and you can keep some money in that account\nTo cover vacancies a or to cover repairs and I might keep that did it that way as separate from my emergency fund and then 'cause that's like a business over on the side it's like a small business right on okay\nAnd then I'll but then at home I Would have three to six months of expenses there not counting the rentals\nUm because I got the rentals covered in the rental account than you're okay over there um and you know if you've got two incomes and you're pretty stable it sounds like you're doing really well and you're paying attention you might be okay with the three months out of the three to six months of household expenses measure\nKnown as your game plan and and and so forth some very good question thanks for joining us Joe's in Austin, Texas Hi Joe I'm short on time go straight to your question\nDave I'm I have a ... year one year old\nAnd I was wanting to get your advice on how to um pay for his features so we have a five twenty nine plant fed up and he's been getting money I'm from birthdays and I'm I'm you know other holiday\nAnd I was willing to know how what we should do with that money and how can we teach him financial responsibility as he gets older\nCool well good for you what a great that question yeah you just um yeah I Would have the money inside the five twenty nine invested in good growth stocks mutual funds are of course a five twenty nine is used for college\nAnd so we're going to teach him that his college money as they were showing that money as he gets older and he didn't need to understand that it four years old don't don't worry about that but then there's for things you teach a kid about money for things we all need to learn about\nMoney number one is worse [noise] number 'cause that's where money comes from a number two is giving number three is saving and number four is wise spending and you teach them to work age appropriate when they're three we don't send the salt mines and pay Lawrence he come to work to give to save and to spin\nThe singer copy of our number one best selling book the more money smart kids\nWhich are show you about your kid to handle money by Radio Free rooms they hold on I'll send you out a copy of that this is Jeff\nHey guys this is James child's producer Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on six hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you had to Dave Ramsey dot com slash show\nOne works as hard as business owners your time is priceless because your work is your passion one of the things that can suck a lot of your time is quarterly taxes\nI'm Talking about all the book keeping that no one warn you about in fact business owners been nearly a hundred and twenty hours on their taxes that equals up to three weeks that you are doing what you set out to do in the first place\nHow much business are you missing out on all for what to be stressed out every quarter and still uncertain on whether or not you're doing them ride\nPeople hire you for an expertise your skill and you need to hire people\nKids and a ... in you know they're all grown now thank you Jesus but um so but they they uh if it was me in your situation and I've been in your situation or pretty close anyway um I Would write a check today and be debt free\nAnd then I again to Bill Maher emergency fund\nAnd we'll have my emergency fund a three to six months which Spencers then that will begin to build a down payment\nIf it starts looking like that we need to rent for a year or somewhere to have our sanity and not be living with the inlaws forever and ever on men um and take a break from that and get your own place and rent for a year while you're save up your down payment there's no sense in that and\nSo I honestly we probably would do that\nBut we are people we shot and I figured out were very generous and a lot of ways but we're not generous for people living with us or more people we just don't do that well we got friends who are just moving the missionary with them they just moving so and so I wasn't all that we can't do it we just were not work that way\nAnd we're we're generous otherwise but we don't have that ability so honestly when I just just just us I'm not saying you I'm not saying you're bad for her and I'm just saying we couldn't do what you're doing\nFor very long it'd be for a very short window out of sheer reaching desperation and then we would go get some kind of little rental and have our own little life until we could save up a down payment but you know maybe you can do that maybe you can hang out there that long but if your debt free today and you land a job tomorrow what do you think you're going to be making\n[noise] well I'm I'm hoping in somewhere in the fifty
