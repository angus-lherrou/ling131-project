I started listening to it\nAnd I think that turning point for me was when I got to the point about the debt snowball and lifting your debt\nBecause up until that point I had been just doing everything they tried to avoid thinking about it it was stressful I just I didn't even want to it you know deal with it and I logged on and I saw that in the past three years I had been pain about Thirteen thousand dollars a year\nAnd about Fifteen thousand dollars a year it was occurring in interest every year so I really wasn't even making a debt and and the student loans and so I knew something needed to change I Need to get serious especially being in my late twenties at the time and single\nI didn't want to have this burden looming over my head for the next decade or two and certainly if I got married or had a family in the future I didn't want to bring that burden into that\nWilliam paid off a ridiculous amount of that with a ridiculously wonderful income show you hum wow\nOkay so you you finished residency\nBan really about a year went by before you started this right yeah roughly year okay where did you come straight out and go into ER yeah yeah Microsoft has emergency medicine so you were making bucks already ... but then you just when you shut down to the map on this you went oh I can do this\nYeah I just realized that something absolutely needed to change because I just I couldn't live like that anymore\nWow look at you and just dumb and you're just dove in now do you take a lot of extra time at a yard to in order to get the ... one of the ... you know our position makes\nSo I actually went to my boss and asked if I could work all night shift and the ER and I did that for the entire twenties too much twenty months because it paid significantly more to work nights\nDown is it's it's that Governor double and uh it's about twenty percent more an hour and a twenty percent ... right but wow so you're really sacrifice to get this done people think you were losing your mind I mean your family your doctor your really enjoy your life I mean\nYeah the one thing I heard a lot of was in regards to buying a new car because I was still driving a used car for medical school at that point like being how are you did it right and so my friends and family were telling me you know you're crazy you can afford a new car you can afford a car payment and I would tell them\nNo I really just want to save and I'll buy my ex former cash and I'll probably be a used car and they thought I was not\nYeah well you you wonder I Know I mean you're my foreign fishing down you know I mean pretty much [laughter]\nBut it doesn't ... story very well done thank you very well done\nWell you did exactly what I Try to get doctors to most dogs come out and go\nFinally worked all this time I've gone to school my whole break in life mhm I deserve a new house in a new car I deserve a trip and they spend money like water you've seen them do it oh yeah definitely and I it's craziness did all you do would you use kept living longer broke college student\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years out because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important stuff that I thought you know\nNow I ... I mean you make three hundred four hundred five hundred wherever you make it ... you're going to be unbelievably will hit so you said your how thirty thirty one thirty one oh\nThat's because you haven't worked very hard at it number one\nBut number two when you go to business ... years of military you ought to be you ought to be they belong to something up I don't know if you can wind up in that particular town or where it is you know what what it is you're wanting to do but you need a plant on your obviously have a great military retirement coming out right\nIt'd be OK how open electric bill\nOkay All right and uh does your wife work outside the home yes you go to church\nOkay she'll between her income and your military retirement the households not going to fold up\nNo not at all it would be about twenty two about that we have out here\nYeah and that's what if you don't work so why do you need to save money oh\nJust a concern with ... and living a little a little more money now we're trying to get our budget and everything under control and I just want to make sure that\n... what I understood as I get my budget under Seventy five thousand between now and then and that would get my career lined up between now and then you got plenty of time here that yeah I just I don't I don't want I mean you can't save up enough to not deal with those two issues agreed\n'cause you'll burn through whatever it is if you never go back to work and you always been more than the Seventy five\nNo matter how much you're safe object to hundred grand you burn through an eventually you know very shy we we have to we have to go ahead and address those issues so let's just address from now but again thank you for your service we appreciate it and\nSo yeah I get my career lined up and I get my budget lined up under Seventy five thousand and that takes the pressure off of getting the career\nWound up exactly but uh and so if it takes you a year even your your okay it's not your good long term plan but no I I think I'd go ahead and work on getting my debts paid off now and build your emergency fund whatever you do well let's keep working your debt snowball keep working your baby steps get their career lined up that's what I Would do\nBrian is in Atlanta Hi Ryan how're you\nDoing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nTrying to question on [noise] investing so I guess the short overview um I'm thirty and my wife's thirty three\nA combined income right now about one Seventy five ... I'm only debt is mortgage I'm a car payment and then I'm a little bit of student loan that we've got the cash to pay it off a which we're I'm about to go at the end it off the U.S pay\n'em even after that we can get at least six months of [noise]\nUm you know emergency expensive setback emergency fund um I've got four one K. and a pension she has four one K. and profit sharing and my main question is what are the extra income every month they\nShould be so good at something that strictly tied retirement which is what we have a lot of orange it'd be better to put that into something more accessible like a like a managed a like us we have a managed fund that can be accessed prior to retirement if if need be\nYou know we call those bridge funds um\n... at some point I Would go there but I think you've got some cleaning up to do y'all been pretty sloppy you make a lot of money to be as broke as you are\nUm how long have you been making that kind of money on\nThe last couple of years okay\nIt's it's it's time to clean up the rest of this mess then yeah let's rides from checks today and pay off student loan the car you got to pay off both of them\nDo yeah good let's do that today and then you need to have your emergency fond of three to six months of expenses not income three to six months of expenses and uh that's what\nWe call taken you through baby step three which lays the foundation for a solid financial plan your debt free and you have your rainy day fund except your home okay then we move on to what we call baby steps for five and six do you have children\nBut right now okay\nThen ah we would baby steps for is Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement that's not much with what you guys make\nWhat it's a good start and it's not going to keep you from retiring and doing the right stuff later which I'm going to come back to and actually do what you want to do but I'm going to do it in the right order\nUm [noise] once you're doing that then maybe step five is kids college that does not apply here baby steps six pay off your house or lamb or reach over knock the house out beyond that which is has the same effect\nTo your net worth the bridge loan does because I have in your home paid off frees you up in ... to need a lot less income\nTo retire before you can access the retirement funds okay now then once the house is paid off which really do how much do you own your home\nAll of a two eighty\nOkay if you do what I'm Talking about here probably in about five years maybe seven before you're forty your house is going to bite off\nAnd by then you're probably making two two and a quarter if you're on a normal career track maybe even more okay so your income is increasing your debt one hundred percent debt free before you're forty now we can do a lot of stuff\nAnd I have a single parent in the world mathematically with one Seventy five two and a quarter or whatever it is coming in\nNow you max out retirement and you build other wealth which will have this effect you're looking for of what we call the ... bridge financing his or bridge savings or bridge investing bridge between age fifty two and\nYou know if you wanted to have enough to to do some stuff with before then but the whole idea of being that we're going to build wealth\nAs a result of having no payments\nTo go with your fabulous income uh your most powerful wealth building tool is your income we've just finished a study here that Chris Hogan is doing a book on I'm of the largest study of millionaires ever done and what we find is as they pay off their home in an average of ten point two years\nMost of them do not make as much as you make\nThe vast majority of millionaires don't make as much as you make\n'em and then they steadily invest in there for one k.'s and once that's maxed out they do other investing in just good mutual funds or by some real estate that you pay cash for the income producing or something like that where you've got some other moneys that you've got access to\nThat is not return not all tied up in retirement\nAnd so you're thinking right I just put it to the back of a line as to the front of the line on when you're going to get to it\nUm and you'll get there faster if you'll go the way I'm Talking about in the way you're talking about in clean up this mass you make too much money to be something really stupid

it's not as expensive I Know California real estate's expensive I understand I'm In ... in and out of California in and out of Manhattan all the time I understand these markets I Know the markets but I mean it's almost impossible to live on the island of Manhattan unless you're making a hundred dollars a year\nUm we just cannot afford the rent even on a studio apartment and so that's what you're facing in your market there uh and then the you know we're talking about this in San Fran the other day when I was over there you you cannot afford to live in Silicon valley\nUnless you make substantial money and so I mean so there's and Silicon Valley as a result as having a real problem staffing service type jobs\nBecause nobody the service type jobs for typical service type income can afford to live there and so you run into all kinds of people are being busted him to do\nLabor type jobs and are in them because they can't afford to live in Silicon valley and that's that's just a

presenting that really connected didn't it\nThank you yes it uh it was exciting to see people jot down some of the things we were talking about that practically allow them to get where they want to be you know that I mean we can all envision a mountain top\nBut then it gets real scary when we started thinking about how do I scale that mountain top end this we talked a lot about the proximity principal and gave people some ideas on the right people to be around and and the right places that need to be in\nBecause if you want to do something to be in the proximity of that\nThing is it here it is the proximity principle simply says in order to do what I Want to do you feel like\nThat I've got to be around people who are doing that and in places where that is happening so think about that when I'm Around the right people they all point to the to the right places and then when I go in those places and were specifically looking for three things in the right places where I can learn or I can do and where I can connect\nAnd Dave when I'm In the right places I inevitably going to be more of the right people and so it becomes this cyclical process that is so profoundly simple\nIt should demystify the path to getting where I Want to go you're an example and here's what's great about this no matter how successful you get your always practicing the proximity principle you're continuously looking to get around the right people whether it be for personal reasons are professional reasons you like to sit down billionaires you want to learn things about these men and women [noise]\nYou know and you're constantly thinking about what are the places I Need to be an where's Ramsey solutions need to be this is a very simple principle that no matter where you're at in life if you want to get somewhere you have to practice proximity\nYou know I've noticed that happening here in our little ... outside of Nashville Franklin, Tennessee has has ended up becoming a melting pot for people who write\n... in the self improvement Space Center ... who ah who speak and the self improvement space\nI mean I've been here all along a Mike Hi it a ... has been in the ... a friend of mine down the road Donald Miller moved here in the last couple of years in from Oregon ... from the ... moved here about the time that book took off there's probably a handful of others that I'm just not even thinking mentioning right now\nUm but a ... a lot of movement and it just seems to be this thing happening\nAnd and it's like an almost like an artist community like Asheville North Carolina very much an art community now and you get around things and the people\nAnd the places that something's happening and then you have a better chance of pulling it off and it's not that the Donald Miller or Dave Ramsey or Mike Hi it in Iraq they're already in every day we certainly don't but we all know each other and we've all interacted\nWe've all helped each other that's one way or another ah sometimes it's just a drop by nothing real fancy but it is a very much all within about five miles of each other you know as an example\nYeah it it it here's what happens when you get around like minded people\nThen there is a natural\nA force if you will it's almost magnetic\nThat they are going to pull you into their or of a little bit just by their example and you you know there there is a guy that you and I both admire I never had the chance to meet him\nCharles tremendous Jones you know it's a famous saying that said you know who you are five years from now is largely dependent on the books you read and the people you meet and we've also heard the age old colonialism that nobody can attribute it to anybody but it's not\nWhat you know it's who you know who you know so again what we've done here on the show with was helping people try to\nDemystify or take away the fear of getting where they want to go is by showing them this is a process is not going to happen overnight it might take you four years of putting yourself in proximity to the right person\nFor me to have you know my story you watched it from afar eight years\nEight years of small itty bitty baby steps\nAre of putting myself around the right people and in the right places doing the hard work learning being humble hustling staying hungry and then you get an opportunity at some point everybody's story is
