of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who's pass through the Supreme Court appears to be assured after two more senators say they'll vote to confirm the judge\nAnd then he backed down said oh no never mind going public private anymore and so all you did was artificially inflate the share price at least that's how to interpret it by the SEC so they sued him a bow ironically enough within forty eight hours they had settled with him he lost his chairmanship uh they uh he he was able to remain CEO which is fascinating\nAnd he agreed to pay a twenty million dollar fine and Tesla had to pay a twenty million dollar fine as well\nUh so really the relationship with the SEC or any after you see\nIt can be quite ... if you are a highly successful company that's the way it's been for years I Know some of your prayer purists don't want to hear it that's how it works that's how they get a lot of their funding if you think the government is solely funding this stuff you're you're on another planet a\nNext next a bit of news GE fired their CEO and hired a new one now this might not mean a whole bunch of ... uh uh as much except for the fact that last Thursday GE was the topic of conversation for our boardroom battles I had people in here that we went to the mat\nTalking about the lousy leadership of G E for a company that has been a staple an American icon\nFor a you know over a hundred years for for the first time in a hundred and Seventeen years they lost certain status on the on the on the Dow Jones industrial average and a number of other things\nAre ... and the Gulf going from four hundred billion dollars to do a lot less than a hundred billion dollars in revenue selling off Thomas Edison's light bulb division I mean you are getting desperate when you were at that point and it's a lack of leadership it's a lack of unity it's a lack of ... bringing on the right leaders and then having the right leader to create the vision to lead leaders\nSo we just blistered them on the border battles and kind of gives them ideas and lo and behold uh we get the news that GE fires their CEO and of course I buy tweeted out and the Facebook out in all social media out like uh\nI Wonder if the board of ... he was watching the program a and of course the answer is absolutely not but [laughter]\nBut either way they they they took the right advice and they they made the right decisions and so that was fantastic they've already hired a new one\nAnd um they did what we recommended to fix the ship\nAnd JC penny finally Jay's JC penny finally hired a CEO after

I Hope we ... coming around the wives\nAre always moving very fast and uh I think but it's just\nSo what sectors are hot right now especially in Nairobi like are is a technology the telecommunication\nYou're not going to have an idea and then go sell it to a\nTo a gym or a or a major company or a Proctor and gamble or something like that because of there are indeed apartments that have so many ideas written down for you know the last hundred years that they can't even agree to your NBA or anything else because they may have already reference some element of your idea in the past\nSo they the weight novice people think this works is not how it works\nWell you have shut above I think you and I would like to also to save up to ... up and you want to put in an idea that's a good feeling but also like to say but um it would really take too long comes to the gym maybe fifty as a hundred years strategy hounded ... yes because you keep fighting you fight\nThat's it you got to be able to defend it yeah job for you you got to pat and yeah I Need you to spend at least a million dollars a year defending said there was actually even we're getting a pet and in the first place and that has worthless if you can't defend it yeah\nI I have to ... my main but then I realized oh I might not be doing a a I have to keep defending adopted exchanges have you gotten used to in one country but ... but the whole was torn friday\nIs you're gonna go panning everywhere yeah exactly [laughter] exactly so here it's time now for my heartless hit list number one the loser of the week on my list as Amazon\nNow it's really ironic that they're on the hill is because they announced that they're raising minimum minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour forever and we should be cheering we should be excited but here's why they are on the hit list because it is not\nNoble do what they did why they did it when they did it when you get more information about what they did and why they did it it'll make you actually stick to your stomach it's the kind of corporate\nUh nonsense that I Want to change and that is not reflective of kingdom entrepreneurship at all of this came after years of public humiliation of pressure from from governments for them to increase what they're doing\nA they they were so when they finally do they act\nLike they're the white Knight they're coming in on the white horse trying to save the day we're going to and then here's what irked me not that they announced it\nThey didn't urge all their rivals to do the same thing I'm going to put all of you out of business to where you have no margin then I'm going to raise them or what we pay people and then I'm gonna try and get you to do the same thing because I Know you can't it will be out of business tomorrow the ultimate corporate\nTakeover hostage situation retail industry I mean it was just it blew my mind but I Can't stand when companies do the right things for the wrong reasons they did the right thing for the wrong reason and then they acted like they are just a you know everyone the wrinkly it's going as it is going to hurt several a certain\n... yeah on unless that he's really into\nBut it's it you know I'm Glad that they raised it but uh I I don't like why you did it I don't like when you did it and I don't like that you called out the rivals to follow sentiment whenever you're the reason\nIt only to put them out of business it is cheaper for Amazon to to make this moving to pay their employees more\nThen to acquire the other companies that are the competition so this was a nothing more than a strategic move to eliminate the competition it was not to feel good social I'm increasing this because I value my staff of my employees and if you work for Amazon you know exactly what I'm Talking about\nThat so now for my hot list though I've got three winners I've got three companies that are just really stellar number one Kroger quarter announced this week that they are a testing delivering groceries through Walgreen's which is great because ... there's a lot cheaper to build and a Kroger\nUh it's all smaller so I'm more compact you can have more locations so that will be very interesting strategy and being able to pick their\nUh picked up from there but I'm proud of Kroger anyway look the only\nUh the ... the the only food store we had in our the holler I grew up in West Virginia was a Kroger\nNow it was scary it was done gee it was dark you know I it's where you would go to like for Halloween or something I mean it was not a nice place to go it was very run down\nBut uh what's our but they have completely turned it around the when I've gone into some ... uh I'm I'm literally blown away by the quality of the uh the layout of food I mean it's like whole foods\nAnd Trader Joe's combined but I still but it's not so I but I still feel comfortable there it's still warm and inviting and it's clean and Mary and bright and and you know public says the only one that's even remotely come close to something like that in public has a great\nA business and they're doing very very well in fact they just announced a seven hundred employee expansion or in their Lakeland facility or in in Florida and a ... and and my financial advisor was telling me yesterday but New York life that\nThat they have enough cash to they could rebuild every store with cash I mean they they they they they've really managed company ... and they are really involved in their communities generally I give a lot of props for for corporate what you've done turning that around is truly impressive\nMy second winter is Walmart on the hot list Walmart I've never had them on a on a winter's was I think this may be the first time for Wal Mart ever being on a on a ... here's what\nThey announced an acquisition this week alec why a which is a plus size a clothing store ... and I've got to tell you this is one of the first acquisitions that that they're getting notoriety form\nBut when Wal Mart gets in the acquisition business they're starting to think differently and that's what I like about it that's why you're on the winters listen on the hot list this week because you are thinking differently\nAnd uh as opposed to just\nYou know I mean what most of us know about you as your main sites and you know people really trashing Walmart but uh but you you got to do more than just brushing up your stores they tried that they did that that you you've done that now you moved on and so that's fantastic\nMy third company on the hot list this week a sun tire son tire company sun tired of their multi ... location national chain\nAnd a former sea level executive uh six billion dollar company wrote and to me this week to say that some tire took care of his daughters flat tire last Sunday his daughter was almost in tears from going to two previous tire repair places that were nasty to her they wanted to charge or two hundred fifty dollars for a new tire which she did not need by the way\nA and make her weight for hours for service so he drove forty five minutes to help because she was so upset and distraught\nThey had a really great experience I had a son tire in the past they went to the closest location and sure enough they fix the tire and Fifteen minutes and for no charge he actually even sent me a photo of the company values he took a picture of in the lobby and they fulfill every single one of them on their on their core values and of course he said he plans to buy all of his tires there are in the future whenever possible\nSo that's what it takes to be on a hot list and that's the kind of kingdom business keen them entrepreneurs companies that deal with integrity that we want to promote you're listening to courageous entrepreneur radio with Dr Rowland Robert and when I come back hit a time for the boardroom battles where the gloves are going to come up rather [laughter]\nIs evil and Christian leaders mark your calendar now for the three day

you're not with cash\nAnd your debt free everything about that when your homes paid for everything else just paid for a vacation home is a wonderful extra as you start buildings from World but basically what is it it's a very large toy\nVery expensive toy that goes up in value hopefully and if you rent it it might make you some money [noise]\nMy family not me my family the rest of them most of the rest of them including the grandkids just spent a week down at um\nWas Rosemary beach Rosemary beach the other day and I rented a house on the beach really nice big expensive multi million dollar house for the week and obviously some people on that and rented out by the week I'm\nHere's the thing about resort rentals vacation home rentals um you're going to make some money on it but you're not gonna ... you're going to make usually enough to after you pay\nAll the fees for the maid service and the you know resort rentals aren't like a traditional rental where you know for ten percent or something you can get the property management usually take half of it to manage it and that covers you know made service and that kinda stuff and then there's a whole bunch of the time it's not rented\nAnd so while you do get a great rate per week during a hot season where the ski house or your house and the mountains for ... for snow skiing or a beach house or something along those lines you you're not going to get rich on rent it out\nYou really not I mean it's not gonna it's not really a great investment property it's more of a way to offset some of your annual costs of your toy\nIf you look at it that way you won't be disappointed but if you actually run the numbers out you're not going to be thrilled with it as an investment you're better off to just buy investment property it'll make you more money for the ... per dollar invest it\nAnd it's not as volatile and you don't come in and you know run or something you know vacation runners haven't torn up your stuff or to build one on your carpet or whatever\nAnd I know that there is a deposit and I know this stuff gets fixed but I also know people are living in their sleeping in your bed and you just have to think about that you know and\nYeah yeah it's just it it's the way it is an even a nice home and even nice people like the Ramsey staying in your home we weren't we didn't tear up stuff or not but he wasn't a frat party in there it was you know babies and\n... and that kind of stuff in there so running like that but you know stuff I I don't think we broke English stuff gets broken and you just got to know that and for for some people\nDon't we put it this way for Sharon Ramsey to walk into the place where she wants to go on her second home as our vacation and someone else to have been in there and some of the stuff is out of place or broken or dirty it would kind of take a lot of the joy out of it for vacating there for her\nAnd so you have to think about that yeah that's a price you pay the rent it out\nAnd uh all of that to say it's not an ideal investment property it's more like a way to cover some of the cost of your way if you want to rent it out we've got a uh like how should we rented out we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out and um so it has to be a our income\nAnd our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that are weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall met worse and so there are a toy it's just a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and I still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in you know the the condo the other day we stopped and there are going to get a condo over in Knoxville and one of the ball game over there and he was out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more ... more repairman you have to know

visiting Saturn a man's life is shattered\n[noise] now that is not marketing for word mocking would have been to impersonator he didn't do that see this is what's wrong Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have\nThese are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her to be credible\nShe's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge her she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they played ride along and without having ritual Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time we were all kind of curious to know what what's the purpose was a\nAll Trump is still is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't know she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention of the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is not mocking\nChristine balls the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying but this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible entered testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers are in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able\nTo parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially when he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make\nAny sense we've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and I was taught people how to beat them we have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there had been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that Trump\nWill tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... the ... the ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord what did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it to the moon to the right\nTo oh he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really\nThinks it's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans\nHaven't Trump has Trump has established that after he makes an initial statement on somebody and he can make fun of things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell\nYou how it irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane it has made them with rage other Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much\nHe doesn't care anymore it doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows\nHe's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nAnd Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors oh my God it was horrible we thought was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress\nVideo audio we played mocked multi for Trump didn't\n\nHe just simply boy she she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any ... for what she said why you're not relevant\nWhy does that not matter why have we\nGotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accusing any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined that can you imagine if there was something going on they can you imagine of men organized\nFor the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine it can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell rush or a million women or nor do there should we do well\n... yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed and\nOprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and they've been ridiculed and made up for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not\nUh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did was say what everybody following this\nKnows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot of cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed\nTrump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous for our country that's what this is that's what the Democratic party is and so

Russia's week in review readings are welcome back Rush Limbaugh the network books to your ear is the IRS the James with them to the gym and guarantee quote\nFrom a National Review um the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activist or not really arguing about politics\nAt all these people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years\nI have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together as one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bed is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding than every representative of the group that ... or the individual that did something good to be made to pay a price for it that's what the\n... this this um [noise] well\nMe too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to me but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democrat Party look at look at the\nOccupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people who for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes\nBecause the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people they capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives\nAnd then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debate about whether [laughter]\nBoys\nWant to pretend to be girl so they can go on a girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nThat's sick it ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating movement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate\nVarious agendas and the target is America the target as America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says\nThat Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right balls the\nFord will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it did happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case will be capital that's how they're going to be heard rather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nA all cops are bad every white cop is a rape every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country as large as being responsible in unfairness in bias and discrimination in racism all of this [noise] the Democrat Party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the range of me angered never ends it only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital
