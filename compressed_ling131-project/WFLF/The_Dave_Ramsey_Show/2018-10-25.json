me here today\nYou bet I I got tired listening to that ... maybe a vacation or something here doing some cool stuff then [laughter]\nYeah but you know what we do is very important and and basically with the real estate here or what I wanted to uh helped contribute on your show is a problem facing\nA just many many of my clients and your clients and and people across the country is they've done well in real estate they've invested they've done the work they've gotten\nIt to a point but the ones that they don't have the one thing is they don't have an exit strategy\nSo they've they've got this real estate and here's some of the issue because I can sum it up with was a I got this phone call from\nThe shell and he says you know I have on this apartment complex for forty years my cash those terrible because Everytime I get ahead I have to put it back and somebody moves out I got to replace a roof I got to replace carpets I got to do something and says I don't want to show and pay all that income tax I'd like to do and exchange\nExcept that when solving anything but I'm Still gonna be a property manager\nI don't want to show it before I pass away and give it to my ears because that can get step up and basis if I if I you know weight\nBut he says I'm tired I'm eighty years old\nI don't want to do this anymore what's your solution and so that's that's what I heard it talked about his ... anybody that owns investment real estate and watch an exit strategy or wants to have really good cash flow watch appreciation day they like owning real estate don't want to be a landlord anymore don't want to pay the income tax\nWants newer properties are there more diversified uh this is a solution that uh we're going to be talking about here on the show today\nVery exciting and very exciting I'm can you tell us exactly a storyline and what it is um that might work for people that are listening to own highly appreciate it real estate\n[noise] yeah basically uh the the kind of real estate I'm Talking about is investment real estate and that can take many forms it could be\nA farm in Indiana it could be several addict me apartment building rental houses office buildings whatever something help for investment which means it wasn't a vacation home or your primary residence essentially and so do you yell this property for investment\nAnd it's probably gone up in value even if it hasn't you've probably depreciated it down to the raw land or minimal\nAmount so if you sell it there's a huge tax on waiting for you typically so what I'm Talking about is just a a typical for people in real estate they'll know what I'm Talking about but out here it's called a section of ten thirty one exchange\nWhere you sell your investment real estate [noise] the proceeds temporarily go to an attorney said that's listed as a qualified intermediary McHugh I recall [noise] so you sell your property the money goes in escrow temporarily and then you go out and\nYou find a different kind of investment property that you want to invest in\nWell again the problem with that it's you don't want to be a landlord anymore and maybe there aren't any good deals where you're at and it's you're done with that part of your life fear here at the distribution phase of your life not at the building phase of investing and so what we're talking about is just a ten thirty one into a different kind of

short than Amazon and Netflix had I've got a whole lot of cash on the sidelines there's no way where you can just say I just trust everything that's going on and that concerns me\nOkay he's down to two stocks and a lot of cash so Mark Cuban is a billionaire he's really smart guy so Sharif should we follow his lead what do you say\nI don't know you think he's got fifty million in each one of those stocks [laughter]\nProminence I'm just so we are not Mark Cuban my listeners are not Mark Cuban so here's the lesson to to to really listen to when it comes to the story\nWhen he is doing the question is should you be doing it\nSo here's the differences Mark Cuban he has many many streams of income I mean he does the shark tank has the basketball team and he has many many strings of income coming in\nSo he can do whatever he wants he can says money in cash if he wants and he's still going to get his income and he's probably still saving and dumping more and cash right\nSo the question you have to ask yourself um are you are you in the same scenario do you have other streams of income that are out there for you basically that will provide income do you have that working for you the biggest thing is you don't want to have to worry about losses and retirement not on all your money and that's how I feel\nIf you are not sure how to do with Mark Cuban is doing and get these extra dreams income without going and buying a basketball team [laughter]\nI mean these are the owners of the shark tank on we do suggest you come in and sit down with us because we're going to show you how to get those other streams of income without all the worry without all the fuss and simplified manner do I believe people should have all their money in the market\nI Do not believe every single dollar should be exposed to market volatility no so it's now time to start carving a piece of that market exposure off the table reconsidering some of these other ways to get an income

security is fast becoming a do it yourself set up\nThe eye why for those of us in and out do it yourself set up especially for those who ... who know about setting things up more than most people in fact\nKnow hounded home security becomes something that you can do for yourself in a lot of people will begin to rush come out what are you doing telling me about that so I Can't you go out and get a real this is that's the point\nThe reason you can do this yourself from the reason you can't do the others just wires stop and think about it\nYou have a house like let's say you're going to have thirty different sensors throughout that I'm just picking a number of every one of those things about that but why are run do what you want to do that you're not\nGoing to do that you're going to hire some team to come out and run a site survey and then they're going to run the wires and you're not going to want the wire scene so they're going to have to be behind the wall or taped up the base boards or whatever that means miniature construction you're not going to do any of that\n[noise] and then when something goes wrong with wind up those wires that my trip the whole system or at least provide a fall somewhere you've got to track down [noise]\nYou don't need any this anymore now the sensors that you get from simply say ... just as good maybe better ineffective as anything else you'd get\nCommunicate to the central base station in your house over white fly so there aren't any wires and this is why it's do it yourself and it's fun at the same time and not just the door and windows sensors you've got glass break sensors you've got ... cameras motion detectors they all\nConnect me a white five that base station\nEmits a loud siren if there is any kind of a intrusion our problem and if you want the twenty four seven monitoring which alerts the fire department or the police department of bears a break him that's fourteen Ninety nine a month and that sells you're still not talking any wires\nIt's easy to understand how to operate it it's easy to operate it\nYou'll become familiar with your system unlike other is you're going to be totally dependent on others to fix it

I Love it I'm not sure we paid off\nHave my notes here I paid off about forty eight thousand two hundred dollars good for you and how long did that take twenty two month yeah hey and your range of income during that time I started off making Seventy ... ended about making Ninety three thousand wow good for you what do you do for a living uh I oversee marketing for a software company and I also started my own company during the\nProcess that okay good for you what kind of that was the forty eight thousand dollar what you\nOwe everything mainly student loans um I also had a student loan or a car loan out I also had four one K. loan mhm\nUm and then also had to pay some taxes to the IRS\nBroker she like normal oh very normal a little bit of ... out there and just kind of bumping along yeah and I'm making decent money but got a big pile of debt and I don't feel like a written oil\nWell I I'm a travel junkie and so whenever I realized that can go on all the trip that I Want it and yeah\nBroke yeah and then kind of you know was horrible about being on a trip and not being able to afford things to eat or\nArea and so what happened twenty two months ago\nI was traveling with my boyfriend at times seem to be my husband ... and ah he the year before had paid for a trip for both of us to go to Costa Rica which was great yeah um so I was going to pay it back and say hey you know I'm going to pay for our trip next year\nAnd then realized I can actually afford is um airfare had to go home and say hey can you can you purchase your own airfare um so it was kind of that you know and then also thing and made good money and I couldn't do everything I wanted to do so make too much money to be this broke exactly what'd you do\nUm I got really serious I actually read the total money make over um about six years ago and started to to become ill intent started to understand some of the teachings but then\nUm the twenty two months ago is really whenever kicked in going in this stupid why am I taking so long to get on to that 'cause I'd started and then stopped in and got back into it mhm that's whenever I you know I had my lovely excel spreadsheet I also use every dollar up\nI'm so we started doing all that and plus my company started to um do smart dollar at all for\nComing at the ... okay great so they taught smart dollar yep which is are going through the whole class as an HR benefited your company yes very neat and so that gave you about the time you were disgusted in going by an airline ticket while law smart dollar appears from the charging\nYeah and actually um to circumvent and I and I think when we go through this process you start to get really creative mhm so one of my passions is to travel so I became a national speaker and had other people pay for my travel I was just working the entire time um\nBut I still got to do a lot of my travel well also working on my income and\nAround the country or smoke\nThat's not bad at all on a professional eater I Wonder if I could get them pay me for that or\nYou'll be surprised what people will pay for you know they\nWere when you get creative it's exactly right so the company teachers from our daughter you're going through it you get your income up with all these side gig you're traveling getting paid you know software on the side you're doing your work Ninety Ninety thousand dollar job and what is the secret to pay off forty eight thousand dollars worth of debt and twenty too much\nSo I'm I'm a marketer um my one Tibet is don't pay attention to commercials or social media boat because that's the second you start to see the restaurants on commercials or the cool stuff that people are purchasing and showing off on social media you start to have that why should have with the Joneses have\nSo don't put as much weight into what you see that all the markers in the world that we're really good at what we do if it's trying to get you to purchase something outside of your means ... shut off that that device to shut off the TV set off that shut off the social media um and do something else which time\nAbsolutely they all the rich will cruise book love your life you know there's that what it's all about his don't don't compare your life to other people's highlight reel on Facebook yeah yeah very cool good for you and what did you do did you cut your spending did you sell stuff did you live on beans and rice what'd you do\nUm I so I sold some things I did a garage sale and really I Want it to get rid of the clutter in my house\nAnd um I actually created a marketing campaign around my garage sale so I titled that um shop of ... turned minimalist and I did a full fledged marketing campaign around it and also created posters to go in my yard and I had a poster have you with your face on it that said Dave Ramsey is making me so much stuff [laughter]\nYou don't want a total of things going down in value more than half your annual income so that's the first measures do your cars all your vehicle's things with boats in motors and wheels ... add up to more than half your annual income if so then yeah you need to show something\nThe second thing is can you be dead free everything but your house and a year I'm Sorry in two years within two years if you can busted\nTaking extra jobs so so much stuff the kids think their next beans and rice rice and beans don't see the inside of a restaurant unless you're working there are no vacations busted and be dead free scorched earth and the debt free\n\nIn less than two years then you would keep your car even if you owe more on it then it's actually worse there's going to pay it off and you're going to clear it you're going to own it it's going to be all\nThrough all done right that's where we are going to end up you know\nIf you owe more on your car then it's actually worth and you can't it's going to be more than half your on your income and or you can't pay it off inside of two years then you do need to sell it how do you sell a car that you're upside down on that you owe more on your car than his were in that case if you need to sound like you've got to cover the difference\nYou owe twenty thousand dollars on the car the car is worth sixteen you can sell it for sixteen but you've got to have the other four to put with the sixteen to get the title from the bank in order when you give the title to the ... in order to give the title to the new\nOwner\nAnd so where are you going to get that other four thousand dollars if you're upside down by four thousand dollars well you would have to in that case\nBorrow the four thousand dollars saved the four thousand dollars or talk to the current\nLinder on the car and letting you sign a note for the four thousand dollar difference that will only happen if you had like a credit union or a local bank it won't happen with a big bank or car loan company General Motors credit is not going to do that Lexus motor credit is not going to do that\nAnd so on something that's what you do\nHope that helps open phones a triple eight eight to five ... five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money John is with us in Detroit hey John how are you\nDave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell I thank you for taking my call it an honor to speak to you um my wife and I are avid ... and we are planning our next move here in the next few years I'm forty nine and she's forty thick\nWe don't have kids um and we're thinking about moving to the Las Vegas area over the next two to three years we probably are playing for him mhm\nI'm my question to you is we're looking at because we do a lot of travelling um ourselves and so we're not sure it looking at her condo\nOr an actual having a home\nWould be a good idea what's your what's your opinion on condo um 'cause we are planning on whatever we purchase we're planning on paying out fine but we eat you know have no market\nAnd that's good okay my opinion on them regarding what value increases are what\nWell uh you know facing the threat but because of the we we buy a condo um we're looking to buy kind of a three hundred thousand\nUm [noise] they do with our colleague of ours and it was something like that I'm a little way money um to to to go into account versus a home where he's not sure what the white financial and action would be\nWell no it's it's not a waste of money um the benefits are as you said you don't have to deal with the exterior maintenance and when you're traveling you've got neighbors that are close and if something of curves obviously you could\nYou know or have the next door neighbor than the person near you have a key and that kind of a thing there's a lot of possible good things about owning a condo as far as the as far as a condominium increasing in value\nOr everything that controls the value increasing on real estate there there's three things location location location right right and and so is it or is it a condominium and a good area\nMeaning to an area that's a stable growing that values are increasing a good neighborhood to neighborhood people considerably a desirable place to live\nA ... and so I Want to I Want to buy a condominium in a fairly a ... area or in an area that is you know right on the edge of a rapidly growing edge of an established area that kind of things from from a ... British resale standpoint okay\nAnd um you know if you do that you're going to get similar growth in value to what you would in a single family\nIn that same neighborhood same families do a little bit better there's a little bit more market for them and there is condos but you know a ... if you're in an area that's accepting of condominiums you'll be fine in Vegas will be fine with that now having said all of that then the only downside is what you mentioned earlier\nAnd that is the H away and the handling of the budget of the ... I wouldn't want to investigate because you are a planner the budget\nAnd um how they're doing with the H away budgeting let me give me an example I had a condo come on a rental or a many years ago when a condo complex that they had budgeted no reserves to replace the roof\nOkay now the condominium association is responsible for the exterior maintenance which would include the roof replacement so they come up with a several million dollar problem because the roofs are going bad\nRight and they done no planning to get rid of it so guess what they did a special assessed every body and the place in addition to the right way fees to keep 'cause they had to have Ruth ... Lincoln all over the place that way but that devalued the condo in both took cash out of everybody's pockets\nOkay and so if you look up and they've got no reserves for parking lot replacement no reserves for exterior maintenance no reserves for roofer placements in their budget and you know and you're looking at a complex is ten years old you got a problem you're walking into\nAnd so that any of the thing you want to look at their the deferred maintenance is hidden down in that age are way reserves budget\nThe second thing you're going to run into is a and I'm In a bunch of joys own a bunch of real estate I hate H always\nRight generally speaking the people that want to be on in charge of the ... way or the people that are in charge of nothing else anywhere else and their Barney Fife\n[laughter] they would drive you freaking nuts absolutely and there are people that need a life now there's exceptions to that but by and large or you're going to run into a lot of that\nBut yeah I'm currently currently live at home or the thought is right now and I'm the president of the U.S so [laughter]\nBasically [laughter] I said are you [laughter] know I\nI stayed at the way because I didn't want to run into a firefight kind of situation very very guy\n[laughter] okay [laughter] well God you say\nKnow ... there's a lot of that it's not it's not a hundred percent truth thank goodness I hopefully you're now ... ... no no no no fat at all [laughter] but that's what you want to watch for is the politics\nOf the association I'm In when I joined the barrel suing each other and it's just gone the whole neighborhoods is melting down you know just ridiculous so you just hit it you got it and that's what you could get into you know if you're the president so she had she already knew all the stuff I was just talking about them as far as uh even reserves in home ownership situation\nSo there that you've got to have reserved\nPreserved cover and so\nThat's all you gotta look for [laughter] that's fabulous this Ramsey show\nGuys this is James Giles producer of the day Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on six hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you got to Dave Ramsey dot com bust show\nCloser to him here\nYou ever talk to people who say things like becoming a millionaire was impossible these days or people are only millionaires because they come from already wealthy families will we just got done with the largest research ever conducted on American millionaires and bill simple truth is everyday people become millionaires all the time\nHow did they do it the overwhelming majority did so by investing consistently and with the help him guidance upper professional\nThat's where our team has already done the hard work for you\nWe've vetted and interviewed thousands of investing professionals all across the country who are committed to helping you reach your goals just started today\nGo to Dave Ramsey dot com slash smart dresser and look up a smart but it's the pros or in your area that's a big Ramsey dot com slash smart and be sure to check out my brand new book everyday millionaires it's available for pre order start in August seventh\nWFL I find ...

where you spend a little bit of alone time today while it's fresh in your mind I Want you to write out several skills that you have because you have more skills than just being able to talk well\nAre

business\nI'd stay in that space I'd be thinking about how uh you can continue this idea [noise]\nUm and and maybe expand a little bit but what you're doing is is when I ask you this direct questions

there is some type of limiting belief\nThat is holding you back when you can't quickly say these are some things I Do well\nBecause here's what I Know if I sit down with people who know you will and I interviewed them about you those of you that are listening right now that having a hard time seeing all this is this is a talent these are my top towns when I sit with those people they're going to tell me areas that you are good\nThings you do well\nAnd there's something that's holding your back and lock you up\nIs it that somebody verbally abused you did you have a failure in your life at some point\nThat has made you believe that you don't have much to offer\nFolks we deal with this every day and some of the out there are locked up on that one limiting belief\nAnd when you get beyond that
