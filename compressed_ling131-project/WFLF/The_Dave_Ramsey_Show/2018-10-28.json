flu shots or other vaccines is a big controversy about vaccines you can go into that as you will\nTalk to your wallet but there's also now instead of using mercury and seems they're using aluminum in some of these shots and she wants to know if it's safe if there is anything about aluminum that's good I guess that's the question and try to paraphrase it here but no mercury is good but he's aluminum okay\n[noise] well I'm actually a as an essential nutrient is required as a cool factor to to make a certain enzymes that are ... dealing with energy production side the ... and ... is not

include these things into their diets because as far as we don't have to give them vaccinations [noise]\nUh you know the feedlot cattle and and even poetry and and um that you look at things they've added that they've added mercury and ours like why do they do that well is because it kills parasites and that kind of stuff but again you're looking\nAt micrograms we're not looking at milligrams and things like that you're looking at a small amounts are necessary to accomplish what we want without drugs and so um\nWell I think what I heard and this and this may be I ...
