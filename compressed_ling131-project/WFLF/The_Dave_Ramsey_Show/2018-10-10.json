everything including starting our emergency fund what can we do\nWhen we are so behind that we can not even catch up for about two months behind on all bills is causing a lot of stress on our marriage or kids were tired of living this way but we feel like we're in so much debt in so deep\nThat we can't get out yeah just seeing it gets really really scary when you're in a situation like that\nAnd I'm part of what's scary is the sense that you're stuck part of what's scary is you're overwhelmed\nAnd um [noise] let's stop and pull one segment out of this thing and talk about that for a second or two months behind on our bills and is causing so much pressure on our marriage and kids being behind on your bill should not affect your kids\nShould know about it you don't need to tell your five year old or behind them ally ... that's not their problem much your problem\nAnd you can tell the kids know but you don't have to give them a little big long reason why knows a complete sentence [noise] no but don't pass off the ah you know don't pass off the stress but the kids\nNow let's look at the rest of this what do you do when you're completely overwhelmed and terrified and feel stuck I've been there so many I don't know what I'm Talking about you been there too and you\nIt is no fun OK here's how you fix it\nYou have to begin to take control of what you can take control of you have an income let's make sure that that first is being controlled and that's called the budget\nNow you do not have to be able to pay everything to do a budget all a budget is is you're telling the money that you do have where it is going to go\nAnd so when you can't pay everything which catching everything up in one month would be paying everything right\nWhen you can't pay everything then you've got to say well the money that we have we're going to do with the most we can do with that and for this month that's all we can do\nSo you prioritize you make enough to buy food you do not make enough to eat out so we're not going to restaurants but we are going to the grocery store and we're going to feed our family and we're going to cook from scratch because it's healthier in ...\nSo there we go Boop you make enough to do that check that one down for the food budget downright that number down and you can do that\nYou make enough to pay your lights and water and if you're behind on them you catch them all up this month before you do anything else after you ate ... current on your lights get current on your water now if you have a six hundred dollar a month cable bill because you have NFL\nSuper duper pooper scooper or whatever then cancel all that crap\nBut I'm Talking about water and the lights and gas to eat okay\nNow I don't really give her up whether you can see Downton Abbey or not but I Am more concerned about you having like some water on and gas to heat\nIf it's gas heat okay show you pay your basic necessities food and utilities you make enough to do that and get current on them ride now\nNumber three a shelter\nNow you pay your rent\nIt doesn't matter if you pay your rent and you can't sleep there because there's no heat so you've got to put heat in the show guys show you pay your rent if you're behind on your rent before you move on to number for you catch up on your rent\nNumber for transportation\nAnd cut do you own a home now no okay I'm the first thing I Would do is I Would not buy a home until I was ... my merges you fund in place\nSo that means you need to write a check today and pay off your car and your credit card and cut up your stupid credit card\n[laughter] okay okay now your debt free right okay okay and that was four and two\nI so six thousand so I'm Down to twenty four thousand right yeah okay and your land is paid off and it's worth sixty or about fifty about fifty and ah we\nNeed sixty so you need ten thousand that's where you're getting your twenty percent of what you're doing okay uh well we're going put fourteen thousand in the emergency fund\n... pay [laughter] so now you have an emergency phony what ten thousand what the land you get a construction alone with the takeout loan apartment a takeout\nAnd your budget cannot exceed or a three hundred thousand dollar value that does not mean a house that you spend three hundred thousand on the house okay the value of the total package can't be more than three hundred\nBut that makes sense huh so that means you're building a two hundred and forty thousand dollar house maximum\nOkay\nBecause the packages worth three hundred and that gives you the twenty percent down if you spend three hundred on the house\nNow you're at three sixty and you don't have twenty percent down anymore okay you see how that works\nYou get an actor option loan that is tied to your new mortgage that is your final mortgage called your permanent mortgage that's the mortgage that takes out your construction loan and so you're construction lender will require a take out letter\nWhere your for your permanent mortgages already approved sometimes you can just package all that together and with increasing interest rates are probably would package it altogether checked Churchill mortgage they can probably help you with that and you can go in Milwaukee and your interest rate on your permanent mortgage\nBecause he's a mortgage undergraduate picking up and a good idea to lock 'em in when you can by the way if you have a ... and you got a higher interest rate loans folks this would be the time to go or Joe mortgage a it is taking up and I would lock in rates if you're in the middle of a deal right now walk your rights and\nAnd I probably would lock 'em in like twenty minutes ago like four days ago I Would walk them in period but we are in a rising interest rate environment loving to panic about but it is going up\nAnd so you might as well take advantage of the lowest possible ray you can get your hands on for refinance were for buying or in her case for building and um\nThat's by walking in current rage 'cause I don't think you're going to see right to come back down dramatically um you know in in in the foreseeable future in the next say six to twelve much they're probably going to go up\nAnd so given that environment um you don't have to be an economist to figure this out it's fairly easy to look at the trends um then then I'm gonna walk everything in as fast as I can get in touch with Churchill mortgage today and get this done Barbara is one of those barbers in Salt Lake City Hi Barbara how are you\nHey babe during gray how you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so we are a month and a half away from bay and gotten a baby that too good and um yeah he's very exciting I don't want to lose that momentum that we've had kept\nGoing toward ... and and going into baby step three there's like a few curve balls that guy I met her happening so we want to get the three ... my husband is also wanting to go back and to go get a bachelor's they get a better paying job that would be maybe step three\n[noise] okay so that's my question is you know we also want to start a family that we need competitors like baby kind 'cause we want to catch that\nWhen you have a baby on the way you will build up a baby fun no need to do it for granted\nOkay the build up the emergency fund or\nMerges you finished first for you do anything and then you start doing other life goals I wouldn't worry about saving for a baby you know you don't really need to save a bunch of money for a baby\nUm if you got insurance health insurance you know and you should have health insurance and um you know you've got your emergency fund and blood and you know you'll be able to budget ... present and believe me your work it out um but yeah you don't really need an extra baby savings account unless you just want to save up enough to cover whatever normal labor and delivery is out of pocket\nYeah that would be it would be around a I think we pay like Fifteen hundred dollars toward yeah labor and delivery\nThat's easy enough to do during that's easy enough to do during the non much\nOkay\nYeah so you can just do that whenever that happens and whenever babies on the way you decide well run our saver for that and and and you know anything you want to do that to an upgrade them move on and whatever comes after the emergency fund 'cause there's not an emergency I'm going back to goes on emergency\nThis Fifteen hundred for the baby not even an emergency or you can cover it it's a luxury to have that as extra savings of baby came on my way writes\nBaby got here before you had to say you'll be All right\nOkay yeah you know and they're not curve balls are things that happened after baby step three\nAll right thanks for the call appreciate you joining U.S Open phones or triple eight eight to five five two to five cliff is with us in Chapel Hill North Carolina Hi cliff our you\nKnow I Can't complain hair you'd make it out but

in the air that we really want to live in a lot about what family around here gray\nOr if you're a how much how can we afford with our income ... their contract that we've been talking the recommended at us alone and you're not a fan of\nAbsolutely not no I Would never do your do you\nKnow it's a it's a subsidized loan and if you ever sell the house or go to refinance the loan at any point you're going to pay back all the subsidy and in some\nYou can get really trapped in these things and they're nasty bad no I never would do a USDA long I have to have had more problems with that loan working with people that are in trouble than any other loan I've dealt with\nWow so wow now ... as far as how much how you can afford we always say I'm you know put your down payment whatever that is into the formula rights and then the loan amount on a Fifteen\nYear fixed rate loan which today's about five percent interest loan amount on a Fifteen year fixed rate loan\nIs no more the payment is no more than a force of your take on pay and and that puts you right where you want to be shown like you've done some really good stuff open\nNow I mean you can really do it I mean you you've you've gotten out of debt you build your emergency fund you're doing really smart things so yeah I just get you a ...\nThe least expensive alone between F.

... my emergency account to paid us off or Chuck Chuck's on it at a\nAt a time I have I have the money I guess I was having trouble forty coming up with ... with\nThe whole you know kind value of money just you know could you know what what I can make and they weren't sure what your house or actually we're probably about six hundred thousand\nOr based on your concern about time by your money ... six hundred thousand on it\n[noise] I've chunk Dexter on it why\nThat show that actually got some contrary to your ... your money problem\nHere\nWill soon consistent okay so\nHere's what's going on right you you have um some good information but it's incomplete 'em and show that in the cause you to be left with a a a primitive analysis and let me walk you through that or him\n'cause I used to think exactly the same way so I Know where your brain is [laughter] yeah okay so because you obviously have a good intellect on especially on financial thanks so\nYour your concern is if I can borrow money at three or four or five percent and I can reinvest isn't good mutual fund at ten ten eleven twelve percent and mind not making that spread why would I ever\nYou know miss out on that spread and um you know I've got the money invested now it's making me ten twelve whatever it's making me not the day but it's making me that overall and why would I you know lose that spread and uh I had to really wrestle that down because that's how I was trained in the financial world obviously with a finance degree\nAnd then I had to start looking it doesn't want to start looking at stuff through the lens of the borrower is slave to the lender and there's no good mentions of debt and scripture and I'm going okay either God's stupid or and I've got something figured out he doesn't know about or there's something I don't understand\nAnd so um what I figured out was was that that formula that we just used ten percent over\nFour percent ... percent spread leaves out risk\nAnd in a sophisticated uh investment analysis you adjust for risk\nMeaning I Would never compare a\nGrowth in income mutual fund apples to apples was an aggressive growth stock mutual fund the rest of gross stock mutual fund might have an average annual return of torn twenty percent the other one might have an average and overturn of twelve percent but the risk ratio is completely different risk profile in those two funds is completely different agreed\nAgreed okay so what you would do is you would adjust and in in that world you can actually use a thing called a beta with an inverse formula and we'll get an all that crap but\nBasically you can say because one is more risky than the other way mathematically adjusted for risk to be able to compare them apples to apples\nAnd that's the proper way to do an analysis between those two funds but no one applies that concept that that level of sophistication to this debt analysis\nThat says Tom value of money and I could use this money to make more than I'm making now so ah but what I have found is is when I Do pay off my house I don't know which risk neutralizes a lot of those the difference between the foreign the ten percent\nIt takes away most of that spread when you when you you know when you factor interest 'cause we're there is risk when you have mortgage now it's not a lot of risk because you've got the money in the bank today to pay it off but er an investment to pay it off but there is risk\nIn so uh you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of foreclosures occur on a home with a mortgage there is rich\nAnd so I'm getting rid of that\nWhat I found this it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula\nBecause when you don't have a mortgage you start making different decisions with your career you start making different purchase decisions you start having different levels of enjoyment with your money your relationship with your spouse talks to have a different depths because there's a a level of security in your overall life that there wasn't before\nOr capture eight and transfer rate of energy or but we can get much much closer than we are now which is where it just hits a bunch of desert and it's like\nWell he's outta there [laughter] for you too [laughter]\nSo ah the way the way it works is you're able to turn a light into store herbal energy and um this is a well Einstein was I mean he's a it was as you say you don't have\nTo be an Einstein to figure that out but you actually did ah yeah he actually is one of\nThe figure to yeah he he uh he wrote three papers in Nineteen oh if I had all three in Nineteen oh if I did and that was his debut like it wasn't like they were like ... coming from this Einstein felt it was he came out with three papers one was special relativity which is the whole you know you you move slower the closer you get are you a time go slower the fast to get to the speed of light\nOne was about brownie a notion which is how particles moving water because water you know has constant motion with the with the charge the relative charges of molecules between each other\nAnd then the third one was the photo electric effect which is light transferring an energy and that's when he got the Nobel Prize for ah for me I mean there's there's always a labor together at a couple of years later I'm\nAnd that and so then people said a neat well let's try that and so uh the the efficiency increases are what's exciting about that because there's there's all these\nAre neat ideas about what what if we have you know photo electric cells photovoltaic cells for\nUm a ... you know shingles on our rules and stuff like that you know on a mosque is working on that with a solar city project and um but uh but the increasing or efficiency of of captured electricity and then putting that into store rubble batteries\nThat can power you know twenty four hours a day whether whether it's night or whether it's cloudy um that's where a lot of the progress is coming from a and a solar solar see so much as it really three biggies for companies one is Tesla\nOne is space sex or is this one is you know how do we get around without using energy basics is or how do we get out of here in case the planet or does just go to pot a and which really is kind of his admitted like we need to be really healthy plant or a species yeah um and then the third though is solar city which is um these\nAre really efficient solar cells and or you know to in order to uh and\nAnd then uh he's got the this gig factory which is just all about batteries which is storing you know being able to store that energy or to to power throughout the day\nUm so I I think that uh I think the future on this is what what's your prediction pop you've been around the block is is this something where you think a stalwart opponents and allies eventually get bombarded by one single truth and come together on this or do you think it's something where\nAre you know people find out too late and tried to scramble what if you I think really\nWe've got some momentum now um we've got of course initial resistance is just how the world is\nUm and there are people who have vested interest in not going to a renewable energy but em it will become more and more it will become cheaper and cheaper um to develop um renewable sources of energy I'm I'm the social\nDemand will become more and more as we change generations your your generation will say why in the world will do what we do this um and those who watch the economy um I'm for\n'em and how the how the economies are going to develop worldwide um will be able to also see that's a great place to invest money for the future so it will gaining momentum and we will more quickly um moved toward renewable energy just because it's a really smart thing to do\nWhat do you what do you think is a greater agent for change just culturally do you think it is a inspiration towards you know towards some a brighter future or do you think it is a more of a primal fear based\nOr in this case China's getting ahead of us that type of thing what do you what do you think uh what do you think in reality it changes people more or is it just too difficult to lump everybody to well I I think\nThere are three three aspects you mentioned two of 'em one is the right thing to do\nThis this makes a a lot of sense\nOr the other thing is um I I I fear change and because it's going to bring unwanted consequences you hear that a lot and um but the third factor is this a doesn't make economic sense people people have this gear in them to say\nWell if we're noble energy is going to be ... cheaper and it's going to pollute less um and it's and it's going to be much more available wind the world wouldn't we do it I doubt that third factors who one's going\nTo put us over the top yeah I I I I think that makes sense because uh there was the thing about having tons and tons of money which is something that you have if you are a a an energy company a you know a few that are ah what's that was an excellent actually yeah um is that you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "10"}
