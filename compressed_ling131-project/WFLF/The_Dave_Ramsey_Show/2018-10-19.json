don't let it be burning made I got it [laughter] I thought the same thing I think it all the time because we got in trouble\nRight right right and I think the problem is when that happens automatically\nWhen you see a black based on that ... you think okay I could have happened you know I I Believe it and and then they start coming digging up the the the smear campaign oh and in sixth grade he didn't turn in his homework and that bag or we All right cool but then when the Dylann Roof come about you shoot nine people in the church\nIs not this guy's evil it's oh he's mentally prayed he has a psychological issue there's always some way of\nKind of try to give them an excuse to have that type of mentality as opposed to by people they are just naturally violent this\nConversation and you know I it's a very hard to get into these Fifteen minute segments I Love this conversation I Am now going to introduce you to the mayor of eating ... we're going to talk to a graduate of the dueling dragging program as well as mixed company continues my name is Margaret we'd love to have you with us\nNine one six fifty four hundred whether it's for seven or eight six six it's still the same nine months to fifty four hundred this is mixed company a news radio Ninety three point one\nMore blow from going off\nOn the news radio not every one WFL\nWelcome back in mixed company we talk here about the topics your mother told you never to talk about in mixed company one of them is today is race and that's what we're talking about today we're glad you're with us I have a phone call was one of the first white teachers a Jones' high school\nSo we were talking with Oliver about being one of the first black teachers in elementary school during desegregation we're going to go to the phones and just a minute I Do want to welcome some other people to the program one of them is vi unwelcome this this is a rock star group again or this half hour\nThe on is a graduate of the dueling dragging program tell me when you first started what tell me what you end up for four years and now you're in college or college man now\nTell me what you thought of the first time you've gotten about\nThe first um and so in the program it was very different it was something that I wasn't used to and it was a big it was a different atmosphere for you to put a kid from the neighborhood that I'm from\nInto a pool of other kids that are also similar to the neighborhood that you're from within cops and it's so it it's a whole different atmosphere when you're there or\nIntimidated I was intimidated scared and confused on what was the whole purpose of me being there yeah same place with cops that I did not like I'm at the time\nSo you had an impression of them and you think they had an impression you\nMost definitely um we all had\nSort of first looking personal kind of we kind of just a book by its cover um me and my associate's my friends and you know we were ... them and we'll give our two cents on our feel like they think of was looking at it this way yes and\nThere was tension and we all feel too but we decided not to say anything but you could just see it in our face you could see it in our actions are look\nOn how we went from each practice\nAnd it was tension but that sense and slowly started easing will\nTell me how about that now once you started to know the other guys in the boat who are your age right to fourteen Fifteen Seventeen year old kids in the boat and then you started to know the officers right because this is a mixed but this is a mix boat this is youth and adults right so here you are in this boat tell me about the upshot of it how did it work out from their V. on\nIt all started with ... um the fall in our our fallen officer and a lot of people looked at her first because not only because she was African American but because she had the biggest small as she was always motivating everybody to talk to each other\nAnd so she was kind of the leader of the group on you know hey let's get out let's go do this get to know one another get to know and once you kind of look past the uniform and what they do on a regular basis under need that uniform and what they do they're still human beings they still\nThey have a family like us they bleed like 'cause they ... they were all the same\nAs so you kind of look past that and you know and you have to adjust to each other because you're going to be around it so that is wonderful seven and so you kind of started to look at them is more than just officer you started to look at them as them\nReally well that Andrea is a testimony to what you're doing you're gonna make me cry tell me how you feel after hearing now that it\nYeah well the and sometimes makes me cry 'cause he is a very special young man named the ion while doing dragon boat while going to edge water high school his younger brother also a pad lawyer was diagnosed with lymphoma\nThe and turned out to be the exact donors so he became a bone marrow donor and saved his brother's life um and the interesting part of that\nAt the same time was becoming an Eagle Scout and also received from want us to scholarships so that he is able to go to college and he is genuine and he's carrying and he's a leader and it's really\nMy told you rock stars right all rock stars Andrea starts the program V. on goes through the program\nAnd and now let me bring on my other rock star and that is ... coal any Cole is the mayor of eating ...\nThe nation's oldest incorporated African American city mayor Cole thank you for being with us thank you for having me on the last time I saw Eddie call we were sitting in a barber shop in a barbershop that trait at talk a little bit about how you ended up in eating ... talked about a little bit of your journey to arrive eaten veal and then be the mayor of that city\nWell my journey started ... originally from Canton, Ohio are working for organization called young life and I'm young life\nAfter so many years of volunteering in Canton, Ohio they saw something in me that I didn't know this is an and they asked me to go into the national training program in Boston, Massachusetts\nI left a Canton, Ohio in eighty two maybe two to eighty four I was in Boston in the national training program in eighty four I had an opportunity to move to Phoenix, Arizona wow New Orleans or a place called alliance Ohio\nI'm with the three um they gave me an opportunity to bring my family to Disney and Mickey One\n[laughter] yes and um and it's been a now you're the mayor and now I'm the only reason activist um I've always been yeah I've always been I'm a preacher's kid I've I've seen my dad used to be the SWAT Team\nWas that what I mean by that instead of sending a polish to go get somebody to have to just to ... to go in there and get Gianni yet and revenue code going to John in ...\nMy father and my mom and as we get in the car and follow my dad and the police car to the police station and I hear walked Johnny end to the police station that's just relationships that they had in the in the community and\nShe you know hurt children growing up in Goldsboro I mean she'll tell the story better than I Do that's for sure but she will talk about how we are still very very different I just read a book called why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria\nAnd other conversations about race and this was a best seller but I think you're describing what she said and that is she went into an all white school and she said it was a little bit off putting it took her a while to actually recognize the students did you have that same experience\nOf you know I did not and in fact I I've always come from the ... the the chips are good people or people and that's how I inducted myself in my classroom\nAnd I'm I'm I'm honored to say that I only ever had to people and the five years I was a jobs and I had the ... the office and that's because these kids to go to girls broke out on a fight in the hallway and I had the sense\nOf course I had no choice but to a Mike my students were loyal I've had students to one William Griffin who became the fire chief and eat and bill ... from OCD and the officer Derek Harris of both were or will they were all students of mine at Jones has\nI mean you're calling sir I really calling and sharing your story\nYeah I run into these kids were grown adults in their late fifties early sixties now and uh we reminisce and it's it's as amazing story\nAll right thanks again for your phone call that was Richard one of the first white teachers I chose high school so the experience runs both ways you know you can grow up in an all black community right and then you have to figure out your way in the world he grew up in the white community and had to wake me figure out his way in the world\nLewis you with that I don't think the experience works both ways I think there are similar but when you go into the Jones you were in Jones you lead you go back to the United states or we can escape that I mean when we want to get a job we can't just seek out just the black community we have to go into an overtly overwhelmingly white\nSociety correct there's no way of escaping that whereas this young man is as much good work as he did and we applaud you when it is that's admirable or if you want to do we know about you and he could have just went down the street to a different school and had options we don't have those options I think that's where a lot of the the apprehension come from the community very\n... and to add to that I'll always I always have to say to my friends I have my my friends in a white\nI have no choice but no you don't have to know me was I mean I Will always have to intermingle with white people and something that I have to do go right to store go anywhere I have to but I have a white friends that are kinda or in a in a area or in a place where they don't have to see me ever\nVisited with that ... lived their whole life I never\nEver have a black man but I Will never have that bad experiences right here I can America\nCan hide my um minority group or nobody has to know my minority group is as as uh\nJewish person or I can hide that you can't hide that is that what you're saying yeah you have to walk through the day and walk through all interactions from here and not and not be able to I mean occasionally\nI can fool to the average Flagler beach resident but I just fell asleep on the beach so [laughter] so I don't want a veteran of the\nNice things about dragon boat is that uh we have email cops male cops Hispanic or black cops sure\nBut our children because we come from Rosemont and para more mostly are African American or we had some Hispanic kids that they were moved away so we brought in some girls from a lake highland ... said\nThis is about diversity come and help us and you want to know the about the second week there\nAre black girls asked are white girls and I read your hair because I don't have hair like yours and and the girls were like ... yeah\nAnd I touch your hair and now this is twenty Seventeen twenty sixteen yeah and all they wanted to know was and I know about you that which I don't know because we don't grow up in the same neighborhoods now some of them they're instant Instagram Snapchat and their best but that's Graham v I can talk about the relationships that the\nKids you still have ongoing relationships or should\nI still have ongoing relationship with the kids that are ... back when I was in a program called that up out of ... back when I was in the program\nJust ... what was the last week when they had a competition I went there and visited and I saw someone obey the officers that I used to row and then there's still some obey the offices that don't currently wrote it off so cool if so if\nI hear millennials those said to me we don't see race we don't see color we don't see that you know this generation growing up says that they don't quote the it do you think that's accurate\nI don't think there's I don't either I feel as if we say that just so we don't get judge for thinking that everybody thinks it whether you're black white Asian it doesn't matter what race and\nEverybody in the room is nodding you everybody mhm sees it as that way everybody says that so they don't get judged for it and I think the problem is that we're not willing to admit it\nRight that is correct on on a different now did you have a lot of technology to get it off your mind we'd had nothing to get it off our my we had to see it had nothing in the middle that can say I'm a ... you you have a commercial a commercial break up thinking correct they have a million commercial breaks right\nNo you don't write to the new I Would like to leave with we're going to go into the big ... room and just a just a couple of moments but\nI just talked to be a little bit about it it sounds like there's not a ... we haven't moved the needle very much and that's kind of thing for me I thought that we weren't you know this generation beyond generation is a little it's one below you write that you think that it would be a little different but apparently that is not the case\nWell I mean it's not as well we don't have to look at the measurement based on what they used what history is and I mean to come from slavery to Jim Crow to where we are is progress don't get me wrong\nBut now I think is the hardest part of the entire trial because we're battling something that's ... it's it's not on the surface you have to actually find out what people's true feelings are and that's why a lot of people are actually ruined their heads on social media you see all these\nUh barbecue Becky and these are these folks were cognitively that's who they really are we don't know just by the surface just like you said most people try to cast themselves\nAs oh I don't see color and it's completely false you'll get mowed you get a a lot of blue supports you and say oh I don't know of the gentlemen are I think it was clear no you don't you know exactly what he was you just don't want people to know the judge is I think that there is some progress being made\nBut unfortunately mouse names were actually having to deal with what's below the surface you're not wearing your you're white or she out the house\nYou're not wearing your work because you're not saying oh no whites are no black sell out we have to actually find out by speaking in ... and actually having engagements with you and that's the hardest part because people are going to admit who they are until they're around company that will that they feel comfortable with\nWould you rather see the Confederate flag in the pickup truck or not see it because then you know what you got there\nAre frankly I Would rather not see it because I Know it's it's best to probably know who you're working with but I think that the culture should be ashamed that's just me now I get it they're trying to kind of re\nBrand that your favorite ... heritage and no it was not to but you cannot take the heritage away from the eight I'm Sorry and at the point at the time that the Confederate flag was ... yes it was representative of folks who want it to maintain their sovereignty because of slavery\nThis conversation is super juicy and I'm going to continue talking about it with all of these ... these are rock stars were going to go into the other room and we're going to continue this conversation on mixed company my name is ... pigment and I will be in the other room and we would look we have a big studio audience in there\nAnd it is going to be food and giveaways and all manner of conversation we're also live streaming that on Facebook so we will give you a heads up on how to get in touch with all of that\nThis is mixed company you're listening to Ninety three point one news radio [noise]\n\n\nIt's easy to take a day for granted\nBy

V. on welcome it is here\nAnd I have heard your story and the other room but explain to people in this room how you came to be in the dragon boat stand up for me if you wouldn't mind um how you came to be in the dragon boat and what you think you got out of it\nAre going to be in the program with dragon boat by my old manager working out of the rose more community center back and I want to see what year was it two thousand fourteen\nLooking at your mama and\nShe got me in a couple of them are friends from the rules more community center into the program and say hey this is a new program that\nAren't interested in job being a part of and she basically there wasn't about tell me about the first that you were in that boat first day was very skeptical it was very scary it was very intense it was something that you you were put in to have you ever been in both before did you get a panel I'd\nNever been in the boat before I never thought of before I never been around that many ... officers before it was [laughter] it was a whole different experience\nNow you admitted last hour of for those who didn't get to hear that that was that was a big hurdle that you had to get over the intimidation of being shoulder to shoulder with somebody from law enforcement\nMost definitely use when you put a new fish in a new pool other fish it makes you look at your surroundings differently is um is so far place\nAll that's where I feel like I wasn't home I didn't feel like I was in Orlando I felt like I was in some place that I wasn't used that I wasn't accustomed to and I had to make a serious an adjustment or I wasn't gonna like it\nAnd now you feel like their family is that what I heard you say\nMost definitely I see them as family I don't see them as open the officers I see them as individuals I see them as human beings and I see them as family\nAnd and they know we know now that it goes both ways on that one I'm married he called talk to me about the interaction you're in a predominantly African American city just a talk to me about those relationships because that's when we talk about race\nAnd the uncomfortable nature of that that's what you told me in the barber shop [laughter] um you told me that that is\nOne of the ways we can get over that speed bumps is the relationship building\nA I think the most important thing is everything is um relationships um building those relationships pass that police this before in our town for somebody to say I know you're dead\nI don't want to see I don't want to do this so you need to go home\nAnd and we're connecting the dots not that's not only the poll is and that ... or that person but it might be to police in that community leader or um just for a school teacher that we all have a vested interest and make sure that that person to see\nHas eaten veal move the needle at all in relationships with the neighboring cities and towns\nAre relationships like for me now I'm three to four times a month of may a\nMayor Steve leery mayor Dale McDonnell fair Nelson from a puff and we may have lunch I mean we're friends and how does that help and we create what we the stereotype things really now I have no I'm not from I'm from Ohio I'm from ...

pavement we're here talking about all the topics your mother told you never talked about in mixed company today is race in Orlando\nAnd we're talking right now we have switched it up on the panel we now have officer retired officer Sharon I'm wherever edge phone rang Trent yes\nAnd Desmond made 'em we talked to briefly to him last time I'm officer Sharon tell me a little bit about how you became connected to the dragon boat program\nSo a real good friend of mine Debra Clayton a was a part of the dragon boat team and she had been trying to get me to come on in because there were some female a juveniles that were part of the team who needed mentors\nThat looks like that and I'm a so you know unfortunately when she passed away I decided to you know take her place if I could do that um and get on the boat with the kid\nWhat were you expecting had you ever been in the boat\nNever been in a boat it's not like that same story that we sell 'em I quickly learned that you know we had to be a team we all have to work together\nAnd we're at Twenty years ago pd yes right and just within the last six weeks you have retired yeah um when you were adult pd ... described your journey there\nSo I started off in hum and patrol I worked ... more Gore Westmoreland does it um but but um I I always did the community oriented policing I'm Alice park my patrol car and walk\nThe neighborhoods and get to know the people um and then from patrol I went into a be a part of the gang unit I'm\nAt at the Orlando police department after that I proceeded on with the school resource officer unit um so I was able to go back to Jones' high school where I graduated um and be the school resource officer there\nWhen so you had interaction with young people almost all through your career on Opie date yeah how did it change your perception when you became part of the dragons the dueling dragging\n[noise] what I what I what I realized was the ... there was a shift in the um the level of respect towards law enforcement there was a there was a a a drastic shift so we went from the kids you know trusting to the kids not trusting right\nThere's been talk about community policing you can't have a conversation about race without talking about beat officers in the community describe your feeling like the is it isn't intimidation things at once you see the uniform talked me a little about that\nI mean you when you when you think about the history I mean any time that you've been experienced trauma and trauma has come from a particular place or they're going to always be some type of apprehension\nUh but I think that you know just listening to also speak that being able to get out side of the car and get up close and personal with the individual makes a world of difference you know I also think that\nThe one of the things that we will stress and post I when I went to school I I have a um a degree in public safety management with a concentration in criminal justice in one of the things that\nWe were always discussion about\nHaving that type of interaction from the academy level right and not waiting until a person get badge and the gun but before they get it you know they have them in Iraq\nWell that's interesting um when you went through the police academy was there ever a conversation about institutional bias or inherited biased\nWhere we went through human diversity training is totally different from what is needed at actually right yes\nAll right we are uh we're talking about race in Orlando we're also talking about the dueling dragging program that brings them together now\nLa ... and the ... and they find it's all volunteers or other people's lives to get to know him it's all on your ... and ... someone asked him to learn to eight and you said you will join in and I went\nOut what it is a it's a great commitment you know you're giving up a lot of time and a lot of energy a but it's worth it\nAren't we are um talk to me a little bit about this community Desmond versus other communities we have heard in the last couple of months some horrible stories about law enforcement I mean both of you can address that issue\nWhether it was a Starbucks issue with the guys who were there for a business meeting and they got rested out where to show up a story on that and just a minute there was a that this golf cart lady who you know stuck our nose into some\nProblem this week uh we hear these things off and talk to me a little bit about that law enforcement and community outreach well\nYou know we did fifty two summer camps all over central Florida most completely free to the community wow and so there's ways for people to say well I I'm not necessarily an artist but I can serve meals or I can help you know a different variety of things with the camp so there's a lot of ways for people to get involved in the organization\nIs good and I feel like this this has been successful and what we wanted to talk about in in what you're doing in the community because we've left off entirely that is the first time that there's any shows at all that's come up at all I'm so without spending a ton of time going over dates of different shows and stuff like that\nUm there are actual like shows that ... that this isn't all just it's not all just rehearsals like there's actually shows that people can attend and and watch the largest choir in the in the country and\nThe absolutely we do thirty six different shows a year so because we have so many different programs were performing all over the place and last year we had thirty two thousand people buy a ticket to one of our show when you sleep\nPiety and I don't know how to them I have\nAn amazing team you know we grew as an organization really quickly so now we have sixteen fulltime team members and we have over a hundred teaching or some contract with us while we have a very large team that helps us you know make all this and create all this but you know people love\nIf if they have the gifts and abilities or even just the desire\nTo perform they love it they he breeds sleep but I Would literally was just in a meeting this morning with a real into health and\nTo our board members once the head of pharmacology foreigner Palmer and the other is the CFO of on a ... and they both play in the orchestra I mean it every day people who have these incredible lives and
