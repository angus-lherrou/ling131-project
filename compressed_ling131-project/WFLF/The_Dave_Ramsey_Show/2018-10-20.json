I came up to ... so he could have people who was right in that in that same vein\nWe don't have tons of time left but this was one question that I wanted to ask you as as we were talking through uh the the the range of what you do and more specifically the range of the people with whom you where\nYou from people who are you know very very high achievers and are you know on the executive boards of very large companies all the way down to people that you're going in there under privileged community and they don't have access to what we would consider a lot of the necessities of life\nUm and they both either have a you know a bit of music in front of them to sing or an instrument in their hand which\nDo you feel like there's something that that is the same across that spectrum that when you have that sort of ability to look at people doing the same thing across the spectrum of life is there something that kind of binds everybody together that that seems the same across the spectrum\nWell I think you entered your own question it binds people together and that's the beauty of the arts is that you know there's so many different people from different diverse backgrounds but we deal with\nAn in that three hundred voice choir there are people from different religions from different socioeconomic spectrums different sexual orientation I mean it's it's a variety variety of people\nAnd nobody cares right and they're all there to make music together they're all there to sing together and all of those things just go out the window and and we see that across the board we see that as we we integrate kids from foster care organizations are for under ... populations\nSometimes into our programs that are really talented kids and their parents paid for them to be there\nAnd nobody cares I mean they're all there to put on a show together and so all those things that usually divide us and keep a segment in\nThose all go away when the arts are in the room and that's the beautiful thing that I see across the spectrum is about the arts is something that unifies us in a time where we are naturally just divided\nThat must have been part of a naturally Drew Drew you to that same thing pop I mean because when you when you started getting you know you you remember is like Twenty years ago or so you just said this is a really important part of the community yeah absolutely absolutely because\nThere there is there's a ... ... responsive chord if you if you'll forgive the pun here in all of us that that is in build you know I'm In and and it's not just responding to a piece\nA performance music is there something that touches deeper inside of us um M. and and makes us\nFirst a person you know a whole person you know ... with other people and were made for relationships and music is one of those incredibly binding factors in our lives yeah and it's thank you so much for\nWhat you're doing I mean because it really it really is incredible lady it speaks to something I think what makes it so binding is that it it kind of speaks to the best part of who we are you know it it elevates us out of the out of the stress of what we what we're dealing with you know and kind of reminds us what it is to be you know truly human again a thank you for what you\nDo thanks for being on the show did a pleasure and you are great delight and thank you for listening this has been the bright side will see next time\nYou for listening to the bright side community outreach program designed to help you\nSide can be heard every Wednesday Thursday and friday at seven pm on news radio Ninety three point one civil us ally\nThe bright side is sponsored by hunter ... discovered the freedom of lasik at hunter vision dot com\nWho's whether in traffic for the smartest audience and talk radio news radio Ninety three point one [noise]\nMy savings are gone okay St where'd you had them I was home that I spent the month of vacation in this tiny suit of armor [noise] now they're gone weird [noise]\nWe're not really fading now means no money later put away a few bucks we'll like a million bucks for free ideas on ... to ... feet to paint data like that about ...

fifty years ago when Dr Jerry Falwell had a vision for not just a Christian day school but a Christian university and as it was founded the message was we're going to train champions for Christ\nAnd so if you look at liberty short history we've accomplished more than most schools have done in hundreds of years so we we give God the glory of great leadership we had an entrepreneurial a founder we

at noon eastern time except for today because I'm broadcasting live from the campus of Liberty University in Lynchburg\nVirginia and I've got some special guest in the studio with me joining me on the program today I've got student entrepreneurs from Liberty University but before that we are a privileged to have the pros\nOf liberty Dr ... thank you for being with us thank you you know one of the things I found fascinating was that you know you haven't been in academia your whole life and you understand business people and entrepreneurs well we've got a whole bunch of them and I would love for you to just kind of share about yourself\nWe've gotten here about liberty a little bit but you kind of your story and how you're able to relate to entrepreneurs in business people\nYeah what what Chris was talking about earlier this Christian at all to be better ah I'm a liberty alum a and they made a huge investment me in my undergraduate studies and\nUh when I gained here was truly amazing uh from the professors that invested in me and I went out and to a corporate America uh eventually found myself in the oil industry down train the last mile of of of the supply chain\nWith a Mansfield on all the nation's largest distributor and um I work my way through great mentor ship a hard work uh teach ability competed humility a a very entrepreneurial spirit service minded approach\n'em to the uh basically to the top of my division a to B director of retail operations uh before\nIn ... in a marriage covenant relationship you know and and the their response to that in this culture\nIs not positive because it's you know you stand up for you you you you are the one you know and you look out for for numerous over here and um and they can like it or or or lump it in in in and leave if they don't they don't want to be a part of that\nAnd that's not the spirit and it certainly isn't going to work in business and I think that's one of the reasons why so many entrepreneurs fail\nAnd that's why the best thing I can do to help entrepreneurs is not give them tactics and strategy is their business seminars coming out of our ears every chamber of commerce every ... city in America no matter how small has business conferences you can go to and learn how to do a lot of the the the tackling\nWhat you what you can't find there's someone that can help the person so that you get the right person who didn't goes into the business and then it succeeds and that's the heart that we work on with people and with entrepreneurs and that's the number one issue whenever people call in\nThat we have to deal with it's usually a personal problem not a business problem at all Jeff you were talking a little bit about what you're doing with athletics and of course bringing\nA ... document conversion and I think there's a lot of businesses by the way some of them that I work with that are still on excel spreadsheets and just really a very archaic and their methods a method keeping and so forth so tell us that worked at the project that you're involved in here um well\nFirst just to jump back really quick I I think the shortcoming of of my generation of entrepreneurs is the lack of learning servant leadership and so jumping right into a company and and being the c._e._o.\nFrom your start up is great and that's a great opportunity to do a lot of work with a lot of people but you miss kind of what the generation over is taught us of working from the bottom and working up so being the logo on the totem pole and doing what I'm doing which is\nThe the heavy work of moving data from one spreadsheet to another and just making it look nice and and that's not what the executives needs to be doing 'cause they have the big picture in mind and the currency that they deal with his relationships like we're talking about earlier and they they have 'em all of their colleagues that they call if they have a problem\nUm so what I Do is I I'm working on um just modernizing a lot of work sheets with uh the organization that I'm dealing with and and that's really the bottom level thing but what I'm learning there is um how to do that bottom level working so eventually hopefully when I Am the leader of an organization I can have\nAn empathy towards those guys the bottom in those relationships and shit\nSo many things brother I think you're you're right on a number one\nYou'll never make it to the top and be effective without understanding that\nOne of the best things about doing it yourself\nAs you also under ... learn how long tasks take so you don't get snowed as much you were able to have more discernment which is ... you know you're able to have more wisdom because you did it\nYou know if they say well this is going to take me a week and you know it takes about forty five minutes if you just go do it you know and I'm telling you I've been on the wrong side of that where I believed what I was being told and then when I actually finally went and did it myself I realize\nHow the system was flawed and how it really did not take that long\nBut it's like you said it goes back to a heart that as your heart to want to be a servant leader how do I give and surf and that's what places you into places of prominence a man's give make room for him and causes them to stand before great men and that's your heart and I think that's fantastic uh you'll you'll you'll obviously be very successful with that I don't\nThink that ... the founder of one of the largest ... in the country\n[noise] doesn't like a college student\nEntrepreneurs that doesn't like funding cause you're not ... I Love you entrepreneurs I help my daughters both when they were one was five and one was eight start businesses I Love teaching the principles of entrepreneurship because they're so biblical and sewing and raping and just to the skill set in communicating with people and articulating a value proposition those are all great skills to have\nBut ah but in terms of being funded that's what really ruins\nAnd so um I totally agree that starting where you're doing building it I Would not want to fund very much at all someone like that because they learn so many valuable skills having to bootstrap it figure figure a way to get it there overcoming that here's what will help them become\nThe best kingdom entrepreneur the best team in print or possible right it is time now for my hot list hit list number one on the Hitler starting with with the bulls I Do\nNot track over nine million people have to do not track feature enabled on their Internet browser to prevent websites from collecting data and following them and according to ... a ... this week this is like spray on sunscreen it does absolutely nothing for you in fact in here's the thing [noise]\nIt's misleading at best and it's completely dishonest at worst a because you've got Yahoo Twitter and others who had pledged to follow that it was supposed to be like that do not call list of the Internet\nAnd and so these companies pledge to follow that and then they reneged on that commitment because you know even Google Chrome which offers a do not track they refuse to follow it you know that as well so uh do not track you know people find out that that's not really doing anything just like to do not call list\nReally didn't do anything of a company was actually reported for calling people on the phone call us they would get a fine but usually the people who were using the list\nThose lists were fly by night and out of business anyway by the time the as you see are the FCC was able to get a hold of them the second company on my hit list\nThe Saudis oh my goodness how that is affecting business a JD Morgan had pulled out of a of a deal a major deal this week Saudi investment dollars Silicon Valley was pulling off trust me it's Only Temporary or they are not going to ah that that will be holding off for a long\nBut uh in in Egypt zero morality I find it very interesting that a good name is still rather be chosen the great riches because they pulled back\nA because of it was starting to get messy sponsors will still pull back often times around a an individual that they're sponsoring\nIf things start to get messy and even though they'll re engage at some point\nThere is still a honor is something that money can't buy my hot list is exhibition coal mine in Beckley West Virginia they hosted Dr ... uh and myself and law and order this week we've got to go deep into a coal mine hearing just how hard those men work was phenomenal\nI also thought it was interesting if a minor died the wife the widow had three weeks they put a rock in her front yard and the wife had three weeks to remarry or she had to move out of the coal camp\nAnd uh so that was pretty intense and ah so should force remarry or forced me mood my other company on outlets does brush ketamine in Murfreesboro, Tennessee\nTo where I worked on a ranch rounds Fifteen and sixteen tour my youngest daughter goes to school they graciously graciously allowed her to travel with me this week so glad to have her joined me here at Liberty University on campus and she's going to share our thought or two with us when we come back broadcasting live from the campus of Liberty University you're listening to courageous entrepreneur radio with Dr Rowland robbers\nWhen I come back in his time for\nThe boardroom battles will see in the boardroom [noise]\nOf a new physics evil and Christian leaders mark your calendar is now for the three day to night all inclusive faith based on hummus CEO\nDividing ...

yeah the market has gone crazy and Phoenix and we were so fortunate because when we moved there was the very low the market and here and we didn't have any debt so we could afford that was the only you know debt that we had we bought a house and then we paid it off I Know it was incredible journey it took full two years to pay it off and that was our guests\nEllen tents so it was um it was hard it was hard um I Would just want to say what you do makes it different all through your marriage like we've grown so much\nAs a couple of going through this process this is not just to get out of debt show it's not just money it's your whole life in your marriage you know so I I just wanted to mention that I mean it's been a fantastic journey credible I'm so proud of you know who are your biggest cheerleaders yeah so my dad was a huge cheer leader\nAverage say my older brother damn\nYeah a couple of family members on the good side yeah we're not on the dark so the ... [laughter] love us right way to go you ... yeah that's so cool so what started you're doing this what made you say we can actually pay off our house 'cause most people never bother\nYeah well because the journey happened so long ago the beginning of the journey he had come home from work one day and he just said hey I heard this guy on the radio talking about money I was always reading books about finance and he said take a look at this guy and see what you think\nSo the next weekend your CDs came the ... the very first set of CDs came ... that you had created I'll listen to those CDs and literally that day my life from awesome that we had everything we can ever dreamed up our big house in our jet skis and so it was awesome until it was an awesome\nBecause we didn't own anything ... nothing and it was just so\nRude awakening and it was so scary to sit there thinking we don't own anything and so that started the journey so lots of life happened in between the removed about five times before we finally settled in Cape creek Arizona air got hurt on a construction job he was builder\nUm and when that happened that changed our life because he chose to go to college you said you know we need to go to college and that's what took the income down because I had to work and we cash flow to it yeah and then once that was all done\nI printed the amortization scheduled for the house and I brought it to him and I said I think we can pay off in two years and I said you're crazy yeah [laughter] but I really thought we could but this last two years has sucked it was hard it on\nYour show you the three Ninety four really in two years or how much of the three Ninety four was the house to house was two hundred and forty thousand okay we did ... who you're already in two years\nYeah whoa that was the gazelle intense where we ate the gazelle 'cause we were so tired and rice and beans\nYou know yeah he's cleaned up all the jet skis and the other stuff in the previous seven years yeah so then when you look down and go okay game on now we're going to do the house and you leaned into it with wild good that's\nRight 'cause he had graduated from college and got a good job I had my good job we were stable ready to go and we did it\nParts of your home or in in the best case your whole home so everything in the house is piling up it gives you a sense of peace and security\nUm and and if you have any health issues to keep things cold and uh if you're on oxygen if you've run out of the bottles people have an oxygen generator um there's a lot of reasons and more and more homes today a have whole house home generators\nHum they burn either natural gas if you're fortunate enough there are pockets around central Florida they do have natural gas not too many\nBut if not you could maybe do what I did I I have one in my home and takes care of the whole house and I buried of a larger tank the normal I think it's five hundred gallons in a propane doesn't go bad folks like gasoline\nI'm an off that I tapped out and I ran a a gas line now to my back deck area and I never have to go have my bottles filled from my gas grill any longer which is just a convenience I don't have to drag the bottles around or in the middle of a cook out\nYou know you can't finish cooking 'cause you you thought you had enough gas\nAnd that's just a second convenience\nBut your program them and once a week they start up it's called exercising and they'll run and test all in themselves to make sure they're in good working with her and then shut themselves down\nAnd you do commercial as well as as as won't yes we do I think listeners should know that\n... in all the trades we do commercials as well as a residential I'm so these generators or you know uh taking care of you know all the electric needs in the house and your kids can watch TV and refrigerators and freezers keep going I'm\nIn it it's a wonderful thing to have more and more houses having it\nAnd uh because of loss of power and you have to maintain it from time to time you should once a year to check it and as a battery in it that should John a trickle charge but you know from time to time batteries go bad because of heat here here in central Florida but uh it's a wonderful thing to have because\nYou know recently we had a storm coming in you you're worrying about losing power\nAt least you got that covered\nNow is a good time to consider a whole house generator and I'm In fact you're going to save two hundred and fifty dollars\nOff the cost of installing one when you call eight seven seven to two three two nine six eight and mentioned that you heard Charlie on the on maintenance show\nI'm the offer is two hundred and fifty dollars off a whole house automatic all house\nGenerator and peace of mind and and comfort and a\nNo loss of of freezers although I've known\nAnd and it's funny because when when we have a hurricane approach and we get people call and you know that last three days that's going to come or can you put when in tomorrow I'm there is a permitting process you have to get an ACOA approved\nAnd a zoning as well you know for some of the houses with what we called zero lot lines is seven and a half feet between a lot line in the house well we got to be five feet most cases off the lot line\nAnd three to five feet off the house or you don't have that room with a zero ... so uh we have to relocate it in the backyard somewhere Tucker whether\nThis is a purchase that you really have to plan for this is in the last minute\nDecision a last minute it can take a ... you know a few weeks sometimes I'm motivated and your city and permitted\nOf the building department you know I mean look around much constructions gray on their swamped so it's taken time to go through all the channels to get it permitted in permitted to the uh uh approved then we have it inspected and it adds value to home when you go to sell it uh everything being equal Jerry if I was looking at home and your name\nAnd the houses with similar same type of law it's everything but one had a generator and one didn't that's huge uh it would be an easy decision for me yeah\nThat's that's huge and you you already have lived with one so you weren't you weren't going back ... you know\nAnd and uh up until not too long ago my son live two doors over from me and he doesn't have a generator and I do and one night for some reason the power went out and uh my daughter in law called my wife and said you\nKnow it's lousy the power went out we've been on for about an hour and a half and my wife not understanding you know electrical systems says it never went out here that the the lights blink for a minute but it's a fine you know and I have him on what's called the quiet sauce so it's quieter it's insulated so you\nDon't even hear running and uh my wife thinks she didn't lose power but they did two houses down so I'm you know you you may become popular with the neighbors when the lights are oh\nThat's right you're the only one with whites is going to be pretty obvious folks ah here's a great deal\nUm [noise] ... um\nTwo hundred and fifty dollars off that whole house a generator when you call eight seven seven\nTo two three two nine six eight and\nCharlie in in the remaining time let's talk about surge protection what is it and why do we need it\nCovering our homes electrical in Florida the first reason we needed is the power is unregulated it spikes up and down all the time uh and the second thing is uh how\nMuch value do you think you have an electronics in your home it increases every single day in my home does your ... your washer and dryer a microwave oven you of and the dishwasher your phones computers are all your charges\nUm what this does is it senses now this isn't lightning protection it's ... which you can get a surge from lightning and the neighborhood or what it does is a it it's she's the surge the spike and electricity and dumps it to ground rather than let it go through your all your electronics\nUh and it's working twenty four hours a day the product we sell his lifetime warranted if something happens or we will replace it for free um\nI thought to be the other day because I just got a new letter from my our company and they're up to nine Ninety five a month or something that doesn't work as well and you rent it you don't own at the system you're talking about the people are going to\nDo on it and uh you know how many months you're going to pay a Ninety five and that's cheap forever in central Florida here you live a little remote and kill it increases yeah\nUh but the one we sell will take the hit dump it reset take the hit dumping reset so um it it to me it's a must you know and to everybody's home 'cause you're going to get a surge\nFolks are right now you can save one hundred dollars off of all how surge protection system from a ... and it has a lifetime warranty the number to call is eight seven seven\nTo two three two nine six they mention\nThe homemade that show and that you heard Charlie on the show talking about surge protection and you're going to get one hundred dollars off that installation and save your electronics and and saved your family's peace of mind\nOne of the things I didn't even mention which would in most ... homo homes would be emotional\nFlags MTV's it is and how many of them do you have in your house you know majors is like a ... losing their electronics don't let it happen to you folks get whole how surge protection and again\nThe number to call is eight seven seven to two three two nine six eight\nWhether you're going to take advantage of the well I mean the water heaters\nUh the whole house water treatment a whole house generator or surge protection and again the

move on through three and four five six goes with the same time and you're going to pay off a house in a in about the same time as if you had done it the way you were thinking about it it really doesn't change the math that much to move with a baby steps away you removing it\nUm except the you're probably going to let your foot off the gas just a little bit which you should do when you're in

crazy in Phoenix and we were so fortunate because when we moved there was a very low the market and and we didn't have any debt so we could afford that was the only you know debt that we had we bought a house and then we paid it off I don't know\nIt was incredible journey it took full two years to pay it off and that was our gazelle intense so it was um it was hard it was hard um I Would just want to say what you do makes it different all through your marriage like we've grown so much\nAs a couple of going through this process this is not just to get out of debt show it's not just money it's your whole life in your marriage you know so I just wanted to mention that I mean it's been a fantastic journey credible I'm so proud of you who are your biggest cheerleaders yeah so my dad was a huge cheer leader\nAverage say my older brother damn\nYeah up now so it's a couple of family members on the good side yeah we're not on the dark so before shelter I [laughter] love us right way to go you ... yeah that's so cool so what started you're doing this what made you say we can actually pay off her house 'cause most people never bother\nYeah well because the journey happened so long ago the beginning of the journey he had come home from work one day and he just said hey I heard this guy on the radio talking about money I was always reading books about finance and he said chicken look at the sky and see what you think\nSo the next weekend your CDs came the ... the very first set of CDs came from that you had created I listen to do CDs and literally that day my life went from awesome that we had everything we can ever dreamed up our big house in our jet skis and so it was awesome until it was an awesome\nBecause we didn't own anything ... nothing and it was just so\nRude awakening and it was so scary to sit there thinking we don't own any thing and so that started the journey to lots of life happened in between the removed about five times before he finally settled in cave creek Arizona air got hurt on a construction job he was builder\nUm and when that happened that changed our life because he chose to go to college she said you know we need to go to college and that's what took the income down because I had to work and we cash flow to it yeah and then once that was all done\nI printed the amortization scheduled for the house and I brought it to him and I said I think we can pay the hell is often two years and I said you're crazy [laughter] but I really thought we could but this last two years has sucked it was hard to to you\nSo you do the three Ninety four really in two years or how much of the three Ninety four was the house was two hundred and forty thousand okay we did that to your ... two years\nYeah whoa that was the gazelle intense where we ate the gazelle 'cause we were so tired and rice and beans\nYou know yeah he cleaned up all the jet skis and the other stuff in the previous seven years yeah so then when you look down you go okay game on now we're going to do the house and you leaned into it with wild good that's\nRight 'cause he had graduated from college and got a good job I had my good job we were stable ready to go and we did it I Love it alone [laughter] well done well but we did it so Eric what kind of injury did you have\nUm what do you owe on rental property number one\nI'm we our number one we owe a hundred and seven or eight down what about one sixty five which are in a rental property number two um we owe one sixty five and it's worth about Ninety five\nRight you're making a little profit you might get a lot\nNow it's about a thousand a month I mean it's definitely not\nAnd all that that's you know when our ... know that your gross that's before you count like and see and major repairs that\nCome up so that's the gross cash flow the difference no rent the payment so twelve thousand dollars a year minus vacancy mine is a an occasional heating and air system or a roof occasionally you're you're making a little bit of money\nBut you know you yeah fire five ... five grand for around something like that I'm On a year something like that over our air raid I mean some years will be better than others and that constantly on a bunch of rental property shark and kind of do these things are my Dutch um\nThe uh uh ... and what your household income\n[noise] um so we bring about a hundred and ten grows to try and what do you own your home our primary um we just heard to stay on ten months ago we\nOwe to eighty worth about three hundred\nAnd ... and so he's saying um you've got a hundred and thirty and uh fifty or so so you got a hundred and eighty if you saw both of these give or take 'em expenses that you could throw at you or to eighty\nWhen that's right he's saying to do your saying we're making a little money um I like rental property these are good runners I think I Want to keep it and that's the discussion on my right\n[noise] yeah 'cause my thought is on and says breakdown we have about ten thousand dollars in and got the ad and you're saying that um we combined probably twelve thousand 'cause they took a we had a lot but we took a bite out of enjoyed after that so\nWe have any help you know the ... like baby steps are very clearly defined that you do write one before you do the other you can't shorten do them or you can have your plan but you can't call them up so I won't let you down you're going to do your plan okay if you're going to my plan you'd write a check today and be debt free\n[laughter] yeah the only reason I I was headed that is because not because you're doing airplane and they know it's just that the end of\nThe year is always really tough and light feel you know in Iran\nSo it was just there in the event that um my condition that don't come through for the next three nights I'm I was afraid liquidated Atlantic I don't think an actor and not being a tough spot so I figure on Christmas if everything goes wild than I Would just write the check\nMhm okay ... okay [noise] uh uh\nUh uh you know ... ...\nYou're not making a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them so they could slip on your pretty quick if a ... at a minimum you know a good compromise between the two every I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love real estate\nAnd I want to try and keep 'em if you want to keep them in the big one that got more margin in it and more equity in it is the most appealing to me\nThe three the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five one and so a migraine won and dumped the other one\nThe fifty thousand to move the needle much but the one that only got fifty thousand more equity you know making anything on that and that you're in a gash bread on that at all in which means that it could turn upside down on ya meaning if it went baking for three months you can be writing checks\nBy the year ... lose money on the house if you're a three months vacancy market chop it up so you just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is is is an asset in your situation even though technically okay forty charm probably dumping the little one as a ...\nBurma is between the two of you and um and if you're going to hold\nThe other one the new guys just got a you know we'll start working these baby steps the right way\nAnd following on through in getting the emergency fund done and get a proper emergency fund in place and and if your income as volatile enough that you need to have an additional account to cover of our income volatility to separate from your emergency\nFund than you could build that went up to\nAnd bill just some cash position so that you're not constantly you know in the lurch back and forth when you're making good money overall but you kind of living hand to mouth anyway\nAnd that and that's that's the cycle you're trying to break so good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Mike is with us in San Francisco\nHi Mike how are ya Hi Dave how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I just started in October here um and I got my that's when I got my start are set so I have um with the money make over um I got an eight hundred my emergency fund film among baby step on the first time I'm doing a budget and it's a mess it just seems like a just dial it in\n... and you're on every dollar um every dollar okay I Am and they're all going in\nA while and things like I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cough and then I just either it seems like it it goes over ... things that I think we're going to have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just dorm it\nYou've been doing it a whole two weeks yeah yeah\nWell that you're you're just takes a little while to get things adjusted the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're wrong put more in there\nBut you're always people are always spend more on food and they think they are I mean people go I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going you Donald there's just no way you know I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more\nReally quick I wanted to ask what should I invest in the financial piece university um I should I get that now are kind of get it after I'm done with my thousand just put everything in their first and\nThat's up to you I mean you you can decide what you wanted I don't want to just give it to you and that way not to worry about it\nOh [laughter] okay All right\nBut that way you can get signed up and get the every dollar plus going and that's one of your membership for that thing and then you get in the class you know you go to the non non lessons and you've got the online\nExperience and that's going to answer a bunch of these questions as well but basically if you just visualize a yellow pad forget every dollar forget a budgeting and all that and just go okay here's what I make\nAt the top of the page and then every dollar\nBut my ... not every one of those dollars needs an assignment going down the ... Exxon food and why on utilities and Z own rent and so on down the page until every single dollar has an assignment you don't have any leftover money in your budget\nIt isn't great out by made it it definitely the easiest one I've I've done other ones or in the past than this one is definitely the easiest is are\nThe Harlem and the problem is is you're facing your realities it's not the app and it's not the system even it's just the first time you do a budget you suck at it you know it just takes a month and then the next months you'll get better really about the third month you're doing it it'll be accurate\nIt'll take about the rhythm of about Ninety Days about three times through it and you'll go oh I'm not forgetting\nAll soccer picture it in Islam bounty on you know and we know what the food really cost and we know what the utilities really are and got a few things that are fixed that are predict the bombing Iran or your mortgage payment that's fixed thing we know what that is but some of these other things you're just you're taking your best guess and and it just takes a little while to get the trial and error or get the course\nOf course corrections done and get adjusted you'll get it meant mango and I'll have to pick up will get you signed up for financial\n\nSanctions ... or ... or ... or social producer named Dave Ramsey your host and we'll be back [noise]\nBoy production officer for the show and here's a little over two thousand and Eighteen [noise] go download our revamp Dave Ramsey show apple app store\nWe listening to your feedback in ... new features to make it even better check it out [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance\nAnd the other doesn't big difference if one of the parents die and that does happen\nTheir wellbeing would be destroyed paying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to Sandra insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and\nSee how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible it really does make you the hero of your story and they put you on course for better things ahead\nWFL I find hills ...

or not we should I buy a bigger house but that way with all taking\nIt on a mortgage and when we want to hear your\nMhm well\nI mean it's a personal decision I made a personal decision I don't go into debt and once I got out I don't think I could go back\nRight and that's kind of the you know that what we're thinking about um how are you know we could definitely that if it you know actually I Am on and we I\nKnow I mean you could benefit with fiber [laughter] but you bend it to do it I mean you know it's it's we want it it's definitely not need you have a house so ah two hundred thousand dollars how much do you make now what's your household income\nAbout twenty out then okay and you don't have any ... what's your home or you want to be that at all yeah we don't have any that\nThere was no payments in the world you're making two hundred grand how fast can you save two hundred right\nAbout that and you know it's out of the ... name [laughter] years fifty grand a year or two hundred and you want to buy a better house you're currently in the house unless you did this I bet I bet you could do it in a little over two\nHow about you want to house [laughter] well I guess now that in that the you know you go yeah but bad enough to going back\nSo this is ... ... ... you know I I'm picking on your just to make you think okay well you know I'm not just picking on your for the fun of it but here here's the thing what happened was shown on the line Jody when we went broke was we should never again\nNever again they'll take phone call\nIf somebody calls us collecting money\nIt's wrong number right okay and and life is God and there's nothing I Want bad enough to go back into the news again or the bar or a slave to the lender that's our decision that's how we decided to live that's what we teach people the goal is it's kind of like the holy grail that Ramsey show\nI get everything paid off so we can become very wealthy and ... and you're making two hundred thousand dollars you you're there now and then you're going to go back into this for a couple of bedrooms I couldn't do it\nIt makes me sad just hearing you talk about doing it but if you do it\nYou know you're just living a different things so you called me to ask me my opinion what would I Do when I drew once I drew the line and this and I said I never borrow money again no matter what is in if I Want something I have to get really creative about it or I have to really work hard to save up the money for it\nAnd I have to sacrifice other stuff to get it and then it makes me go a lot my lifestyle but I don't know like those two more bedroom so I'm probably not going to cut my lifestyle down to nothing to get this which is kind of what you just said and I show um which is okay that's okay choice you made the choice though but what that does is it allows us to buy something we can't afford\nShow I mean you can do whatever you want to do what you and I'll be friends I'm not really mad at you but you called the Dave Ramsey showing us to borrow money\nAnd it just new you're not ever going to get a yes on that one um so\nIt just makes me sad that you would go back in so I I Would 'cause I I think he doesn't stop and measure the freedom that you have the sense of peace that you have the economy turned down to ... for back then if you did that feel\nWhen the world's falling apart and you have a house paid for it gives you a different set of peace because I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere 'cause I've done research I've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures occur on them\nHome with a mortgage show we just we quit borrowing money so you do whatever you want to do will be your friend either way but the way I live my life is how I answer questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth\nAnd great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability and up terms and in downtime ...\nEnjoy to not have a ... year old\nNamed country wide on my back\nBank of America on my back can't even imagine it's been so long since I've had him that just\nJust oh I think I Would probably like to have an anxiety attack it would be bad Carl is with us in Pennsylvania had Carl welcome to the ... show\nUm there is a hundred and monitor his given up on a fifty eight for mortgage and about six thousand for her car um seven thousand or one medical bell for thousand for another medical bell a month out after another medical bill\nOkay how old is she sixty three why are you know power of attorney\nStarting to forget that um she kept getting checked out for the ... ah she's in the process of doing that and she had been been paying us that are on a budget and so now I'm taking care of her stuff\nWhat is your income um she makes ... about twenty eight thousand a year\nMhm okay and what is the ... were hired sorry what's the house worth\nUm my sister lives in it now and she kind of destroyed it I'm sure I'm where's your mother and my own apartment your\nMother is paying rent an apartment so that your sister can live in the house\nYeah so what's the house worse I'm guessing sixty five\nOkay okay so how fast is are you a throwing your sister out and selling the house\n... can't throw [laughter] she's on a date I Can't or\n\nAre you on the deed and loss on line how did she get on the deed [noise] um my sister has um a child with me so my mom wanted to make sure my niece had a place to lead so she put my sister on it\nAre you paying the it was your mother paying the mortgage\nThan not any more I was ... yeah I told my sister I Would not anymore you know everything everything's in my mom's name all the utilities everything as take 'em out yeah I Can't turn the heat off I Can't tell you tell the people don't trust me you're\nSitting there in the ... and her name [noise] um she has said that she can't because her deposits too high uh-huh 'cause she doesn't have to pay her bell so they [noise] they tend to posit too you know compensate for that\nBut you can see ... to pay the bill right yeah okay just to pay the bill that and that's it and she used to\nPay the mortgage today yeah okay I got rid of fifty eight thousand other debt good and one hundred and one thousand in student loans passes away when your mom passes\nAway yeah okay so we don't worry about those quit paying a shaded that we're paying the students that quip paint student loans so now I got\nSeven thousand dollars in some medical bills that does the rest of it we're just not paying your mom don't have any money she broke his apparently got dementia tremendous twenty eight thousand dollars a year she's sixty three years old you're living in an apartment\nWe have to make sure she's cared for first and that food shelter clothing transportation and utility she doesn't need transportation did you say there was a car and here does she need to be driving\n[noise] I'd say no you're the power of attorney yeah\nI Know that I've tried to convince her to sell her car and get a thousand dollar car 'cause fifty eight hundred dollars is a lot for a car so\nIt's not a lot for a car but it's a lot for a car for somebody that has dementia and I'm not sure they need to be driving right she can't remember to pay your bills country remember how to get home I'm scared for her\nThat was one of the time she forgot how to get home that's what started it\nIs it responsible on your part to let her drive the answer is no\nRight\nShe a lover you love or you don't want her to be hurt or to hurt someone for God's sakes definitely she could she could go driving often end up in Tennessee\nFrom Wisconsin and we'd have one of those silver alert or whatever they call them right yeah yeah\nNo I think we're going to I think we're going to do away with cars period oh okay now we're down to medical bills\nThese are very hard decisions for you right but you have to do your\nJob has the power of attorney and as a loving daughter is do things that are good for your mom regardless of who it upsets\nYour sister is upset your mother's upset I don't care\nYeah it's very hard for you to make those decisions but we're only going to do things that are good for your mom none of this you are doing is out of greed for yourself\nOK\nSo all the student loan people they get zip nothing nada\nOkay tell your sister she gets nothing not a zip sell the car now I'm Down to just a few medical\nBills and I think you can work your way through those with her income or at least get some kind of a payment plan going this very small and ah you can let that attorney's office know that basically she has no money what ... what is twenty eight thousand dollars coming in from\nUm he has a pension annuity for security\nOkay [noise] um than what I probably would do with these medical bills is let them know they're probably not going to get paid either except if I have a little extra money here or there after taking care of mom\nBecause I paid fifty on on on each one\nAnd it's okay if you won't pay twenty five or something or if if you can work out some kind of lump sum and you know five hundred bucks shuttles a whole dead or something like that clears up that's fine but here's the thing if they were to sue her do you know what they're going to get nothing because you know what she has nothing\nAll of the income that she has they cannot attach you can attach pension income you can attach Social Security income and you can't attaching annuity\nAnd so that she is what we called judgment proof because she's broke\nAnd so that puts you in a very strong position to talk to Mr or Mrs collections bottom feeder attorney when you do talk to them and just go here situation she's sixty three she's got dementia she has no assets in her only income as pension and Social Security she's judgment proof tell them I said that\nFrom Utah natural coach and he said they are judgment proof\nOkay and uh so what we'll do is we would like to clear this up but we're going to do it for pennies on the dollar so make me a ridiculous offer because that's the only way you're getting any money\nAnd play hardball with them because we got to take care of mom here yeah I'm not trying to I'm not trying to beat him by up I'm not trying to hurt anybody I'm trying to protect your mom\nAnd the last thing I Need it she she gets her food paid her lights and water her rant and she is taking care of only then do we deal with a couple of medical bills seller car sister gets nothing student loan gets nothing\nSo I I'm I'm saying this real kind of like 'cause I Want you to get all that down inside 'cause I Know these are going to be hard conversations for you\nYeah but you got to be our\nCars at your mom you're protecting okay exactly you can do it you can do it if you need some help\nYou call me back but just just play hardball with um tomes issues judgment proof my goodness for the story [noise] there's a reason to save for retirement ... not

had passed about Iran's sure well I'm so\nYou've summarized the beer industries reaction pretty nicely yeah they said were on top of this thing there was a drought and the Pacific northwest last year that affected probably production and so we're all aware of this and worrying about it and that's all nice but some of the people who look at sort of large scale farming say that\nYou know these are changes are gonna be happening on continent wide scale and that is going to affect drops when you have drought and heat waves we can engineer\nFor things like drought resistance but that actually might change the nutrient profile of the barley which might change the taste of the beer\nOr you know it's what's in it and you can editor for drought resistance but he resistance is a tough one and he is the thing that's going on what time of climate change and that might change these very basic chemical reactions that are going on in our late ...\nEarly barley and so that's why you have to move it north to harm it and you know you run out of north after a while and it becomes more expensive to do that sort of thing you're competing with other crops so the people who study these things on ... agricultural economics basis or not as sanguine as the industry on the other hand you know people\nLike beer and the industry is pretty innovative one in some way so you know maybe they will get on top of it it just shows is not cheaper though than like not having to worry about it\nYeah I think it's just pretty funny how quickly this story went viral you know obviously climate change a lot of people are always attuned to that but you throw in beer one of the authors of the study even said not sure what to make of the fact that in one day our paper on climate and beer has garnered considerably more attention than\nAny of their previous work on energy transitions air pollution death anything other than that you know it's like this you know you're missing when my beer and you know everybody's like interest in it right away Denver got a science reporter for buzzfeed news thank you very much for joining us thank you [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\nAll this month of October I've been putting in little stories and the podcast is trying to get everybody to get on the same level of Halloween that I Love to get every year\nThe one that caught my attention this past week\nWas that a child vampire burial that was found in Italy in some type of baby cemetery\nThere was this era discovery ... they found was the skeleton of a ten year old that had a rock lodged in his mouth they bury this child is way because they were afraid who's going to come back to life and contain the spread of malaria I spoke to my producer Miranda and we talked about this vampire burial site in Italy\nResearchers from the University of Arizona and also a university that Stanford\nWent on this gig in Italy and they found this\nChild cemetery and so inside of a miniature him in what used to be a gigantic ... they said it was about the size of a shopping mall if you can think about it like that they found a body of the ten year old child who died more than Fifteen hundred years ago the skeleton was lying on its side with its mouth open and stuffed inside a limestone rocks\nAbout the size of a big egg and like you said\nThey believe the child died as malaria\nSixty miles north of round and they said that the way that they buried this kid let's say that they ... already dead they opened an ounce for ... to the rock inside and then failed that\nExtra spots with cement so that they can be sure that the Iraq wouldn't come out right and they were able to determine how old the kid was by looking at the teeth depression\nAnd that's how they know that the rock was put in after he was dead because of those same impression right locally or they're calling it the vampire of little nano it's in this like you said is in this area which was like the center of witchcraft and the Roman empire at that time in Italy they said that this burial site has also been called the London a crop believe they bend beanie\nWhich is a cemetery of babies and they found all sorts of different stuff in his burial site you said it was like a huge villa\nAnd they found remnants of or in these trenches they're covered trenches\nThere was remains of infants toddlers aborted fetuses that had been buried alongside raven talents toad bones runs called dreams these things were filled with ash and sacrificial puppies\nYeah archaeologist call these deviant burials which is the ancient way of burying people who were they feared would have supernatural abilities like coming back from the dead or that the where people and like I don't know how this would apply to children but it had violated society's rules and ... vampire ...\nAnd a lot of these archaeologists and researchers saying it's stuff that they just didn't understand these illnesses like malaria at the time they probably didn't have a handle on it they didn't know\nWhat it was or why it was popping up and things that they feared they thought might come back from the dead that thought they were vampires that's why they took these extra steps to bury them this way so that they couldn't come back and continue to spread diseases\nAnd they would do all kinds of things like that were rituals I'd really he didn't say they were dumped honey cycle all over the place and these were just to kind of try to make it as your as possible so that these spirits would just pass along and not come back\nWe don't know the gender of this ten year old the skeleton that was there but they said that near this one was a three year old girl the the remains were three oh girl they found\nThat said there her hands and feet had been way down with stones which was another form of vampire burial to keep the evil away so that she couldn't get up they were able to dig in into the bones and the remains and they also found that she had died of malaria\nAnd they're saying that the reason why there are so many children's bodies that they had done extensive research on to find out yeah they all died for malaria is because it's Roman Empire section was considered to be assessed full of diseases and spread it through\nContaminated food and water and it was pretty swampy so they're a ton of mosquitoes and that's why there was so much malaria up until they pretty much figured it out in the Eighteen hundreds\nThese are not the only sight of these quote unquote vampire burials yeah northern Italy there was a woman who's buried with a break in her mouth almost the same thing like that you know a shape rock but this was brackets huge too that\nShe was dubbed the vampire of Venice and England there was another guy who had his tongue taken out and replaced with a stone\nSo it just seemed like that was one of the popular methods are probably a rituals to keep them from being able to come back from the\nDay but that guy in England is fascinating because clearly in the year two hundred if people aren't talking to each other so somewhere these people in England nearer to do this exact same type of ... and the people in northern Italy we're doing at the same time\nYeah it's interesting just what people will do when you fear or something you don't know how to control or react to it you go through these extra

we had completely\nInto I'm trying to find a way to help them and I would come in [noise] I'm trying to get a little bit better [laughter] I Know that I'm short on knowledge and experience so\nWhat's the what's the problem [noise] well the pollen is\nThey have kind of taking the on the dad is kind of taken on can be be collector and ... he's pressured his daughter and and with All right you should be um but she just not interested in ... she's not interested in being responsible for it\nI'm into they kind of cold here now into financial pieces while we are with them um but I don't know what's coming to you know\nHow she reacting now that she's in the class\nWell she's reacting in Iraq and like she she's kind of wanting to take it on\nOkay I'm there she have an income\nNow she doesn't really have an income she's well actually she does she's working part time um\nShe married no she's not married okay\nWell her first goal is to take what counts as a girl\n[noise] twenty five okay and why should not working fulltime\nI don't know ... the degree that she always being video editing and she hasn't been able to keep the job gets out of between a responsibility and it was bad decisions in our lifestyle\nOkay I'm kind of hearing spoiled brat\nAnd mom and dad coached on for a spoiled brat and then they're shocked she she didn't come out and become a a a great a citizen of the United states and pay her bills or are they shocked\nYeah\nYeah okay All right well I mean you're ended up being a family therapist you might want to send this family to your pastor to sit down and talk through this with them but the bottom line is legally they're both on this\nAnd that can play collector all he wants but let me teach you something about collecting you can't collect blood out of Iraq\nThere was no blood there and this girl and getting money you know why she didn't work much\nRight near her\nSo she's got to take care of food shelter clothing transportation and utilities first and then she pays on the student loan and if she has a one to then what change do take like five jobs\nAnd getting gear but that's going to be a shock to her little system does she didn't like she used to work and much\nNow so I mean that so what we're doing is we're training her to be an adult and um but you you know dad is ... walking around with his chest puffed out like he like he can just yell at somebody and that makes them have money\nDon't have any money she's broke because she didn't work\nSo I'm Glad they got her in the class so let's get her into let's tell her you need you treat her like she has a hundred thousand dollars to in London she's twenty five years old so she does\nShow her answer is you need to get six jobs live on beans and rice rice and beans live on a tight budget take into roommates sell so much stuff that the dog thinks she's next\nAnd you have no life ghetto cause you signed up for a hundred thousand dollars in debt get your budding gear go right that's what you would tell a single girl that was twenty five in your class with a hundred thousand dollars in debt wouldn't you\nIt's good okay then I'll look at mom and dad and they're in my class and if I if somebody came in my class and said a day we signed up because we were stupid way co signed for our daughter who doesn't work much and ah what are we going to about this hundred thousand dollars in debt I'm going to go do you just bought yourself a hundred thousand dollars in debt\nAnd so I Would put that in your debt snowball and I would get my button gear and pay it off because you're an idiot you coach Sunday is\nBecause it says in the Bible you're a fool if you ... for another\nAnd you may nicer than that but that's the message so uh you know but I Would put the responsibility on both of them and let one of them start working on the bottom of it and want 'em start working on the top of it and we'll see where they mate\nDoes if she doesn't pay it they get to if they don't pay it she gets to that is what coast only works are both on the stupid no so I treat them both like individual cases and let them start chewing on the top on them so she went on the bottom let's see\nThe biggest fights sir first there's the middle east from ... in the middle on this but I treat them both separately and then the as far as the in a personal relationship between these two uh you know if she won't work and all that kind of stuff and you may want to have the family should do as far as\nThis sounds like a family ... girl she's in a row of shows like this is the

it was a guy my wife knew from college came around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from it\nHad it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was\nAnd got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy anything other than\nFifteen to twenty two year\nTerm life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you\nThe best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker the shops several companies and get you the best possible deal whether\nIt's your car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind\nLetter brokers shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deal and that's why we've been divorced for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff

told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason he done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price own term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany

insurance you can shop most people saved three to eight hundred dollars a year\nOn their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business captive agent can sell for one company like a state for a major\nForeign nationwide and Asia\nPeyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent was it nationwide that's nationwide and\nAnd they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that what you're paying for those guys\nWhen you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of

to it I find a way you can eat that frame of paid off I home again and we're looking at whether or not we should I buy a house that way we all take\nA mortgage and we we want to get\nTo well I mean it's a personal decision I made a personal decision I don't go into debt and once I got out I don't think I could go back\nRight and that kind of the you know what I'm thinking about um how about you know we got point that if you know actually I Am on and we I\nKnow I mean you could benefit with Bob uh [laughter] but\nYou bend it to do it I mean you know it's it's one of his ... definitely don't need you have a house so ah two hundred thousand dollars how much do you make now what's your household income\nAnd that ten twenty okay okay and you don't have any debt but your home or you don't have any doubt at all yeah we don't have any guy\nOkay with no payments in the world you're making two hundred grand how fast can you save two hundred grand\nA point that you know it's ...\nYears fifty grand a year or two hundred and you want to\nBuy a better house if you can get the house unless you did this I bet I bet you could do it in a little over two\nI mean how about you want to house [laughter] well I guess now that in that yeah you know you go yeah but bad enough to go in that\nSo this is where this is you know I I'm picking on you just to make you think okay All right and I'm not just picking on your for the fun of it but here here's the thing what happened was Sharon in line Jodi when we went broke was we should never again\nWhen never again they'll take phone call if somebody calls us collecting money it's a wrong number\nRight okay and and life is God and there's nothing I Want bad enough to go back into the news again or the bar or a slave to the land that's our\nDecision that's how we decided to live that's what we teach people the goal is it's kind of like the holy grail that Iran's you show racket everything paid off so we can become very wealthy and ... and you're making two hundred thousand dollars you you're there now and then you're going to go back into this for a couple of bedrooms\nI couldn't do it it makes me sad just hearing you talk about doing it\nBut if you do it you know you're just living in a different thing so you called me to ask me my opinion what would I Do when I drew once I drew the line and this and that sort of never borrow money again no matter what is in if I Want something I have to get really creative about it or I have to really like work\nUm there is a hundred and ... they're not known to have fifty eight for him I goods and about six thousand for her car um seven thousand or one medical bell for thousand for their medical down I'm Down for another medical bill\nOkay how old is she sixty three\nWire you know power of attorney\n[laughter] starting to forget that um she kept getting checked out for the amounts that I should get a copy for doing that and she had been been paying us that type of budget out but now I'm taking care of her than what is your income\nUm she makes ... about twenty eight thousand air\nMhm okay and um what is the house you were hired sorry what's the house worth\nUm my sister lives in it and he kind of destroyed it I'm sure I'm where's your mother and my own apartment\nYour mother is paying rent an apartment so that your sister can live in the house\nYeah so what's the house worth I'm guessing sixty five\nOkay okay so how fast is are you a throwing your sister out and selling the house\nSide friday can't throw [laughter] she's on a date I Can't figure out\n\nAre you on the deed\nLast night\nHow did she get on the deed\n[noise] um my sister has um a child with me so my mom wanted to make sure my niece had a place to land so she put my sister on it\nAre you paying that is your mother paying the mortgage\n[laughter] I'm not anymore I was ... yeah I don't I Will say I was not anymore yeah everything everything that might not knowing all the utilities everything as take them out [noise] yeah I Can't turn the heat off I Can't tell each other because they want to it's kind of\nYour ... and her name [noise] um he has said that she can't because her the pilots too high mhm 'cause she doesn't tend to pay them so they [noise]\nThey tried to posit too yeah compensate for that\nBut you can see to pay the bill right yeah okay just to pay the bill yep\nAnd that's it and she used to pay the mortgage today yeah okay I got rid of fifty eight thousand of the debt good and one hundred and one thousand in student loans passes away when your mom passes away\nYet so we don't worry about those quit paying a shaded that quit paying us to know his dad quit\nPaying student loans so now I got so eleven thousand dollars in some medical bills\nThat does the rest of it we're just not paying your\nMom doesn't have any money she broke his apparently got dementia mess twenty eight thousand dollars a year she sixty three years old you're living in an apartment we have to make sure she's cared for first and that's food shelter clothing transportation and utility she doesn't need transportation [noise] did you say there was a car and heritage you need to be driving\n[noise] they know you're the power of attorney\nYeah I Know that I've tried to convince her to sell her car and get a thousand dollars a pack of fifty eight hundred dollars is\nA lot for a car so\nIt's not a lot for a car but it's a lot for a car for somebody that has dementia and I'm not sure they need to be driving right\nShe can't remember to pay your bills country remember how to get home I'm scared for her\nThat was one of the pound she forgot how did you get home that's what side of that\n\nIs it responsible on your part to let her drive the answer is no\nRight\nShe I Love her you love or you don't want her to be hurt or to hurt someone for God's sakes definitely not she could she could go driving often end up in Tennessee\nFrom Wisconsin and we'd have\nOne of those silver alerts or whatever they call them right yeah yeah no I think we're going to I think we're going to do away with cars period oh okay now we're down to medical bills\nThese are very hard decisions for you right but you have to do\nYour job as the power of attorney and as a loving daughter is do things that are good for your mom regardless of who it upsets\nYour sister is upset your mother's upset I don't care yeah it's\nVery hard for you to make those decisions but we're only going to do things that are good for your mom none of this you are doing is out of greed for yourself\nOkay so that all the student loan people they get zip nothing nada okay tell your sister she gets nothing not a zip sell the car\nNow I'm Down to just a few medical bills and I think you can work your way through those with her income or at least get some kind of a payment plan going this very small and ah you can let that attorney's office know that basically she has no money what ... what is the twenty eight thousand dollars coming in from\nUm he has a pen someone I knew it in for security\nOkay I'm than what I probably would do with these medical bills is let them know they're probably not going to get paid either except if I have a little extra money here or there after taking care of mom\nI was I was in\nThe evening I paid fifty on that last month on each one\nYeah it's okay if you won't pay twenty five or something or if if you can work out some kind of lump sum and you know five hundred bucks settles the whole dead or something like that clears up\nThat's fine but here's the thing if they were to sue her do you know what they're going to get nothing because you know what she has nothing\nAll of the income that she has they cannot attach you can attach pension income you can attach Social Security income and you can't attach an annuity and so that she is what we called judgment proof because she's broke\nAnd so that puts you in a very strong position to talk to Mr\nAnd Mrs collections bottom feeder attorney when you do talk to them and just go here situation she's sixty three she's got dementia she has no assets inter only income his pension and Social Security she's judgment proof tell them I said that\nOnly ... the natural coach and he said they are judgment proof\nOkay and so what we'll do is we would like to clear this up but we're going to do it for pennies on the dollar so make me a ridiculous offer because that's the only way you're getting any money\nAnd play hardball with them because we got to take care of mom here yeah I'm not trying to I'm not trying to beat him by up I'm not trying to hurt anybody I'm trying to protect your mom\nAnd the last thing I Need it she she gets her food paid her lights and water her rent and she is taking care of only then do we deal with a couple of medical bills seller car sister gets nothing student loan gets nothing\nSo I I'm I'm saying this real kind of like 'cause I Want you to get a little that down inside 'cause I Know these are going to be hard conversations for you\nYeah but you got to be our cars at your mom you're protecting okay exactly you can do it you can do it if you need\nSome help you call me back but just just play hardball with him terms as she's judgment proved my goodness what a story [noise]", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city":
