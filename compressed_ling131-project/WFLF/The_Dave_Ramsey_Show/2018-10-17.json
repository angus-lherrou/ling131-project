but I Love the rabies too so hey the best one was oh\nWell that day the best football team play on that but I Do yeah I don't think that those guys would agree with that there was a bad day it was\nBut um so you you've done that travels several times you've done some other NFL work as well so some of the other teams have called and you increase or going to both been available to them and and helping them when you're meeting with those guys I'm ... and they're asking you money questions what's coming up\nYou know day this is the main thing that's coming up hey I'm young I'm twenty two years old I was only making maybe five thousand dollars a year my first check was Fifteen thousand\nAnd I'm gonna get another one next week it what do I do\n... how do I spin is how do you keep from being overwhelmed overwhelm money with the pressure with family how do I tell my mom no should I tell my parents\nKnow how do I tell my friends know um should I go by this car\nAlmost any names but there are some um you know rookies out there that I've had the opportunity to to to mentor and they're you know they they they are going out there and buy some big things and other rookies are seeing that are saying well wait shit I Do that and I'm like no no no do not do that and to save your money live on a plan live on a budget\nAnd with the coolest thing was with the ravens I could say this was all of them sign up for every dollar a couple of weeks ago um and all of them get every dollar play and so there was like ... how do we do this and it was surprising to see that a lot of kids did not know how to budget\nEither twenty two year old Twenty one euros making nearly um on average sucking the low end is about Fifteen thousand dollars a game so it's about sixty thousand dollars a month to about two hundred thousand dollars a month and they didn't know how to budget that so I'm just excited because I'm seeing them saying hey I Want to help\nYou know these guys are tech to me they're they're calling me Kate how do I do this how do I invest what is Dave say about this issue is real cool to see these young players want to be good on the field but they also want to make the right decisions off the field as well\n[noise] I was telling a leadership team this week that I was talking to the river passers we were with yesterday that aren't you can't attribute\nA life skills both to someone just because we're successful in one area\nOr answer if you get a twenty six year old music star yeah um well they're good at music but what happens is we see them being very successful there even me I'm fifty eight I Know better I've worked for the NFL players for Twenty years off and on\nAnd um I Know this is a a a world clash one half of one percent athlete\nUm but they are twenty two guests there and the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills are developed\nThey are the size of a key up yeah [laughter] but I don't mean that their life skills have developed at the same level and you know so it it's it's kinda weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps as like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes\nUm because he still is football skills are are the best on the planet you\nI'm In his physical acumen his physical uh IQ the things you can do this body in mid error or it's just circus like it's amazing\nI have that I I Would think an unusual question but maybe not I have a twenty year old granddaughter she is living on her own now um she was working full time more than ... when she lived in Aurora [noise]\nBut um [noise] had to move into she's renting a room for hours away from the Denver area and she was only able to get part time she is still making her bell she died she doesn't know about a random the I I've been trying to get her into a class I Will at some point\nUm and she does have a car payment cheese making it she you know has room rental room she's making that [noise] um\nBut just barely if you could imagine I'm working at a rally part time [laughter] so uh the problem is that she is making it but now she just found out she had I not for but I went to ... in her mouth all the cat to come out\nIt will be willing to the south and why our\n... why did she move away from our income right\nThe high um it was a dangerous area her house with being shot up her father's ... with blown up at her house on it with a life threatening situation um she walked into the house twice that we've sat being people in there and I\nGot that burger had jobs right\nHe had a job\nAnd she ... she moved so far away that she couldn't do that job when you can move out of the hood and move into a decent area and keep the job\nWell she couldn't find a wrinkle in the Denver area that was within her range chief out yeah I Know yeah I mean do do the Denver a very very expensive and kill area and so she moved somebody offered her room over in a\nLot of faith ... shows so she got into a mess 'cause she overreacted and I'm jumped away from her income without an income set up on the other end and now she's dialed up I'm Out\nShe had to have to tell you that the company she was working for a promise cherry they transfer to fulltime even their home so when she when they had told her yeah we'll we'll give you a full time day or two we understand\nAnd so she got there and all of a sudden it without right now it's part time it will working full time but now it's like I Gotcha so she didn't she didn't move thinking she was having all got ya okay fulltime\nSo Bob are you asking should you help her with her wisdom ah with some situation\nOh I Would yeah I I Will help her as much as I can with her with Keith ... um is there any other ideas I mean what does money went to the ...\nYeah I Know yeah they have jobs ...\n... you have to let her\nShe made the decision says he has to live with the consequences of that decision understand you want to help her as a granddaughter but at the same time as young millennials they need to start feeling the weight of their decisions if they make a bad decision\nMom and grandma ... grandparents sitting not come to help them out all the time I made one bad decision Dave my dad kicked me out the house\nAnd he said hey you're going to learn from that cost acquaintance because he knew that the only way that I could really become the young man that I was going to become so\nWe brought a ... I wouldn't help her as much I agree with ... she needs to get multiple jobs she left a good job I have friends in Denver I understand you're saying it's expensive but it's not that expensive to where she had to move that far away for a good solid career path that she had going on\nYou know so until these people come in with a fulltime you work through those things you waitress you ... you know ... feet soon as you babysit your dog walk you do other stuff to backfill and and that'll get her where she can eat yeah and if you want to help her out with the wisdom teeth expense there's nothing wrong with that\nUm but I'm not going to go along with the idea that somewhere in this process she was forced to write\nAnd she's a victim of or circumstance or she overreacted or circumstance gay and um when you told me that the people cannot live in Denver because rent is high on there's a whole lot of people living in Denver proving your own proving yeah and I'm a show you know you've got that ... you know\nShe just use that as an excuse and said I'm outta here I'm going to another city\nAnd did not have her feet solid under but your work three four jobs and then the other thing comes in its full time job and you can drop a couple of those and maybe you can help her with the wisdom teeth and help her make to make the\n... the my turn their financially Ted is with us in Kansas City Hi Ted you're question for Anthony\nAnthony um [noise] I have two daughters they're both doing very well eighth and ninth game four O. one K. question neither one want anything to do a bit\nMore fabulous favors and givers [noise] I'm In ... I'm the one is making a ton of money she's a welder she's on the road she saves money great and she's starting to do the four oh one cave my question is should I advised her\nTo just go to a Edward Jones or someone or a ... one of your piece or do her work ones and keep transferring now\nDo you know for work was are matching matching her as well\nAnd and I that's the question is is you get the packets she'll she her she's a welder show Ron thanks you could be there for three months she could be there for six months so but they do all we send to the retirement pay for our country and have lead to get into that so I guess that would be the question if they are matching it would be worth the\nRolling it over every time she changes jobs\nExactly yeah yeah that's exactly right up so that and then in addition to that on the side that the two have stability peace in their lives are just ... was a smart rush for pro and then the ... each time but you're saying she's working short stance and so she's going to end up with ten or Fifteen of these little for one maybe four one K. someday\nShe could write so should cheat each time she leaves were over there and they're stable one she has\nYes yep yes always take your four one K. with you and do direct transfer roll over when you leave always do that um but it that they technically or won't each one will technically be a separate account number but you can still look at the whole\nYou know your whole portfolio in one place than from all the different rollovers and stuff as you go alone so good question I Would question\nEighteen years old that's amazing that is amazing yeah best debt free welder she's making anywhere between eighty two hundred thousand dollars a year in already starting to invest in two or four one K. day that sounds like an everyday millionaire to me I think\nIt is like this is talk of the dad in every day and ... and it's very good well he's taught him well I mean they don't have debt

actual about the actual subject um and ah and that's and that that a lot easier to do\nUh I I it was one of the things I mean just to a um since you rarely ... ah one thing that was\nReally impressive to me was as that whole you know we just lived in the last ten years through everyone's against same sex marriage too it's by far the majority law the land\nUm and you as a pastor of a large church and someone who was in the political sphere even though he didn't want to be necessarily you just kind of got dragged into it because of bomb I kept going you or\nWould you go with if you're living in those are the Obama he never said it that way [laughter] but I'm just pointing out that you never saw the limelight on it you know um but you were then cast in this position that I Would never have wanted to be an of\nThinking what you did about ... about the definition of marriage based on a scripture\nAs you had honestly understood and interpreted it and and you managed to stay absolutely true to to your beliefs on that and also a there was a a a a friend of a friend who was a very big a\nProtester against you know everyone who was against same sex marriage he was very very hard core for same sex marriage on a kind of angry opposition people uh if you were on this on the you know keeping marriage as it was before\nUm and up and he he was a ... he was a gay man who are just really want to gay marriage or in in ... and he got what he got we wanted um he rode a thing that was linked to something you said about this of if the other side of this argument was like this guy\nI we wouldn't have nearly the problems we have you know because um because it was it was it was the actual argument about you know what\nIs the difference between the law the land versus what we can think morally and ... you know those two how do those to interact with each other um anyway I worried that really inarticulate Lee but it was it's it's something that's really hard to do but sometimes I feel like you've done well and this was when President Obama called me about this you know he he made that distinction and he said\nWe're talking about civil law here not religious law\nUm and I think that is the key you know we all live in a land where we want\nFor everybody to be treated equally and with respect regardless of what they believe 'em and there's a difference between that and being a part of religious community where you want scriptures to define how you carry on your life you know there's just a it's easy distinction to make and the reason that the\nPresident told you about it and that you've got to have a voice uh you know at that level or is because I I don't know how the conversation went but I can almost guarantee that you didn't say so using a man's you'd be able to marry his own daughter [laughter]\nActually I bet you didn't see you're annoyed today [laughter] no actually he\nCalled me to protect me because he knew he I'd be beaten up from our relationship with him yeah that is true and and turned out he was a profit on that are on Oh yes\nSo uh but but the reason I'm saying that is because of all of this stuff has to do with a ... not only gaining more information and having more constructive conversations but the amount of credibility that you can build overtime by purposely avoiding\nTrying to always be right but you are trying to understand actually even more than you're trying to inform is is it's it's a very important thing so\nUm that's all the time that we have today that was that I enjoyed today oh that was this was great it was good because we especially 'cause we agree on everything I Know of an inch tacky joke package or the person that is good thanks are listening we'll see you next time on the bright side\nFor listening to the bright
