been seen in a long long time because nobody has the equipment the play but many more if there is a member of the family who once upon a time carried a video camera to advance beta max probably VHS something like that maybe even super great film\nA that stuff has just been sitting around somewhere on watched because nobody has a Supreme projector anymore or ... or VHS\nTape player so what do you

now you can the only thing keeping you from seeing it is the equipment to watch them\nWell there's a company that makes all of this possible now it's called legacy box may have made memories come

these internally youthful appearance is is a former White House communications director for Trump\nAbout eight team days and he remains you got a new book out\nUm and it's it's I forgot the title of it but he's making his rounds emails and Hannity last night and Hannity said why did the Democrats even have a shot in Fifteen days and it's a question a lot of people who in the world would vote for Democrats why would you vote for anybody\nThat he's promising to wipe out all the progress why would you vote for any party that wants to literally shut down the progress and here's what the ... had to say it's because of the media\nProbably Sean I mean I think that could be one of the main reasons most people predicted that the house and so forth goes to the other side\nBut the president is demonstrating that he can get the voter turnout even in a midterm election and so I think she'll be very close I mean you're not going to be surprised our friends are not going to be surprised Rush Limbaugh is not going to be surprised if the Democrats um don't win or don't ...\nOkay but again you're always measuring then back against that what it's costing you a what I pay a thousand dollars a year for ten thousand dollars worth of insurance no\nRight no but what I pay a hundred bucks for that policy in this situation maybe that is really high for a forty year old per thousand you see what I'm saying\nSo you know it's just a matter of relative cost to the amount of coverage and and just does it give you sticker shock when you look at it the last thing of course as if you remain uninsured the long term your goal would be the same\nAs it would be for those who have insurance and that is by getting out of debt and building wealthier need for insurance goes away\nOkay because if you have a million dollars in your four one K. and you have no debt house or anything and you die your wife can probably make it\nOkay the medical ... that's called self insured in other words\nOkay with the increase maybe the amount of the emergency found at all if I'm remain in trouble\nProbably yeah yeah I'm ...\nYou know just because again she's going to be facing something and that would be part of your self insured wealth building picture that we're trying to do for long term and we go for that either way I mean the goal is raise the kids get them out of the house so they're not there to have to be fed right\nA goal is to get the house paid off and everything else paid off and then build a huge mistake if you've done those three things you know somewhere in your fifties or sixties you becomes completely self insured maybe sooner because your wife would be okay if you left or behind with a huge pile of money no debt the kids are gone that makes sense\nAnd so we work towards that that's why we suggest term insurance instead of one of the reasons we should disarm insurance because ... as you are finding out runs out so it's a couple of three suggestions or but I'll tell you this I think within five years you're in trouble\nOkay if you stay clear of the diabetes if if the diagnosis doesn't recur\nSo on but designer can tell you more or it used to be that if you had diabetes or cancer or heart you were just done no no no amount of time but the insurance market has gotten much more sophisticated in analyzing your actual situation case by case and those three things do not\nPermanently mean no life insurance ever\nKnow again you know cancer diagnosis two weeks ago you're not in trouble you know but if you've been clear of cancer free for five years and somebody told you never get insurance you may be able to get insurance\nAnd start to look at that rate it but it won't be you won't get premium prices but you check on that folks you check on that no calls and talk to him no dog either it Susan is with us in a way of I don't push the wrong button Susan's with us Susan there she is on is with us in Raleigh North Carolina Hi Susan how are you\nHi

and I'm an event planner\nVery cool good for you guys welcome very good so tell me the story what happened thirty nine months ago they put you on this journey well not forty years ago we were\nGetting ready to get married yeah eight and that so we had a tiny and she'll talk\nWe realize that we thought had about the same amount of\nAnd going into a marriage and salary and we knew that that would limit our options and in life you know we wanted to move somewhere or you know such jobs things like that and so we knew we wanted to be that phrase but we didn't know how that was all we knew at that point and\nAnd wave at that point that you know that that's really normal and it's just part of being an adult\nSo we didn't know it was possible and that\nA few months later when we got married and we had a few people mention Dave Ramsey and financial these University in passing and we couldn't really put a lot of weight on it like okay that's coal and this sounds sounds complicated no thanks [laughter] and and then I was out at lunch with my friend Tasha and I\nShe had her wallet with her and I made fun of her and I was like how your mind is huge but do you have in here and she's hell you know my envelopes are in there and so I finally had asked like okay fine explain what this envelope deal is to me because I've been hearing it I don't know what it's about\nAnd so she told me about your podcast and Irish and on my way home and I you know it just kept listening and I finally talked about it and they said you know\nThere's I either they ran the guys then mentioned to me a few times and it looks like he has\nA financial plan and tired of that is getting out of debt and maybe that's just something that we need to like entail mhm and that was about a month after we got married and and months after that we started our first I\nHad him interact PM so I didn't know he was supposed to participate in that and how I did the budget on my own and I presented it to him and I said you know if you're willing to do that and he wise and and I was like if you're willing to this I Need you to sign this\nMade me so they may I signed a contract\nYeah yeah she knew you know I I was cautiously optimistic yeah um because\nAgain I had kind of lost that hope of I Would ever be out of debt I remember thinking praying like man it'd be nice to just be zero again you know starting a zero\nBut she made me sign it and I was like are just going to be like a a diet fat you know the next fad for a diet you get on it for two or three weeks and next thing and you know you get back to eat and um so\nShe made me sign it and you know I stuck to it you know if I put my name or something yeah I got a deal yeah big deal that's that's my name that's my word is my bond you know she made me sign it\nAnd she knew that I was very good I like that\nWow that's fun yeah and so there's ... there's zero base budget was born at your house ship well and it's game on yes they\nMonitor the months later we take a few are actually coordinated team and the first of all you know and we've done in about five times sense how\nYeah thank you how me course Dave and I I just take a few moments you know to the to the listeners and and those are you watching it on YouTube coordinator nephew class you don't have to have the answers Dave and his team on the video have the answers you know it's nine classes over nine weeks just take two hours a week that's Eighteen hours\nMm okay okay [laughter] All right well I think the question 'cause I was wondering about ... percent and I was thinking you know would be on are you waiting thing that doesn't sound like they're from the ... so\n... just a temporary thing it's not that I don't like you investing in four one K. when you get to be here for you\nEasily with no payments in the world except the house payment can put Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement but the problem is you're delaying how long you get there and here's what happens the things that we focus on in our life\nOr the things we're good at are you married\n[noise] no I'm Single I Am twenty nine years old\nOkay are you dating [laughter] yeah ... relationship\nYeah I've been married for three years in actually trying to make that next that you know it can go next year or so\nOkay so have you noticed that while you're in this stage of\nYou're dating how focused you are on her\n[laughter] [laughter] what you focus on you're good at have you noticed that [laughter] that is true\nYeah and and so you know it is ... and it's a behavior saying it's a psychological thing it's a spiritual thing it's an emotional thing and that is that ... and so it's more that's more of the reason to stop the investing in the math\nTen percent that you're putting in is not going to cause you to get out of debt that much faster but what does he is when you're like all in\nA mall and like you are with her you're all in ... you're all in okay you're focused you're concentrating and and that's that's what we want you to do with the debt here for a short period of time I want you to be all and I'm not doing anything I have no life I'm\nFocused on working extra I'm selling stuff I'm not doing anything ... beans and rice rice and beans um get now\nOkay then when we get you out of that and that that's what gets me ... more than the mathematical manipulation so that's what's important about temporarily stopping you're investing when you're in baby step too and that's why we suggest that hold on I'll have Kelly pick up will send you a copy of the book the total money make over\nAnd it'll help explain that a little bit further for you\nThan a is with us in Sioux City Iowa how do they how are you\nTied eight and a huge fan I think that you and your name and talking to people that my name's square on two [laughter] ... I'm Sorry how can I help I'm calling about my um\nMy youngest brother he's Twenty years old and four years ago he read from behind a highway speeds ... my parents are going into litigation for what his future will be like um\nKids in a job training program kind of just learning basic skills like how much and you know big groceries things like that\nSo many and I got a brain in an area that's yeah I hear that\nA brain injury a lot of memory as you can um and coffee and so I'm not really sure how to you know my dad I Do some research and I was like well I'm going to call Dave and she like he would say about 'em they're legal stuff as far as hot as secure as a future for Daniel that he'll be taking care of ...\nI'm Sorry what a sad situation I assume they have an attorney right thank you yeah\nMhm and they've assessed the ability to ah that that the person they hit them had insurance\nAnd or assets that make it worth chasing them around right\n[noise] yeah it's been a long process over four years just kind of thing what would happen with Daniel or this time frame that now that the effects of this accident so\nWell there's a I mean there there's not a magic thing but a a a good attorney in this situation should be able to help you run the numbers out that basically has a\nYou know the the this accident has taken away his earning ability for the next sixty years that's a very expensive\nThing that he is lost that they need to pay him for\nMillions and millions of dollars mhm is what he would have learned in his working lifetime is now gone\nYeah\nAnd so to offset that due to the accident is the liability of the person that caused the accident and you don't have to be an attorney to know that okay so the calculation of that I'm ... and ... you know could we get a big enough lump sum that it that a lump sum invested\nCauses a you know Daniels income to never be a problem again and so if you take a million dollars and invest it and then you know as an eighty thousand two hundred thousand dollar income the rest of his life\nAs an example you see what I'm saying and um and that's probably not enough but I mean that's that's a ... that's an example of a calculation to offset what he would have potentially earned in his working lifetime because that was stolen from him\nBecause of this accident and uh I'm not being angry towards the person that I have no idea of the conditions of the accident but that's just the liability that that person and their insurance company has as ... as a result of law okay and your attorney David ... already told you all all of that that some basic thing\nIs like business law one on one okay the very first movie learns I kind of stuff so um\nYou know once you do that then you're saying we were replacing his lost income and certainly then medical bills in addition to that\nAnd uh and medical bills would include any kind of job training we can do to help him have a quality life skill or you know anything we knew increases quality of life going forward right\nBut there's not a magic number to figure this out is just a ... there's a calculation you can do to estimate these things and you know all of those things added to gather makes the\nUh you know the the settlement negotiation with the insurance company go on now they may be in there probably is um limits to the insurance coverage\nAnd there are limits not to the liability but to the assets that the person has let's say this person had basically no money and the insurance companies on the hook for half million dollars you negotiate the rest of your life and you're not getting more and a half million dollars 'cause guys broke and you can't get blood out of Iraq\nOkay in so you sue him into oblivion and it won't do any good suing people to make my money it just takes money they do have\nIf you win and I'm obviously you'd wind here\nBut um but it take a long time so the settlement may be that the insurance that is the person carried maxed out and max is out of their life at their assets\nNow if that person is worth two million dollars in the insurance company has a million dollars then your maximum you're going to get out of this three million dollars take everything that person had if you wanted to do that\nAnd get the million dollars other insurance company to Megan from that person they solve everything they've got and give it to you or or give it to Daniel in this case and so that that's how the calculation works but what most folks don't realize because this is so emotional so tragic is\nThat the math is limited by the insurance companies max pay in their policy and the assets of the person that hit them\nThose two things that are together is the most you're going to get that 'cause there's no magic money doesn't just appear because some tragic and this is definitely\nTragic for a situation I'm so sorry you all are facing it\nBut that's that's how your math all shake out so what I'm going to be doing is investigating what the ... on the insurance policy is and the asset base of the person who hit them that's the thing to piece of information I Want a real quick because then it doesn't matter if calculate ten million dollars is the settlement also if there's nobody gonna pay it\nOf course can pay us [laughter] this is Dave Ramsey show [noise]\nHey guys this is James Giles producer of the Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on the hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you and Dave Ramsey dot com last show\nDid you know that fifty six percent of homeowners are over paying for their insurance and one in three drivers is doing the same thing\nAlmost seven hundred dollars that they do they check\nOkay so I'm just going to seven hundred dollars as an example\nOkay well let's start with that you're twenty three a show in forty years you would be sixty three does that sound right that's right okay if you're investing and if you average twelve percent you'd have about eight million dollars in your four one K.\nRight now let's understand the seven hundred\nFifty two earners not fit to twelve times and then we said forty times so out of that eight million dollars\nThree hundred thousand of it is money that you put in\nAll the rest of it is gross\nSo we're seeing like Ninety eight percent of the money in that account when you get to age sixty five in our example large sixty three in our example okay Ninety seven percent Ninety eight percent of ...\nAnd the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and
