right\nWell there's a rule that we have discovered in these types of conversations and it's called the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder but they don't really want your opinion about money or sex and so your mother is not going to take an Eighteen year olds input\nOn her spending habits you don't have standing you don't have credibility with her to have that discussion and that's what you're discovering am I wrong million around at all\nYou know it's just difficult now you know when you're fifty eight and she's Ninety six or something yeah she may take your input those days right that's a different that's a different parent child relationship than an Eighteen to whatever and so\nYou know you have to build some credibility so the only thing I Would tell you that there was a couple of things [noise] um one is I Would not bring up her spending again unless she brings it up\nOK okay too I Would tell her lots of stories about the times that you used to mess up mom I used to spend and do this and I used to do this and man when I got on this budget I got on this humble up system I got on this plan to get out of debt I'm doing so good and you just tell your story\nBecause your story is not condemning her\nIt's just lose just holding up the idea that there's hope right\nTo tell your story and talk about how you're winning doing these things and that changes everything for you then the second thing you can do is is is there anyone like maybe your dad who could sit down and talk with her and the two of them actually start getting their act together\nWell I'm actually against my dad has talked to her he's actually one of the people that we should call and we both watch his show\nMhm oh okay well this was his job not yours is what I'm saying and sunny ah this would be like a husband now calling now that's a little different standing and he puts his arm around his wife and says look we got a problem here you're spending like you're in Congress\nI mean we got to stop this there's a problem here\nAnd when you sit down and work through this issue together and we've got to put together some kind of a plan where we have a good life\nAnd we have a good life meaning we spend some money now and we invest and save so that we have to live like no one else so later we can live like no one else but really this is on your dad to do this is not on you you real 'cause you're he's got standing he's got\nPosition in the household to have a discussion where as an Eighteen year old you don't and um it's not just you obviously are very sharp and you can do all kinds of things for you I'm not saying you're not good or you're not whole or whatever I'm just saying in your mom's eyes you're still that little baby she used a diaper\nAnd it's just hard for her to take advice from you but now her husband that's a different thing\nAnd um you know he can sit down and if it wasn't my house on insurance I Would just sit down and we have a discussion going this is this is something we're not doing here and there's a problem and we've got to work through this and so he's put up with is a long time\nAnd it's time for him to deal with it now that that's what I'm

your butt off we pay off almost a hundred and twenty four hundred and twenty thousand seven hundred and forty ... forty two dollars in one once I got it and how long did this take\nWell it took six years but for\nThree years when we really started following\nYour we're finally on the same page at that point that we are a little faster\nThen yeah I was a dragging my feet got it and you're a range of income during that time well we were broke twenty ... twenty five thousand and we just accept a new jobs and right now are making a hundred and twenty five and ... what are you all do for a living\nI worked for advertising agency in Oklahoma City and then on the store manager at the coach store at I'm In Oklahoma City very cool and or your wife like sandbags that early and do we\nYeah she's got a pretty good collection [laughter] she deserves anything she gets that is right up with me\nSo well done you ... your you know how long you been married seven years in All right so a year in a marriage or start within three years later you kick it into high gear for sure tell me about the journey what happened and and show other people how it's done\nAnd right after we graduated we had so much in school that and and we just we need to get rid of this and and\nI grew up in a single family home than my mom worked really really hard and you know I wanted to say I want to take every advantage that we had and get our you know get everything in line and be successful or not you know\nAnd I felt in titled like I deserved a jeep wrangler and I work too hard and so we really were fighting and I just felt in title I was acting like a little boy and I needed to be coming man and I just I she deserves better and I just I had to [noise] you know what my pride down\nTo what happened what what was the breaking point what kicked it into gear because obviously you flipped an obvious ... the way she looked at you just then when you said that was a ... and it was it was really the way every man wants his wife to look at them know what you just did was incredible so tell me about that one huh well\nMainly just argued a lot and you wanted to have a very healthy and happy marriage and I just remember standing in the kitchen three years ago and he held my face in his hands and he was like we are going to get rid of the S. and I think and\nWe just finally got on the same page and it sounds like we're connecting mhm um because you mentioned a lot that when your priorities on the line in your budget your priorities are aligned in your marriage and so for us that was kind of just something that was really important ...\nYeah and I just I didn't have any hope I didn't think we could do it what\nWhat flipped ... which I got this we're going to do this\nWhat happened um I just\nI think I just didn't want to hurt her anymore Mm hurting I Love her so much and I just\nDon't want to it just wasn't fair to her and I was the one who's spending money and going out to eat doing whatever I Want to do and so\nAnd I was hearing your not important yeah finally we're like we're the most important thing in on us and we need to get our finances and mine and be on the same age and our our life moving\nForward and so at that point it's game on yeah and what what kind of income where are you making at that point three years ago I think the ... the thing about eight and okay so you're still come up from ... to one twenty five during that three years yet area in Russia or cool so then okay you've made the decision were on the same page then what happened\nTo make a budget and it kind of\nIt was I felt constricted at first and then I kept listening to your show and it's like almost like give me permission to spend money and I felt safe to spend money it wasn't like oh this is going to cost me a night on the couch and so like okay we're on the same page and I felt an acting more when\nAnd that's that sixty five when they get sixty seven eighty or the year and it's kinda Mac second day when I say it's passed out\nThere you go you're under funding it automatically then so that's perfect yeah yeah I Would put the whole five thousand through there which is going to save you about Fifteen hundred dollars a year\nThat's a nice benefit definitely thanks thanks appreciate the call Andrews next in Canada hey Andrew how are you\nOn the border but you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so we have just recently paid off our house and the U.S so we are completely dead free and I just wanted to ask you a question about next steps okay\n[noise] okay so we live in a\nTwo bedroom townhouse it's pretty tight we have a family of four and go on on the way\nMhm so we\nAre a moral case here for a little while but in the next few years we want to say about and pay cash for a large ... good\n... so my income\nIs roughly a hundred thousand a year my wife know that she is on the curry leaf really we've been making anything\nIs she going back to work she won't eat no okay so you have a hundred thousand dollar household income what's your town Ellsworth two hundred and forty to fifty and when you move up what what price would you move up to\nRoughly four hundred\nOkay she and a hundred and sixty thousand it's gone up in value during that time so you need a hundred and something thousand dollars how long has it gone tricky to save a hundred and something thousand dollars\nWho our question is fine I Am quoting away the Fifteen Percent a month long ... ... on my employer match is four percent mhm\nSo we we have the Nineteen percent there that's going Nineteen percent of my income that's going into retirement mhm my question is what makes sense to go back to three baby step three D.\nNo and you know you know what a what is your age or I'm thirty and my wife is going on okay\nWell you got plenty of time you're going to be OK I'm into here here's what's gonna happen during the next three years five years whatever it is your income going to go up and the value of your town house is going to go up where's the value of what you're trying to buy is going to go up to right [noise] but is so we're not dealing with a fixed\nItem to do forecasting with the fixed item your your income is not fixed it's you and you're going to see some increases and the value of the town houses not fixed and of course your target is not fixed\nUm and so we don't know exactly where you're going to end up there\nBut um no I I Would say at Fifteen Percent if I were in your shoes and then I Would just save aggressively I Would take extra jobs any other money that come your way inheritance is bonuses anything else the role that in the house fund don't consume it anytime you can get your hands on anything just do it in the house fun though in the house fun though it in the house fun\nAnd um but we know if you save thirty thousand dollars a\nYear that in three years and some change you'd have another hundred thousand but with this town house you'd almost be there\nSo I think your three I think you've got three year plan you might have a four year plan something like that while doing the Fifteen Percent but it's going to be tied there'll be a tight budget to do that but you got trashed by not going to send you back into that you know that and you didn't have to go back into that either you're smart man [noise]\nCindy's immobile Mississippi Hi Cindy how are you\nHigh Mobile Alabama I Would\nThink so I'm looking at Kelly going where are you from woman okay how can I help\nWell we're new to the financial peace

him a lump sum due to his disability\nNo he was one hundred percent disabled in every month have the money on the Veterans Administration and I had been paid all his you know care bills and everything like that mhm\nBut because Mike would give it away on the first day he got at the Veterans Administration kept bringing a family member to walk over here to state and some might have been doing that for Twenty years oh my lousy so the estate grew\nHas not it's not they're not going to come after that\nMay not have paid a disabled veteran for being destroyed and yeah a family member managed it will for the good of the veteran who has now passed they they've got no standing whatsoever to come after that okay All right no I I think you're fine is your husband the show later\n[laughter] no no he had a written well with my brother my could very well with my husband's help give some to his nieces and then distributed among his dividing brothers and sisters\nTo how much was the size of the state\nI think it's around ten fifty and I think each of the three science siblings are gonna get Seventy and the five or five six nieces will get ten thousand eat from I'm not really sure there's
