LA LA\n\n\nKnow if I\nWalk all sure what's up\nMan my brothers are taken care of mom dad passed on years ago she Seventy eight then intermittent or hell a sixty thousand dollars and what we would call her retirement fund them in about six thousand a checking account and that\nRetirement fund has been a rental house but my brother used by a rental house maybe basically been given all the rent money even though he covers all the maintenance just kind of extra gift from him\nBut that's become a bit of a problem because he doesn't he owns a small business and that's really not his focus so it go at all and goes without a ...\n... that he money coming in\nAnd wondering you know if you have a recommendation oh maybe a better um consider an investment maybe a dip it in pain or just the mutual fund or on your trip on her\nAnd her financial um situation is our net monthly is about two fifty an old was she gets a Social Security I'm after she either rent which includes an independent living with male so that three hundred two to three hundred a month that we've been chipping away at our checking account\nOver the past two years now five pound only six thousand that's about to start hitting a sixty\nOkay so the sixty is in cash and it's from rental income over the years\nYeah for about eight years okay now you've got that trash on that's invested in one\nAnd my brothers one of my brothers rental property oh shield your mom's money it's not in\nAided liquidated he can he can give her the cash if if we made it if we decided to go that route but he basically just took the money and paid off his rental house and started giving her all the rental income\nOh I see okay and so her investment that she has made and this rental properties\nDoing well because there's not being managed well correct okay\nUm and where is the property\nIt then it around jak anything if they so she lives in Memphis with me and you know it's there and my brother is in his home town but you know there's still a burden on him and I think it kind of even though he says it's not a problem I think the ban and thought\nIt'd be better off I'll sell the house and use the money to invest in something that doesn't require\nEffort correct okay\nYeah I mean if you just did that and you put the money in a mutual fund um throws off six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month that's ten percent right\nAnd that covers or shortfall\nWhat are your thoughts on living in pain she think that\nMore now or ... or no I don't think it's more secure safer because you're not well diversified\nYou're stuck in one or two stocks and ... and I wouldn't get into that um I Would like that or I'd take a growth in income mutual fund\nAnd a balanced mutual fund put about thirty K in each and try to find something that's got a track record of paying up around ten percent a year eight to ten percent a year a again gross and just drained the growth off of it and they should run in perpetuation and to the tune of about five hundred bucks a month\nThen assuming you're sixty out of the sale of the house but yeah sit down with a good mutual fund advisor do you work with one\nOf my company uses finality so they've been\nPutting you know you don't work out with a financial advisor then your company is you're talking about your fry one K. and stuff okay right yeah\nNot just grab one of the smart Mr pros off our website people when we indoors and sit down with them um have your mom Saddam to even if she's are just so she kinda knows what's going on and we're going to shut the money in something that's going to generate a low income than\nHave to generate a lot she's only a couple of hundred bucks shorter months\nMhm and invest sixty just generates six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month maybe does half that you're still okay so what we're saying is is that you know that there's this houses really poorly managed don't hardly anything [noise]\nYeah it it comes and goes there's been a couple of years where it was about seven hundred a month but the last year I think that any\nKind of women if she's getting seven hundred a month off this house why isn't that covering her three hundred dollar shortfall\nA we actually did not own or how we got these kids we're in a contract for deep or trying to find a bank that wouldn't be willing to give up money for a non traditional loan cars were first time homebuyers on an unfinished house\nAnd I did find a bank that was willing to um as long as they finished it within five years and uh but it was appraised at two eighty um recently\nTo are they foster kids are adopted kids\nThey're adopted now they were played\nIn the dark and completion\nThey ... yeah\nWell could you sell the house for right now as it is\nI'm Glad we could probably get to fix the for it and you and you are what on it [noise] one Seventy as pretty tempting you know go rent something in clean this mess up [noise]\nBut my only concern with that is because her man of many and thinking about that is our kids that we had we had five kids coated with two biological and tree adopted our three adopt a kid all have to clear the Iraq of attachment just some very\nSerious mental stuff that they're working in fighting through and I I'm afraid that move in a shift up in their life again is this going to\nI'm afraid the parents being stressed out and never home because they're working all the time to clean up a hundred and forty eight thousand dollars or the stupid that's going to cause these kids' problems\nAnd that's kinda where where yeah\nI work a lot yeah I'll bet and you don't have a life\nWas this crap on Jew something's going to give you need to decide what's going to give or it's going to give without you deciding it's going to blow up on your dude yeah so you didn't make the call I think you need to sell your house\nAnd I think the kids will deal with that temporary shift and change ... easier than they will deal with two years up to three years of high stress in the household\nAnd you never being there [noise] yeah\nI'm no I'm no kid expert I just raise three\nBut ... and I never dealt with the stuff you're dealing with and I understand they're very sensitive and I get all of that I I I'm not trying to be on the ceiling I'm just trying to say I'm a rip the band died off guy and I think even with the kids with that situation that might be the case\nI think you guys don't want to sell the house because part of killing the dream of the rehab but the house too emotionally and so I'm going to blame that on you and your wife I I I'm gone man I I'm this how you're you're working on a house\nYou're trying to run a business you got kids with the issues that you've adopted you got a house full of different things coming at you at one time you\nNeed to get a few things off your plate\nI mean if you lived in a house that you didn't have to work home and you didn't have any that\nWe got rid of two of your three huge stressors here and I think girls quality of life will go way up\n\nSounds really appealing to me it by the way it's stupid house there's houses on every corner\nYou get you another house day [noise] but you guys have painted yourself in the corner you're gonna get pain on your shoes they just decide which one you know\nAnd so\nThat's one thing you could do anything into she saw her car or you saw a bunch of your equipment that you've got and start the process of cleaning this out but who am I not going to pay is not a formula that takes you good places in five years when you've got some other options\nI I Love your heart I Love what you're trying to do for those kids that are messed up and you're loving on them and trying to help them turn their life around and in the middle of that that you you're just you're good people man\nYou're my kind of folk I like yeah I Wish I could just wave a wand and make this go away but if I knew I'm going to concentrate on these kids and the quality of life my family can have over the next five years and if I don't have this debt\nAnd I don't have um the stress of working all the time to get rid of that that all of a sudden I've got my quality of life back\nAnd if the one thing I did give up was this house mess um\nOh and by the way I don't have to work on the house what they what hours I Am home I actually spent time with these children ... swinging a hammer when I'm at home um I just think there's you you just put you in April of Superman\nIt ... brother ... Seventy three things at once I don't think you can do it all and I think they're showing up in your numbers\nBut um I think you're good man I think you ... people are like you ... do the right thing and you try and love your family oil but I'm if I'm you I'm selling our house is just a stupid house you can get you know you get out of that you get your business built up you bring up a big pile of cash you\nCan buy you another house and two or three years and and you know settling down there and you're just about the dream of homeownership is not off the table the dream of doing a rehab all I have three kids with ... D in my house these things just don't mix\nYou know it doesn't mix or too much going on this thing up till stressed out just talk about all of it and I don't have to deal with it so I see what you're facing I'm so sorry but that's what I Would do and that's what they're shows about what I Would do so I can do whatever you want your grownups but I'm not a\n... who you're not gonna pay is not the answer have you're not you are going to pay mom and dad does you're going to do that out of guilt and your company the Irish or they're going to come take stuff um you put the student loans or hardship for all you can decide not to pay the credit cards but eventually you got to get this mess cleaned up\nAnd it's going to come back to roost Anya so I'm Glad you're in financial position where she ... and if I can help you further you call me back anytime Lewis was in Palm Springs California Hi Louis how are you\nGood how are you did better than I deserve what's up uh I'm\nTrying to advise my mom she she uh\nShe just completed a field and she is out of debt except for her mortgage um shoot God Nineteen thousand dollars cash in the bank\nUm another thousand she would be getting shown from a an investment she's trying to a cash out of that she potentially will have about twenty five thousand dollars cash\nI looking at her budget I figure about twelve thousand wouldn't be a good three to six month emergency fine okay she got about a potentially Thirteen thousand dollars extra cash it in three years old mhm she liked to retire at sixty five mhm\nShe has a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars in a four one K. mhm um I just got her set up to do a automatic withdrawals indoor rock tirade\nShow ... that thing out at sixty five hundred a year and so she's right now for ... she'll be investing Fifteen Percent of our income into retirement mhm I'm\nA project in with that with a Fifteen Percent out of it about ten percent to be a little conservative I figure she'll be at about eight hundred and fifty thousand a year and\nNot having a force feed the first year off with some of it which I might go ahead and dropped fifty five hundred on this year's raw\nI'm sixty five hundred which you can do her age on this huge drop out of it and then and then jump forward and structure structure with roles for the wrong for the first of the year is probably what I Would do some of it and I'm probably throwing the rest of it at the house\nBy bishops it because you're doing for five six five but on the fly\nThat's route where you are and um but you know you're right on the right track here they're barking at the ride trees here\nAnd show I think you're doing the right kind of stuff that's how I Would do with the question man like you were joining us this hour of the day room to show in the book and [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIt's like the production officer for the show and\nYou're struggling with money relationships career you name it you're stuck and you don't know what to do\nWell I've got great news for the first time ever or you can experience our Ramsey smart conference from the comfort of your home that's why you cannot purchase our most popular live of an on DVD and stream it on the go for only thirty nine Ninety nine in our own lawn store at Dave Ramsey dot com you'll get four and a half\nHours of life changing talks and two complimentary work books\nThis brand new love of an experience was led by me\nAnd world class communicators including Dr Henry Cloud Dr West parrot Dr\n... maker Chris Hogan Rachel cruise Christie right and Anthony O'Neill these folks are America's leading experts in money leadership personal development career parenting in marriage take back the key areas of your life get our brand\nNew Ramsey smart conference on DVD and stream it all go in the online storage Dave Ramsey dot com\nWFL I find ...

attempted mail bomb and\nOkay All right I'm ... and so this this um move down in house you're moving more than half of the house uh it sounds like a multi ... even if you rent for six months or something and I moved back in this price range\nUm you know it wouldn't if you worry wouldn't make any sense I'm ... and and so this move down to half of the house has probably three to five year plan\nCorrect okay\nAll right because you're going to do something to get your income back up a without having to completely sacrifice your soul at work I get that part I'm not asking you to do that\nBut I also there's a there's an equation out there that's floating around in the culture that I'm kind of working against subtly and that is is that in order to be happy you have to make less money and that's not an equation I'm going to participate in\nA group because usually means that you just didn't go do something that God designed you to do because you were afraid\nAnd I don't participate in sphere so um but again I'm not trying to destroy your family or anything like that this was a sizable step back for you all in order to take big steps forward as long as you don't take this sizable step back and settling on and make it your life\nThat I'm cool with that that's kind of where I'm saying so hope that helps a good question and a courageous decision on your part to do that ... is with us in Rochester, Minnesota Hi James how are you\nPretty good thank you for taking my call\nSure what's up I'm ah [noise] well I I got married last year got your book is the president

thirty and she's twenty two so she's kind of going through I don't know a front page she makes twice as much as I Do here and uh it's hard for me to say no we can't go out for dinner or you know we can go to the mall for a day um because she makes so much more than I Do\nI'm Sorry I lost your ability to vote in the household based on the economics\nIt it [noise] that's pretty lame no I still have a vote and I I like it just is not as well as hot as my ... she just got to you got one\nIt kind of that that's how I feel that's probably not how she feels at all okay\nI'm In ... and not because that's not a good way to have a relationship but you should not make decisions together based on who makes the most money has the most which that's not a good plan especially when one of your starting in the other one's twenty two\nOkay so you got a little more life experience could we agree on that\nThat's right okay good and that's not to say she's in up to twenty two\nBut in this case uh apparently she is so uh in in this particular subject so how are we going to do this year's started talking about what we need to do\nWe don't need to go the mall we don't need to spend so much money we need to get a day you start talking about what after you read my book instead of talking to her about how and why\nYou sit down together and dream and say well what if we were out that when we have no doubt at all\nWhat what what if we had a million dollars what would we do what could we would we travel would we give more generously took causes what what do we do if we had a million dollars well what's the shortest path to get to that dream\nOf being able to do those things the shortest path is to live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else the

right so like six months plus or minus All right um okay\nIt doesn't matter much um the thing I Would do though is\nIf you put the money into a savings account instead of ... around the house and you have to like write yourself or know that shows like ... yourself a letter that come June first says if the house is not up for sale put this money on the house\nOkay so in other words if you waffle on this decision and the money gets spent on a bass boat it wasn't a good plan [laughter]\nOkay 'cause that's what happens to loose change it tends to find its way towards an impulse purchases if we change our direction on the sale of the house and I want it thrown at the house if um if you're going to keep the house but for six months it doesn't matter\nThe other part of my question would be sixty nine thousand currently does say we don't know how much are Americans\nPete from what you put towards the mortgage old emergency fund she'll be three to six months of expenses I doubt that your

states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony and the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers\nPersuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which she has doubled\nDown on by the way so this is a story trying to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's

weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website but many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so combat and co founder of this place was on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top up here and Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they have real clear politics and analyzing\nIt's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it he forecast that Democrats might win the house\nThat they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one the seats they're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half states which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five an absolute two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and it went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sleep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising\nAll her on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple of two

any country these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail and I don't know if it's right away to point fingers at certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrat they've proven time and time again there's simply no loans that they won't stoop to everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something to do it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way\nIt doesn't make any sense\nFor a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around what does it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today\nAnd the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have assured us for the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their hands and they believe it\nThen they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like think Kavanaugh trick backfires and these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the Swedes here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans they use this caravan which is so obviously a set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose\nI'm In Florida right to have you here or whether it's mark ...\nMake it did U.S Russian a truly an honor to speak with you so well I was holding for you a couple of things popped in my head and I'll get to the point two seconds\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and\nAnd you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan that it's all deep state and this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folks started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOh yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nWill tell people what it was ... tell me 'cause I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ... um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign in two thousand and eight\nWith signs saying iron my shirts or you're in my shirt of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nFrightened watcher of wanting to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kind of thing right\nYeah it was a point it was a plant it and it was all the it was all nonsense the garner apathy in\nSeparate it was already planning to go to waste their was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good teeth and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons at great professor called the ... rush she taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences and there are no ah you there's nothing that's set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made off\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who was

years in Boston\nHarbor day as good as my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked at a at\nA later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the elite group\nOf science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific how men\nYou know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nA ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is just very I Love it you know she's grey and you'd really like her and this is just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list them urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean yeah I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I tried to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America honey honey Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook\nBasically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that as far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that I Walk with me had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories are thought and so forth and so on\nBut can I got to be honest with you that like old school um what I ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then download it on to a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with the four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is the artificial intelligence robots\nThat third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the Ford has to deal with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not that big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're

Harvard as well as author and the new book is ah is this is great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life uh on this planet is like whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nUh trying to get their hands on some DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting that sits like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're the drama of traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were defined the natural order of thing and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice ... nice to mother nature\nYou know that the one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah and we all know margarine is not so great for us right now so [laughter] but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a ... billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we need to do that if we take it on or who who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or a beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the ... the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as towns words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so forth and so on but he recently applied to the our son was granted I'm\nA tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence [noise] and you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt ... it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots powered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is it is developing you know I talk\nAnd how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs that to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYeah I play in every once in a while you write in artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in\nI mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no they're no longer just doing computations ah but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once spoke about being very\nGood at that well you know like you they're ... they're putting it up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small but you\nKnow one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that day of the singularity that's for the day and\nAll and ... when they will have the equipment IQ you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is with you you said a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I used to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nSell out like that the cushy ... the ... yeah I'm right because you know what the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a\nYeah no but I talk about I think I quote one guy that the you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquer\n[noise] now how is raising with that the right now I fully believe that completely at it and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm

I I Can't think of the downside to that other than the military application I guess a ... where are you with that one\n[noise] no I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that yeah that that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's it there's actually\nA movement are called the trans human movement where as you say ... or the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there's where a ball and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of the sky from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms ... them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses [noise]\nBut see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms\nYou know that we are mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ...\nYou know these are these are arms that he can move with his car so they're they're wired\nTo his mind and I are fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and even even in um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just it it you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fella Scott what's on the take some of that load off of their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that I mean and I do I'm not I'm not\nBeing facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we could come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about maybe some of our advancements should not be consequence\nFree is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see that\nPoliticians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever\nWe want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then\nIn ... the new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right and then I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead\nWhat this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we spare\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know\nAnd and now and and the ... group you know I caught him in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling\nSome other stuff soon or using neural net says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain the question then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if\nWe give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nSo right yeah ... it in some ways you know\nThat I often I often think\nTo myself you know all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we can't are just still the same you know so oh our faults in our ... our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah\nConnor k'naan from not the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology\nOf the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism you know\nYou know I mean that's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending for some term in there but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nOr at his weaknesses but but positive person 'cause whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old had on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay well had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now that\nThis is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have so up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig and there are scientists who are uh her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to\nYou suggest fuel nudge venue shove them shoot we are

question for you I Know you don't get and political one\nAnd I won't ask that way\nBut my question in their opinion I Want is where shall we are looking what else is going to happen that we're missing we're missing all this done on purpose or missing something what is your opinion on that\n[noise] well that's an interesting claim it that the the the marches on purpose or coordinated toward us I mean I\nI think that you'll always see migrations and the good the long history just to bring up the Bible again it does is\nThat we're all immigrants right the Bible says that we we all move 'em and that would be you know all of the stories you a lot of the stories we're both from people just trying to get food just trying to move to get food and begging people to allow them to live in in space

are you suggesting that something is going to come from the north um while we're so busy\nLooking south and east is that was that part of your implication\nThat kind of my question I mean all this was happening at one show or something else going to happen that we're missing and all the media is concentrated in one direction and I just uh I I\nWell I think that's something I I Can't answer but I'd love to let that just flowed out there like All right so I write down what you just said and we'll see maybe a couple of weeks where there's something comes with that um because I think that's just

sorry ... ...\nFor so long I I started out listening to art bell and I've tried to call in a couple of hundred times this first time I've gotten through this is such a great privilege\nIt if I can and I would like to share something a ... about the Bible a and there's a great truth that we need to realize\nIn any discipline a\nIf any discipline that you study whether it be science or whether it be a Bible for instance uh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a big drink\nAnd the and the Bible is something to be studied and pondered over all three of the model the aesthetic religions from the middle east began their roots what the Bible and polluting the Korean the Korean has the birds and the Old Testament and\n... and the new this and the new ... the the current New Testament yeah I mean the\nThe story the story of the prophet Jesus and the current is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and even the story of the floods the story of Jesus in the car and all of that validates not counting the historical\nValues the historical cruise you know that that line up with a so many of the stores in the Bible a mini the many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because\nA historical value of the book of Daniel is so accurate\nAnd ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for Daniel to know as much of the future as soon as he did\nBut that that Cruz when you look at the courage there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the the Old Testament and the New Testament this has done so much for humanity\nYou know oh I agree I agree we yeah we we stray\nAway from that and people and and people like to take two or three versus\nAn edge a whole right terrible whole book or you know and they'll us held in\nAnd you know it's called proof texting and it's yeah it's there's a there's an old saying I've said it before I go to ... but as soon as the first in St learned in seminary was\nThat some people\nUm some people rely on a on scripture I'm like a drunk leans on a lamppost not so much for illumination\nBut for support and I think it's the illumination part that I always go for another support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just sounds like you're a learned guy but\nI did a I'm a I was writing I wrote an article about a ... about the true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories\nAre told and I was interested in how many troops um how many murders stories there are in the Bible\nAnd that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that it starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what these murder stories still do\nWhat I found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder\nWith regard to Jesus they where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the ... of the Bible in the New Testament the Greek word says kill but actually the word that's often used\nUh the Arabic word is that Jesus was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that the Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it and he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot when we think about him\nIn a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out yet I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did the on\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity has a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to\nBuild a legacies de do you think that that has hurt us and gotten a so why are from the central message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime there's always the ... been the big difference of shooting a bullet in the name of God or taking a bullet in the name of God and I'm I'm In the taking the bullet camp [laughter]\nI'll take the bullet and protecting somebody else I'm a ...\nYou know people go a long way far out of their way to create these\nStructures were there shooting people killing other people in the name of God and I uh that's where I draw the line you can join the conversation the rink and you've got a great town I'll let you get back to work too but um last time I was in a Bowling Green actually they were doing work I was on my way to the airport in Nashville and I came across it\nTo a Charles in Portland, Oregon coast to coast Charles\nAnd good morning how are you today\nGood it's open lines you take us anywhere\nWell

I'm okay with that I mean nobody can replace man but you know I get that anybody to wind up on it\nOr George George isn't great job I'm having a good time or where do you want to take it\nOr just do what you said maybe they go to different stream murdering show that's fascinating that can be off that live with me for a week in\nA in it isn't that just ... and the fact that it's Islam where they say murder the Jesus was murdered\nYeah that's [laughter] ... it really is I don't know um go ahead\nWell I yeah I wanted to take us back to the Bible um I was telling the screener I'm a a for lack of a better term hardcore atheist and everything but ah I Believe in in\nYou know seeing wisdom where you find it I I yeah there's a whole lot of wisdom in the Bible and when if you read it at the\nFive ... uh I I don't see much value but if you look at it is how people were thinking two thousand four thousand years ago\nUm it's fascinating I mean you read genesis and if you actually go back and look for you know the garden of Eden you're going to be disappointed but if you look at it is you know what separates humans from the animal knowledge of good and evil consciousness felt for blacks and\nYeah and how how people we're dealing with that that fundamental truth back then and um\nYou know they were putting your own poetry behind it but they were saying this is what separates humans from animal and how you know how do you\nBalance good meat but once you understand it you know a cougar doesn't\nUnderstand good and evil wanted something\nYou know it it it only does what it does in ... in animal does what it does and thankfully but as soon as yourself ... collective your human\nYeah and it's really interesting yeah I think this is and\nI ... I you know I I I probably had\nFriends there's a lot a lot of people I Know who go to church to hide from God because they really they think like a roof over their head in the church is something that ... it's like a like a like a screen like some sort of force field is going to bring them in and out\nYou suggest you'll nudge venue shove them shoot we are well in to the shove category\nThat we have not I am still new news radio Ninety three one [noise]\n\nThis is a Fox News alert on Debbie handmade mourners gathered tonight for a vigil honoring the victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting a lot of the adults are dead and six wounded including for police officers\nI Would describe too is in critical condition they're in the icy you right now one of whom return to the operating room the others are doing well we would not uh there's obviously seriously injured but it would not describe them as critical Dr\nDonald yearly at the University of Pittsburgh Medical center the president spoke at Indianapolis today and then all the noise he said he had a hard the hard over the shootings\nYou up crimes like this [noise]\nWhether it's this one or another one on another group\nWe have to bring back the death penalty [noise]\nThis aspect forty eight year old Robert Bowers is in cost to day basis Fox News [noise]\n[noise] we got each day with good morning airline do we ought to me too movement and full bloom right now enlisted for men who are guilty of sexual misconduct\nThere is no different than I Would never offered one having said that we need a heat to ... we're still keeps innocent man from being what I call Kavanaugh good\nLand do we have sex don't use radio not eat ...
