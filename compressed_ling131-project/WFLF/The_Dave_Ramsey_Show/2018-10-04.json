fellow finals or Linda ... patients every door Orlando news radio nutty free point one WFL a and I heard a radio station [noise]\nIt's a lot different than have your refrigerator running yeah better don't catch it yeah it's a little different than that it'll cost you money right\nYeah a lot of money from what I've heard so far all righty [laughter] it's a retirement coffee talk with serious reverse read we always you know if there's a new scam out there we always like to highlight it because people call in and say hey\nWhat's going on with this and that's something that we handle regularly and when you have a financial advisor on your team you can call with those kinda questions and that's really a valuable resource to yet\nSo here's one thing that I Know that Sharif loves to talk about a little bit it's football and that sort of do today or we're gonna we're gonna you know if you if you look at the best coach in college football's people might saint Nick Saban they might say others\nIf you look at the best coach in pro football\nNo doubt people are going to bring up build ... and he's of course the coach of\nThe New England patriots won a lot of Super Bowls he was just recently interviewed on CNBC the financial networks and he talked about\nBuilding a game plan there's a lot of things that are similar to here to building a financial plan to take a listen\nCalled operation you know what you're doing and you have an idea what they do with us for a week or\nOnce you get into the game than those adjustments will be\nEasy but relatively easy or more manageable your review situations review the communications [noise] try to make sure that everybody's on the same page of a complicated probably not going to work or if it's just simple\nThat might not work either because it's so obvious so that if you are right\nWe get we get a plan we reviewed the plan we make adjustments if it's too complicated no good if it's too simple no good we have to have good execution boy Sharif that sounds a lot about what we talk about every week doesn't it\nYes preparing for that game plan so whether you're playing baseball or your football your football coach or soccer coach or wherever yeah there there was a game plan to everything that you do and you have to strategize and you have to look out for your opponents and you got to be off and said you have to be defensive and you're always changing up the plants and nobody\nI figured it out right I'm supposedly but I mean that's the same thing when you're preparing for retirement Randy you want to review often you want to adjust when needed to be adjusted\n'em and you went to execute so it it there's no difference whether you're a professional athlete our coach versus being professional retiree right do you plan to be a professional retiree because you're going to live twenty Thirty years and retirement\nAnd so you need to have that game plan on that tax plan the state plan you know Social Security plan when do we take it\nSo I take my pension from my lumps on our lump sum option from my company do I sell my house I have a couple of homes I keep the rental income all these questions are part of preparing for this game plan I called the game plan to retirement\nAnd every moving piece in part is just important as to the ones that prior to that and it was many steps to it and so you want to be prepared\nYeah I think about uh I I don't know there's a lot of people think about the opponents that they have in retirement to who's my opponent well your opponent is going to be a market decline you want to protect against that your opponent is gonna be inflation you want to\nProtect against that you're in your opponent is going to be a health I bet you want to protect against that as best you can financially speaking in there are things to to fight against when it comes to retirement we have to be ready for whatever that opponent froze ...\nAnd it's kind of what you talk about being prepared and having all of those those game plans to go around those things\nYes uh I recently had somebody come in and they've only sat down with a couple of advisers and their time\nAnd they said ... you really do press on this inflation issue and I do think there's going to be hyper inflation I say I don't know I said oh they know we can prepare for the worst case scenario and the best case scenario and they said well if I Need Seventy five thousand dollars now why in five years might need eighty one thousand dollars in income I said because\nUh purchasing power changes today you're ten thousand and not works ten thousand in ten years so we have to plan for that and if you look at history on the average inflation is three percent over the last thirty or so what's to say it's going to be any different or worse or better so we might as well planned for it just in case\nThose opponents that we have in retirement we don't think about them but we want to prepare for them and that's what our tailored retirement plan does really it is a game plan going through all of those pieces that Sharif was just talking about\nIncome you're four O. one K. your IRA how do those become paychecks how do they pay you in retirement Social Security we're going to talk about that and just a second year what kind of a strategy would be best for you and your family\nTax planning we're going to talk about that today is well having a tax strategy many people don't know that maybe the number one expense you are going to have in retirement\nIs taxes what if you could put more of that money in your pocket we'll talk about risk we'll talk about fees will talk about estate planning we'll talk about that market and build in a game plan for you it's called our tailored retirement plan we would love to get one to you that is our gift your radio list or this is free\nThere is no obligation here you can come in and take a look at what we have and see what we have and you can choose to move forward if you want to\nGive us a call and let's go through the process and give you a look at where you stand right now\nThree three three six eight three six eight zero eight three three three six eight three six zero ask\nFor the tailored retirement plan most recent one of the things when we talk about the tailored retirement plan we talk about having a Social Security strategy and people have heard over and over again the longer you wait the more money you get so why not wait till Seventy well\nWe got a guy here who has a completely different thought on that his name is David Bach and he says you know what if you don't need the money don't wage take it\nI recommend if you don't need the money this is very counterintuitive he donated money to take it early and people go why\nAt sixty two sixty three sixty four year in the best shape of your life\nAt least at that point you can take extra cash you can travel first class you can get a bigger sweet on a cruise\nAnd you can enjoy the money and give it to your grandchildren are so many things that people are sixties can do to enjoy that money so if you don't need it I can just take it early unfortunately if you're doing it it pays to wait because it's worth so much more money and that's the part that's unfortunately unfair for those who haven't done a good job of saving\nNow that makes my head spin just a little bit Sharif's but it I like that idea I was kind of makes sense doesn't it yeah\nYou know what one and a blue moon walk up in my office and that's exactly what we do this has to be something we just we we talk about on the radio today Randy because\nIt's not cookie cutter retirement planning is not going to be the same for your neighbor or your your your your sister or your brother your uncle um it's different for everybody and one person can walk in and say hey why is my neighbor whether Social Security check up so much higher than my Social Security check\nAnd there's a lot of reasons why can't explain that and I sit there and talk to them but this is another thing we tell folks maybe it's best to wait till Seventy to take Social Security 'cause you get a nice big larger benefit guaranteed eight percent every year that you wait after full retirement age of Clinton\nBut let's let's say you have plenty of money saved you have a great pension when it passes to your wife or husband and then you have this big chunk of money and you have to pull money out every year especially if it's Irene moneys and you just\nDon't need to delay or Social Security than by golly take it take it away you're healthy span did reinvest it once in awhile I haven't ... clients that listen take and go I have an old time with it\nI Love it I Love it and see that just shows you right there there are so many different scenarios and how are you going to know what's right for you unless you have a real good animal is Asian of where you stand right now and that's really what are to their retirement plan\nRandy I don't mean to interrupt you but we did have a caller commit calling last week and she was debating or want to know if she should take it early sixty six is around the corner for her she\nVery soon talking about the new realities of retirement Sharif will give you the last word for today\nAgain thank you for all the feedback I had somebody emailed me about talking about Iraq and
