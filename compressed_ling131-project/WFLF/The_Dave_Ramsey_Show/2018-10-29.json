Roche I Want to thank you for all you do and defending Israel and American Jews on your program\nThank you sir I'm sure it is\nAnd I ... I had the the money to put down on the house but I didn't I wasn't able to show income so the house was actually purchased the my father's name ... once I had developed the income to be able to get the loan or the mortgage and my name and before I was getting married I had purchased a home from my dad\nNow for me to have that mortgage and not a PM I\nHad to be a certain amount of equity which I didn't have any cash at the time so my father essentially gifted\nMeans so what's your question the question is do I pay back the uh the the money to my father because I'm paying him ... I'm saying and be sure\nYou have a second mortgage on your house to her that you're going to stay on the house you're paid off ... absolutely and then you can also first mortgage and then hopefully by then that rental will come up to its ... worth at least what you owe on it and you can get rid of it and get rid of brother out of the house\nAnd then you're dead frozen uh yeah yeah\nYeah I Would not only a rental property that I break even on dude it's not my goal I saw that rental property up as soon as brother could move if you weren't forty thousand dollars upside down but you're forty thousand ours upside down so well let's wait on that market to recover a little bit because most real estate in the U.S has not recovered you're in a weird situation there that if it hasn't\nBut I'll give it to another year or two or whatever and let's get it recovers wants to run a large checked to get rid of it I'd rather I'd a hundred and thirty six dollar check than it would have forty thousand our checks all do that for a little while but this idea of buying property to subsidize relatives that we're losing money on and calling that a tax write off this is not good\nWith money but you didn't set out to do that is just where you ended up marrying into it so when it comes up in value dump it and in the meantime pay off your second then pay off your first there we go think Kevin's

keep it so that when he retired or excuse me when he\nPasses I have money to pay the taxes on uh the inheritance money that will be coming to me and so how large assistant state\n[noise] uh I Would

[noise]\n\nThey\nUs from August Georgia here in the lobby of Ramsey solutions Hi Gail how are you\nI'm doing great thanks Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nAh well I had an unusual question and I've been pondering it for a while\nI'm after my divorce I moved to a guest and started working and I moved in with friends in their garage apartment mhm so I have used the kitchen restroom and laundry on normally thing she would renting a room ... um\nBut I came across a condo that are wandering the realtors own and I had an opportunity to buy it\nFor about fifty two thousand and its values anywhere from sixty five Seventy and it ... and was rented [laughter] when I bought it for a couple of years ago and it makes about Thirteen hundred dollars a month and Iran where I Am an only five hundred\nAnd this one's going to be available for the end of the year and I've been pondering do I want to move into it make it my own home now that if they can show you bought it and it's rented\nOkay and what's your income a average about thirty five thousand a year commissions mhm\nOkay well I the the way I answer questions is what always ends up happening with me on stuff like you're describing is um\nWhat feels good and the short term\nMight not be taking me to my long term goal\nAnd a show or when I'm always asking myself as warm where am I going to be in ten years in which these decisions takes me there\nOkay now obviously you can live in a garage apartment how old are you\nI'm not fifty five okay then you could live in a garage apartment or your sixty five and you could make the transaction will spread here I'm making next door some extra money doing that is what we're saying and then you the question to ask yourself is is that worth it to you\nDoes that get you some place that you couldn't get otherwise um my tendency personally would be to do everything I can increase my income during the next ten years and be living in that condo\nOr I mean you landed in the garage apartment as a a a place to heal and and get reset after a divorce right\nBut that really wasn't ... it's kind of camping well when you're not a college student I mean this was camping ... you know and so this isn't like your destiny it's not where you want to be long term but ... and so my point is just because the numbers work on something doesn't mean it's right\nSo if you feel and you've settled you got your found footing under you again which I'm guessing you do that you bought a condo um probably moving into that condo but the ...\nWhat am I going to be doing ten years from now like Seventy thousand understood a thirty five and what ... what am I gotta do to get my support a healing is believing in yourself again at a way ... our air oblivion yourself in a way maybe you never have to where you put yourself on a career track to get those income so long term\nBut er ... if that's where you are that's where your head as I think I'm going to move in with a condo\nIf it was paid for in order to have three hundred and savings of them and the answer real quickly in my mind will be no right right and because all we're doing is doing that in reverse aren't way yes and so that's how I kinda get there but the thing the reason I was asking some of the questions I'm trying to think you know two hundred thousand is not a huge mistake it's a good one\nBut it's not a huge one I mean it's going to produce Fifteen twenty thousand dollars a year in income and um then they've got the other\nUh Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars a year coming in from Social Security give or take ... and they gotta live on that otherwise they burn through this nest egg and they ended up having to sell the farm in their old age right and I don't want to do that so as long as they'll keep\nA spending less than the income that is produced by the two hundred\nAnd their Social Security stay on a ... household budget that's below that then the game plan you and I just talked about will run in perpetuation no matter how long they live okay is that it's not logical to you as long as they do that then yes I Would do it in a heartbeat or because I Love the idea of going into your\nYou know your latter years with everything paid for especially your home folks when your home is paid for and you're sixty\nSeven you stabilize for the next Thirty years till you're Ninety seven your ... your your housing costs and your housing costs as the largest cost in your budget\nSo if you're renting your rent goes up every year for the next Thirty years if you're sixty seven and and that sounds like homelessness to me later unless you've got a huge mistake and so by\nOwning and by owning with no debt you've completely stabilized your golden years Tyler is with us in Oklahoma City Hi Tyler our you\nHey Dave I appreciate you taking my call sure man what's up\n[noise] well my uh wife and I did our dead prescribing last year in July so we're on steps four or five and six um when I got back to the Oklahoma City area ...\nA couple of months later he started to change my job an employer and I are gay or what appeared to be a better job of fit for us in our family at the time and it produced nothing but a year worth of turmoil and so now I just lost my job on friday last week [laughter]\nI'm working through the debt snowball paying off my student loans [laughter]\nI think I pretty much a barn myself out of my career path and so\nI'm a pharmacist and light training is is skilled in such that I'm at this point I don't see myself as as marketable for other areas and so that's why I'm trying to figure out I've been reading books like crazy this last year [noise]\nBecause I'm passionate about um small business I have an entrepreneur heart and I still like working with people that work in the health care sector has just\nEating my lunch this past year and so I'm trying to figure out what to do\nNow so it's not actually doing pharmacy or dealing with the customers a chew up it's the bureaucracy and show how is there another way we apply your existing education skills to the market that rather than just work in a CBS\nMhm correct um\nI don't know but I I Would think that there's got to be some kind of ... a pasta carry idea out there kind of old school ...\nHigh end delivery or something that is not all insurance based in revenue crazy\nRight you know like ... are used in the doctor's got some of the doctors box go to the ... model right correct where they lower the number of patients that they see and you pay a flat fee and you've got like they'll do house calls and everything and they actually know their patience now\nRight that kind of thing where they lower the different kind of practice management is the I Wonder if there's that kind of application to your world I have no idea I'm making this up right now so I'm fully pharmacist\nJob market is saturated um they've they've been dumping pharmacist more and more pharmacists and ever since I graduated\nIn ... and ... says just they're just stamping out that's the ... world so right and that's\nThe world I came from a smaller smaller sector and you know here I Am I lost a hundred and forty five thousand dollar income and I'm thinking well you know what next to it obviously I Can't pull the lady I'm so to the dog because the docks no longer than I\nWell I mean there's ... there's two things one is I'm trying to think through if I'm you a business model because you've got an entrepreneurial\nItch to scratch that is some kind of highs service and low insurance no insurance policy to carry model where you use your licensing and your knowledge is you're very specialized in very valuable knowledge\nRight and that's not what's your burned out on your burn out on the corporate crap right\nAnd uh and so is there another way to be a pharmacist in today's world that you invent even if it's on a small scale I don't care I'm right I'm going to begin to investigate business model ideas like that around the country and see who's doing\nLike an old school of pop the Kerry I'm almost thinking like a soda fountain and the thing like the old days you know kind of thing we're stuff but I don't know I I'm just making this up in my head sitting here I Know that ... here's the thing I Do know about the marketplace the very very\nA high end high service a luxury markets are booming in every sector\nThe uh low end the bottom end which is all price based is booming middle grade product lines and services are not booming in any space\nThose are people I mean in other words cheap hotels enriches or doing good the ones in the middle are struggling right and\nSo get off on one into those spaces you figured out the bottom of the ... space is killing you so we're probably going to some kind of high end thing is they're the ... to rich people model some way I don't know I'm making this up I'm just asking questions out loud now while we're discovering that I might go back in ... for another year or\nTwo of the grind to put away two hundred thousand bucks to go live my dream with\nOkay but I'm not going to submit myself to Thirty years of this grind right okay but I put up with all kinds of crap for a little while to get to where I Want to go\nThis last year has been so brutal and my wife and family that you know they they now see what I saw um you know a year and a half ago it's\nBrutal on their wife and family does your time you're\n... ... my my morale\nOkay what's your morale has everything to do with what you're looking towards you thought you were stuck there I can ... I don't want my Morales bad if I'm standing and poked my knees okay but not bad if I'm standing poop money's cause I'm walking through that shoveling it to use it as part allows her to grow a crop\nTrue\nOkay you just see the difference if I can look past it I can walk to anything but you couldn't like passed it in the last year and it destroyed your emotion germ your gas tanks empty\nRight I'm kinda glad that I said that chapter you know and I turned a new page yeah\nMy point is you could walk back into a similar situation if you knew you were only doing it for two years because at the end of two years we're going to do X Y and Z right okay\nBut you gotta have your X Y and Z defined and I'm I'm not capable of doing that in this setting in you know a minute and forty five seconds on the radio but I mean at least get you started there\nSo you got the right stuff do you just got to believe in you again and not completely give up on the idea that you can surf people through a path to carry through pharmacy because you can surf\nThat way I just don't know how to do it business model because I don't know your world well enough I mean I'm a consumer see the CVS

it that swept in my budget um because I'm thirty I'm Single I'm and I'm worried that you know when when God does provide me that women are coming up ...\nAm I going to have the house and I'm forty if I get paid off maybe she doesn't want to be here forever home and I'm not sure that I'll stay here [noise] so does it make sense to start throwing all that money at it to get paid off early um two years into the mortgage goal to pay it off by the time I'm forty\nYeah I was wondering I Do think it makes sense after all that money out\nOf your hand on male not sure if I'm going to stay here forever\nAbsolutely sure throw the money that here's an interesting thing we're not spending the money when you reduce your mortgage and you're homeless paid off and you show your home they give you a check\nAnd all that money comes back to you so it's not like you're throwing the money away you're actually investing it at the rate of interest that your mortgage interest is\nBy which is your mortgage interest rate is proof points to Seventy five percent her\nTo show you have a three point three Seventy five percent savings account that you can withdraw from until you sell it\nIt's different I just got I'm Sorry\nI'm just trying to get in there I mean Fifteen Percent of your income and baby step for going into retirement live your life\nAnd my extra money that you find or
