so on and so this this is the culture war that we are in and this\nIs the side opposes are\nThat's why this stuff is all crucial [noise]\nOkay listen to it again this is Monday Night on CNN taken a couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise]\nNon ... lemon says it on Monday Night on CNN and its\nNoticed today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo all about all the recent shootings in mailed the pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky\nAnd other white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nYou know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ... what is your reaction to this I mean this punks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy Bannon that that may be something that he individually holes but the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's dead on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the Americans left is white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here that is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the uh Lenski days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from\nThe traditions in institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary and evidence the primary example are exhibit\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair they of course pay no attention to the steps in America took to end racism that gets no credit gets mentioned whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration policy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and Phil ... of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo ah to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more ground than that in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using the victim allergy and victimhood in to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be at right men or continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people you\nNotice how quickly they want to do that notice how quickly on the left at people who commit crimes are not really responsible for it on their own ways the result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's a day if you're going to if we're going to go down that road never going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it that's in raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon and said this is a Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't Republicans in that group looking number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well there are cops and they mistreat and they are racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up a Republican baseball practice I think he was just intending to wound people Steve ... is almost did die it's amazing these people the way they talk in the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen\nAre a general General David Dinkins where there are fifty four where are you parity yes in ... that was\nGreat longer hear it again someday but I just wonder are your thoughts on why we haven't seen or heard of any reporting on this airline went down\nTwo days ago and I recall the last plane went down in Malaysia CNN was all over for about a month and a half a non stop the and we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that went that\n[noise] yeah where did it go down\nIn leaders Taiwan there but a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is going I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link at the Trump good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that crash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking day how I'm not I'm not joking number they don't care about it because it has no impact it has no usage they can see it\nAffecting the outcome they want in the mid term elections don't worry they'll get to it when they decided that time to attack a corporation like bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it\nYou do you do do do do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh I just don't ever remember seeing them go when wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN I Wish there were there was there were sucking hot or they were in the last place out there and ah this was that was pre Trump and ... the belief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers\nIs white blue eye balls are ballooned to TV so they believe and then he had a mystery where it was a damn thing where is it Don women even ask the former director of National Transportation Safety Board corn it had been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\nChance but certainly remember that Americans are ... ... ...\n... ... they had a mystery on their hands and indeed you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became\nA standing joke you know that the the best way to make everything you're doing it success is to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlet whether it's Yahoo Google CNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what\nYou want to wait a minute how do you know about it then well I saw it on line\nNews maybe where Monday morning Monday morning the headline news\nHeadline news they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go\nEighty percent uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever forget which called at programming but I just\nWanted to kill your that there was not wind ... usually anytime the plane goes to show him that many people especially it was a brand new planning that\nI don't know whether you such a brand new playing what kind of plant diseases about what you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new it's got to be one of the dumb or somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news Stewart Brand new plan going on is unusual and ah we were out\nOf the street sucked into it I'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max which is the latest uh upgraded the seven ... seven thirty seven is a debate wide body\nAnd not as widely courses a jumbo jet wide body but it's stuffy and they have a mixed ended a damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers went down\nBut it didn't go down in America a Donald Trump has nothing to do with it going down that they could they make a case\nUh they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... so\nThat no way to link this I'm not ... I'm not joking\nI Wish I was there is no way to link that crash to the mid term elections they'll get to [noise]\nGoes for you the best school do on the email I\nYou is your smart speaker to Google Home the plain news radio nodding green\nPoint one WFL house bedtime is complicated my wife is always freezing and when she layers up to bed I get way too hot Hi I'm Scott tan and founder of bone branch makers of the world's most comfortable seats loved by three us presidents if you're like us you'll love our flannel betting\nBack for a limited time at bowl and branch dot com\nThey're unbelievably soft warm and breed the ball so Missy stays warm and I don't know ... it's like magic\nWe let you sleep in them for thirty nights if you're not impressed\nSend them back for a full refund\nR. flannel sheets coming fourteenth stunning patterns and colors you're guaranteed to find a style you love but don't wait last year they sold out in just a few weeks\nGo bowling branch dot com today for fifty dollars off your first set of sheep plus free shipping with promo code rush that fifty dollars off plus free shipping right now at Boeing branch dot com criminal code rush\nBut one branch dot com spelled B O L L and branch dot com promo code rush\nUs ballet [noise]\nA lot of Democrats have been making racist statements to drive by media is really ignoring them left and right\nDemocratic Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly\nImage debate [noise]\nAgainst Mike Brown said our state director is Indian American but he does an amazing job our director of all constituent service she's African American but she doesn't even more incredible job you can imagine\nYeah he's got all this diversity and has to remind but they do a good job nevertheless a boy and a racist\nComment not reported on not highlighted but we will\nYou could if you're reporting and in the news media\n[noise]\nGet the impression that all of that inertia and energy is lost but I think people in the news business and consumers of those are two different things and I really believe that people in the news business in all businesses are among the most detached\nFrom their customers consumers that any other business out there any other retail business I think the news business has people\nThat know the least about their customers and consumers and I don't know of a business out there that that has contempt for their customers and consumers like the news media does\nDon't know if one I don't know of a business who ... who who reject half if not more up their consumers are customers like the news business does but the news media has a habit negative is is assuming\nAnd then operating on the assumption let whatever they think and wherever they care about\nIs what everybody thinks for everybody cares about so I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted if that momentum was interrupted if that energy level declined and wire Trump's rallies still so over the he's got one in Fort Myers like it's Fort Myers yeah Ford\nFoundations of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies\nPlan between now and election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election\nAnd he's pumping a series of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence\nConsumer confidence in the economy [noise]\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration but he was having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties always messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this\nSo whatever is out there in the daily news media is not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh\nAttitude or anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking I got a lot of this idea that all of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb in the synagogue shooting\nThis is\n... you know I I circled back to I really don't know what's gonna happen on election day and I don't believe anybody else does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and yeah that's a toss up you want to believe it did not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close we don't know we never know until the aftermath\nHere's Trump tweeting out at Paul Ryan Paul Ryan will be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out and gets a conversation started on eliminating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up\nCriticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but you know it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence up everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweet\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\nThat's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting\nAnd Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you\nSome people it's horrible what Trump said about ... why is that why is it why isn't it a problem the Paul Ryan\nTook the first chance he had\nTo disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is\nThe design and it's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway it was a great piece today\n[noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question during\nThe Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the foreign what her allegations whatever cabin on there that led to the fact that Kevin all of a spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it none of them ever present at any but\nThe media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's named in the Supreme Court he is the passes it gets ... got the confirmation vote and isn't sworn in why did the media drop it\nIf Kevin all of a such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I would've Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get one of those guys are rubber ... serial rapist where is all it just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility of all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political nuns\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kavanaugh if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually cruise they would not have stopped at him being confirmed and the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\n\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate winter he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why aren't they doing that there was a big campaign going Kevin always will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion of Kavanaugh did you believe balls the forward and if you did do you still support impeaching cabinet where are these questions\nThe reason those questions aren't being asked are the reason why the media is doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every day I'm One of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin off as true it was all manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats sought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her\nNot Jimmy may humbling to terrify the here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nHis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYou Republicans running for office have you ever debates left you need to start asking a Democrat opponents\nThey still opposed Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... or oppose Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign ads we've got a week if not to wait to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot to wait to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded\nLet's pretend that some of the momentum was lost all okay we've got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who\nDid it what its purpose was and the proof than it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy and Kevin ... they lost and their attempt to use Kavanaugh to hurt Democrats hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one if the cabinet confirmations circus we're about\nJustice for his alleged victims Little Women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nCardio Mobil much peace of mind in your pocket for only Ninety nine dollars ... party a dot com boom dedicate a A R D I F ... dot com\nAnd [noise]\nThey want\nTo take a brief moment I just heard the ah the spot for cardiac go by and I just wanted to show you what this device is I Want to hold it up for those will be watching on the little can that's as big as this thing is not big at all you\nPut your to your index finger and your middle finger from both hands on each of these pads\nOr we go for thirty seconds\nAnd you get the ap from cardio on your watch and measure for thirty seconds and it'll tell you whether you're in the sinus rhythm or pending ... amazing it's a one way and you know if you go to the hospital and they connect you an E.

Benjamin Franklin and\nI'll Try a paragraph Abraham Lincoln you know I I John Silver at Boston University at Boston University of way back in the nineties did a survey and the most popular\nHigh school history textbook and found one paragraph in reference to Abraham Lincoln one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton for example in an American history the name that\nYou want to know is Howard Zinn Howard Zen as a textbook writer as a as a as a as quite as I socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of so your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program\nSo over Thirty years in one white thank you very much a Ella for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about Alice and Alice ... not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nAnd we were much newer in younger country them and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly\nThe immigrants who were allowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nGot the loudest and most sustained applause of any announcement are you ready when apple announced that the new ... book air is made of one hundred percent recycled aluminum\nThe young people in that in that room\nErupted into a game a standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect to movies gives most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nAway for life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people have been brainwashed in propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer here and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\n[noise] holy smokes\nNow let's go to the audio soundbites vis vis folks I talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nThe president of the United states making a controversial visit to Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history\nPresident was greeted by a hundred protesters singing this land\nIs your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome until he saw what they perceived to be his assault on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protests are not support what one does immigration refugees have to do with this debate in any way why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper\nThe protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Trump is hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not come in every did gum they wish they would just\nLeave so now we go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical center President Trump's first lady\nYou Monica Trump Jared Kushner walking through the halls to visit people wounded in the synagogue shooting\nArrows\nNow they can reach shake your hand or\nThank you so much [laughter] I Can't keep having a chance\nYou will not see this on any network those cast you will not see that video on\nAny news channel anywhere thank you thank you President Trump thank you mock it thank you we love you thank you for coming thank you very much no thank you sir you're the best the best great job thank you Mr President we love you thank you can I shake your hand serve thanks so much thanks so much thank you so much thank you President Trump\n\nBut wait a minute Jake Tapper said the protests are not surprising nobody wanted to president there and it's not just Jake Tapper everybody in a drive by Mr President your sham trip and I thought this was not to replace you know business going they don't want you to forty five thousand people signed a petition asking to come\nAway we're not through we stay at the University of Pittsburgh Medical center and now I'm a lot of the first lady and if Monica Trump got some loved to\nBank you parents rainy\nThank you very much anger her name is John John you've paid me ... [laughter]\n\nThat was a male employee looking Jared questionnaire saying nobody ever heard of you laughing at his wife was a bigger star that's fine no problem everybody laughing about it from the point is you're not going to see this anywhere I mentioned it to you in the opening our of the program it this is what happened\nThere are thousands of people already in line in Fort Myers awaiting a Trump rally there\nLater tonight [noise] but nobody wants to Donald Trump anywhere she everybody hates Trump everybody's spices Trump everybody regrets that they voted for everybody can't wait\nTo vote for Democrats so the Trump can't do anything and everybody wants to Democrats back in power so they can start investigating Trump and get rid of it that's your drive by media\n\nThey don't show you the reaction of real people you will not see\nThose videos you will not here that audio anywhere\nOn that and reduce the number one of your personality of all time Rush Limbaugh hardly beat that goes with George Norris one\nNews radio Ninety three point one\nFive year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down these\nUh and birthright citizenship claiming the fourteenth amendment does not say that\nYou have everybody in the world out there disagreeing with it but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump has done that that's what's conservatism was as a former movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can I can show your countless in two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that\nThe closest I remember to anybody for casting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something out of he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are gonna pick ups sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because there's so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should see and if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two\nEverybody thought everybody did Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody hated Bush\nBush was not duly elected Bush stole the election and the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court and Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way\nAnd what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was Don ... that drive by media couldn't believe it so they're\nExamples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen\nThey ended up being surprised the brightest minds in grave this girl rose the most heralded the analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here is from uh motives are real clear politics by one of the written down the\nWhole analyst and data analyst there is Sean ... day\n\nI'm not going to read the whole thing of printouts of four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as men terms and her final stretch nominate\nTells you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words\nWe know nothing\nOn certain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten men germs are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a bunch of polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty two hundred and fifty and majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionately toward Democrats\nAnd see something more on the order of up to twenty five to two hundred ten Democrat majority but this is hair splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five states are Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that data the Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller\nHere are some things that shouldn't bother any sober minded elections\nAnalyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here and as the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats and the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any further because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words and I'm just ... days [noise]\nHis words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other couldn't be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait he's already predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr trend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's given you every reason in the world is ... to ... to ... you can think of where it might turn out that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval it is also unclear\nHow about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this\n[laughter] but that's just me you know being smart alec\nOr in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia get Tammy is possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests\nBut what about the nineteenth representative John Faso is up by a point that the president is job approval is at a forty six forty nine split\nThat suggest a very close race than there are likely a lot so\nTrump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIsn't going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\n[noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things\nAnd then the next paragraph how many votes are Democrats wasting [laughter] one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been the massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke\nChallenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a outer Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead and the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress now normally this would be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning current liable aren't the ... thing [laughter]\nThen the next ... are we're relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern and then the\nMan and get those are the kinds of things that people are up against and if there's a journalist David ... who ah who writes and [noise] of quote on his work here a bunch of times and he's out saying something that I have\nMentioned on this program countless times that of course the Democrat Party\nIs the drive by media and vice versa drive by media is the\nDemocratic Party they are they in fact I I think the drive by media is actually the organizing power\nA behind the Democrat Party Mr are Sandy you're saying this but he's he's saying that in his opinion a growing number of the American people are aware of it now\nThe federalist that's right that's right he was a Mollie Hemingway in a gang and his his opinion is that a more and more Americans are succinctly aware\nOf the unfairness the imbalance and the other way beyond by us if if that's true for a number of these things are true then there could very well be a major surprise and shock in store for the media and the Democrats on election day too\nBecause it's a parent now they think they've got this in the ...
