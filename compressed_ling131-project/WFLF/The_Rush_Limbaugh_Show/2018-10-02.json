estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls rough on what the Republican wave in the center in the house and the ... not in the house\nRepublican away in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump means an impeachment of the Democrats get the house I don't think so but if they do it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake\nBones in there because they would never vote to what to convict if the Republicans hold the Senate or even swelled the ranks so the panicked host Jim shoot I couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red wave in the Senate\nHe says there was discussion of a blue wave being generic battled advantage for Democrats do you notice it tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans but you know there's a lot of talk oh with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation math that in fact that might hurt Republicans but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening in the house races\nBut I'm going to get a little ... observation about this but what did I tell ya he's generic ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping on this\nAnd back then you know nine months ago the Democrats\nHad a twelve point advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave began and that's when all the talk of the Democrats winning ... Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of 'em and Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host of doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything\nMe remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots

point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known at the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to win yet look what you were doing you were making ... guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of

October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot\nThey've had this in in in the

be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and the Republicans could come out I didn't know where at about final turn and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far

for those of you not watching on the digital camera going to post what I'm going to show digital camera at Rush Limbaugh dot com you'll be able to see it there\nAre but first before I assure you that there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed the cartoon the firemen carrying the baby and put it in a sweater let's let's use that when it first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentleman was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton\nA set of angry voices on the right speaking out against ... there was only one voice on the right in Nineteen Ninety two I was at a local talk shows but\nCNN is the only cable out and there's no Fox News there is no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh aren't really conservative website just start everything's starting to ... to to block it at that point but but this program nationally it was still in four years after our founding\nAnd Clinton have blamed angry voices on the right for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the\nA building in Oklahoma City the federal building and of course uh I I\nWas living there was not going to accept that would challenge the White House on and they issued a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\n\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio this is by the way this more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up\nAnd strategize I Know their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do\nSo a cartoonist by the name of Chris brick think was his name drew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead\nBaby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine and the artist that his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\nWell one of the local hosts at the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the fireman said no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of the ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back\n[noise] some public and the Illinois something Illinois journal or some such thing\nBut the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter and parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching other digital camera this is the cartoon\nIt has Kevin ... daughter praying at her bedside\nThe description the upper left hand corner Kavanaugh's daughter says another prayer and in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says dear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\nNow as I say if you're not watching the program on the digital camera which you can do\nAs a member at Rush Limbaugh dot com will have the cartoon eventually at Rush Limbaugh dot com or if you don't have to remember you'll be able to see if I'm not doing this is a come on for membership I'm I'm just we have the ability to show these things rather than to describe them\nSame cartoonist Nineteen Ninety two

reacting\nTo it and I weighed\nWhether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets an I decided to go ahead and do it\n\nIn my never ending quest to have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men did did\nThey are\nThis is what passes for humor on the left this is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh Kevin ... says another prayer\nDear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n[noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise] and it's just good flies in the face of decency\nYou know you run out of descriptive adjectives\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some point in our lives of suffered psychological just of the events that have led the psychological disorders and they found themselves now as the mainstream of the Democratic party\nSo don't dumped me on this on to what these people in the media you have so much invested in their power\nIn their self esteem related to their power and that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurts them to the quick it disturbs them\nAny time you can demonstrate to them that what they're trying to make you think isn't working you

Kevin on to\n\nNBC I don't I don't know if they're really vetting her or just trying to get confirmation here to add to what they want to do\nSo Kate Snow then says did you see Brett Kavanaugh spiking the punched and you see him putting green alcoholic in the punk\nI saw him getting red solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame and their wide screen punch it as parties and I would not take one of those classes from\nOur cat um I ...

can you guys [noise]\nShe said she was going to kill you yes\nRight after she dealt with the unborn baby is going to do that first\nYou will never ever see your unborn child ... the Democrats really want to stand behind this is this what they want to vouch for they're backing off of that this is again I don't mean to be redundant\nBut Dianne Feinstein all of a sudden this after the bringing up the fact that we need to start looking again of his roe versus Wade decision or women's reproductive health and is assault weapons are thinking on why\nThat's been that long ago and you didn't have anything to oppose them they're just so you imagine how they feel about this\nI mean they're fools to believe this was real in the first place but they're so damned desperate [noise] uh [noise] one let me I Need to go back I Need to find Sheldon why is everyone is number nine Sheldon Whitehouse this guy's money this is a Democrat who\nOn friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's ...\nSaid that he had figured out how to translate it and the date in ... he figured this could be the gate where the incident Dr foreign described it happened and he thought\nTo try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward capitalism so\nOn good morning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room\nIs talking to Sheldon Whitehouse he's a Democrat and Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied we don't know how all the details yet but clearly if they haven't been given a free rein to interview whomever they want so that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here on a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to get this done by friday of really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have Krabbe audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle did\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles said the Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is a grown adult\nAnd if you believe Dr Ford\nJudge Kavanaugh\nNBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge we're in communication with his classmates to get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying if Kavanaugh perjuring yourself and that means he's not quite on what they got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape is nasty throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk and now\nHe is a a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer\nYeah I think friday night yeah there's not too many people to talk to hear FBI's got a lot of shore or we can get this done that's just to central maybe White Houses out their truck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target or they can catch Kevin in anything\n\nUh there's one more than I Want to play and I'm looking for it and I just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise]\nThe question of who leak Dr foreigners letter to Dianne Feinstein you don't just\nDozens of leaking this letter my memory and this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the foreigners to the gym judicial committee or I remember her showing the letter holding it up or talking about it\nI remember I don't know if that was the week but she clearly talked about it and said that she had it since July and that\nShe told us all about it that whoever Senate doesn't want to be named and
