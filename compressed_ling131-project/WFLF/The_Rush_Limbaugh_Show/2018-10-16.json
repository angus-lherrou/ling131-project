[laughter] how did you eat they were just so blasted\nSays why you'd data him with his shirt off so that was good for them to stay away from alcohol yeah I could do some really good you should see it\nEr yeah er and er it did means doing very well\nOr at least as far as the reviews go people are talking about it as a big time Oscar movie have you seen what does it first in the first man first man have you seen that I haven't I'm ... I'm new to buy these sort of cultural controversy around surrounding that movie ... which I mean we talked about it when the story came out\nThat they didn't put the scene of than planting the flag and the moon right I'm In the movie which is the iconic moment of this story\nI mean but the the the argument was a ... is showing is making it into a global thing and I said if they have the patches of the flag on their arm yeah they have the usa on the rocket and the and the flag on the you know the the lunar lander\nWhat's the problem right it's it's an odd choice I thought you know it's the iconic moment of that movie why wouldn't you put it in the movie\nI mean it's kind of moment of that whole situation I don't think so I think the iconic moment is the one step for man ... another one yeah yeah I mean there's a couple yeah um but we now a nice not seen the movie um but there's a couple of articles that are out talking about the flag and first of all the flags all over the movie\nI mean they they can say that you know Fifteen twenty examples of the flag all over the place in some of it is like they just a patch or any of that yeah which which you kind of understand would be really obvious if they tell you I'm not even only just that for example\nUh apparently they don't show them planting the flag into the moon however in the scene you can see the flag planted in the mood in the background blaming already been planted in there and they show it it's either a voice in the flag they just don't wait about a moment\nNot good enough what if those forty year old women are they like\nSent her to fly again and I was in their own rent it is so it's kind of thing and\nThere a couple of bottles of shark today you might not understand that but I mean are we not just the victim here of of\nOf the budget the outrage I like it does not seem to be a thing no it's most of it's not most of it's not this okay today there's a tweet from Donald Trump oh did he say something crazy of course they did it simply from Donald Trump today we're\nAlso talking about a war in Elizabeth Warren's Cherokee heritage\nWhy does this matter I mean you know again we have the Saudi Arabia thing going on that as much more important I mean not to mention that we are going to hit a trillion dollars in debt again for this year another trillion dollars in debt there is no\nSide of that letting up despite the fact that we're in a good economy were were were popping out a trillion plus on the books when the unemployment rate is almost at full employment or almost at the peak of our employment situation we are at a point where we are the stock market despite a couple of bad days this week\nA has been raging for a very long time\nA housing prices are up everything you know everything is ... point in the right direction and we're still throwing a trillion dollars on the fire [noise]\nI'm just put this up this new bad are from CNN a disappearance of journalists put spotlight on Trump's business ties that he is because candidate Trump talked about uh doing business with the Saudi Arabia and yes it talked about that for very long my gosh are you kidding me now\nThe only reason why they care about the Saudi Arabians they forget about you forget about gas prices forget about the economy forget about the tech sector forget about all of that\nThis is just another way for them to talk about Donald Trump don't play that game just don't play that game\nI Wish I cared about anything in the world as much as you get an cares about what Donald Trump tweet I mean there are absolutely chemically obsessed with this man they are it's it's incredible they are chemically addictive and\nThey cannot break the shell\nAnd unfortunately the one who loses in that ... them\nDo weddings news adequate to talk about er and news radio Ninety three point one WFL Larry Mm\nOf Native American DNA Carlos de boost among pay use samples from Saint Paul parole and calamity you have to stand in for Native American\nThey gave me my task Indian DNA because they didn't have any and she goes out and announces this\nSo she is one one thousand twenty fourth Mexican\nOne thousand twenty fourth Peruvian one one thousand twenty fourth Colombian and mushy trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of Indian DNA\nWhy is there not much Indian DNA out there or was the problem that bustamante couldn't find any matches\nFor Warren using only Indian DNA so he felt the need doing expanded\nTo include in South America when other reason there isn't much in the DNA is because they\nAre very very wary of\nThis the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine the lineage they use junior logical trace\n\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus us in this country in the Mormon church out in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical pray organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing\nAnd that story I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize\nDNA if any of this but ... the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except British inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA\nAnd by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test from a little kitten ... myth wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... have or take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate a future debate and that's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he ... that she wouldn't show up as the Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies compass causing them to go insane and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and ... out in the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about\nThe Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can and this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it to go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this is going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but then if you look at\nThe reality of voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right and it all started with Iraq Hussein all and two thousand ten\n[noise] do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama go through the two thousand fourteen midterms\nThe Democrat Party lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide\nSeats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses\nA governorships are you\nEven go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over a hundred seats\nThey were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election they continue to lose even more and the and the dead set lie\nThe assistance of the Democrats treatment of Kevin all the Republican Party not all of it but it's it's it's moving toward unification at least in terms of opposition to the Democrats the Democrats are not\nUnified and one of these four of them\nSay they want to be president now [noise]\nThis audio is for

denizen of Twitter but I Know a lot of people who are\nAnd then the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown when you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people\nFind the time attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studies to focus on us this DNA did not actually use samples\nOf Native American DNA the Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr\nCarlos ... samples from may go ... in Columbia\nTo stand in for Native Americans now she's out there touting that it's true is she's an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth [noise]\nAnd there wasn't even any in the in our Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to\nI mean it's laughable it is the static and I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each and every day out there saying\nThat what Bill Clinton did with Monica ... no no no no that was not abused that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making the answer for herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out\nIn order to save both herself and her husband who are assumed to be embarking on what\nA stadium chore ... Oh yes [noise]\nBill and Hillary aren't going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged doesn't like this I mean if Trump can do what they can do it if Trump can do it anybody can do it they were going to try to get in on\nIt there's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say there is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor that Trump\nHas the Hillary certainly doesn't they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent had it\nAnd I'm Talking about this ... type of charisma or back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had I've never really they or I was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\nThe lake Donald Trump you know what this is why does it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring and Gary Hart parents\nSome ... some ... the state treasurer of Texas they gave a radio show Mario the pious they gave a radio show and the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who'd never done it before as the rush killer\nEvery one of them was anointed end inaugurated as the Democrat that\nWas going to steal the limelight away from this program then Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it\nNever has happened every attempt to supplant take over\nRelegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up to get the kind of\nCrowds that they want that you may think rush the rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks you may think that\nWhat we're going to find out common sense will tell you Hillary Clinton could withdraw fly just\nDo a book selling party she couldn't draw applies to a campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact bus people\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons companies not waiting\nWith bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a brief moment to this\nThis notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple of audio soundbites Nate Silver this is the guru David analyst on the left who used to be at the New York times and then he went to ESPN and then he\nKeen on most each is the key even signed up for the ... season and then we are getting the extended family that's coming out on Wednesday I Would also keep a close watch on the China GDP numbers it's going to come out during the week\n... then there's the stock market report was saying ... senior strategist\n\nThey even tried to make up the evidence with the phony steel dot CA they tried to manufactured they planted allies all over the drive by media\nNothing has gotten rid of Donald Trump nothing hasn't turned the American people against Donald Trump can you imagine the frustration these are people who get their way every single time they target somebody for destruction\nWhenever they want to take a Republican out they are guaranteed a Ninety percent chance of success\nBecause they have the drive by media working right alongside with them and if they set their their crosshairs on somebody there as good as gone or damaged beyond repair they haven't lay the glove on Donald Trump\nThey're running out of weapons and then the process of running out of weapons they're losing their minds they're losing their rational sanity I Believe\nAnd this latest debacle over Kavanaugh\nDon't doubt for a minute that this thing was orchestrated unplanned from the get go as a late breaking\nUse only if necessary event they didn't lead with this because they knew it was flimsy they didn't lead with it because they knew they couldn't prove it they didn't lead with it it was it a central part of the Kavanaugh hearings because they knew there wasn't any evidence for it and they knew that ball Z Ford could not pull this off under pressure\nI'm Still shocked at balls he showed up to testify I I think that took everything they had to persuade her to get there 'cause I don't think she ever intend to do and I don't think when they pitched her on this whole thing was ever part of the plan that she would ever actually have to testify\nAnd does anybody believe\nThat uh fifty one every year old woman literally talks as she talks that way in her classroom teaching students if she does\nThat mean that just [noise]\nAnd I guess it's possible I guess she does but I I I don't believe that either I don't believe that's how you talk to the balls before and you run into rather beach Santa Cruz that's not how she's going to be talked she's like you're running around the beach out there\nUh and she's not going to be talking to you like he's in perpetual fear of being hit or damaged or harm gr yelled at or whatever\n[noise] ah anyway the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things the the\nReal objective from the get go from all of this the cleanest way for this to happen and what have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him if they have been able to do that get Trump's approval numbers ... the thirties those are the twenties then they could get rid of him\nThey failed at that\nAll they did was cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly and in the process Kavanaugh saying they actually turn some people who are sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching\nThe most powerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying a human being and a wife when\nThere isn't any evidence that would warrant such a thing but the Democrats tip of care that there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always relied on the seriousness of the charge working with the media\nTo create a daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse than poison\nAnd must be dealt with as though he or she is poison well none of it has worked\nAnd even in their own post Trump's approval numbers hover in the mid forties Rasmussen Trump's at fifty one\nThey see the approval numbers for Trump of the African American community they see the economy based ... I'm telling you that they are teetering on the brink\nOf being hold it altogether being able to hold it altogether and it's\nIn this universe\nFirst framework contacts I just I don't see this massive blue wave that they do and I'm not sure they even see it and if you're hoping I think it's a birthright to them it's the way things ought to be should be and\nI got to do everything they can to make it reality but these are massive elections all over the country and it's going to be a challenge for them [noise] we'll see I mean look it's possible that I I'm like Nate Silver I have no idea what's going to happen only difference between that silver and me is that I make no pretense of knowing\nWhat's going to happen all I'm doing with you today is sharing how I break this now using common sense\nI've got\n... two thousand twelve to six years of on the ground actual experience of Democrats losing elections of people turning against the Democrats having fewer seats electoral seats in Washington\nThan they've had since the Nineteen twenties and I don't see anything is going to reverse that ... Hussein oh\nSinglehandedly made this happen for rock Obama's presidency is what turned to people against the Democratic party\nAnd it was based on substance because Obama was a likeable guy and he was African American in check off a box I'm not racist look at this I voted for Obama and still when people had the chance they voted against every aspect of the Obama agenda they could\nWhereas Obama by the white campaigning for all these Democrats trying to retake the house and Senate\nWhere is the worst plugs\nBeto O'Rourke heard about this Beto O'Rourke is following the Obama a mold Beto O'Rourke raise thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter\nHe has been asked by Democrats to share some of that money for other races which are closed in ... has told them to go pound sand\nThat tone has told them if you're a lecture that important when you go raise the money yourself I'm going to ... ... that's the way I Want to use this the way I was not my job to raise money for you exactly what Obama's Obama\nPeople remember this he resented the hell out of having to GO Campaign for house races he thought it was sold but need him he had he wanted no part of campaigning for house\nRaces and very little to do with campaigning for Senate races\nBecause it was but nice [laughter] the office of the presidency to go that low real reason he didn't want to do with this Obama didn't have confidence of coat tails\nAnd that ... is not going to want to share any of his money not being good socialist got all this money it's not fair that back to oh who's by the white what does he down seven or eight points now the latest poll\nA it's not fair that Beto has more than he needs and won't share it with other needy Democrats but that's what he's saying that he won't do [noise]\nUm yeah look I also have the um the shell game situation and there's some things about this guy that I don't think are being widely reported exactly who he has been Dr\n... let me just tell you what the drive by purpose here is again\nThe drive by is are trying as hard as they can to link Donald Trump to show ... murder my the way just so you know there are a couple of CNN\n... pronounce it can cause show gee because there's two genes in there\nEvery time I've heard the word the name pronounce it's always been ... ad ... pronounce his name that way Robin Leach who made a star out of ab ... who was a saw the arms merchant\nAnd he was practically featured every other week and the lifestyles of the rich and famous\nHis name was pronounced ...

long time listener first time caller I just wanted to make a couple of points than the\nDemocrats are are eight full of a spark and Pocahontas ...\nUm I think that ah these are state elections and well I think the worst got to go out to vote Republican uh 'cause I I Believe that they take a host they're not learning how to roll back from tax a tax cuts roll back all his work\nHe's got they're going to put the hammer down on the people that voted for such as the lowest learn the IRS scandal I I think they're going to hurt the base\n[noise] I don't think there's any question about that in

the things they are going to do the things they have plant\n'em anyway I got to take a break because at time wasn't finished but I\nWill continue only be missed were America's worst news were born in

they're the good guys the experts who do this best there\nEvent and it off it's not not when you send Fifteen people in there now there's one other thing about this\nBox that ah [noise] the media in the United states is trying to say trying to report they're trying to say that there is recorded evidence of the interrogation and murder because Joe ... show he was wearing an apple walk\nHis fiance was outside in the family said Dan she had his iPhone in the family sedan that she had instructions to call a man I've got his name here I'm not gonna bother to look at it up she had instructions to call somebody didn't come back out he was going to get\nYou know divorce officially recognized sort of get married at fiance that it's waiting outside of the families the ban and she had instructions to identify mutual friend if he didn't emerge meaning he thought\nHe was lord and there he bought something could happen\nI reporting that here's ... was recording everything that happened functions not possible in the first place an apple watch is a slave to the phone and\nApple does that even if if we had a new watch the series for what she didn't because it hasn't been out long enough\n... but even if you get if he if he bought it in the United states and had it it's still not capable of L T E operation in Turkey apple has not yet brought\nL T eve service to the to the I watch the apple watch in Turkey which means that there is no way his watch could have worked independently of his phone\nNow there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch it's just a giant red button that you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the concept was no way\nYou its its maximum twenty yards Bluetooth that that connects watches to phones twenty yards twenty five hours I'm trying to think on the golf course when I lose the range of phone stops talking to the watch\nIt's maybe twenty or twenty five yards at most about what should be Seventy five feet on the tops on the outside sixty feet more like it there is no way his watch was recording anything and\nTransmitting it anywhere so there there can't be a recording of what happened to it besides that the Saudis would have seen the watched by taking it off\nA and they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it\nThe watch is still not an independent piece attack even watches that can operate under LT they still need to be fair to the phone [laughter] there's not enough storage capacity on the watch to store the data of a recording if doesn't story yeah it can store I think up to a\nHundred songs maybe more now but for the most part that has to stream them it's not an independent device so the ... there probably is no evidence on the guys watch or even on the phone\nIt well the [noise]\nExcept for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be at some point put back in range and connected to the fun to watch what needs to be back into close proximity of the phone for his heart rate data to show up on the phone\nIt's simply ... it's simply not possible what they're saying\nThe way they're saying it it's not possible to watch is not independently capable of doing what they're reporting it needs an iPhone and and to remain paired to the iPhone you can't be more than\nI Wish I knew this exactly I'm I'm I Know when I lose my connection when I'm On the golf course and it's [noise] [noise] thirty\nYards Ninety feet at the tops tops and this guy had walls to deal with inside of the consulate or he couldn't have been that close to the phone which is in the car\nThe family said damn with the with the fiance now uh [noise]\nI've got the audio here of James okay if a secret audio taking enough Claire McCaskill and her campaign and Rob Mills I this is\nThis is important because there's no it's just not being reported in Missouri which is Claire McCaskill state it also happens to be my home state about what we did hear we went and we did a Google Search\nFor new ways of the secret video from project maritime Claire McCaskill and we wanted to see where this\nThere are times news have been reported so we got Washington Times the Daily Caller Daley wire Russia Today a PJ medium Breitbart News you know your report there's no way piece here why there is no New York times here there's no\nSt Louis Post Dispatch here there is no Saint Louis globe Democrat even though they know publisher and fifty years there's no Saint Louis penny saver here there's no Saint Louis TV station\nMatch and I don't know about Kim Alexis St Louis but we're covering that by doing it now um there's nothing Yahoo News nothing not one\nDrive by Oregon mainstream media outlets shows up in a Google Search when you Google Claire McCaskill and project verite sauce every site running this\nWould be a conservative side or a conservative bloc there's not one mention of St Louis papers or TV stations here\nAnd what it basically is is McCaskill recorded on secret video admitting that she cannot tell Missouri voters the truth what she really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get elected\nWe can't\nOpenly said that says one of her age we got to soundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff talking to the on identified project Vera toss secret journalist and in this particular soundbites Senator McCaskill\nAre talking about it ... and the project maritime us secret journalist are talking about the second amendment\nPaying only I think we can actually do you think is going on where you are a young\nMan\nWere you able to hear of that\nAre you able to understand what she was being asked in her aunt okay All right let me let me read to you because I couldn't if it were I Would not be able to make sense of that\nOr even though I've got a direct audio ... that just sounded like noise to me but here's the transcript\nSaid if we have the kind of the year I think we might have any Democrats winning big we could actually be in a position we can get votes on this gun stuff on the floor and we can get sixty and McConnell knows he just doesn't want to put it on the floor because then it goes to the house and then it's awkward 'cause all those house members are total and\nYou and there's no middleman markup retail or an additional wholesale advertising promotion budgets and so they're able to sell the set a price point\nThat they consider to be much more reasonable that's why they'd be another reason for dealing on line as they want to have a personal relationship what every customers so it's bowling branch B O L L\nAnd branch dot com we still have a a number of things that struck this caravan from Honduras and Trump's threat to withdraw all age of Honduras doesn't grab that caravan\nAn order it or to return back home so you sit tight uh hanging there'll be a brief time outcome and look at this one of the thing I'm trying to remember when I got here who probably two or three [laughter] I'll find it during the break here\nI Can't believe I covered just about everything\nHas to be some stuff that\nAnd welcome back okay somebody asked me a good question about they watch the apple watch worn by ...\nThrush what about my ... a good question [noise]\nThe way why fine on the apple watch works\nIs this and it's it's not as simple as you think I've learned all this by user experience\nThough the watch is always a slave to the phone so the the way it works your phone is with you and you're wearing a watch your watch is ... it's connectivity is determined by your phone so if your phone is using ... to connect\nOr even an L. P. E. or cellular to connect your watch is connected to it by Bluetooth\nIf the to get separated let's say your watch your your phone is on a wife I network\nThe watch is capable of why five but only if the iPhone that it's paired June knows that wide network for example when I'm at home um I leave my phone in\nThe library when I go walk the dogs the state has a massive yard so I'm Out of range so my phone is not with me but my watch connect via wife by\nBecause my phone is connected the wife ... and the watch learns that but I still I have to manually answer\nThe why fi password on my watch for it to work it did not automatically translate transmit the uh the password from the phone to watch\nIt took me a while to figure that I'm Out there walking the dogs and the watches connecting on al ... he had a wife ... what the hell's going on so I checked and I found out that I had not edited the password for my wife I network on my watch\nWhat I doubt that your mouth to show these phone had why fi connection to the Saudi consulate\nIf it's password required and his wife is sitting outside with the phone she might be able to see the wife I network in there but if she doesn't know the password that phone's not going to connect to the Saudi wife I end up the phone doesn't connect to what the watch will not\nNow if he had a history of going into that consulate with his phone and if one of previous visit he had logged into their wife I network where the password then his watch would connect to be a wife fight if he had also entered\nThe wife I network password on his watch that's just the phone is not nearby\nI just don't think any of that happened I don't know how proficient this guy was with tech it is possible that his watch could have recorded everything\nOn why fight if he had actually answered the consulates why fi network password independently on his watch just because the phone has has been logged on what the password does not mean that the watch as\nEvery device connecting\nDoor why find that were half to go through the password nothing is automatic now Apple's got it really simplified view or do you know you'll people may not notice it may have happened to you to know what I'm saying let's say that you are going over to uncles eats house\nAnd uncles IQ as a wife I network and you're going over there and when you get the uncles weeks house you ask ... for the past word to his wife you don't have to do that anymore all you have to do is make sure uncles IQ is in the room with you in whatever wherever you are in the house\nAnd it on your phone you go and turn on the wife I network find the wife I network at the minute you do that\n... phone will get his alerts saying do you want to share your wife I network with others in your house and uncles equal click yes\nAnd that will send the password for his wife I network to your phone you are the guest them as they will do this automatically that way hosts do not have to remember their passwords and do not have to give them the gas that happens automatically as of Iowa eleven\nYou should try to see if you don't notice\nIt's fascinating it's it's uh it's amazing how apple has continued to idiot proof and simplify all this\nBut I'm just telling you that ... would have had entered the wife I network password to the Saudi consulates ... on his watch even if it was already done on his phone even if needed to do it on his watch in order to activate the wife ... worker access it\nIf he'd done that if his watch worked on why fight it meant consulate then he wanted to have been able to record everything that happened on the watch if he had done it on the map\nOr\nWhat if the car ... wife I Know it it it it it because he's probably be out of range for it but but it would still need the password still need\nA [laughter] well I don't know if they would say no or not I mean he's a he's a journalist up until this visit was probably will find devotee okay who knows but I doubt\nThat his car had a wife or that would require you to have a hot spot\nFrom whatever cell carry over their offers them but even even if that were the case um\nLook get another example of try to explain that you go to a city and you get in a car picks you up at the airport or whatever and the car service has wife I it it it's just a hot spot", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "16"}
