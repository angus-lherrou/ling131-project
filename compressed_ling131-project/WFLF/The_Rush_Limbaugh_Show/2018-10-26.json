they were those on the left that said it was a conservative um we've said the whole time let's wait for information might be a crazy\nGuy and might be as it was amazing to just say I'm a lot of people will make a prediction with no evidence on something like this right they'll say oh it was the right wing or or it was a left where\nAnd then when it turns out to be one of those two they claimed victory as if what they did was was a good idea and it wasn't that not a good idea you know the fact that you come out and you say you blame the right with no evidence and then it turns out to be someone on the right that doesn't make you you're we're process good\nRight that's\nThat's what I I just [laughter]\nBut I just read a comment from somebody has a ... this this van looks like what's

it's\nYou know what do you do hear with these things it does it ... at the very least it is at least we can hopefully avoid any injury remember there's been literally nothing that's happened with these\nBig media spectacle but you know ... much less of a media spectacle that what happened when Trump and many others mad at us and others and the government received white powder in the mail\nLast week or two weeks ago so you know obviously we know why it's a bigger\nA bigger deal now number one it was a media members specifically that was targeted in this with CNN getting one of the packages and number two obviously uh the uh the chance to kind of blame the broadly against the right is going to be something that the media is going to take advantage of it at all possible\nBut we don't know yet and we'll find out from this person to see if they were ... you know how serious the attempt was when we look at the bottom construction will find that out and we always find that you know it's

plastered to a window\n[noise] um [noise]\nI also have something sent to me here said that he was um I'm from ... and a member of the Green Party but\nWhat I don't see anything on here that says he is are there it is about political party Green Party birthday march seventeenth Nineteen sixty two\nAh income information pending what is this site can't tell what this site is it it's um [noise]\nAnyway identifies it as a member of the Green Party [noise] uh yeah these got pictures of Trump and he's got a GOP stickers all over the uh the window so law enforcement has a press conference waited for two thirty\nThis afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our\nCory Booker in New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nRuby recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them\nThat some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them had been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate them a blow 'em up because\nThey might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to them is still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks\nAnd this is typical during events like this is everybody becomes a journalist that everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation law enforcement's undoubtedly going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they like trust or what have you so there's going to be a daily use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to\nBelieve the first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti Democrat guy\nIdentifying the the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomber the mad ... bomber because it creates first impressions\nIt it created this worldwide presumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter set up at the people Trump is but this is this is the\nUh the narrative if you will drive by as attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions\nAre what are matters of same thing is happening today\nSome sort of political message or id so this is what I just want you to who are listening here and watching this ... this is what is being reported\nIn a number of different publications now and I just I just want to caution you that since this is what's being reported first impressions are now being registered by people as they hear all of this I Am reporting it to you under\nGuidance I'm telling you that I I just\nTell you what I'm finding in uh in various publications that are that are floating around there has been a a mad kept desire to id who ever was sending these bombs as a Trump supporter\nOr all week long and they have not waited they are they're moving at light speed to make this association such as in this headlines suspected make\nAmerica great again bomber I deed as Native American Trump supporters say ... or say oc\nA fifty six [noise] so [noise]\nThere is still have this this one I'm Still trying to figure out somebody sent me this screen shot of a website that list is party is the Green Party which doesn't jibe with any of this\nI mean the Green Party would be all in on CNN the Green Party would be all in on a\nA bunch of things that are anti Trump so some of this that we are being sent and seeing doesn't make a whole lot of sense [noise] so we're still in the process of trying to track it all down now in the midst of this there continues to\nBe news reported about the mid term elections and there's some other news that was reported and discussed about the bombs before today when people were told the identity of the bomber and showing pictures of the bombers a van\nA down in in ah in plantation Florida and one of the\nThings that I had intended to share with you today as Chuck Todd was on the MSNBC yesterday and we have an audio I lifted the ban on MSNBC to report this that Chuck Todd said that he was afraid the Russians were behind this scare\n\nChuck Todd said that he fears the Russians couldn't be responsible for the mail bomb scare that has targeted top officials in the Democratic\nParty as well as CNN and Robert De Niro quote I have this fear it could be some Russian operation out there are designed to do what's happening now and that is so all of this confusion\n\nChuck Todd added that we shouldn't rule out the possibility the Russians are behind this and the male bottom scare is dividing the country\nAnd that's what its purpose is this was on his show called meet the press\nDaily [noise] now I the reason that I [laughter] the Russians what is known worry about that is that here you have the moderator of meet the press have Chuck Todd\nWho's still believes despite the fact that we haven't seen any evidence despite the fact that there isn't any evidence Chuck Todd still operating under the belief that Russians stole the two thousand sixteen election\nSomebody whose mind may be closed and made up about something that did not happen and and and in fact the exact opposite is what happens is we all know Hillary and her team\nWere doing the clothing with Russia but that doesn't matter the director of the moderator of meet the press\nLike the Russians could be behind it because they're the ... time to view this whole thing was bound and determined to help a\nPresident Trump which means the Russians would have been it's just\nThe way people think amazes me it always does [noise]\n\nOkay so\nThat is the sound of\nAn identifiable website identify this guy in the Green Party being ripped to shreds [laughter] [noise] um\nNow be because of the stickers all over ... stylish white van the drive by media are concluding that he has a right\nWinger he's a right winger and he is a Trump loving and deranged individual\nNow according to Florida voting records he has a registered Republican full name says are ... and his party affiliation as of march for two thousand sixteen was Republican Party\nAnd he's a been active as a registered Republican since March fourth of two thousand sixteen um and as his motor status is um is also active now that information is from heavy dot com to claim they got it\nFrom the Florida voters search site which they might have done but they would have had to know his birthday to get it\nOr we don't know his birthday so we can't double check the claim here so this this stuff\nJust happened to happen to right is the program is beginning I have a lot of data you know is a highly influential a major media figure I have all kinds of people trying to influence me with what I'm saying flooding lose on with things they want me to repeat\nA now say I guess the Philippine name the guy's family seems to have come from the Philippines but they're calling him Native American\nI and again I'm flooding in his own here with the with the information for you that as as I receive it [noise] um and whether or not any of this stuff is true keep in mind that what's making first impressions\nAgain I Can't emphasize that uh [noise] enough\nNow there Dr buys have the stop their coverage and have\nJoined the President Trump\nAreas that goes listen to it a little bit of ourselves he's got a big powwow headed up there at\nLeast she ate it for the media thank you very much I thought I'd do that and uh we feel very strongly a again congratulations to all law enforcement who had the best in the world and they just showed and thank you very much\nFor young black leaders of the White House [noise]\nNow to the subject at hand [noise]\nTo be with so many brilliant and that's what you are burning courageous and yet they can proud of them are so once a month out of this\nBecause he is now getting onto the ... the the real meaning the reason for the meeting there which is unprecedented by the way it's a leadership committee of hundreds of young black leaders are in America that are gathering at the White House has been a lot of ... about this I guess the president made\nAnd acknowledgement to law enforcement foreign ... great work and tracking down the bomber and\nBringing that story to a to a conclusion and we were rolling on it and whatever he said that was relevant we will pass that I'll say I want to grab the phones get started berets open line friday and I know you want to weigh in on this\nAh so are we going to start a just as if we have the ability you don't have the ability to give them okay Jimmy in Omaha Nebraska we're experimenting with a bunch of things here today folks bear with us Jimmy and Omaha great to have you how you doing sir\nThanks for having me on rush 'em I Want to run my theory value um and I'm going to say in advance I I had this thought process in my mind even two years ago I'd have to look in the mirror and say what's wrong with you but I've become so cynical towards the media and the radical left in this country\nThat I'm just thinking this way nowadays okay but this this whole thing with a package bombs to me reeks of deep state and I truly believe you've been talking about how you don't think there's going to be a red wave\nOr a blue wave I'm Sorry ... and I think I think these folks know that there is no red I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are\n[noise] and I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house once the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward\nOn that Feisal document and that the CIA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the the I think this package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national right groups planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in the selection for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nI so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not ... they're going to win the house back Democrats and then the state thing not going to win the house back\nNot going to win the Senate back so all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is the Democrats and the deep state laws as they can say\nThe election invalid too much was going on we can't we can't start democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that the the deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and have the left\nWhen in fact they orchestrated it you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean like I said rush three years ago I Would have said I'm Crazy I mean I I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\nIn company incorporated ... bc and why I see [noise]\nYour brain is an amazing thing as you get older naturally begin to change causing a lack of ... or

could imagine if I can remember that very much for me to have you here too so what shaking\n[laughter] um well I wanted to let you know I've been listening since Nineteen Ninety One when the federal judge I was quite a few for introduced me to your program um and so it's so great to be on here so many years later I wanted\nAnd I love that pedigree look at where you come from you come for you you have a federal judge was working and that's who recommend that you are so that that that that's a wonderful pedigree that's a that's a like a great resume that we've got you into the Institute\nAnd by the way I recently gave them a gift of a twenty four seven subscription [laughter] I'm so I'm sure he's listening\nToday oh that's awesome that that is that's what I Can't tell me how sweet that is you know what\nYou bring that up I have to tell you we we we are ... I don't know how to save this other than to say it we are continuing to set records with the size of membership at Rush Limbaugh dot com it continues to blow my mind pleasantly so\nUm we don't know if it's just it's great people are signing up left and right it tells me how crucially important\nThink these times are and ... and you would you would think that the record high would be shortly after we introduced at some twenty five years ago Twenty years ago but no man it is is that just rolling if people like you make it all happened by giving away subscription I Can't thank you enough\nWhile the product right now you're willing to spend money on it but I wanted to ask you I asked the question of taste such on his comment yesterday about the caravan yeah though\nI Know how lucky I Am to be born in the U.S I have compassion for oh people all over the world who live in poverty who live under a horrible condition\nBut it it kind of the world's population live on less than ten dollars per day shift ... live on less than two dollars and fifty cents a day so my question to him is are we obligated to let all of them and to the u._s. um art to support them all with us tax dollars\nAnd it's not how do we choose who to give the gift of coming into the U.S and she was a trick question I'd like to suggest that we have an answer for that and it's called the legal immigration which is the only fair way to make that choice for\nCheer here exactly right the way we have always done it\nYou know getting into this country under legal circumstances has always been a privilege it's always been an honor its always required some effort you have to learn about America you you have to want to be an American\nNow as for governor case that I don't think governor Casey was advocating for anybody in poverty around the world being led into America that's not what he was doing\nHe was simply trying to advertise the size of his heart to I think governor case sick is still one of these people that thinks Donald Trump has destroyed the Republican Party and the things governor case that cares about the governor case it wants everyone in low hey you know I saw big heart\nI look at these people that are down trodden a disadvantage that I still love 'em and I still care about about I don't think he'll of them and we've got to be able to put ourselves in a in in their shoes and understand he he just want everybody to understand that he has a caring thoughtful compassionate person as opposed to this bump couldn't he thinks is in the White House\nNow I\nI don't know that any of my thoughts your minute thing obviously I'm just sharing with us some of the thoughts that I've had that I and I ...\nProcess but you know I just didn't work these out when I first started noticing this stuff so to audio somebody number twenty six we have there there is a CNN sucks sticker on this man's\n[noise] [laughter]\nHe goes to a post office kiosks whereabouts are\nCameras to mail these these ... none of them went off\nAnd from what I'm told for reliable law enforcement none of them could help now there was also a story out there that some of them are so unstable that law enforcement Heather detonate them rather than transport them to the FBI lab in Quantico\nVirginia you know these watches excuse me so I'm OK I'm OK I did not fall you know these new watches\nHave fall detectors on him I mean if you fall if the watched detect that you have fallen it will offer to call emergency services for you if you're incapacitated all you have to do is do nothing if you do nothing after a certain number ... it'll call\nYeah that's the whole nine one one where you are it also gives you the opportunity so no I didn't fall I'm fine I'm OK this thing goes off on me twice the show while I'm sitting here\nMy wild Jess ... my expression field manner of speaking as drinking might watch triggering my watch into thinking that I Am boiling the gang up\nIt starts vibrating no you know what this is a great health featured that a lot of people are buying this watch\nFor grandma and grandpa because it does it work they've ... they've tested this watch on Hollywood stumped actors and ... men and women and it works but it's also it shows it nothing wrong with is comes back with false positives\nBut I'm ... my hand than even hit the table and does it just wildly just sticky waving around here in my fall alert has been triggered him to watch that is what [noise] just interrupted me but my my point is it this guy\nHere has been screaming noticed me and now here comes Dana Bash from CNN justice after the CNN sucks sticker on this ban [noise] CNN sucks [noise]\nHere we go\nThat image standing next\nTo president didn't direct deaths is not technically of responsible for that but he is responsible for not just allowing the chat than I'm stuck at his rallies joking [noise]\nMaking clear that he likes and all you need is one forgive me crock pot\nAnd we've been saying this for two years\nAnd looks like one may have emerged and that is the danger and that is a reason why leadership is the way it is and you can have an enemy you can have a political discussion you could have political discourse but when you cross the line\nIt is extremely dangerous and that has what has been a giant mission and everything we've heard from anybody at the White House\nOkay so in CNN's ... that's Trump's ban and its Trump's bombs and you know in a\nIn a vacuum and in a narrow world what Dana Bash just sent here would be perfectly fine\nBut the thing that really irritates me about CNN and the rest of these people in the leftist ... is that they permit themselves to say all of these incendiary things about anybody they want\nThey permit themselves to attack the character and the intentions and the decency and the honesty of any of their targets\nAnd they can call every president kids work like they did George W. Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous\nThings in the world but of course there's never any danger that uh one of their crackpot ... just going to take action except the theory is\nCrackpot CNN viewers shot up a Republican baseball practice crock pot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after\nExample of attempt in violence against conservatives when right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public from happening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places and these are genuinely threatening people\nAnd they are confronting people and demanding that they leave and and there's not there's never any condemnation of the ... you never hear CNN can damning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj this is what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insanity is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nAnd I believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way CNN starts this with\nTheir unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it and ... the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people are seeing her find people's data that Trump fires back at them\n\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch\nPowerless lay as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots of us and our issues they have lied about the misstated the miss characterize them they attempt to do it ... and the character in honor of conservative people\nSpokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun in a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our politics because the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\n... chocolate where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody else comes down to ...\nA lot of people separate Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply I I'm not talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and high judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves\n\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is turning perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it\nThey're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the aisle act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\nAnd to be exam\nFrom having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this van I mean if you [laughter] if you wanted\nTo decorate and dress up a van that says notice me and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top are major over to stop\nThis is what you would do so\nMy two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today as he convened a meeting black Leadership Conference a young black leaders from all over the country this is not been\nDone before in in this in this manner\nUm [noise] and he's talking about the arrest in these bombs here\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that have been male too high profile figures throughout our country and a media organization I Am pleased to inform you that law enforcement\nHas apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[laughter]\nJob by law enforcement we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation find the person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nNow I Wonder when again remind you of Trump pacing if if if you think Trump is not as\n... pointed is your baby or selling out just hang on I Want to remind you of Trump's first reaction after ... foreign showed up\nAt the ... at the Senate Judiciary hearing what a Trump say I've found her very credible I really hope that she continues to testify I think if what happened there happened in Kevin on maybe ... that's what he said at the beginning and he did it\nIs it Rush Limbaugh dot com and look for them a hindrance military salute give away\nThanks to my hindered the makers of the toughest utility vehicles on earth and God Bless all of you who protect our freedom\nTake advantage of rock bottom prices and test drive on the hindrance today at cops triangle tractor in used is or visit cops tractor dot com that's cobs

and enforce the law\nFor by the Tea Party express [noise]\nUF LA [noise]\nA couple of observations about those two audio somebody's replayed Donald Trump of the White House that I was\nLike three hundred and fifty four hundred\nYoung black leaders from various walks of life in the United states did you hear what happened when the president of the United states praise law enforcement\nSome during applause\nStanding ovation in some parts of the room but some during applause nobody took any in there and nobody started booming law enforcement among this group of young conservative black leaders something else\nIn in the remarks made by President Trump he was very gracious tort law enforcement he was very gracious toward the work done to bring this ... this gusting make America great again bomber to justice\nAnd I I I think before the day is out you're gonna see various panelists and pundits and commentators and the drive by media over the edge driven over the edge by Trump doing for two reasons one they're going to consider him a total fraud\nThat he's calling for unity you might you might just going to happen maybe before this program is over there is going to be a paddle on CNN or pee MSNBC or some leftist on Fox in a call Trump by\nTotal front calling for unity when he is responsible for all of the\nChaos and division they will say that Trump was on believable a brazen for talking about this is if he's not complicit they'll rip him for acting like he had nothing to do with it\nRemember the old Limbaugh the rub the Limbaugh fear him was the process by which for rock Obama\nActually got to pretend and portrayed himself as involves\nGetting any policy that was going wrong or any mistakes that were being made\nPositions herself as an outsider tackling whoever was screwing it up [noise] um that's the ... the around the Obama effect not response that's we're going to their can accuse Trump\nDon't just to clarify the Limbaugh fear of them was how I explained that the media never held up by my count for anything that was going wrong including his own policies and Obama would never even always position himself\nAs an outsider are up against powerful interests that were standing in his way and he was valiantly fighting them meanwhile it was his policies that were growing up\nAnd I will I marveled at this and how how the relationship to the bottom of the media permitted to him to go through his presidency on accountable\nAnd all those lives about Obamacare you keep your doctor keep your plan twenty five hundred dollar per premium decrease every year that kind of thing never called him on it well here's Trump out there and he's acknowledging law enforcement\nAnd they're going to call him a total fraud here by trying to say he's free unity when he's that guy and they're going to say is responsible for\nIt is not a man and they'll say that he is bracing just unbelievably brazen for talking about business if he's not complicit in\nThat he's trying to stand above it they gave Obama the benefit of the doubt on everything but they are going to hold Trump to mark my words okay for those of you're watching on the dental camp here is a shot that has three windows filled with stickers what in their ...\nAnd his band as is the case with all of these they will eventually be at Rush Limbaugh dot com so everybody can see them you know I could withhold them and have them only for digital camera usage but that that would be cheap\nAh and and on necessary\n[noise] we're just taking advantage or of the tech or being able to use the switch or to show you these things have you looking at big van window there on the left\nOr you will see ... lower center you will see when you may not be able to tell I don't know what size screen you're looking but it's Hillary Clinton in the crosshairs of a rifle scope and just beneath her as you're looking at this to the left is Michael Moore\nAlso in the crosshairs of a shotgun and then to stickers over from Michael Moore is the CNN sucks\nSticker or whatever but the thing to notice they're three total windows in the van there's no way anybody could see in or out\nOf these windows these are in the rear by the way they're on the side of the van\nA you've got parents or the upper left look how evenly proportion every sticker is look at nothing is off line\nThere isn't any overlap nothing has been slapped up there in a passion or anger or any of that in either of the three windows that you'll see here\nNo no nothing is said that this is South Florida sun this guy's been driving around who knows how long nothing's faded this screams noticed me\nThis this would be the face you got a bunch of people down in South for I don't like Trump they see this band park somewhere and you know if there's somebody would be throwing things on it or scraping it with the kids or getting a paintbrush and tomatoes rotten eggs who knows whatever this damage pristine\nVan is a is almost like a a work of art\nHere is Chris in Las Vegas glad you wait until you're next year on open line friday high\nIt's there it's an honor and privilege appreciate that serve thank you\nI just wanted to say about the only thing this guy's van was actually meant the worst spotlights on a giant neon sign that said I did it a rest [laughter]\nThat's all the time [laughter] I mean I Can't speak out any more than it already has it's ridiculous\n\nYeah we what this guy's apparently been a law enforcement radar for a while uh they're claiming DNA got some DNA off I guess some of the packages here he's been arrested and and uh on law enforcement radar\nBut you wonder how long this vans been decorated like this how long it's been driving around down there unnoticed are on observed or\nOr what have you it does it just I don't know if there's something about this that [noise]\nI don't know I'm like you're watching a hundred percent right so you're a hundred percent right like it looks too good it's been out there in the sun for as long as it has been people in that state openly can despise the president and probably have a long time and nothing's happened to those guys and it's like\nSomebody just toss this guy the keys and tell them hang out for twenty minutes the cops will be here you know and then you just take it from there it's like how much more to set up in this book like this they even if this guy was part of the Republican Party\nGuy needs help and he doesn't represent anything but a small fraction of some extremism ... not hold a candle to what the party actually is very\nTrue very true goes without saying but I mean you got me imagining pictures now is van driving around and you see people would notice I mean I I noticed a bumper sticker on a car in front of me if I think it's looney tunes does this this man\n[noise] ah there's no way that this man doesn't get noticed in doesn't have people reacting to it in in certain ways so you think what then you you you you think this guy is being used\nYou know I don't know like I mean like a ... there's going to a gym we lose ... and the guy is just off his rocker and he just needed some medical help on the on off Russia I mean\nWas all Sheldon room to make room for coverage for the bomb story and when the news stopped covering something these people think well it's not happening anymore if it were not covering it it's it's it's not happening so\nThe sense was that the momentum was being lost by Republicans Republican voters the story was that Republican voters were\n[noise] [noise] somehow\nLosing their enthusiasm to I don't know what early vote a registered to vote was too late for that but whatever it was ... and now Trump has joined that parade President Trump today\nComplained about the pipe bombs being sent to prominent Democrats lamenting that this scare\nHas distracted from news about them in terms of even slowed Republican momentum he said Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote that was Trump's\nTweet now\nThere are some who believe that this is another example of Trump pacing\nJust like when he made his original statements about Christine balls the Ford being credible and compelling and then later\nSort of lowering the boom on her at a rally pointing out that she really had no evidence and no way to back up what she was alleging so some people think that he's a during the same thing here uh basically tampering expectations\n\nWith the bombers suppression statement the trumps out they're lowering expectations setting people up so asked to be able to say we overcame the bomber and we did great anyway and there's some people think that this is very very artful love Trump but he's getting really really good at this\nLowering expectations while he knows things are going to go well and then when they do go well he can go back and look at what we had to overcome luck of the obstacles that we that we came through\nAnd we try out so we will see Charlie Kirk of turning point you asked a\nTweet in a sea there'll be yesterday that the presidential approval rating has hit forty seven percent of his highest yet I don't need it aside the poll I'll guarantee you it's not a CNN poll\nAnd it probably is it an ABC Washington Post poll or even NBC Wall Street Journal maybe Rasmussen\nBuck forty seven percent in whatever pull it is is Trump's highest and also forty seven percent is free points higher than Obama's approval rating twenty ten midterms does anybody remember what happened to twenty ten midterms\nThis ... a little pop quiz on history now admittedly this is eight years ago\nIt seemed like eight years ago that Obama was president and mid term but how many seats the Republicans win\nIn two thousand ten mid term some of\nThe free\nThe Republicans one sick the free now in those terms conventional wisdom one out\nConventional wisdom is the party out of power makes big gains in the house and Senate primarily the house in the first election after a president is inaugurated\nWell that's what we have coming up here but but ... point is that Obama was sitting at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent and rising\nAnd therefore we uh we could be looking here have to have a bit of an upset [noise]\nThere's also polling Davis here in Florida and let me let me find this it is yeah Syrian golf barely two days after Democrat Andrew Gillum\nWas leading in most polls for governor of Florida a strategic Research Associates Paul conducted for great TV\nAnd released a couple of days ago shows Ron this Santas pulling into the lead forty eight forty five margin of error plus or minus three and a half\nSo statistically tied the poll is the first since the primaries last month to put the Santa Fe head of Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum\n\nNow there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum a cotton is thing operate and do you I Am reading\n[noise] by the way\nThat it is possible that the FBI is going to indict Gillum at some ... regardless of the election that he's going to be indicted for some of the corrupt practices have been investigated\nAnd formed a we had the news that he had he paid an under\nCover ...\nMoney to buy ... tickets in New York\nBeyond that emails in tax raise questions on Gillum trips with lobbyist records show Gillum new well in advance that he was out of state meetings with Adam Curry could help him network with power for developers businessmen and the lawyers\nI mean this is incredible that a newspaper is doing investigative journalism on a Democrat but the Miami Herald is\nA it's a it's not so we'll see how that plays out there's a Politico story today actually saw it last night that Trump fears a foreign to wipe out that Donald Trump fear\nIs that we're going to lose everything in Florida the socialist in Florida are going to win\nEverything and so Trump is scheduling even more rallies and more effort in Florida to try to save the day here it is a political star and that's the word it's being used the Trump fears a Florida wipe out\n\nThere are other news stories that didn't drug drug has links to them that are the socialists of America appear ready to win and dominate\nAnd convert America after long last too committed socialist policies so you find these stories all over the place [noise] about the intention of voters this ah this cycle\nAnd how they're faring the Charlie Cook report the vaunted inside the beltway analysts who take a look at every election inside out\nThe election just eleven days away now it seems that the overall Senate playing field won't change much although what appears that some of the races in toss up are getting even tighter\nThat says it's getting more difficult to see a path to the majority for Democrats with Democrat US Senator Heidi Heitkamp heading for defeat in North Dakota\nDemocrats now need a net gain of three seats to win the majority the one way would be to hold the five Democrats seats and toss up and pick up three of the four Republican seats in toss up\nIf you read the cook report I'm not going to bother telling you which ones those are but that's how they analyze the bottom lines of this story is that New Jersey has been moved to\nToss up in the cook report New Jersey has been moved to toss New Jersey ought to be deadlock Democrat any day of the year that you look at it New Jersey being in in toss up in Florida\nRemains a coin toss although Democrats see a path to victory for US Senator Bill Nelson well they better he's the incumbent he would have the path to victory in Montana between Jon Tester\nIncumbent state auditor Matt Rosendale that racist tightened tester maintains an advantage that's either just within or just outside the margin of error\nThere is an addition to the top ... columns that race in New Jersey moves to toss up from lean Democrat [noise]\nNow all of this movement taking place this week\nIn the midst of the bomb scare on the Republican side Republicans strategic us feel better about us senator Dean Heller is where he is in in Las Vegas strip dangerous also feel better about Martha ... Sally where she is in her race against the\nWell\nHere's to send them I'm going to with withhold the characterization of Tennessee in Texas remain unlikely candidate for the ... column so looking bad for Beto O'Rourke there\nBut the um\nSo there's a great difference of opinion even among Republicans where the race in Texas for cleaning crews and O'Rourke stands today cruise allies contend that\nHe's way ahead of O'Rourke well outside the margin of error\nBut the cook report people say we are aware of other polling that shows a closer race back to Florida for a moment thirty eight Florida sheriffs are demanding Andrew Gillum withdraw his anti cop pledge\n\nThat\nLast segment I must of lost track of the clock 'cause then went longer than I intended it so this one is not going to be very long and [noise] just long enough to give you a heads up on what's coming over half of America now gets more in a welfare than it\nPays in taxes stop and think of\nMessage brought you in the first five be met work [noise]\n[noise]\nSo many emails asking what are you really think Russia and get the sense that you're holding back to the [noise]\nHolding back calm um no my friends I'm not holding back I'm waiting\nTo hear what is said at the upcoming press conference of the media are eagerly anticipating\nAnd its upcoming they're seated at the department of justice waiting for whoever's going to conduct is\nTo\nExplain how they found the guy who the guy is if they've found anybody else working with the guy\n... co conspirators are they were complicit is is there somebody that\nHas been working on this guy for some period of time inspiring it motivating wrapping 'em up I mean there's so much that we don't know yet\nAnd we don't know what we're going to be told we don't know how credible what we're going to be told is\nDespite all of that there is enough information to glean simply by exposing yourself to that which is reported so far today\nAnd you add that to what you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here and do you think for example that the\nThe deep state not ... the Democratic party see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years on this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big\nThat is so outrageous what has been\nDone in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies in the Trump campaign lying to the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nStaffers and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways asked to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia Russia was involved but somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still\nOngoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\n\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began\nGeorge Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned it in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with smaller\nJust briefly to recall Papadopoulos was a young eager beaver\nSo called foreign policy advisor on the Trump campaign and you never met Trump he never gave him any advice\nBut he was hired early on because the media was hounding Trump or your advice or choose obviously does out these positions Papadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign a guy name stuff and help her\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joseph ... who planted in his mind the idea he George do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lot of Hillary's emails\nNo I Know that Stephanopoulos twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they tell him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London\nAnd the ambassador\nIs stepping up just you know I told the we we know that the Russians have a lot of Hillary emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told him well they planted in his head he didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true\nSo Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the best to ... to go get the ... orange what's all bogus that was not when the investigation started it started way before that\nMy point is how much the deep state wants their government back\nWe don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea these people have an entitlement to our government the strings the levers of power their positions in at the un I cannot relate to\nWe can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it if there's\nThey are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother but this whole two years ... who\nThey are hell bent that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out and the fastest way to making sure\nThat nobody ever finds out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get to the Senate and the White House back and then everything's cool the cover up we'll continue nobody will ever know what really happened\nThese people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared that's another reason why Hillary had the wit and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to distract everybody and and be a cover up\nFor the real conspiracy and the real ... and the real collusion with out well if I Believe all of that to be true and I do", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "26"}
