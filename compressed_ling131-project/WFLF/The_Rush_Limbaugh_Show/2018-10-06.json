home improvement show\nHere's your house Charlie didn't Perry\nAnd welcome back was just talking about a water damage and Senate actually falls into your cat has already failed to see that they're getting customers who\nHave water damage like that they might damage two or three cabinets and and you know those camps who may Twenty years ago when you can't buy the replacement and so forth\nYeah it happens I'm quite often will have people that like Alex it sounds like they have a some water damage and uh you know some older cabinets and you know manufacturing techniques and a standards change and I'm ... years\nEven flooring can get involved because it was put in on top of the floor or his or that or you know I'm sure\nI'm Nancy said many times before that people come in\nThey want to replace two or three pieces of their their wood floor right you know from eight ten twelve years ago and it it's just not possible\nUm just to get a good match or a good color match or\nUm the thickness of the wood or the way that the edges or came for um you know there's all sorts of variables that go into that kind of stuff so the insurance companies for the most part uh to their credit because we've done a good job of\nKind of beating them up a little bit here this morning but to their credit for the most part what we've found is that homeowners are entitled to white kind in quality and if there's some base Kevin et cetera damaged and you can't match them exactly\nUm that they'll replace the upper cabinets as well but in order to replace the base cabinets the countertops apt to come out you know if you have laminate countertops in there we can probably get laminate countertops out and then back in a in one piece granite countertops or ... problematic\nTo remove and replaced so um you know each one's a little bit different and\nAnd then if you've replace the upper cabinet you could have ceiling concerns and that just just rolls on\nIts the domino effect that we always talk about you know there's the the molding set out to be replaced there's going to be some drywall damage and repair the backslash when that comes off that you know they they talk and a hot melt glued those in place so when you remove the ... that's gonna tear your dry wall and that has to be repaired and\nUm you know there's there's the domino effect with all of these things so\nUm you know you're entitled to like kind of quality and\nUm you know to the extent that we can if we're able to match that would be our goal if someone came in and they have something that's damaged if we can match it we'll match it if we can reality when does that happen it it'll happen if the cabinets would just put in\nSix months ago um and I know the cabinet manufacture 'em\nYou know most of the cabinets that we do nowadays are modular factory built cabinets back in the day\nOr in through the eighties and a little bit through the nineties but even back before that they were locally shop fabricated cabinets where you might have an eight foot run a cabinets that it's all one common\nA unit right but it might have different sizes of doors in different elevations or the cabinets and\nAnd such you we've all seen the sink cabinet that when you open the door it goes all the way back into the corner I'm so those were locally built a cabinets and almost no one does those anymore for residential applications so\nI'm so we can almost never match those um so when people come to us and they have laminate cabinets that that have some damage will upgrade them automatically because it's the nearest closest standard um that's currently manufactured was so will upgrade them to uh uh would\nA framed cabinet box that has the word or maybe a laminate door on it or that matches as close to the quality is what they had before\nYeah it's a big deal I mean even AS Nancy says you know yet tile you bought two years ago right you can't match it can become allied lawyer for that\nBecause of the size the size it ... a few years on this\nAnd people say oh I just just white tile right what color exactly um does does all kinds of different colors and shapes you\nCan get the same line tile on the same men effects or it was manufactured a week or part in the shade just totally different\nYeah so folks if you're getting new fluids whether it's worded tile you know a buy an extra bucks of it and put it in a place under a bed oil um where in because you're going to chip in child crack a tile or the the wood floors you know it's going to be a similar thing it gets damaged or a water damage\nYou have or do you want to change out your shower vowels or you have to take out some tiles in order to get to the to go out\nAnd I mentioned in that if you're putting in New ... new shower always put it in the shower valve and yeah it's very important you know and I'm ...

Fox News\nWe need the majority very little is coming from pensions\nAnd then of course Social Security is obviously been restricted with low cost of living adjustments the threat of a being cut Twenty one percent within technically the next\nRoughly Fifteen to Twenty years and the fact that most people went from a defined benefit pension paid by the employer to a ... defined contribution plan which is what I call the yo yo plan which stands for your on\nYour own right you eat what you kill what you put away is what you're going to get to draw from and that's what's causing a lot of people to not be able to retire or retire with the lifestyle that they had envisioned\nAnd it does is it doesn't have to be that way folks but the harsh reality is we're on our own for the majority of you listening and I know this by having a front row seat with baby boomers now for going on\nTo a quarter century right twenty three to twenty four years we're in and if I had a front row seat with boomers and I've learned the very real things that it prevent and boomers from having an optimal retirement and here here's what they are some of these are basic but we're going to get into the specifics number one\nEven forks had a great article that said the number one thing that's preventing people from having the retirement that they could have is number one having a plan\nThat one seems pretty common sense right having a plan I just talked to two clients this last week and by the way I'm not just a a best selling author or radio educator I'm someone with my wealth architecture team that takes on a certain number of clients each and every year all over the United states and I can tell you [laughter]\nThe reality is these particular clients have said you know what we've never had a full fledged plan some of them said we've never had a plan and many of them said in particular two of them this past week we've never taken the time to actually do a budget Chuck in your budget woke us up what I call a lifestyle\nIncome budget that is in other words not just the essentials but the wants to travel more to do more while you can to see your grand kids as they grow up and they said you know what we had no idea we had that much money going out of folks that's the that's the real first step\nThe second step is than implementing a plan\nThe third step in probably the most crucial the Forbes article went on to say was then managing the plan for further optimization so here's what I Want to encourage you the importance ... more so probably than ever before in my career I'm seeing is the investigation\nInto the optimization of an actual full fledged holistic comprehensive whatever you want to call a plan that incorporates tax strategies solutions to save tax folks because as much as an for these tax cuts somebody's gonna have to pay for them\nAnd ... that somebody or those that have worked hard and it saved even harder and typically it's because they've saved and accounts that the accounts until they start drawing money out have not been taxed yet\nWhich means deferred taxes equal increased taxes because the cost of living will increase of the distribution out of those accounts will have to increase to net the higher amounts\nNeeded to spend but add to the fact ... you know tax tax reform one point oh and now the passing through the house of tax reform to point out all of these cuts\nIs causing massive increases to our deficit now we're seeing some positive things come from that but some of them folks are false positives the corporations cutting their tax to buy back their own stock to keep the party rolling\nIt can only last so long until they run out of the ability to do the buybacks and artificially that's propped our market's up candidly for about the last three years if not for\nSo it's kind of prolong the party but folks the lights are gonna have to go out at some point in having a plan that not only addresses taxes but also addresses\nThe protection to the downside right a few clients this week said you know what I really like about hitting while solution as you guys find\nTax savings in wealth strategies that other people miss and folks it it's not just seeing what people are missing it's a ... where the advantages are in the timing of having the advantages and I gotta tell ya [noise]\nOutside of the the chance of Trump getting uh unfortunately uh impeached\nWhich could make a lot of these tax cuts a timing go away very quickly is the fact that they're going to expire unless this permanent tax cut gets put through but even if this permanent tax cut gets put through the reality is the tax magnitude for those that have worked the hardest and save the hardest is going to be even greater\nAnd let me make sure that you understand the the the ... the key if you don't remember anything else I share with you remember these two words shifting and timing and we'd like to say in our practice shift\nHappens but it happens as part of his strategy to a comprehensive plan other words one client I'll I'll share a couple of days with you that I thought were very impactful because the folks just didn't see it right so for example\nA client was very taken back recently because they were going to have to have a earnings provision penalty on their Social Security benefits that they never knew they were going to have meaning over Seventeen thousand forty dollars if before full retirement age you draw your Social Security\nEvery two dollars you're over Seventeen thousand forty dollars you basically have to give one dollar back\nThey had no idea if you've not drawn your Social Security for a full twelve months you can get a redo\nBut you've got to see what makes the most sense for you we had another client that learned\nHow eighty five percent of their Social Security would be taxed because of a choice of the type of pension payout that they would elect\nAs opposed to doing a lump sum roll over which would enable them strategically to avoid having eighty five percent of their Social Security tax now here's the big one right\n[noise] one particular client had no idea that in the new tax reform bill now the taxes are on sale maybe not permanently but at least temporarily which means take advantage of the sale while the sale last that there's a one hundred percent tax deduction\nThat can be used between now in the end of twenty twenty to that one client we met with this week we were able to move two hundred and eighty thousand dollars out of his remaining IRA and the net result is paying zero tax for those that qualify under the special provisions of the code\nAnd finally [laughter]\nWe had a client who was unaware right that the legislation now that's being passed is to prevent the stretch IRA meaning\nBefore when the second spouse passes the remainder of the IRA can be passed on to the next generation and then there's an inherited required minimum distribution over their inherited age lifetime\nWill now Congress although it's passed a hundred percent before in the Senate a few years ago its back on the chopping block and likely to be passed in a recent article that now any inherited irate money has to be fully closed out in under five years\nWhich means when people can afford the tax the least while they're making the most they are going to be forced to take a distribution that indirectly makes Uncle Sam the biggest beneficiary of your IRA\nFolks I'm going to be teaching this coming Tuesday an introduction of how to ... tax the deer growth of your money on tax the distribution and use of your money and untaxed the concern of leading attacks\nThe unfortunate penalty to your children and I'm going to be teaching it in a complementary educational Web and our this Tuesday and you can register well space is still available go to retirement protected dot com\nThat's retirement protected dot com and register now if you're married it couldn't be more important time even though one spouse predominant makes the financial choices for the family\nBut the choice of pensions the choice of when to draw Social Security the choice of what to do with your IRAs or rollers or for for one case\nCouldn't be more important than right now folks because again shifting and timing what you shift and what you time will make all the difference again that's retirement protected dot com retirement protected dot com or if you prefer you can call eight five five six six eight\nTo nine to eight that eight five five six six eight to nine to eight but you've got to hurry folks the space fills up even though it's complimentary the spaces fill up quickly 'cause we teach over all throughout different time zones of the U. S. and different people have a more preferred time while the spaces available folks you've worked hard for your money\nI mean without question you worked hard you've saved hard the concern is getting taxed even harder\nNow when we come back from this break I'm going to talk to you more about some solutions and introductions I'll be teaching this Tuesday but keep this in mind shift being in timing and the timing of this can be important more important because the tax sale could be coming to an end and the stock market's Bull Run is likely close behind\nHis retirement protected dot com retirement protected dot com\nShook when we realized was your plan gives us peace of mind [noise] because we have a guarantee she never lose money and just marketing Jim ...\nSo that means Security Council grow tax free and Lincoln acts as our money during what more can you if you want to\nCheck all over again well solution will get your retirement on track retirement pretended dot com that's retirement protected dot com [noise]\nFirst way to hire based on trust by the reading of hiring size of the reviews noted author former chief medical correspondent and slump ... user Dr Bob are not\nThe human body has billions of pain receptors block those receptors with the anesthetics founded salon ... plus and you'll have relief salon ... plus contains two anesthetics including the maximum strength lie to gain available that prescription they numb aggravated nerves for effect\nIs lasting relief for only try what I use salon pause ... plus\nIn the silver box with a blue wave [noise]\nBiking red state blue state we come from different places\nDown down and we come to different conclusions half empty or half full but no matter how different we are we're all connected and we can all make a difference and that's why United Way brings people expertise and resources together to improve the education income in the house of our community building blocks for a better life\nWhen we live United our efforts magnified by others add up to real change showed him succeed in school manly game financial stability health of our neighbors improves him suddenly so darn community real change won't happen\nWithout you know so let's look beyond our differences in one by one let's make a difference to reach out of hand to one and influence the condition of a [noise]\nGive advocate volunteer live United sign up today and leave the United auto workers brought to you by United Way and the ad council\nWhich the stock market near all time highs you may not be worried about another crash but you probably should be market crashes could have a devastating\nImpact on you and your family but with the right education you can learn to protect yourself over the past two decades online training academy is help people around the world to generate income whether the market goes down or sideways [noise]\nWhatever your financial goals online training academy definitely has a solution call right now to sign up for a free half day class near you you'll also get our free Wall Street insider care which includes educational investing videos access\nTo our award winning articles and lessons from our instructors learned financial skills designed to empower you still\nLive the life you want to live register now from your cell called parents who fifties say the key word training academy said found two five zero keyword trading academy you'll have the option to receive a one time auto dial text message from the trading academy pounds do fifty keyword trading academy\nSay folks if you own land you're going to want to listen to this my good friends that ... may have\nThe best Mahindra tractor deal I've ever seen for a limited time get them a hindrance ... twenty S.

hidden well [noise]\nProtect yourself from taxes inflation and market lawsuits and now\nJust shut down for welcome to hidden wealth radio where we helped baby boomers\nAnd business owners secure a safe retirement safe\nBy insulating they're serious retirement savings from unnecessary market lost his as well as unnecessary taxation\nBack when clients said you know what I Love about the hidden well solution is you do help people discovered uncover retirement opportunities and wealth strategies that others mess hey baby boomers are in particular I'm Talking to those of you listening between the ages of sixty and Seventy five\nAnd particularly to those that have saved at least two hundred fifty thousand or more towards retirement I Want to share with you a story and in particular about friends and colleagues just like yourself all within that age group\nThat are sharing what they are real concerns are in properly positioning themselves for their most optimal retirement opportunities and what boomers are sharing in that age group in with that asset range of two hundred fifty thousand to typically\nTwo three four five million dollars or more but at least a quarter million is that they're worried about the economy\nAnd they're very concerned about losing money to the federal government the form of unnecessary taxes and I want to talk to you about a really just in its simplest form a couple a Cindy and Jerry uh they're in their sixties\nAnd uh we help Cindy retire\n[noise] ah we actually met her shortly after retirement who helped her position her retirement and then we're helping Jerry get retired so if you're somebody listening that is getting one or both spouses to retirement or you're trying to get better\nThrough retirement I don't think the timing of this message could be any more valuable and I want to I like to teach so I'm not just a best selling author in a national radio educator I'm somebody that takes on a certain number of clients each and every year and a half now for almost a quarter century which is hard to believe\nThat we've helped insulate their serious retirement savings so they sleep better worry less and have more to do what they want when they want how they want by just having a plan but a complete plan that addresses taxes market risk inflation\nAnd obviously economic uncertainty\nWell folks I don't think the the economy could be more on certain than it is now but I've been saying that now for gosh the last ... you know ten plus years and it just seems to become more and more unstable but when I Want to talk to you about with with this particular client\nA Cindy and Jerry is this tends to be what we see a lot of and that's people saying you know what we've never had a complete plan we've never had somebody address how we can not just make the most but keep the most and for those that are business owners listening you know that's the name of the game is not what you make it's what you keep\nStrategically obviously there's a lot that goes behind that but here was that here's the reality\nRight that the two greatest risks and slashed concerns that boomers are sharing ironically are predictable right the markets obviously going to to have a loss we don't know it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when and we know taxes are going to continue to be a big threat\nAnd it's very obvious why that's the case which we'll talk about then let's start with taxes as I get into this case study of of a in this particular case us in the end Jared one\nIs in the past months roughly the longest running bull market in history which is now standing at about nine and a half years well here's the reality folks know bull markets ever made it to its tenth birthday and we're already over nine and a half years into this one\nThe second longest Bull Run a now was the dot com right which was fueled back in the nineties which caused investors to lose eighty percent\nOut while there's no guarantees at a bull market will crash before its tenth birthday right we do know that historically the longest running bull markets go out not\nLike in a in a in a small fashion they go out in a with a big bang right it's like a drop\nIn it's a pretty significant drop especially for those that were heavily into tech stocks back in the tech boom and bust that lost literally about eighty percent of their their assets\nAnd experts who study behavioral finance which I thought this was interesting note again and again we humans have an enormous capacity for for getting the lessons and pain of past crashes right and the reality is this folks and we've seen this and I've seen this with my wealth architecture team now\nMore than I've ever seen it is that people are woefully unprepared for this next crash in fact they've positioned themselves to be in a worst position\nFor another two thousand and eight to hit then the amount that they lost than in other words how little they they didn't realize too we ran a stress test of their retirement road there on of how actually exposed more so they are this time than they were the last time\nFolks the timing couldn't be more important and it couldn't be a better time than right now here's why the two greatest concerns that those between sixty and Seventy five a shared with me [noise]\nEspecially over the last nine months has been in the area of the concerns of the economy right the uncertainty of when this Bull Run is going to come to a screeching halt many people are predicting a loss worse than two thousand and eight\nThat's coming from people like Warren Buffett and some of the top economists in the country on top of that\nThe other big concern is unknowingly or unnecessarily giving up unnecessary taxes to the government\nNever seen anybody that loves to pay taxes right in fact I share with people this is not about being unconstitutional this is not about being not being patriotic folks ... former judges have even said it's not our economic duty to pay more than our fair share of taxes in fact\nI I Want to share with you an actual quote\nA with that actually in mind which I thought was very interested in this comes\nAnd I talked about judge hand back in Nineteen thirty five is dated anyone may arranged his affairs so that is taxes she'll be as low as possible [noise]\nBooks that's what we do [noise] uh for a fact that's what you do that he is not bound to choose the pattern of which best pays the treasury folks that is what we see unfortunately we see that every day\nThere's not even a patriotic duty to increase one's taxes over and over again the courts have said that there's nothing sinister in so arranging affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible that's what we teach people\nEveryone does it rich and poor like an all do right for nobody knows any public duty to pay more than the law demands folks let me teach you something the law is going to demand view unnecessary tax I see it time and time again\nAnd the sad part is whether you call that tax a truce tax tax on your income tax on your growth tax on your Social Security tax on your Medicare tax on your kids the reality is taxes are everywhere\nAnd the good news is as predictable as those taxes are likely exposing you'd have to pay them there is ... ...\nUnpaid by not having to go to the direction of the government's perfect tax planning plant right don't become the perfect taxpayer [noise]\nAnd I teach people this because when you were able to show people the retirement road there on the truly exposure that if they continue on this course it's a crash course for a major market correction there's going to set them back and maybe even force them back out of retirement [noise]\nUh it's going to force them to pay such a high tax than in some people's case they're gonna have to work or take a part time job just to pay the tax to sustain or maintain the lifestyle then come they're looking for and folks just isn't fear mongering this is what almost a quarter century of having a front row seat with baby boomers\nI I've learned by having that front row seat of the very real challenges the boomers have and will continue to have if they don't get a complete plan\nAnd part of that plant starts with what's predictable well it's predictable folks that if we're nine and a half years in to the longest Bull Run in history and no bull run has ever last ten years\nRight and you've got some of the biggest and brightest out there like a Warren Buffett saying the market will lose it will lose fifty percent plus and it will lose soon and you've got J. P. Morgan predicting when the financial crisis is going to hit\nAnd you've got the ... congressional budget office predicting how high federal tax rates are going to have to go which by the way is north of sixty three percent\nAnd we've got our own Social Security administration telling us that Social Security benefits are going to be cut by twenty twenty nine to the tune of about twenty nine percent\nAnd that's down from twenty thirty for folks and you've got Medicare saying that premiums are gonna have to continue to go up up up but you've got a government that continues to spend spend spend right I Love the tax cuts the folks somebody's gonna have to pay for them and get to\nThose of you that have saved money in tax deferred accounts you're the biggest tax target of the federal government and the reality is some people are the last to know it\nWill folks here's the opportunity\nTo see we we helped Cindy and Jerry this week\nAnd you know they had a couple of the objectives right one was to not outlived their money or to was to learn the key tax savings strategies that saved them the most tax because they to understand is not necessarily always about what you make it's what you keep and they didn't want to become a financial burden to their family because they each have taken\nA elderly parents one already through in one currently through\nAll farmers and dementia\nAnd folks if any of you listening I've ever had to do that it's a it's mentally exhausting and its financially devastating and the fact is our own health care is projected costs similar to the tune of about two hundred and eighty thousand or from age sixty five on many people are are woefully unprepared\nBut here's the good news by sitting in understanding exactly the retirement road Cindy and Jerry we're on we're able to demonstrate for them what\nRoad look like if it played out as it were\nBut we're also able to show them where the proper detours right or the bypasses that could be implemented that avoided unnecessary tax avoided unnecessary market loss exposure risk avoided losing purchasing power to inflation I'll talk to you about a couple of those number one\nA Cindy had a couple of different pensions that she could elect from her employer but they didn't neither of them had a cost of living adjust\nWell for those of you listening if you've got to make a pension decision\nPlease make sure it's fully audited\nBecause in this particular case or not only was she able to get a better rate of return on her own\nBut also able to make sure that the income lasted for both her in her spouses' lives on top of that with the ability that the pension didn't die when the second spouse died it continued on to their two daughters\nAnd not to mention the fact that when you do take the pension into your own hands right you also have the ability to on tax it\nWell that was a huge hit and wealth transformation for this client because we're able to show them how not only that but how on tax all of these to lump sum pensions to the tune of about four hundred thousand dollars that not only will they not pay tax on their children and their children's children will not pay tax on that money\n[noise] after the fact that had they continue down the retirement road there on their exposure was constantly having eighty five percent of their Social Security being taxed basically by where their assets were position so shifting and timing so by shifting assets in timing the shifting of those assets in particular with the timing of this\nTax reform bill that's going to expire this tax sales going to be over by the end of twenty twenty five\nAnd teaching them one that they qualified for that's only good through twenty twenty two we're old actually untaxed them to the point where they will not face it required minimum distribution when they turned Seventy half because we got the IRS out of their IRAs completely\nTherefore none of their Social Security will be tax which also they were setting themselves up to have a higher Medicare part B premium penalty\nAnd if you looked at what the tax was going to steal from them and what the Medicare stealth hidden tax of higher premium penalties was going to cost them that was going to be about Nineteen thousand a year\nThat they were woefully unprepared realizing that they were going to have to pay and very grateful for realizing now that they will not have to pay it folks\nHere's the opportunity I might be teaching one of several of our crediting or one of our a couple of strategies one I'm going to teach you how to have crediting of indexing where you get credit on your money's growth when the market's up never exposure when the markets down\nBut also to teach you how that's designed as the ultra wealthy design that completely tax free so the money grows without you being taxed and you can access the money without being tax and you can leave the money to your children are your grandchildren without

with\nWhat's your opinion of buying a vacation home with cash and the renting it out when you're not there [noise]\nNothing wrong with it at all with cash\nAnd your debt free everything about that when your homes paid for everything else is paid for a vacation home is a wonderful extra as you start buildings from World but basically what is it it's a very large toy\nVery expensive toy that goes up in value hopefully and if you rent it it might make some money [noise]\nMy family not me my family the rest of them most of the rest of them including the grandkids just spent a week down at um\nWas Rosemary beach Rosemary beach the other day and I rented a\nHouse on the beach really nice big expensive multi million dollar house for the week and obviously some people on that and rent it out by the week\nI'm here's the thing about resort rentals vacation home rentals um you're going to make some money on it but you're not gonna ... you're going to make usually enough to\nAfter you pay all the fees for the maid service and the you know resort rentals aren't like a traditional rental where you know for ten percent or something you can get the property management usually take half of it to manage it and that covers you know made service and that kinda stuff and then there's a whole bunch of the time it's not rented\nAnd so while you do get a great rate per week during a hot season where the ski house or your house and the mountains for ... for snow skiing or a beach house or something along those lines is you're you're not going to get rich on rent it out\nYou really not I mean it's not gonna it's not really a great investment property it's more of a way to offset some of your annual costs of your toy\n\nYou look at it that way you won't be disappointed but if you actually run the numbers out you're not going to be thrilled with it as an invest\nIt's my you're better off to just buy investment property it'll make you more money for the ... per dollar invest it and it's not as volatile and you don't come in and you know rent or something you know vacation runners haven't torn up your stuff or to build one on your carpet or whatever\nAnd I know that there is a deposit and I know this stuff gets fixed but I also know people are living in their sleeping in your bed\nAnd you just have to think about that you know and\nYou know it's just is the way it is an even a nice home and even nice people like the Ramsey staying in your home we weren't we didn't tear up stuff or not but he wasn't a frat party in there and it was you know babies and\n... and that kind of stuff in there so we want anything like that but you know stuff I don't think we broke anything but stuff gets broken and you just got to know that and for for some people\nDon't we put it this way for Sharron Ramsey to walk into the place where she wants to go on her second homeless or vacation and someone else to have been in there and some of the stuff is out of place or broken or dirty it would kind of take a lot of the joy out of it for vacating there for her\nAnd so you have to think about that that's a price you pay to rent it out\nAnd all of that to say it's not an ideal investment property it's more like a way to cover some of the costs of your way if you want to rent it out we've got a uh like house we don't rented out we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out and um so it has to be a our income\nAnd our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that door weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth and so there are toy interest a toy that happens to go up in value and both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in you know the the condo the other day we stopped and there are going to be on a condo over knocks when when the ball game over there and the he was out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more stuff more repairman you have\nTo know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich from then you'll be fine Jamie is whether Jamie is in Alexandria, Louisiana Hi Jamie How are you\nWell very well done sir you are way ahead of the curve congratulation thank you well what we teach folks is to follow a plan we call the baby steps we think it is the shortest raped shortest route to wealth okay\nAnd a baby step one is a thousand dollar saved too is dead free but the house you've obviously done those three as an emergency fund of\nThree to six months of expenses you've obviously done that\nFor five and six reduced simultaneously that's Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement as baby steps for five is kids college doesn't apply here six is pay off I'll surely so that brings us into our question now\nThe way I look at paying off your house with a non retirement non emergency fund money\nWhich is sounds like if I heard you right you got fifty five K. and miscellaneous investments that's non retirement and not your emergency fund is that right\nThat's correct and you ... eighty on your house did you say is that right yup okay and um [noise] the uh the way I look at that is if you owed\nThirty thousand bucks on your house would you go borrow fifty thousand to invested in stocks and bonds and my answer will quickly be no yeah and in\nEssence if you do a column of your assets and a column of your liabilities or what your own and what you owe that's called a balance sheet you probably heard that before and uh uh the balance sheet says that those things offset so it has the same mathematical effect\nAs if you had borrowed on your home to buy the stocks\nThat I may ... if we don't if we don't use that money to pay down on the house now I Would not to clean out your emergency fund I Would be willing to take it down a little bit to three to six months of expenses it you know twenty three thousand or twenty two thousand or whatever was might be a little sick\nI might pull that down to pin or something you'd be safe as a single guy making fifty with a ten thousand dollar emergency funds so I'd probably pull ten or twelve Thirteen out of that and I take the fifty five throw it at the house and you know that house paid off in a year what's the house worth\nOr if they were about a hundred and ...\n... ... ... only three years old with a probably four hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nIt'd be pretty nice\nYou know and then take and then you take that old payment you used to have and all of the freedom that you have mathematically now in your budget and you use that that fifty five will be back in twenty minutes\nYou'll be amazed how fast you can rebuild and how fast you can build investment portfolio when you don't have any payments at all and that's the reason for doing it plus here's what's kind of weird you've made really unbelievably wise decisions for twenty two years old I mean you you're just you're killing your head\nAnd I think you know what else will happen is did you do remember when you signed the mortgage\nDid you feel emotional weight or\n... I started off with I've actually already refinanced one\nWhich I mean when did the original deal the first time and you went from debt free young debt free with money in the bank to now I got a mortgage do you remember feeling the weight on the oh that\nYeah especially when it said Thirty years in front of it yeah\nThat's what I'm Talking about that because there's more going on here than simple math there's complicated math that entails risk\nAnd and even even relational and I'm spiritual things the borrower is slave to the lender that's the way you felt Thirty years I Can't stand as I got to get rid of this well the same thing will happen in reverse but on the positive side of hey when you don't have any\nYet no wait nothing on your shoulder it changes the way you play it changes the way you do you're investing it changes the you get so I got I got so enthusiastic do when I got free with my investing and with my generosity both\nThat both of them went into outrageous mode very quickly and so they will get that fifty five back so freaking fast\nThat it it'll it'll it'll come back faster than in the first time you've got a lot faster it's not gonna take you five years this time\nI'm much you've got more income now too so that's not fair but I mean mathematically relation Lee spiritually emotionally when you're free you just do better\nAnd you just make better choices and you're already making really good choices so all of that to say yes\nI Would cash out the investments that are non retirement yes I Would take that emergency fund down to about ten\nUh that doesn't quite get us there so you got a lenient out of your budget and cash flow out the rest of that thing and finish it up within\nYou know four or five months the debt free on this whatever it is six months whatever it takes and then when the house has done than you than you if you want to build up that emergency fund a little bit fine but then kick those investments in the bud get them going again and you will prosper you are on your way sir\nSo honored to talk to you very very well done Wayne is an Indianapolis Hi Wayne welcome to the Ramsey show\nThanks Dave I just want to first say God Bless you for all the work you do it's really made a difference in my life\nWell thank you ... help today\nWell my wife and I have been a leading the life of ... for about two years now and that we've pretty much become that for other than our student loans which we were working on and then we ended up getting a now I've got pregnant with her first child in April so say we took\nYour advice and stop putting everything toward their debt snowball and started a bank and all that good and that as of this month we we now have enough for her to take her three month maternity leave um pain free for us which is great\nAnd that but the problem as as Murphy has decided to strike a\nLast week we got a bill in the mail from our city here and they replaced and sidewalks here on our lots and or the bills for forty four hundred dollars and a\nA baby on the way here and another a few months we don't have that kind of money in our cash flow to pay that off and twelve months before they put a lean on our home so my question is what would you do it in that situation that we we ... our maternity leave fun and pay that off or what do we do when somebody do\nA better from the beginning of December\n... well the game plan that we usually outline for folks is push paws on your total money make over your debt snowball Kobe becomes pile up the cash when baby comes push play again and take all that cash and throw it at your bat\nCorrect as long as my mom will come home and everybody's cool but the cash is just to make sure everybody's school there is no issues and we're not it's not really for maternity leave unless you have to have it to eat with but I mean it's not um it it's so that we can use it so how much cash will be got piled up or will you help piled up by ...\nSeventy five hundred dollars this month and like I said she is knowing that she didn't want him to take the three months off the bond with the baby on such and we can't do it on just my income alone so um that's why we were smart about this and set that\nGold and make sure that you know so we got from now until December to continue to save right correct and what other debts do you have in your debt snowball how much I'm just about a hundred and fifty dollars a month as what we have from other than our car payment I mean do you have you have actual that balances you need to pay off\nTime no not on your car and much your your car alleys\nAnd often dollars no got well then the four thousand would be your your pay it all up out of this guy and bar is set aside enough for her to Texas for a month so\nYou got the cash you should\nTake guys this is James child's producer of the Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce we're now period on six hundred radio stations across the country to

differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying

last moment hey don't forget us can we be part of this to prompt said come on in a reporter just asked Trump what about just me and the terrorists jumps in hell no I mean the end of tariffs\nIf the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products into the United states we're going to slap tariffs not\n\nHow to drive by the Democrats said that slapping tariffs on Chinese goods\nWas going to provoke the tri comes it couldn't possibly be good at it might mean the end of what ever Rangel or making what the North Korea and\nIt might destroy existing good relations with

increase imports that means products from us this year amid rising tension with some of its biggest trading partners such as the United states bottom line\nTrump said he was going to do X Y and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started a B and C I think he's pretty much closing in on see\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs his economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits\nFor Amri ordinary American who makes this country work\nAnd it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one I thought it was necessary to do and it's now done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number than that with Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money\nAt the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs lost about twenty five percent of our order jobs even more than that\nThroughout the campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe even longer than maybe forty five minutes or you know and extended the\nStatement\nOnly recently started taking questions will tell you what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocated he wasn't just announcing that deal got done he was teaching why it was important including the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nA known to understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works\nAnd how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of American leadership believing well you know where the superpower in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then if it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason that we should have our back pockets\nPicket there's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy that doesn't mean that may cause we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not have did was on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important in how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other type people about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question that Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about any kind of run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement does it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened to why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching\nAs well as a noun Singh\nIs fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this caught that cut this reform that reform a lot of people didn't know what they were talking but I got scared to death\nAt lesson hasn't been learned by none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with\nUs [noise] [noise] it's kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking and\nBut both parties who who believe that it's up to us\nA ... or in the\nRespect of others it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump just turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world economy\nWhere the future of the world economy where the future of world freedom and liberty to the days of the America as the world's piggy bank are\nOver steel will also imposes new standards requiring at least Seventy five percent of every automobile to be made in North America in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets it's a privilege for them\nTo do business with us and I'm not talking about Mexico ... I'm Talking about everybody everybody it's a privilege for China\nTo do business with us it's a privilege for the European Union who is treated us very badly\nTo do business with U.S Japan every country is a privilege for them to come in and attack the piggy bank\nYeah it's a privilege to come down and I as I say if folks it's it's a new way of seeing ourselves and our country without the need to make excuses without the need to apologize\nMe really we really happened is you know you can see evidence and scientists on our own culture of the achieved any accomplished somehow feel when they do apologize\nFor it or to downplay it\nAs some sort of new definition of humility a rather than having used as a teachable moment if something inspiring\nIs this Trump points out we want every country making their country great we want every country putting their country first we want everybody doing it that way that's the whole point for everybody\nTo do better but not by piggy bank in the United states by doing it on their own these kinds of things are just they're ... they're far in the United nations types diplomatic types here's the final bite\nOr don't don't forget who told you this was not possible do not forget it was ...

said he just laying the Democrats out he was laying them out for the lying\nTrickster isn't skunks that they are he is linking the media to the Democrat Party\nWhich uh we do it all the time here but ah you don't really hear the president or make it that direct and Bobby as\nHe has just if Mr rated the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats Cory Spartacus Booker to Richard Blumenthal Dianne Feinstein at one of them with Feinstein if you'll recall\nToward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came\nSomebody raised the question of how when the world did Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it ... we're\nMade to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and she didn't want to come forward yet don't woman had written in the Washington\nPost she called the Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public so people\nWere trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her for a busy you most a nose ring or is it fair and so it's like ...\nAnd it\nBecame obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of low rider one would be Senator Feinstein end or her staff\nThe other would have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who had seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and as all the other possibilities were mentioned\nShe eventually asked for point of order the chairman Grassley and and said a German wrestling\nI I Need to react I Need to respond to this re just allegations that I or my staff had lead this letter or just for the record I just asked my staff I just ask my staff at any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[laughter] but what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her and she starts\nNow that we can't hear what she said 'cause it's off might but she's obviously asking them did anybody here to leak it she turns or did you did you look at she turns back to the camera\nWait a minute like Mr German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this\nAnd mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night by say oh is this how we're going to determine who leak something she gets so turned her staff and asked them and they deny it and that it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and as to undergo his seven FBI background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it and Dianne Feinstein guess will turn around and ask her staff hey did any of your link this\nLetter and they own nor nor was it was with us she turns back around so we we didn't do it unless you're German as though\nCase closed it wasn't us they had done it it was strategic just like what happened on friday was the ... strategic ladies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday\nOf a transcript\nOf a conference call that have occurred last week among and between Democrat activists who were planning exactly what happened on friday it's laid out in this thing now unfortunately I Can't reproduce this and put it at Rush Limbaugh dot com because I don't legally\nHabit but I've got it\nI'm not going to mention any names but the names of the Democratic front groups in organizations are here and the strategies that they use and it makes it\nCrystal clear that they were going to target Jeff Flake that he was seen as the most malleable and the easiest to intimidate the elevator\nIncident where it just happened\nThat to nearly in say an anti Kavanaugh pro democratic activists ended up there in flakes elevator with us CNN camera right there to catch what happened and they started shouting they started accusing and they started pointing\nFingers he got scared to death it was all part of the strategy to turn him\nAnd it was there was there was a three point strategies a flake strategy was number three if the other two had bombed out\nAnd they made it they pulled it off they did it\nJohn Fund has a piece today at National Review who was behind the flake set up\nAcorns tactics live on and the senators elevator confrontation with activists from George Soros backed group on friday morning two women raced past reporters and security officers and block the senators on the elevator and the capital\nThey cornered Jeff Flake who adjusted announced he was going to vote yes this is in the morning is before the hearing began it was on his way to the hearing\nHi Michele I'm often hear

thank you for taking my call you bet um I I've been curious about since about the ... the beginning of this year several times you mentioned that as an incident or an occurrence has yet to happen that will affect or seriously affected the term\nI was curious to hear if you think this Kavanaugh's nomination that's gone sour is that incident\nWell could be I mean the but the the point was uh I didn't have anything specific in mind it's just that\nWe get a poll in June or a poll on may or even July and it tells us what the\nPublic is thinking of doing and the November elections in my point was this is silly this poll doesn't mean anything there's anybody remember the pole in July of two thousand sixteen or in August that doesn't mean anything because it's not when the election is and I said the ... the events are going to shape the midterms haven't happened yet I said that in July\nAugust September ... and this is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind but there's going to be something beyond this\nOh dear this is going to get resolved one way or the other depending on how it's resolved yeah it's going to affect turnout it's going to affect votes if the Democrats lose this uh if Kavanaugh gets confirmed a then you know what a democratic voters going to do they get us going to\nThe really enraged didn't show up and vote are they going to be mad depressed and set home who knows but this thing is going to get rid of if this if this is not resolved before the election and it's a defeat anyway because all the Democrats want to hear is delayed delayed delay\nBut my only point was that those polls in the summer are largely irrelevant because there are things are going to happen much closer to the election nobody can predict that are going to have a great impact on it this is one of those things yes but I don't know if it's\nSomebody has to have much to say you should probably be met work\nSimply say there's another one of our great success stories fantastic

Orlando news radio Ninety three point one WFL a and I heard a radio station [noise]\n[noise]\nGetting ready for the big vote 'em Rogers stern Fox News ... hours away from what everyone expects to be the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to become the next justice on the Supreme Court boxes Jared helping his live on Capitol Hill with the latest\nOh my God [laughter] oh no Harry the polls are tightening my God you know what ... what does that tell you what what what what what's going on\nHere we are so many races that are within the margin of error\nMissouri Nevada Tennessee Florida the list goes on and on and on we have all of these close races which means we have a best estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls rough on what the Republican wave in the center now and if that not in the house\nRepublican away it in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump means an impeachment of the Democrats get the house I don't think so but if they do it ... it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake clones in there because they would never vote to what took an effect if the Republicans hold a senator even swelled the ranks\nSo the panicked host Jim shoot I couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red wave in the Senate\n\nHe says there was discussion of a blue wave big generic battled advantage for Democrats you'll notice that tightening their as we get closer to the election\nWill say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans\nYou know there's a lot of talk oh with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation map that in fact that might hurt Republicans but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening in the house races\nBut I'm going to leave your little ... observation about this but what did I tell ya he's generic ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping on this\nAnd back then you know nine months ago the\nDemocrats had a twelve point advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave ... and that's when all the talk of the Democrats winning ... Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of 'em and Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host of doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything me remind you\nOf a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I but I Know of one time\nHe gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're gonna have more fun we're going to watch a horse race he had videotape of a horse race that nobody at sea and it was not a big race they don't allow the players to make friends leave that sent away Andrews on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bats and that'll change starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer bats tell me it was going to win players go nuts making their choices\nTape resumes that much ... stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds\nHave the final turn ballot checked stops the tape but the horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of ones they've made\nPlayers do what they do that much ... resumes tape to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known as the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to win and yet look what you're doing you're making beds you bring guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter halftime third quarter\nFinish doing your job\nSame thing here polls in January\nIn front of ... election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything\nThey're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could've been answered none zilch zero not up [noise]\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot\nThey've had this in in in the in the can that's been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the calendar play out now all of a sudden house races\nAre tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about fine old her in and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we don't know anything\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know what did they get into the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night [noise] now one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation mess that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen high and the reason he saying this and everybody else because of my viral prediction of last week that if Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything\nThat production of mine went by blood drive by is loved it\nThey love it when the leader of the G O P reminds me starts ripping the Republicans when I start predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run the sound bites me predicting it all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite\nHe's just the exact opposite why all this attention on Kevin on what the Republican is actually going to help them how can that they live on just said they were gonna lose\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win you know there was a well like Kevin I'll go down that are really fire 'em up that will fire buddy you know the way you can get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the bandwagon the way you get people wanting to be on your team as when\nIncluding winning the capital nomination now let's go to further news is about

about hoping to force Kevin ought to drop out that's what they have\nJust like the mother investigation Mueller investigation was designed to depress Trump's approval numbers so the Trump would have to resign because of total loss of support in Washington by\nRepublicans have they can get his approval numbers down to the twenties because they succeeded make everybody think of Trump cheated with the Russians and Trump would lose all support as Nixon did in the Watergate era and have to resign that was the objective\nBecause there is no way they were going to impeach Trump to know where the mother investigation is going to lead the Trump being indicted they only hope they had was to drive public approval for Trump way down the twenties and be done with it [noise]\nWhat they're trying to
