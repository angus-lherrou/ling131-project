Saturday we're in Pittsburgh Sunday in Cleveland, Ohio make sure you join doesn't lend back dot com lashed door\nIt needs to be addressed every effort that Trump has made to fix this problem has been met with opposition everywhere and yet we have another caravan this time with people loaded with guns in bombs now that are heading across southern may go with their intention\nTo get to the United states and the drive by media giants just just being done ... upset Trump's base that the implication is that people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote\nIt's again a classic expression or illustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remains supportive of Donald Trump but back we'll get to get more details that I ... back to my little test so I read all of these people at the event last night\nIt's going to be a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations\nForty five I mean that is a huge number\nMany of them are committee chairmen not all but many other committee chairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being Trump's you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house into private sector success\nI spent forty five seats\nIncumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students viewed the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans would never run before\nNobody knows\nI mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are no not as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy\nI and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party that holds the White House in the first\nMint terms after a presidential election all ways Lewis's seats so forty five seats they have it\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resign and we're still in the house you can count a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now his reelect and this is what the left in the dry buys are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip and then you've got a contest of all races are in in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resign\nResigning members of Congress retiring maybe they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up\nAnd they are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump to know exactly what's at stake they're not gonna sit home they're not gonna twiddling their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking my job was done when they went and voted in two thousand six day and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today at a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on the forecast models [noise]\nUm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is red wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty eighth congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected to office\nAnd in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\nWhen Robert my great book great in the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative here a long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift in ...\nAll over now blaming me we're back first it was the Oklahoma City bombing and now me and others in conservative media being blamed for all of the rest of this today [noise]\nFreeze in common and sit and I saw\nOffer rotation here in the ER beat up or did you hear about the mass shooting in McDonald's on Saturday\nYou did when did you you know why because there wasn't one\nAnd you know why there wasn't one because there was a guy in there with a gun and stopped it you can make up a brave father armed with a pistol stop what could have been a mass shootings Saturday inside the McDonald's in Alabama when he took down a masked gunman who stormed in an open fire\nYou've not seen that send a drive by media anywhere they identified father was leaving the establishment with his sons when a masked man walked into the Birmingham fast food restaurant started shooting\nThe father returned fire in during the ensuing shootout the gunman a father and one of the man's teenage sons were struck\nGunman who was not identified later died of his injuries the other two injuries were not considered a life threatening Marcus, Washington one of the employees and Donald's\nTold WBRC TV in Alabama he was making ... quarter pound there's one of the bullet started flying Marcus, Washington said he ran into the freezer worry heard about Fifteen shots fired [noise] it was all brought to a screeching halt by customer\nWho legally was carrying a gun you didn't hear about this anywhere [noise]\nFox News has it on their website\nBut you didn't hear about it anywhere look let me get straight to the fourteenth amendment business here and the ending of birthright citizenship is just such a big deal a lot of people on the left will get to the audio of of me and others being blamed for all this and in due course I mean it's it's so old it's actually not news anymore and it's\nIt's it's really pathetic of these people on the left I got it all started with me being blamed the Oklahoma City bombing by Bill Clinton and it's just ratcheted up from there and it's all an attempt to suppress political speech the left doesn't want to hear\n[noise] [noise] and now even though the gunman at the synagogue on Saturday in Pittsburgh was\nA guy David Trump the dry buys are trying to claim that Trump and me and mark ... van and Breitbart radicalized him we are responsible for this guy shooting up the synagogue\nActually out there running with this and they're they're they they're saying in his though as though they believe it it's innocent tile it's juvenile it's irresponsible and pathetic and it's all they've got\nAnd they just they just keep at it even when trying to blame me for for Timothy McVeigh shooting up near a building in Oklahoma City\nI'm back then by the way I was alone I mean that was it that was during the Clinton Administration there was no Fox News ... websites conservative websites and blogs had not yet sprung the life\nAnd it was a job I'll admit it ... I was livid and of course as a lone voice at the time I was a little alarmed can they make this that\nAnd of course they weren't able to and even now a certain members of the drive by caution everybody to remind people Clinton try when Clinton was called on it by the way Clinton's hey we talk about [laughter]\nAs talking about that [laughter] Michigan Militia shortwave radio do the right the Michigan Militia short wave radio network that's what they said they were talking and it blew up on their faces and this continues to to\n[noise] but let's get the birthright citizenship this I think as a follow want it to Donald Trump following through on one of the primary commitments he made as a candidate\nWhich I think is responsible for his election and that is his promise to build a wall to get a handle on illegal immigration\nAnd to stop it because of its for ever changing consequences to this country\nBut primarily with Trump is a law and order issue as it is with all the rest of us it's simply a law and order issue we have laws defining legal and illegal immigration we have a political party that is pushing illegal immigration\nAnd actually both parties have to the extent of promoting programs that have amnesty involved for all of them are both parties have different reasons for supporting in the meantime the very definition of what America is and what our culture is is under assault\nAnd the politicians in Washington don't seem to care because they think they're always going to be insulated from whatever negative changes result\nAnd in some cases it's even worse than that the left wants\nThose changes the left wants this country over thrown from the days of its founding\nOut to the left America as a legitimate to chip morals it's in decent because we were a slave nation\nAnd we discriminated in the original white privilege was the founding fathers there were no founding mothers only founding fathers never went to a white privilege rich white guys they set up a country for themselves and their descendents so goes the arguments leaving everybody else out and it's time to overthrow they have and change it and it's a serious movement and it's\nIt's a ... you can trace the educational roots for this back to the Nineteen seventies Nineteen seventies as a [noise] an offshoot of the radicalism of the sixties is where\nAnd the U.S threatened the next wave of tariffs on China is talks between these two countries call through next mark\nWhile then Michael what should investors do given this high level of volatility right now\nAre the key for any investors to check to see if your portfolio is aligned with your own risk tolerance and investment plan being diversified really helps with daily volatility you can check with your Steve for financial advisor to review your portfolio and consider any appropriate adjustments\nThanks Michael your path to investment advice starts with the ... financial advisor find yours at ... dot com that's S C I F ing L. dot com steeple Nicholas in company incorporated member sci fi C.

I I have at times I marveled that this country is held together by the way it has for many years as if has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us altogether as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper the U.S constitution the honor system and the ... the respect for that document is what's held us together\nIn all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who wanted it literally rip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nElection results for whatever reason it make it up well it was stolen the Russians this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue to issue but we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising him haven't been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing\nIn common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that I'm In junior high intramural football and softball nobody won\nThat there were no out in a baseball just nope nope kid ever struck out the kidney hit until you hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\nOutcome based education two plus two is five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart in school or in a slow them down and we're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we've now gotten to this point where kids have been raised ...\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derived from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been\nTeaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In ... they're not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child light snowflake behavior on college campuses\nAnd we have a political party that's behind all of this\n\nRight now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results\nOf an election of\nThat is on going and now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not win\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened if not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\nWho Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise] uh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of ...\nThat the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I I think\nReasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are\nAnd it's\nA large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do and it's ... refusal to accept this not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't until they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good when they feel bad and something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

today because there's so much to discuss we'll start with Dave in Pittsburgh it's great that you waited ... hello\nHi rush hey I'm In Pittsburgh and something that really bothered me upset about the local news or a local leaders where they've seen the blaming off the people of Pittsburgh for the shooting that happened to synagogue\nThey were on the local leaders are saying that we must come together and stop the hey we must stop the violence we stopped\nAnd isn't that enter this was a great observation and you are making this is classic yeah one guy who's responsible for this he's mentally not write clearly off balance he does what he does\nAnd now all of you in Pittsburgh everybody we must come together we as do everybody living our lives cause this guy to lose it and go do what he did the\nRabbi of that synagogue is saying some of the most intelligent stuff anybody a particularly in the heated passionate moment but yet that you're you're exactly right at local media during the same\nLocal meat is doing the same some of the national about local leaders are doing and why should anybody the guy who did it a shot and they're not say anything about that guy [noise] we we need to change [noise] I'm like be waiting for what\nDo you think you need to do it David in order to prevent this from happening again what what do you Dave in Pittsburgh need to do to make sure that some other lunatic doesn't act like this\n[laughter] well I used to be an armed security office for many years ago\nNo no arms aren't cancer you need to renounce Trump you need to renounce your support for Trump that's what they're trying to get you to do don't do it that's what they're trying to get your day\n\n\n\nAnd\nBack to the phones we go this is Dan in Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThank you rush I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment for team because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are on in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\n... ... it it it's your we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it\nYet right 'cause what's causing this is causing a discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhat you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night they teach sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are closed up we're still restricted the plaques that essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game\nThen we're going to formally recognized former slaves of citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the ... were polished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house reporting number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should\nDo this and that's his point people have looked into this\nMay have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign\nAgents it was expressly\nWritten took in first citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean ... there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties\nPretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans they didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't have to they they settled in\nUh in in neighborhoods are Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians is that they do but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct and unique\nAmerican culture which is rooted in western civilization\nThat's what's different now there is no interest in that [noise] we don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're Balkan icing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nGood easily located down there and I have a great workforce motivated intelligent people even though they're lonely educated could certainly do that kind of work and help provide jobs and\n... what what what what what what what are you what what are we talking about here\nWe're talking about it we were talking about the same thing that we have in this country for\nA uh companies that would like to locate in inner cities are poor areas they get a tax break for doing that that was part of the Trump tax cut\nPretty smart idea I thought why not do that in Central America they wouldn't be maybe the United nations could finally do something useful and subsidized companies who want to locate there and hire people to do that kind of work\nWhat you're talking about the caravan you'd think that what you know when to stop illegal immigration\nI think you would have an effect on illegal immigration there are a lot of common sense things to do you know certainly the birthright citizenship thing going on with the help and the e verify but this is another thing that would certainly help providing jobs\nThat they would be doing in this country possibly anyway low tech type manufacturing that's being done now in China [laughter] that could certainly be done down there I haven't heard anybody talking about that that's what kind of that was kind of surprised that uh that nobody in the Trump Administration has been mentioned that\n'cause I don't think that's what this is about NAFTA was supposed to do that\nAnd it failed royally are these people in the camera man are not looking for jobs they're not looking for about ... maybe a few of them are but this whole thing as political\nThis is a political movement these people are being paid somehow I'm In somebody's paying for all of this to happen\nUm there are plenty of places to be the only place that can go to the United states that can stop and get asylum in Mexico or some of these other countries\nUh where I I agree with you that if the rest of the world was more like the United states everybody would be better off if the unequal distribution of capitalism could be dealt with and we had a far greater distribution of capitalism be fine and dandy but the camera man\nI don't make the solution to this is enterprise zones in El Salvador or Guatemala\nUm maybe long term a economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for ... and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another\nAnd\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming\nAnd it's ... and [noise] we're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here 'cause that's these people aren't capable being hired anywhere\nYet but I understand that if you wanna start political theory and economic theory it makes no sense in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a short term political movement here this caravan [noise]\nI don't know either joined sorrow so I think George Soros his name has become I'm kinda like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states\nThe purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done to it to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party\nWhich wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in Madison, Virginia great to have you with us You're next on the E R B network Hi\n[laughter] Hi yes

I thought I saw\nAbout ... Michigan Militia shortwave radio numbers what the excuse was so now that's become a me we have here is this a montage\nYep we got a bunch of CNN people and some National Review people\n\nUh radicalizing St ... saying that Trump is radicalizing domestic terrorists just like ISIS listen to this\nWhat are we learning about how the Pittsburgh suspect was radicalized\nThese men appear to have been radicalized these men appear to have been radicalized\nRadicalized people seeing what the president and a half a point I thought that thanks\nWeather is Sarah Huckabee or Donald Trump the half truth thing leads to people getting radicalized who is radicalizing people in America Donald Trump certainly affairs responsibility\nFor the bomber was radicalized into sort of this Trump super fan community has radicalized so many more people than I Am very proud\nJulia Ioffe off there she is with a I guess it ... pronounces you off his shoes GQ and I think she's a ... yes\nGQ writer Julia yeah the Trump is radicalized many more\nPeople than ISIS she said that while I was a guest on CNN and then she apologizes for claiming Trump was radicalized more people than ISIS\nShe apologized to Monday shortly after claiming a on the air but Trump has radicalized more people than ISIS Twitter blow up after she made the comments since it on and I used to be when Twitter blow up it\nWas all liberals it was all leftists you know Twitter is blowing up ad leftists all over the place now\n\nHere's the next one CNN Tonight with Don Lemon speaking with the former Republican National committee chairman Reince Priebus might shield\nAnd Washington Post columnist Max Boot about the links between Trump's comments on the actions of the bomber and the synagogue showed her\nIn Nineteen Ninety five when Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that their political speech isn't allowed any more because there was a direct connection between political speech and violent that's a very serious thing to do that\nJihad as terrorists lone wolf carries out an attack we always ask what radicalized and what inspired him to go to violent we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are as long as terrorists\nAnd you could not divorced the actions of the second to the ... from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nThat's max boats Max Boot used to be as conservative as anybody you know uh in the Washington establishment something you may think that's a very conservative but he's certainly wasn't this\nWe have to answer the same thing\nAbout these right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic terrorists you can't divorce the actions of the sick people from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\n\nSo what he's talking about is you have an a jihadi who walked into a mosque one day was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward any buddy walks into a mosque starts listening to your mom preaching comes out of their Osama bin Laden junior\n\nAnd he's saying that's exactly what's happening in the unit so somebody Donald Trump is is radicalizing people Donald Trump is encouraging this the moms are telling people what to do and how to do it they're being taught how to make bombs how to explode themselves with bombs they're being\nNobody on our side to this is where did kill us\n\nIt's the comparison alone and it comes from never Trump ers who are frustrated that they have been able\nTo diffuse Trump they'd been unable to dispatch Trump and it's always a\nOne way street we never heard about Bernie Sanders radicalizing the guy that shot up\nThe Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftist so Hillary Clinton right it's always just one way street there's always you know what it is rooted in folks it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms of this program\nDating back to Nineteen eighty eight was the you are a bunch of mind numbed robots and I ... valley and I am\nTelling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you where\nTo go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted in it's rooted in the presumption of superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in they never understood\nTo get angry oh look look look at look at how bad you are and then they tell everyone they know how bad this person ... and they make an entire narrative and what they believe I actually got hurt and he's an idiot they're not evil\nNow I'm not seeing it all that every and liberal person in like a parent these kinds of people exist on both sides but I think that a lack elevate people like that and I think the right type that shut them up\nAnd and that's really all you can do I mean you can't always control he's on your side\nBut you can control the you Alan age and I'm lying is perfectly fine if your cat fighting and actually the dog with\nBecause you just imagine what every person says oh what was clearly that was very well may use the word the gumption to want to be at the dog with someone on the right you did that for\nTrying to use the word be that's kind of watch what\nWait what word ... me [noise]\nOh gee I'm suffering here [noise]\n... one [noise]\n\nLet me explain what I meant I'm suffering here I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise]\nComprehends I had to put it together after they hung up the most recent\nCaller I lost her when she just how families will gas light\nA the weakest number of the family I've I've never seen that so I'm rolling it back and forth on my head\nBut then I finally heard when she was talking about I heard definition gas light a I got an ... her point was that the Democrats the media can get to define everything\nThey get to define that get to decide everything what they say is is what is in anybody isn't that then of course is abnormal or what happened and that that that has been my point it's just a different way of saying that it\nIrritates the hell out of me too I watch the media but my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act\nThe media hated it it was\nIn response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to make a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples but then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and they filed lawsuits trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media when come right along and act like that was entirely justified\nThat these bigots would refuse to bake a cake or take photos at a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when ... when when Indiana passes along Pence's the governor the media was out ranged and they began\nTo report on this as though the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this\nAttitude and all things that they do ... what they report in the way they report it what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big it's are and who the ah the racists are and once that happens your tag you're it and then they ran around and they started knocking on doors\nAsking businesses\nWould you bake a pizza when you when you make a piece of ... and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman a running a pizza shop\nFor her family no we wouldn't it would be against the sole days zeroed in on this Twenty one year old woman and they wanted to make her out\nTo be the typical Indiana bed yet\nAnd she was just answering their questions naive way and innocently she was just trying to be honest with them she bought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting of that went on Indiana was odd the people in it are odd weird racist beget sexist ...\nI Know exactly what the caller ... Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral\nSeats at federal state local level and there's a reason\nFor this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well and so gas if if if what the media did to the state\nOf Indiana is gas lighting as if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it\nAnd er and accept it and it's this arrogance and just the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's\nYou have a the synagogue shooting while the obvious the obvious explanation is that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody\nThinks this is crucial for me to the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't and what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition\nSpent numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media is right in their facilitating this or that I'm telling you it isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of one of the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut the\nElectoral results just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what [laughter]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday Sunday but apparently Chris what I gotta I gotta you know I'm On Fox News Sunday\nTwice a year during ratings month [noise] and Chris Wallace was always", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "30"}
