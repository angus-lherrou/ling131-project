and for those of you listening that you're concerned about your taxes\nFolks you should be um I'm going to talk to you about the biggest trap that prevents baby boomers from having the retirement outcome that they could have that ends up being different because of not having a proven tax savings strategy to save them\nThe most unnecessary tax folks I Want to share with you that what you do now\nHas to be in in in implemented before the end of Eighteen for you to save taxes for twenty eight team and why I think this is so important\nUh yeah I'm I'm somebody that writes books and has national radio show but I I work with a certain number of clients each and every year and a half now going on twenty three years in the financial arena\nThat I've seen firsthand the uninformed it I think a former federal judge and said it best he said you know in America there are two tax systems one for the informed and one for the uninformed both\nAre legal and I think this article kind of says it all so if you're somebody listening and you save money towards retirement let's say a couple of hundred thousand or more typically for those of you listening to save money in tax deferred accounts meaning the it hasn't been taxed yet 'til you take it out\nYou should have some concerns and and I'll tell you why because there are so many tax traps that the government's counting on you believe me they're counting on you in a big way and it's what I write about my books you become unnecessarily the perfect taxpayer\nYou see one of the articles out this week says why retirees tax rates may be higher than they expected says higher income retirees may see their tax brackets fall\nBut still face higher levels or Lebanese of tax because of tax on their Social Security or tax on their Medicare part B and the right through the form of higher premiums\nConsidering the additional taxes many will see a marginal tax rate that could jumped as high as forty percent\nThe folks think about it in in in at a time when the greatest tax cut is ever been passed and our country's history people are going to face higher taxes\nAnd it's like upset for years what the government give us the government take up the way and you've got to be informed right if you're going to save the most you've got to be informed the most talked about a few clients like yourselves friends and neighbors other boomers that have basically said well you know\nCharles Oliver I understand why you do what you do folks my story simple I I can tell you how to overpay tax I over pay tax for years\nBut being a well strategist and in writing and teaching and teaching tax attorneys in CPAs and really learning\nThe impact of how retirement ties into taxes it's amazing how many people were overpaying unnecessarily they're overpaying tax and it could all be prevented and I want to teach you how you can eliminate\nThe iris out of your IRAs getting government out of your tax return I'll I'll talk to you about clients that are legally zeroed out their tax liability\nI talked about how people actually untaxed their IRA money\nHow people can avoid having up to eighty five percent of their Social Security taxed\nBecause folks many people are being caught off guard and some of you listening I've had the opportunity to sit with and you've shared yourselves while truck I had no idea of this tax scam that the government and Social Security holds\nA we I would've never know and I had a client in this week that said gosh we've been with the same advisor for Twenty years and he's never mentioned is\nFolks reality as it\nGets tiring it into a comprehensive plan right it's not just what you make is we've all heard right it's what you keep\nIn in in learning in in teaching in seeing in having a real life experience\nWith what it means to be self employed and pay taxes on taxes and seeing a unfortunately people that are more in the accounting area of taxation not the tax savings area of taxation it's kind of a rigged game\nTo be quite candid and the reality is ... you've got to become and formed in order to benefit the most\nAnd you know even when we look at what was that a book out called the ... golden rules are retiring rich one of the main goals are one of the main rules I should say was the rich stay rich because they are savvy enough not to let Uncle Sam to too much of their money in other words\nRight they understand that being informed legally ethically morally to reduce your taxes is perfectly allowed\nConsiderably even right against the backdrop of a booming economy\nNow think about this before the federal the congressional budget office pass the tax cuts a few months before it passed they predicted the government would take in three point five three trillion in revenue\nThis past Monday the treasury reported that the revenue was actually only three point three three trillion a two hundred billion dollar shortage folks guess where they're going to get this shortage from\nI think you're probably guessing your cells and if you're guessing yourself you'd be right especially those of you listening that have worked hard and save hard in tax deferred accounts like four one K. is IRAs for three days et cetera\nFolks that doesn't need to be that way and the question becomes what have you done to have a tax savings solution plant right not everyone can say they have an accounting threats overview share with me well I had no idea about they said well tax saving solutions you guys are tax planners\nNot tax accountant such as a big difference between people that know what boxes to check in what dates that that there needs to be meeting deadlines\nOr you can do that on line folks\nAh but there's a difference of getting strategy especially like we do with our clients and have for years before in the fourth quarter\nIs vital to have reviews to know exactly what steps can be taken to strategize to legally reduce morally and ethically not just legally reduce your taxes for that actual tax here\nAnd folks the windows closed and very very quickly but the opportunities still there and I'll tell you where it becomes so important you know a ten thousand people retiring a day and is this article goes on to say which I think is rather alarming says why retirees tax rates may be higher than they expect\nRight is is high in higher income retirees and they see their tax brackets fall but still face higher levies of taxing the form of taxes on Social Security benefits and higher premiums for Medicare part B in the in fact it said\nConsidering those additional taxes right there marginal tax rates could jump to be as high as forty percent or more\nThey'll think about that in in a year that we have ... of the first year implemented of the greatest tax cut in our country's history\nMany retirees taxes are actually going up and folks I see it firsthand I've witnessed it I can talk to you about a few clients that that hit home that we just met with this past week right so for example\nUh I think of Marty and daddy okay and mommy and daddy had no idea about having up to eighty five percent of their Social Security being taxed\nRight but they also didn't realize that they could actually zero out their entire taxable income for two thousand and eight team with just one of our kid well tax saving solution strategies and they were able to do that I think Don and Steve um they had some highly appreciated assets that they sold this year\nAnd as a result of that was exposing them to a massive capital gain and some of you may be the same we rented a lot of clients have sold but now the real estate's come back they sold off\nOf the you know fully appreciate it out rental property or commercial building a or a business and the capital gain is pretty sizable\nAnd unfortunately that game then gets transferred onto their ten forty and then it's looked upon to determine then how much of that as as a taxable income is then going to subject taxing their Social Security\nHow much of the as an example of they're required minimum distribution\nThat for those of you listening that's when you hit Seventy and a half some of the view that are Seventy half knew exactly what I'm saying that the government then forces you to take a certain percentage it's a universal percentage formula\nOut of all the totaling of your I raise that you have one or more however many you have are going to take the total and then force you to take out a distribution if you don't take it it's a fifty percent penalty of what the distribution should've been\nAnd folks I just met with a client this last week whose requirement of distribution was almost Ninety thousand dollars because he waited and waited and waited he deferred deferred deferred and now the day of tax reckoning his hit him and as a result now in ... he at AT and his wife at eighty eight they're paying more taxes in retirement\nThan the amount of taxes there they pay to their highest wage earning years folks we see this time and time again but the good news as it doesn't have to be that way I also think of mark and Donna\n[noise] who legally untaxed their IRAs read so they they took money out of IRAs but they they that's a district distribution of of of tax exposure but they used another section of the code with a hidden well tax saving solution to them directly offset that tax with a tax deduction\nIn essence zeroing out the tax liability on their IRAs which means they will have those pesky required minimum distributions because there before the age of seven and a half which is the ultimate goal is not to have requirement distribution for those of you listening to have requirement of distributions let me talk to you about Mick\nMix somebody that had requirement of distributions and we actually eliminated\nHim ever having another required minimum distribution by using a proven tax savings solution this year in twenty team\nFolks are you ready for the taxes are going to pay in twenty four twenty team or are you ready to see how much unnecessary tax you can avoid for twenty team\nRight one of the most important steps that people can take is getting informed dry taxes are on sale folks but they're not going to be on sale for long\nBack Andrew shelling said don't wait to get ready for the twenty Nineteen tax season right avoid making huge tax mistakes ahead of the next year right or ahead of retirement even goes on to say to validate seniors are likely to pay unnecessary taxes in retirement if they fail to avoid making financial mistakes before they retire\nAccording to marketwatch to improve their future right client should not assume that they're going to move into a lower tax bracket and they should avoid ending up being forced to have a high or large required distribution because that sets off a triggering of other forms of taxation\nRight and when you have more money in your pocket and let's go into the government folks that money for you to use for your grandchildren for your travels to visit and do the things you can do while you're still allows you to do them\nAnd don't forget what judge hands said right because it's true and I've seen it I I'm somebody that you're listening to that for years overpaid unnecessary taxes and then got super serious\nAbout learning what the ultra wealthy do and what the tax savvy due to pay my legal least required amount share and unpatriotic folks I have no problem paying tax I just have a problem paying tax not required to pay and he said it best you said you know in America there to tax systems one for the informed one for the uninformed but both are legal\nFolks get informed here's the opportunity\n[noise] I'm going to give those of you that are very curious to say how much tax in my overpaying or how much unnecessary tax can I be avoiding and especially for those of you that are likely predicting your taxes are going to be higher\nIn turn Eighteen maybe you sold highly appreciated asset or maybe you you this was the first year you had your required minimum distribution maybe some of you this is the first year you elected your Social Security maybe that's some of it\nYou ... have not requested or locked in your application or choice excuse me of election of Social Security because you may find that you can prevent that Social Security from being taxed like one of our clients we were able to show them how to avoid having up to eighty five percent of their Social Security tax and you know what it had everything to do\nWith whether he they were going to elect the lump sum pension option from the employer or the pay out of the monthly payment\nFrom the employer you see if he elected the payout from the employer for the rest of his wife and his wife's Social Security eighty five percent of it would have been tax which would have given up anywhere from six to ten thousand a year of unnecessary taxes as the Social Security benefit continued to draw higher\nFolks simply email here's what we're doing um we're we're there's enough time but you have to act email help at taxes saved dot com that

I help\nMy wife and I we have zero debt but\nWe um we have that on our house and we plan on how in the house next spring mhm\nShould we pay on the house\nSo soon as soon as the weather breaks you put in the sun they are\nWell yeah like like for much\nProbably like may or June\nOkay right show like six months plus or minus aren't [noise] um\n[noise]\nIt doesn't matter much um the thing I Would do though is if you put the money into a savings account instead of ... around the house\nAnd you have to like write yourself a note that shows like ... yourself a letter that comes June first says if the house was not up for sale put this money on the house\nOkay so in other words if you waffle on this decision and the money gets spent on a bass boat it wasn't a good plan\n[noise]\nOkay 'cause that's what happens to loose change it tends to find its way towards an impulse purchase if we change our direction on the sale of the house and I want it thrown at the house\nIf um if you're going to keep the hatch but for six months it doesn't matter\nTo the other part of my question would be way at sixty nine dollars currently have how does say we don't know how much of that America is he from what you put towards the mortgage\nOn emergency fund she'll be three to six months of expenses I doubt that your expenses are that high ... you know OK show what would it take if you lost both your jobs or what would it take for you all to pay your bills for a month\nFor a long mhm um eat keep aligned get on it though it keep the lights on that kinda stuff I'd say three to four thousand ... show\nThe three to six times times four thousand six times four thousand twenty four thousand so twenty five thousand and the sixty nine is the most used do\nOkay which leaves you about forty clear okay forty forty five clear um and to throw at the house and what's the balance on the mortgage\nTwo hundred and eight thousand okay yeah so hold that and and I had to separate those two accounts by the way I'd have a twenty five thousand dollar count in a money market and not have a forty five thousand dollar account in the future house paid off house fund or paid off ... bond\nOkay if you don't put a sign in the yard by the first of June take that money on that account and put it on the house\nOkay if you awful and\nChange directions in your decision which are allowed to do you're an adult

Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolfe now with the scene of a deadly mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh calling it an absolute tragedy Pittsburgh Police spokesman Chris Tucker Mary\nIn the forefront of his supporters minds so I've been studying the media to trying to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending\nAlmost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on ... not focusing on the care of him that tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrassed that they would be\nCovering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road but CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid germs at the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories on how the blue wave may not happen hip hip it never was going to happen I don't think anybody's ever know whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was a media narrative\nIt was a meeting\nNot born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election hasn't happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest is going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a\nA microcosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop and Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\n\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all Huffington puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't all white the network the infant didn't want it but last so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this despite everything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\nAs elected\nStill there so you have a piece yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them at their not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump there's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't doubt is the right where would they would be my only disappointment particularly after Trump has said over and over again this caravan is not going to\nGet it if if if if some Republicans\nAre behind this than that it's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern border of the United states since ... Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start walking to the United states to thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this would be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this\nSo you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden undecided all of a sudden 'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom we don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams and what would the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell did it [noise] I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they got maps in San Francisco for the tourists come voided the piles of human the fate [noise]\n[noise]\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing altogether I just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how many miles a\nDay you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next day\nThat people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to thousands of miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those every unreal Linda that's over for three months\n[noise] and the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen\nVideo of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand [noise]\nAnd then of course ah ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan than we are just hearing about Fox News in the a P report that the second the\nCaravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras and has already crossed into Guatemala\nThey're hoping they catch up to the main group\nAs the massive my grand caravan Bush's during the southern us border a second group of about one thousand people from Honduras is rushing\nTo join the main group which reportedly and swelled its ranks with several people who've already been to Fort in the caravan which has around five thousand uh seven thousand members\nWas on a more again Monday morning departing the southern may cause city of ...

their\nRight mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this would want this who would want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\n\nWhat every bit motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake which takes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never did push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals but in the world is so damn hard to understand about this\nI think it's a classic illustration of how tough this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young [laughter]\nI haven't lived long enough to know what's best for being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefit from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a mass the bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and saint of the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped it but it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\n\nAnd so the Democratic party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot\nThey should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense take a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nIs the six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nArticle brothers thank you can say it was signing up to nine percent all van more is now over or [noise]\n[noise] yeah I'm going\nTo get to that CNN [noise] CNN\nPlaying an impartial soundbite and made to make it look like I was trying to make the case that can show deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I sending in fact the exact opposite so yeah yeah a lot of people worked up\nAbout that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it\nOr in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOutward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nOr is this ... saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion\nAnd thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like\nThis but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out of ... that normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman government says there but there's no law says he\nCan't this isn't about what is what is seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way for the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections [laughter] what if we can make that case what do you think the people will be demanding Trump do\nStand aside left to seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God I was trying to get in\n\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good listen I say this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized is the border that if they bomb\nRushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or tear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this himself\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump soon as a military down and they started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people are planned this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own he leads to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's uh\nIt's it's it's a dangerous situation but it is in a\nWhole lot of different ways will be back my friends that

exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the media\nThey've had Republicans who are elected properly intimidated they've been able to persuade you that various Republican stink not worth your

meant it they can do for\nWe've got a bad they got a a a a bad a connection here about the only time I read or sitting NPR is when they run pieces to translate what I've said a further audience and
