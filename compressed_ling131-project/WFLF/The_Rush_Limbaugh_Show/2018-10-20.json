treasury reported that revenues acts that were predicted to be three point five three trillion were only three point three three trillion which is a\nTwo hundred billion dollar shortfall\nAnd guess folks where they're going to collect that shortfall\nYeah they're going to click the shortfall from the people that have worked the hardest to save the hardest are going to get tax the hardest right and the tax\nThat the cost the boomers can avoid that's costing them the most or will cost them the most\nIs taxation and the irony is the area that's causing people to most gets the least amount of attention until tax day rolls around so I Want to give a battle cry a shot across the bow of the importance\nOf thinking about taxes before the end of that President tax year right so what you can do to save tax has to be done and twenty teen if you want to save taxing twenty eight team\nAnd here's the reality that tax sale that's on with this new tax reform bill is only going to run through twenty twenty five\nSo to take advantage of each and every year Eighteen being the first year to take advantage of this this tax sale is vital you see a couple of people have learned that over the next years they can completely untaxed their race which means they won't have any require minimum distribution\nWhich means they won't leave a tax burden to their kids but they also leave a tax burden to themselves while they're living because they won't subject\nHaving eighty five percent of their Social Security tax or that the require distribution other IRAs is so large that forces there Medicare part B indeed premiums to be increased by three four hundred dollars per month each\nFolks we see it all the time I I see people that are paying more tax in their eighties than the tax they paid and their highest wage earning years right leading up to the year that they retired when they would have been their highest wage earning here\nTheir taxes are higher Twenty years later folks that doesn't need to be that way the question is are you ready for your twenty teens tax\nAnd do you have a plan that better than the government's tax plan for you right I think of a Marty and Debbie right they use one of our hidden well tax savings strategies that actually enabled them to zero income tax out for twenty team and it's already done\nOr done and Steve sold a highly appreciated asset that was exposing them to a massive capital gains cost\nIn legally eliminated the capital gains\nI think of mark and Donna right that ... they legally untaxed their IRAs in other words the governor the iris is out of their IRAs\nThere isn't any concern about their you know distribution of their IRAs pushing them into a higher tax bracket or forcing eighty five percent of their Social Security to now be subject to tax [noise]\nAnd I think about Mick a mic is older\nAnd it was already retired but his requirement of distribution was just annihilate in his taxes was pushing him into a higher tax bracket and we completely got rid of his required minimum distribution so whether those of you listening or trying to get to retirement\nAnd it's all about how you can reduce your your earned taxable income or you're somebody that's already in retirement and you're drawing money out of your hard earned savings of these tax deferred accounts\nOr some of even listening that have hit the milestone age of Seventeen and a half or the government then forces you to take these distributions the good news is folks you can save tax but you've got to act and here's the opportunity\nFor those of you listening that saved and and have concerns have your taxes this year saved a couple of hundred thousand or more wonder ... maybe your business owner or you're a baby boomer or maybe you're just

joining us all of our radio shows are archived at hidden wealth radio dot com\n[noise] what we've been talking about taxes and here's why that's so important the window distill saved tax is still open but folks it's closing very very quickly because what you do in twenty Eighteen has to be implemented in twenty team\nFor you to save tax in twenty teens and the reality is this the tax sale that we have with this new tax reform bill as great as it is is causing a lot of problems in his ultimately causing people more tax which I'll teach you\nBut the tax sales only good through twenty twenty five\nAnd then it goes away\nSo the time to act as now right like any sale you want to take advantage of sale before the sale expires well every year leading up through the end of twenty twenty five is the opportunity to reduce your taxes the most because what you do this year didn't have a dramatic impact\nOf how much less tax you pay for this year and next year forward fact we've been talking about\nAn article that was out that this rather alarming and I see this again I I Am not just the best selling author or national radio educator I'm somebody that works with clients individually baby boomers and business owners and have now for over Twenty years\nAnd the number one trap for those that have worked the hardest to save the hardest and ultimately and accounts that haven't been taxed yet like for one case in IRAs right those we listening to save save two three four five hundred thousand or more in retirement accounts\nYou become what I call them my books is that found through my experience the perfect tax payer because unfortunately the government has a better tax plan for you then you have for them [noise]\nAnd I think a former federal judge by the name of learned hand said best you said you know in America there to tax systems one for the informed and one for the uninformed both are legal\nFolks now's the time right or the sale goes without saying but what you ... the ideas what you get done this year is what has to be implemented this year in order for you to save the tax for this year forward\nAnd you can eliminate the government from your taxes or reduce the amount that they take from you and the reality is this right the the [laughter]\nThere was an article out this week that it said the tax cut isn't paying for itself now think about that\nBecause the Treasury Department just released figures this past week showing that the federal budget deficit widened by Seventeen percent\nOr to over seven hundred and eighty billion dollars\nWhich is an unusual jump the article goes on to say out of New York times in in ... in a year in which the unemployment hit a five decades low in the economy experienced significant economic expansion right but the increase demonstrates that the tax cuts signed into law last year have reduced federal revenues\nConsiderably even right against the backdrop of a booming economy\nNow think about this before the federal the congressional budget office pass the tax cuts a few months before it passed they predicted the government would take in three point five three trillion in revenue\nThis past Monday the treasury reported that the revenue was actually only three point three three trillion a two hundred billion dollar shortage folks guess where they're going to get the shortage from\nI think you're probably guessing yourselves and if you're guessing yourself you'd be right especially those of you listening that have worked hard and save hard in tax deferred accounts like four one K. is IRAs for

your host and best selling author Chuck Oliver\nIs mission is helping you discovered and uncover your hidden well\nProtect yourself from taxes inflation and market lawsuits and now here's Chuck\nI'm Charles Oliver and welcome the given wealth radio for\nWe educate baby boomers on how to have a safe retirement to secure grow and protect their serious savings so they can thrive in retirement you say we find retirement opportunities and wealth ... areas that others miss\nIn essence helping people discovered uncovered there she hadn't wealth through our proven process the hidden wealth\nSolution and I want to share with you the two biggest boomer concerns that ended up becoming the two biggest boomer retirement success techniques\nIn fact it really comes down to the reality of this there are two types of taxpayers\nAnd there are two types of retirement accounts\nSo let's get into this boomers two biggest concerns and I'm going to start with number one is having especially in light of what just happened a stock market protection plan\nC ... my story is simple what am I talk to you how to get a complementary copy of my most recent book the baby boomer retirement breakthrough where I teach you my story see I was a I was somebody that got greedy as a buffet with say be greedy when others are fearful but cheerful and others are greedy and I I mix that equation up\nAnd ended up being a victim of the tech boom and bust the last time the tech bubble hit and unfortunately people lost on average eighty percent on the NASDAQ being heavily into tech mutual funds or stocks\nAnd what I learned from that experience all that many years ago was that I always had the proper financial foundation for our family in structures that really only the ultra wealthy had ever really heard about\nBecause I became a student of finding a superior alternative\nThan just following the crowd you see and that's the concern today because if we look at what's happening history is likely repeating itself especially being this far into this next bull or what some people are arguing to be the longest Bull Run in stock market\nHistory in fact uh the headlines say it All right the markets fear index just exploded upwards of stocks around the world plummeted that was Business Insider\nBecause volatility is returning to the stock market in a big way back yesterday's a drop in the Dow eight hundred and thirty one point was the fourth largest single day drop in the Dow Jones stock market history\nIn one of the things that that we track called the VIX or the ... volatility index see it's more than doubled in the past week and it's added another six percent as of just this most recent end of week\nAnd the fears of a major market correction came to the forefront and I hopefully as many of your sharing a I've shared it again not just a best selling author or radio educator or or wealth architect I'm somebody that personally takes on clients and have now for almost a quarter century\nAnd this has been a continual theme right people got hammered in two thousand one or two that got hammered again in two thousand eight in early two thousand nine and many people are shared look we we don't have time to recover so if you're somebody listening that saved at least\nYou know two hundred thousand or more towards retirement and typically I'm Talking to those of you that are baby boomers so that could range anywhere from ages\nYou know forty a five per se to Seventy five\nYou can protect yourself and it's not just\nTaking a a a simple way to you know get inferior results it's actually using a more secure way to get superior results which I'll teach you you see the volatility index reflects the expectations of the volatility of the S. and P. five hundred that the\nGold standard of what all of the wall street money managers aspire to get as close to in performance but long term none of them ever have\nThat is what we call investing and there was a distinct difference between investing in indexing and I'm not talking predominantly about in indexing type of an annuity some people confused that\nThese are techniques that the ultra wealthy of used for years that I was fortunate to learn almost Twenty years ago and have applied for my own family that has saved our bacon\nAnd the safe so many other clients that we felt now for over these period of years and the time is upon us folks are the key is not being too little too late because many people unfortunately will have time to recover\nSee or CNBC came out there's more pain to come for stocks according to analysts watching the charts right with the u._s. stock market in the midst of an October sell off some Wall Street ... chart watchers are worried the situation could only get worse\nCNBC also had this last week they're warning signs a big market sell off was coming and investors believe there's more to go a ... a warning\nFor boomers this was outta NASDAQ dot com what will happen to retirement savings and the next market crash and then sadly Fox News reported that both Amazon and Facebook just on this past Wednesday plummeted to the worst day in seven years I could go on and on folks but I think you get the picture\nHigh income earners all the way to Big Ten football coaches that were just discussed in the ah the media this last week about putting two million into a strategy that has upside with no downside\nSo you have a floor of protection and which is what we call indexing but you money only participates when the market goes up\nAt double digit potential returns but does not participate when the market goes down and folks this has been part of our family's financial foundation now for well over Twenty years because I'm somebody likely like many of you listening that knows what it feels like to lose money and in light of what's happened just this last week\nWhere many people took a three percent tumble just in one day this last mid week day the fourth largest single point drop in art stock market history just transpired this last week\nAnd as the headlines read which I again this isn't a fear tactic this is just educate people CNBC reporter this last week there's more pain to come for stocks according to analysts are watching the charts\nCNBC also said they're warning signs of a big market sell off was coming and investors believe there's more to go Amazon and it's a Facebook plummeted stocks a tech stocks recorded their worst day in seven years this past Wednesday and the folks the list goes on and on and on\nAnd it it's not good news because again what what's the reality here let's review the facts were nine and a half years into the longest Bull Run in stock market history\nRight no bull markets ever made it to its tenth birthday in the last time right that the second longest bull market being fueled by the dot com boom and then unfortunately the rally went bust in the nineties caused investors to lose nearly eighty percent folks I'm One of them\nI'm somebody that I'm going to teach you indexing versus investing that anger down our family ... financial foundation\nAnd praise the lord I we had that but at the same time I got greedy as Warren Buffett talks about I did the opposite I he says be greedy what others are fearful but be fearful when others are greedy\nAnd I took too much risk and it it prompted all those years ago\nAre experiencing the loss of some of our families money into studying what the flu and the ultra wealthy have done for years and this is an interesting statistic that many people that I've had the opportunity to educate I'm not just a best selling author or national radio educator I'm somebody that\nHas written several books a two time best selling author and it all came from ... things that I've learned from other people and then by applying these techniques and showing people how these techniques can work in conjunction with one another enables folks to discovered uncovered their various areas of hitting the wealth\nThat typically reside in the two biggest threats to boomers which end up being there are two biggest success techniques and that is a limit aiding stock market crashes\nAnd eliminating unnecessary taxes so getting rid of the crashes and taxes folks is not that difficult in other words having a stock market protection plan any unnecessary not to pay tax savings plan and it's all done through using the tax code right judge hands\nSeveral years ago said there's two types of of of of taxes are in this country taxpayers I should say that he says they are in this country the informed and the uninformed right however both are legal\nFocus is not deceptive tax evasion this is strategic tax avoidance it's teaching people how to grow money without tax access their money without tax and transfer it without tax\nA savings in itself but protecting yourself from this market volatility that I Believe his back right to lose eight hundred and thirty two points in one day this past week being the fourth largest single point drop in our stock markets history\nIs giving people the writing on the wall with many people predicting this happening well before now I myself have been teaching people how to get ... they're serious retirement savings anger down and secured\nTo not not just a lot lose but folks it's called lock in and reset so let me spending just a minute on this for you because this may be one of the biggest breakthroughs the boomers have shared\nThat I'll be teaching this coming Tuesday or more specifically that I Want you to be able to learn more about right people don't have as one clients that ... we don't have the time\nTo go through another major market meltdown we we do not have the time to recover\nAnd of course folks that's the big concern dry but many people are caught off guard by these unnecessary taxes [noise]\nLet me teach you just a couple of quick techniques then I'll be teaching more about an in depth and detail this coming Tuesday lock in reset it's a unique provision in the engineering of how to to to structure your savings\nThat you're going to build a structured cash flow of of secure retirement income from so that you don't run out of money before you run out of life\nAnd the strategy is very simple as the market goes up your money isn't in the daily ups and downs and all around the stock market right especially with all this volatility but ironically the volatility itself actually makes this strategy better\nNow I Know that sounds kind of odd or counterintuitive so how can volatility helped me Chuck let's let's think about this when when the market has again our clients lucky in that game never risk of giving that gained back\nWhich is not what anybody else has I can assure you [laughter] I I I personally sit with clients on a weekly basis and and I can't believe nor can they the exposure that they start to realize they have by some of our software analysis [noise] one just the other day would would lose fifty five percent of another oh wait market crashed hits [noise]\nAnd they can't afford that has no one could it but it's the same time when there's again it's locked in huge peace of mind sleeping better no worry right and when the market does lose there's the floor of protection\nSo if they lock in but here's the key though reset so if the S. and P. today let's say sell a thousand points\nAre clients don't lose they lock in any prior gains not at risk of giving them back and then they get the advantage of the index that they're tracking only games not losses to Theresa sad at the lowest point to start their next game right so in\nOther words if the S. and P. loses a thousand points the folks have to wait for that thousand points to be made back before they start any new game our clients start their new game from the lowest level forward folks that is huge that's a way to out Fox Wall Street and how we've been getting that done and helping clients secure they're serious returned\nMuch savings for over two decades\nNow here's the things I I Want to teach you this coming Tuesday so for those that have saved at least two hundred thousand or more are typically between the ages of forty five and Seventy five I don't care if you're getting to retirement or you're getting through retirement you can improve you can increase this isn't about playing it safe\nThis is about playing it strategically and this has outperformed the market this has outperformed the unnecessary taxes and it's helped people do a few things number one avoid having eighty five percent of their Social Security tax\nA number to avoiding having their retirement income tax\nA number three avoiding leaving a unnecessary inheritance tax to your kids or your grandkids and ultimately giving people the ability to live more and ironically leave more all without\nTax but also without the sleepless nights concerns of when the market did its thing right if you remember back when it did its thing an eight hundred point drop or an eight hundred point gain was the norm not the exception folks I think it's back\nAnd whether it's back or not can you honestly say you have a stock market protection plan and an unnecessary tax protection plan because you can\nUm here some of the things I Want to teach you tax free liquidity having access when and how you needed\nMarket volatility protection right the uh the removing the uncertainty of when the next crash or drop or correction takes place\nAnd ultimately with now running a seven hundred and eighty two billion dollar deficit through twenty Eighteen right folks the writings on the wall where taxes have to go so here's the opportunity for those that registering it in the first fifty I Want to give you my most recent book the baby boomer retirement break through the unfair advantage to a safe and secure retirement\nAnd what I Want to do is for those either ...

Chris I Know that fact but man it doesn't feel like it every year when I got to cut that right [laughter]\nYes I hear about that you know so here sue here's what Ronald Reagan and he's at a Ninety four percent tax bracket right so what he did and it was once you've made over two hundred thousand dollars you're taxed at Ninety four percent so he just didn't make a third movie\nBecause it'd be worth less you get six six thousand bucks\nSo taxes causes to miss out on some potentially great movies guys\nSo so the taxes and Ninety Ninety four percent of the question is can they go back there\nWell I think we've already heard that answer having way\nYeah I mean look debt if there's anything to make us go back to a higher tax bracket in the future in which we think they absolutely will get its debt\nYou know something's funny Chris is a well not really too funny actually is back then we didn't have Nineteen trillion in debt right and what did you say that top tax\nBracket was it was Ninety four and in fact in the seventies there was still in the sit in the sixties and eighties beginning of the eighties is is in the fifties so you can see if you've got mounting piles of debt the government is not a business right\nIs the only way it gets in Columbus how from us from taxes is kind of service this day where do you think they're going to get it they're going to get it from us\nSo that's one thing that blows my mind is taxes were higher when we last and I mean something's gotta give their\nRight so so taxes are going to go up we got a lot of debt water people to do and retirement tax we're going to go up in the future\nOkay let's say you're in a twenty five percent tax bracket right now ... hurts but what if that goes up to forty five now you're taking home forty five percent less money now you're taking a forty five percent loss\nEvery year in retirement\nThat is crippling sill instead is there a way can we turn the tables and get a forty five percent growth every year by simply not paying taxes well yeah if you don't pay the taxes\nAnd you're getting forty five percent more money in this case in your pocket and you're essentially getting so forty five percent more growth but can you can you not pay taxes\nAnd not go to jail if it's tax free income that's not qualified and you don't have to pay on that then yeah okay if it's set up correctly\nYeah does it set up correctly\nI got to do is read the whole tax code everybody you'll find it in there\nRight so who wants to do that though let me open up Pandora's box for a second now the ultra wealthy they don't pay any taxes in retirement using the rats strategy you know it was a very well known strategy in the ultra wealthy communities\nYou know Chris that bought ran through my

what we're trying to do that's what we do bring clarity and misinformation you know where some more misinformation is Chris where's that most people don't realize your Social Security is going to be taxed potentially\nA Yeah Yup just talk with somebody ah yesterday about that so\nWhenever you go to get it back out mhm they're actually potentially if you're on the rise thresholds on income they're going to tax you on it\nAnd it thresholds are low so most people the majority of people I Would say are are going to have their Social Security tax\nNot only are all your other tax deferred accounts tax as ordinary income but your Social Security can be tax too that it's just keep comment that just doesn't seem right to me right it but there is a solution if you have enough tax free income make a drop you below a threshold\nAnd boom your Social Security is not taxed anymore\nI said at one more time helped me understand what you're saying\nIf you had tax free sources of income and your retirement tax free source of income tax free right they're going to look at that and they're going to see you don't maybe hit the threshold to get your Social Security taxes also you can potentially drop your Social Security down for being attacks\nAre ... percent of five enough tax free income coming in it's going to therefore lower my tax bracket and reportable and come to the IRS and they're going to look and I said hey he's not here she's not meeting the threshold we're not going to tax or Social Security is that what you're saying\nBoom you can potentially dropped attacks on that and not only going to get tax free from another source which is nice right yeah tax free from there but you're so security's irony text now what would normal people do right now hey they don't have ... and most people don't right now Chris what what should I Do about that\nWell if you don't have ... one of the most powerful streams of income tax free unpaid taxes you need is you need to implement that right away\nHey we hear about the national debt all the time I hear it probably every single day was it actually mean for us it means tax is potentially going to have to go a bright bright absolutely right that's what that's that's what everybody's talking about we know that right so are all your account is going to be taxed when that goes up\nA lot act suffered yeah I mean a lot of people's their retirement accounts are going to be taxed most likely at a higher rate than they ever anticipated ... there's not thinking about it it's going to happen down the road\nSo a lot of people are what are called rolling the dice right the role and I said in the future on this tax deferred accounts when I go to use them in retirement uh-huh the taxes are going to be lower\nRight yeah 'cause I was thinking that I was the logic that's basically it but what can they do what can they do or you know what can they do about the Social Security being tax\nWhat can they do about taxes going up on them in the future and having to pay that actual higher tax burden kicking the can down the road rolling the dice that hey maybe hopefully taxes won't go up but we know they are what can what can the everyday American do\nWell you can not reinvent the wheel or you can do something that you're also well you've been doing for decades right you can use the same strategies that they've been doing apply them into your retirement craze some tax free and can we do it every single week here\nYeah let me see two thousand people here that we see about eight eight ten well shoot I see

you take concrete and you take a water\nAnd sand and you mix it together and you get a or I mean you take the men and you mix water and sand together and you get concrete so\nIt's two components put together to make one much stronger and that was the idea behind fiber eggs along with a few other things a longevity or being able to withstand the things we talked about earlier such as the water leaking into rotting fading all of these terrible things so that the the insulation value\nAll of these are protected and a vibrant allows or eliminates all of these processes from happening and it also\nIt sounds as though you can also put it into any shape that you need that gets custom orders and things like that all that's easily not\nAbsolutely by British can be custom fit it to just about any opening in your home\nSo when you do you order with renewable energies and you're not just getting something off the showroom floor\nNo you are not a what we do is we actually come out when they designed consultant we look at your opening\nA lot of folks in the industry think when they get ready to do windows there's really only one way to do it and that's what they have existing in their home so many options out there so many ways to save money\nFrankly a lot of ways even spend more money to pay how beautiful you want to make your house I'm really good at that most people want to most people at the end of the day want to accomplish to things they want a product that's going to last forever and they want a house that looks like a brand new house at the same or address\nOkay All right yeah I I don't know where I think I Would like improving the aesthetic of my house well\nOf the things that I've found in many folks that I talked to a in the window industry when I approached folks I asked him hey what is it\nYou're trying to achieve and when they talk about the aesthetics of the home and how it looks they go Dan I had some quotes I've talked to some folks that look I've seen these windows in the house I've seen these big white clunky thick\nBones looking glass windows I don't want that look and it really so our mission and on one of our goals uh ever knew why Anderson is we want the window and we designed the window to look like it actually came with a home mhm\nSo it doesn't seem like it's out of place exactly if you're curious and if you're thinking about and this is something you might want to do a little bit more about if you're in the same kind of mindset that I can get some information but also take advantage of a often it's going on right now to a if you are listening to the show or nearby Anderson you can\nBuy the first seven colors get twenty percent off windows doors and installation that's twenty percent off of everything so shut down the number\nEight eight eight for eight for nine for eight zero that has eight eight eight for eight for nine for eight zero eight eight eight or eight or nine for eight zero to get the information and hopefully\nGet in on that special offer as well um now I Am looking at replacing it all at once that\nThe doors and windows I'm Ken renewal banners and also do sliding glass doors I mean is there any\n... like is there anything that in your typical home is there anything that you came to\nMe the short answer is no\nWay to answer right um\nWe want you we don't want you you want to be really careful when you are changing opening sizes are sometimes you can begin to get into structural members of the home so we can and larger make openings smaller if it's the right situation okay\nBut to answer your question oh we can do just we can yes we can do just about anything you want with the custom or be a window\nOkay one for a new plan or some kind of want me to the process let's say I give you a comic Dan I think I'm ready I'm not exactly sure like what's the best way to get a quote to get your design team out walk me through the process All right\nSo the first step is you when to pick up the phone and you would call our national call center or our local call center within a working hours and you would set up a free and home designed consultant estimate\nRight so that individual would then come out to your home\nThey would take a look at your\nMeans your dreams or whatever you were trying to create a most importantly provide you a solution so we would go we would measure the windows we would go or some design options with you mhm\nUh and then we would uh we have a a\nDesign a software that we carry with us in the home so you can actually\nSee what the window looks like that you're having designed oh fantastic and so once we had a mystery that makes a little bit of time in the home so uh be prepared been this way you can get exactly what you want you know it's what you want because you can see what it looks like\nAnd once we knew that ah we simply price it up for you right there in the home so okay\nSo now waiting no waning that's nice and we can get an idea of\nWhat you can be getting into you often get excited about the process of you know possibly getting these new windows and new doors now let's say I you know I I Love the station I Love the smell of the way everything looks and I say okay and let's go by Anderson let's make this happen in my home what is the next that\nWell the next step is how we're going to pay for it right [laughter] can't call mom anymore right [laughter] well my daughter would kill me but she uh she still calls dad so uh yeah so the\nNext set with me we have many different ways to help fund the job or to modify on the on the job\nSo you can do financing through us you can pay cash or credit card any of that and it's all done on the spot instant financing we have great promotions are going on uh at this time ... and I'm\nSo is there is quite easy or you don't have to have any money down in um\nIn the process can keep going in the process can game going well tell me about the uh the teams tell me about your crew what what can we expect when it's time for renewal by Anderson to come into my home and actually put in these new windows\nAnd doors and sliding glass doors and everything else yes so the process a is\nReally smooth the we have a concierge service so what that means is once you place the order human\nContact him ... years ... years ... job is to hold your hand through\nEvery step of the process so once you place that order with us\nYou will then be contacted and they'll let you know the very next that\nAnd that next step would be a tech mission or any tech measure would come out and measuring Honda designed consultant because of that measure three time that's right [laughter] measuring Tom's cut launch right\nSo we do that and I'm a ... uh get me confirmed measure much the windows or order they come in your installers show up so we don't use quote just installers are folks are a Anderson certified master installers\nAnd what that means is we have a scope ... pie and guidelines that these windows have to be installed by okay I often tell people that windows there's two home improvement projects they're really scare me\nWhen I was in a roofing those too that if they're done incorrectly oh yeah they will rot your house to the ground\nGame yeah do we need to make sure that it's being done properly um obviously we have great building inspectors and codes in Florida that help us with that uh but believe it or not votes can still get a lotta corners and so we make sure we do it right\nSo what would happen say if you know real renewable energy and it is in the home that insulation process has begun and you're taking out the windows and you do find some things structurally wrong well\nWe hope that that doesn't happen we trying to spot it but you're you're exactly right it can happen in ... in this great state of Florida there's a lot of there's a lot of humidity and there's a lot of ways for water to get in these walls that we can't see\nI'm hoping that's where this concierge service comes and [laughter] and again and we'll have the answers for me\nTo show what would happen in that case um uh when we designed a window we priced out just the window\nIn the cosmetic area within a couple inches of the window but if we find out when we remove this window we've gotten mode infestation and all types of things going on in rotten all the things you\nJust pray that wouldn't be there yes um what we have to do then is we have to bring in all we have to uh refer you to a an al ... Khan tractor that would specialize in structural damage\nAnd get that are taking care of some on it or to some degree we can handle a just depends on how severe it is\nAnd you've got people that you trust and you're ready and then you can pick up that phone and asked\nThem early we wouldn't we wouldn't put anybody anybody is home we didn't trust\nThat's comforting yes um let's say to go smoothly no bombs at all which we all hope of course with renewable Anderson about how long are you looking for this to be happening in your home and let's say if you're doing\nTen windows the ten minutes wipe out I mean is that you know a week's worth of open holes in your house or is it something that hopefully a lot smoother than what\nA Gen if it was our first job and Bobby takes us about a much but a sense since we do ah you know two billion dollars a year we pretty fast or this but we are good too yeah ...\n... normally it would take a you can usually say about a day for every four windows and that's being conservative but we'd rather you know we'd rather a over promise a I mean a under promise rather than in over a promise\nZero Dan thank you so much for coming by explaining this all to me I feel so much better about this process now\nWell hey I was a pleasure to be here and uh I Can't wait to see your brand new home in the same All right thank you so much [noise]\nBaby boomers have shared their frustration about how much tax they pay [noise] let me reverse that for you and put the emphasis on saving taxes this is ... founder of the hidden well solution and I've been helping clients for over two decades to get their retirement on track and avoid the tax traps\nDaily I see clients paying taxes needlessly instead of maximizing their financial future learn how to save unnecessary tax in optimize your retirement visit retirement protected dot com retirement protected dot com [noise]\nI'm voting in the mid term elections because my ...

energy efficiency\nAnd now here's your host Ghana [noise]\nI'm not going to the New Hampshire thank you so much for spending part of your day here with as if you're anything like me the eye why home improvements I'm all for it I just need to know more about it before I started diving and I'm here with Patrick\nMore from University of roofs and contracting and one of the first memories I had when I moved to Florida in two thousand and four was flying in and seeing\nLou tarts everywhere\nAlmost every home and that's not a decorative thing\nIt's not a decorative bang and I had owned one home prior to that and it was new construction and never in my life that I ever thought\nAbout a roof over placing a root for when you need to replace a real for how do you know when it's time to replace a roof and to this day I still see are everywhere is it\nBecause of where we live or is it because that's just a homeowner thing\nWell I mean Florida's twilight zone right I mean we're like our own little country down here but I mean all seriousness yeah I mean it's actually not uncommon I mean we are over a year now from a Hurricane Irma which uh you know cause a lot of damage I still\nHave a lot of neighbors getting nervous repair and replace from that\nOh yeah yeah and so a lot of people have for whatever reason have been putting off of replacing the roof or maybe they don't even know that their roof is leaking or you know there's all these different things but uh yeah it is not uncommon\nEven still a year later or over a year later does is he a tarp on houses all over central Florida I mean they're everywhere I mean I live in winter park and I've got a couple of houses near me or the half tarps on them still you know\nAnd that's where the homes and realize that there is a problem for many there can be a slow leak there can be stuff going on and the rules that\nYou wouldn't know that there is a problem going on and I'm sure you see that a lot when you finally get into a home you're like you know this has been happening for a really long time so what are some of the initial finds\nThat your roof may need repairs and distress or needs complete replacing sure yeah that's a great it's a great\nQuestion because a lot of people saw the obvious signs right so there's a big wet spot over their kitchen or they noticed in the bathroom you know the drywall is starting to bubble up or or may have been as extreme as actually we've been in homes where there's holes in the ceiling because so much water was coming into the house which is\nYou know a terrible terrible place to be and so those are the ones where people were very quickly I Need to get somebody here I Need to find out what's going on and that's the people that we've been\nHelping predominantly over the last you know year or so since Hurricane Irma [laughter] ah but what we're still finding even now a year and a year or so later after Irma is people are now just noticing they have water spots right you know or they just now noticed the the ceiling is bubbling up um\nMaybe they just looked in a corner of the room in their house they just never look at and these are yellow\nOn the white drywall and um and so we're going into homes now and there's often what happens is there's a leak in your roofing system and it might be so small and so slow that for that water to penetrate through the roofing system and get to the actual visible places when your house can literally take this long\nShared a roof collapsed might right yeah it had to take a long time for you to figure out hey something's wrong here right\nYeah and so there's so many people that are dealing with this with their roofs that they're calling us going to have a leak\nIn really what to do and really what's been happening is it's been leaking for a year\nOr because they have shingles missing that they don't know about the torn shingles have shingles that have lifted um where the water is driving up under the shingles which it's not supposed to do right and that is really the greatest opportunity for water to get in your roofing system is underneath the shingles\nAfter that bond breaks where the single kind of tax down south yeah once the when pops out up it's really difficult for that to lay back down and stick back the way it was I always say it's kind of like a sticker right like if you take a um Hi my name is Patrick and you put that sticker on your shirt right if you take the sticker off\nThen you put it back on your shirt ill stick but not the same right by the fibers and things aren't\nAnd the more you do it at some point it just doesn't stick at all and you're saying a shingle is like that yeah so what happens is a shingles will lift during the storm er during the win whatever it is ... as they lift that tacky underneath the shingle it gets debris underneath that gets ... your water it gets\nA leaves to get little debris underneath there and it's not going to stick back so I was just that house not long ago in\nA house look totally normal and I got up on the roof in literally the whole back in the house I just went around with one finger at every single shingle lifted up\nSomeone looked fine it looked normal but when you actually got up there you can see it at the start even compromise\nExactly and we find that a lot of universal refund contracting where people call us and they'll say\nI'm not missing anything goes I think my roof is fine it's just I Want to make sure and we go out and sure enough\nShingles are lifted there might be shingles torn in so don't just assume because it visually looks good [laughter] that it's in good shape I mean there is a very good chance that\nThere could be something going on and especially if you notice any yellow ing and your ceiling ... anything that looks like a water spot whether it looks like it to dry up or it looks like it's fresh give us a call and we'll come out and inspected and find out what's going on\nOh that's great okay so if you got to an inkling some of them going on or you know it's been like so many years like how long can you expect a decent roof collapsed in Florida you know storms was standing\nIf I don't know the company I just say hey you know when you're asking talking to another company just ask them how long have they been in business you know or have they been in business for since Hurricane Irma\nThat may say a little bit about what their intentions are and it doesn't mean that every roofing company that did is bad but you know just junior due diligence so that way if you do have an issue with the roof down the work down the road and the company's stand behind the work and I can say without a doubt the universal riffing contracting can within twenty five years and we're not going anywhere\nAnd you have the warranty is to back it up exactly and you actually have like a next level kind of warrants yeah I'm a little more about that\nSo we are a platinum contractor I'm ... with Owens courting or which is a great company uh we install Owens Corning and certain teaching those but specifically Owens Corning where one of the few platinum contractors\nA preferred contractors in the ... area and um we are really proud of that because it means that we have been a certified and know\nHow to specifically installed their roofing system\nAlong with that a certification huh hum and recognition violence Corning we can also offer warranties\nThat other companies can't offer their extended more robust warranties homeowners can\nUm can take with the roofing system that other Owens courting of contractors can offer they just can't that comes with the platinum prefer exactly yup ... and there's only I'm a really a little bit more than a handful of those even in Orlando and the central Florida in Orlando area so it's a\nPretty big on the ... that sounds like a big deal I like I like it better warranty for pretty proud of it I think I'm gonna look you know\nMy a person in the eye and say you've given me the best possible risk to protect my home and my family and and everything and it I mean that's that's hugely important\nBecause every system comes with a standard warranty from Owens Corning um\nBut this is kind of step up so if you want added protection an added value for your roofing system we can offer that whereas other companies can't so you know that's a big value to a lot of people out there and it's something that we can offer that other people can't\nAs fantastic Patrick I'm sitting here at Patrick more from universal refund contracting and if you're thinking about\nNow it's time to get that roof looked at it time to get that work done uh right now the first seven colors during the show right now\nFifteen Percent off new roof installation and by calling you can also get priority placement on the list as well\nSo if you're thinking about it just going to make a call and get on the list now at four zero seven eight zero nine five one five six that's four zero seven eight zero nine fifty one if the sex again for zero seven eight zero nine five one five six so the process of replacing a rift you've not been through it before and they just come and take the whole rip off\n[laughter] and you know everything's open air and you gotta wait through the ... it's it's done in a very deliberate process yeah kind of wanting to that but he doesn't that fewer shatter\nYeah so we are very process driven in terms of making sure that we're very efficient and very effective when we install your roof we did not want your roof exposed anymore than it has to be with the ...\nHow about that like you have your plan is singled out and it's just the wood chair usually at the data pull everything off and then a day to put everything back on but it's Florida\nThat evening thunderstorms going to come up with\nWhat's happening there are we\nSo we're really is I Will say this about our crews are cruiser like amateur meteorologist like these little chemicals in their head or antennas and they just know when like a storm is going to come and they're really great about\nCovering the roof and typing in and we really never have any issues with that not violent but at the same time you know we're so efficient and effective that quite often most shingle roofs an average shingle roof we can do in a day to day and a half\nAnd the main thing is that tear off process when we get down to the ... as soon as we get that would\nExposed and we re nail it if we need to buy code or um we get that under lame it down and that's really what protects the house so if you was to be a little sprinkler a shower we harp and cover it but our guys are very efficient they're effective we're not running back and forth to the to the supply store going oh we forgot this forgot that everything's there that\nWe pull into dumped trailer or to the house you know it is loud noisy and dirty I mean it is what it is it's really wanted to be right but it's going to happen quickly and efficiently and effectively for you and when we leave you're going to have a great roof and you're not even get to know we were there\nAnd you have a great we want you to go a long way that actually that as\nSo if you're thinking about uh it's finally time I know there isn't that you've seen a lot of your neighbors having this done and you just want to have them come out and take a look I highly recommend contacting universal roof and contracting um when I had my roof ridden a few years ago it was a beautiful process but\nI ... I Know so much more about it now like I Wish I Would have asked the question is if I Would have paid attention\nAnd to you know what were they using and how were they applying it and how long did it take like I've gotten such a great education on roofing from you Patrick thank you so much but\nAside from the warranties and and and that you guys can want people to like an insurance bumps and along the way what are like you're taught to takeaways about what sets universal contracting apart from other rivers here in Florida\nI think what you just said is a perfect example mhm we think of ourselves as a consultant our job is to teach you what it takes to put the best route on your home and not every roof is the same mhm there are different shingles there's different systems there's different crews there's there's all these things involved in the process\nWe're not a hard sale organization and we're not going to beat you up over the head are not gonna make you sign a piece of paper the second I Walk up to your door when I'm walking through the process we're going to explain to you why we're better and why the system and the products we use are better than other companies\nAnd so at the end of the day we want you to want us because we definitely want your business as well and we're going to earn it so um that's the biggest thing is ask questions\nAnd the other thing too I took a toll customers out their potential homeowners customers\nIs when you're looking at your roof find out if you're comparing apples to apples to apples to oranges\nThere's a lot of people think that a roof is a roof and so you know there are certain cars if you if you buy one car versus another car\nAnd you know one car you know ... there's a difference in a car and a truck right they're not apples apples there's different parts to it and so they do kind of the same thing but they perform differently and so it's the same thing with roofing there's a big difference of materials\nThere's a big difference in labor there's a big difference inexperienced and especially warranty after you know what you're buying and don't just assume it's the same and if anything give us a chance to come out and explain the differences so you can make an informed decision\nOkay All right I like all of that um but when it comes to roof damage which does more damage storms or squirrels\n[laughter] it's funny you know squirrels can do some damage I Know it was girls can do the damage real damage Iowa or pesky situation where I I was in my office at home not too long ago\nAnd I heard like a water dripping into the roof and I was like okay my ... not that old oh what's going on here and I called my my company back out there like a squirrel is eating the yourself ... ...\nIt happens all the time I mean you must see some pretty incredible things\nAren't as crazy I just went to a house that had a\nA whole family of um of raccoons living in their ... and um I we see squirrels choose stuff all the time\nUh it's crazy I mean it ... and unfortunately you know sometimes there's nothing you can do about it but um you know that's another example of things that we do differently other companies install what they call led boot they just wrap ... led around those pipes that come out of your roof I think that you know they do to them they actually cut their teeth on them that's how they cut their teeth like maybe my kids we should do that with\nTheir right but it\nOral squirrels do that they cut their teeth so we we as a company made a decision we don't put lead on those pipes anymore we put we called Bola boot the kind of a hard rubber a material that goes right over the top of that pipe and make sure that things not going to leak more importantly the squirrels don't chew on them\nOh my gosh yeah even even really thought about everything oh yeah\nWe don't we don't we don't skimp we don't cut corners we do it the right way because quite honestly I don't want to come back out to your roof and fix things I Want to be putting roofs on other people's houses so we do it right the first time and then you know on the one off that we get something wrong we come out and fix it because we've been around for twenty five years\nYou're not going to call the office and get a dead signal and hope somebody shows up right we have people there and we will take care of everything\nBut I Love everything about that and if you're thinking about it's time for you to take the next step I highly recommend calling us the crew at University of ... and contracting a for all of those reasons that they they definitely stand behind their work they've got the warranties and the platinum preferred status yes congratulations on that is awesome\nFifty percent of new roof installations out of the first seven colors during the show can enjoy it that offer special to the show Fifteen Percent up new roof installations\nAnd calling for zero seven eight zero nine five one five six\nFour zero seven eight zero nine five one five six and four zero seven eight zero nine five one five six\nPatrick ... you certainly seem to know a whole\nLot about the right way to do roofing if there's one piece of advice you can leave everybody with today when it comes to knowing when it's time to make that call what can you even with\nDoing when it's time to things if you see people around you getting getting roofs you know it's a ... you would I Would go ahead and call that is probably a good chance or maybe some hail and the area or wind damage okay the second thing is obviously if you just hear leaking or you see any kind of water spot in there where he just got an old roof\nGive us a call will come out and look at it and will advise you maybe a little more time maybe you don't maybe it's time to call your insurance company or just replace out of pocket\nPerfect patchy thank you so much for coming by you guys don't hesitate universal Ruth and

heater um our insurance companies have now an deem that once a water heater is ten years or older\nOr it needs to be replaced and if it leaks in damages your home if it's after ten years uh they consider it a maintenance problem I think that's a big change it's a big change and the reason that change came into effect is there's been a lot of want to damage and homes that they had to pay for

different air conditioners but we've got one that the drain line a and ends up going in a flower bed and then out onto the concrete a parking lot and you should see the amount of water that's running down the parking lot cause a flower bed can't take it all\nA tremendous amount of humidity out there that's getting pulled out of the year and uh that that line gets clogged up\nAnd and your systems working um and in all of our homes day in and day out that machine is working folks you need to have a plan to take care of\nYour equipment and the ... family value plan at two hundred and Ninety dollars is a a fantastic deal eight seven seven\nTo two three two nine six say\nLet's talk a little bit more about air conditioning and um and some of the things that I I Know for an example that you actually have got a special that you're offering I'm On a seat right now\nYeah and I want to remind our new Florida residents of people who haven't been here too long ago maybe you have been and you just haven't thought about it you're a condition of works or to cool you're home as well as the heat you know there's two different styles this one that we call a straight cool\nUm which the air conditioner runs a ... when you need air conditioning but when you need heat the outside unit shuts off\nAnd your air handling the piece inside the home becomes an electric furnace it's you heat in your home or really electric elements come on like a toaster\nAnd you're blowing that out in ... to heat your home and it's not cheap it's not cheap it's much less efficient\nUm landlords put them in and condos and apartments and most commercial applications are straight cool um because the commercial applications you don't usually need a lot of heat does a lot of people in it and equipment and so forth\nAre and then the a typical on on a has what's called a heat pump is reversing valve on on the ... side unit in reverse is instead of making the inside coil um\nA cold it makes it more with the refrigerant and for emergency heat you do have elements but\nThat's a if you raise your temperature usually four degrees or more are the elements will come on for a short period of time and then the heat pump will take over or if it gets his extremely cold the emergency heat will kick on automatically but if you're getting a a new\nSystem I recommend you know if possible get a heat pump\nA there's things that can limit to you that two year if you rent an apartment or a condo and it's how many why is the term is that why has going outside the existing wire\nUm 'cause it needs more wires and in most cases you have to have additional wiring but he'd pump is the most efficient way to go so your your air conditioners running a year round for heat or cool regardless\nUm and as I've said ah on on these shows in the past when it comes time to buy a new air conditioner\nIt it's rated and see a rating a it's a seasonal or energy efficiency writing and by think of it is miles per gallon and kind of the sweet spot it today we have to put a minimum of fourteen seer\nOr it's going to raise up to Fifteen sit here in the near future uh which is more miles per gallon right but uh I Would recommend the sweet spot it starts at sixteen\nOr you know you get a good bang for your buckets sixteens here it's a very efficient or it'll pull more humidity out and you can get a variable speed and so forth and uh if if you're lucky enough to get a higher efficiency one in your home\nYou will feel the difference in the air the air gets crisp and if you're usually keep your thermostat at Seventy four you can put a Seventy six in most cases though yet I saw it on the news it was just absolutely savings power absolutely\nUm the variable speed ones ah they run\nLonger but they reduced uh uh the amount of power they're consuming as well and uh keep the humidity how much much more efficient so uh what a says offering a today or anybody who needs a new system\nOr anything sixteen Sarah and higher and we're a premier Lennox dealer and we sold Lennox that's a a first option and we have another product will offer if we have physical restrictions to get it in the closet because how they've gotten more efficient is over time as\nBoth the indoor units and the ... units have coils in them which refrigerant runs through\nAnd it takes more coil space to build deficiency\nSo when we get a small closet he didn't have to rebuild the closet to get more efficiency or put it in another product we have other products have different shaped coils are still the same efficiency rating\nUm but uh\nIf any by by sixteen in up we're going to give you two hundred and fifty dollars off that system\nFolks that's two hundred and fifty dollars off a new air conditioning systems six teams here\nIn up the number to call for that special\nIs eight seven seven\nHang on here I've got the number I had the number\nAnd Jerry just sort of listeners know a air conditioning air conditioners are cheap\nUm but we will ah we ... we can finance we have several finance companies out there and they're willing to finance and usually a\nA you know it's not uncommon for us to save a hundred and fifty bucks a month on their electric bill and uh and that's usually more enough to pay for the brand new system\nAir conditioning plumbing in electrical case solved at all [noise]\n\n\nWhat's your case worth doll

how you doing Charlie I'm doing better than I deserve to [laughter] there you go Mr Dave Ramsey junior yeah\nToday we're going to talk about some plumbing items in some electrical items that are I think our listeners would be interested in it\nAnd the big one is water heaters we were talking about just before we went on the air\nThe uh uh it should be shouted\nFrom the mountaintops tell people what we were talking\nAbout well this is a lot of changes in water heaters but also with insurance companies in regards to water heater um they've put in my type or in their policies most insurance companies has 'cause 'cause if one does it then they all you know jump on the bandwagon and if you have a water heater in your home\nAnd it's ten years or older and it leaks in damages your home which water here will damage your home with mold and mildew and so forth um they will not a\nEnsure the repair that your problem\nOr you should have changed that they look at it as a maintenance I don't know I think a water heater should last\nLonger than ten years but uh I guess history has shown them with costs are that it fails enough that they had to put it into their policy another item folks and it's kind of related has nothing to do with water heater but it could if you have a leak in your home and the insurance and you need to get the insurance company involved\nOne of the things they'll ask you is how long ago did it start leaking\nAnd same thing uh they've put into their policy if the leak occurred uh fourteen days before or longer\nUm they're not going to cover it they feel the same thing it's a maintenance item you should have known it taking care of it so I'm you know usually the truthful answer is I just you know started to see at least now you know because that's when you would call him you wouldn't wait a couple of weeks or three weeks but\nAnd then after that duct tape your mouth so you don't say anything and\nUh so be careful but in water heaters uh they've changed over the years or two or three years ago time flies or the regular conventional water heater tank they made a little more efficient and how they're made it more efficient is by adding more insulation\nSo they're like three inches wider and three inches taller so if you have one stuffed into it\nYeah a a small closet and it was an older one and it just fit the chances are the new one will not fit\nI'm so be cautious of that we've had some uh instances where we would have to move them or we may be offered them a tank list water heater or another style water heater\nUm to to take care of their needs but what's available out there now is a conventional water heater which pretty much everybody knows you can get 'em in gas or electric\nA tank was water heater which you can get in gas and electric and some of the gas ones if you buy the right model it can be put outside in our\nClimate here go on the outside wall and invents into the air um so if you can make space in your in your home if you go to tank was whether it be electrical gas it's not that big are they are efficient\nI'm a water typical water heater is very inefficient because what the tank does all day long as heat up cool down heat up a little down or some people put time is on them but in essence that's\nThe only thing when you're on vacation it's heating and cooling\nWhen you're at work I heating and cooling when you're sleeping eating a cool and we're both gas and electric tank was um\nThey're on demand so they're never requiring any energy until you asked for hot water and you get instant hot water and in a in an endless hot water so those are some of them and then the newest water heater out there is what we call a hybrid water heater\nIt's super efficient it's a great product here in Florida if if your water heater is in the garage or any other on on conditions space on the air conditioned space a it's a great product because uh what what it does is it's a heat pump air conditioner on top of a tank\nUh it pulls the hot air out of the environment that it's and it takes that heat and dumps it into the tank\nAnd then on the other side of it it blows cool air out it's not going to air condition your garage but it's going to change the climate\nYou know maybe up to ten degrees and uh that's all free and the cost to a heat you water at that point is very very low and I'll give you an example we we stage material that is going out of this shop on a daily basis um\nDay there was a an eighty a gallon a hybrid which is a a large hybrid water heater if you have a lot of demand a lot of bathrooms and so forth are in some of the bigger homes require that uh we had one in the air and there's a yellow efficiency tag on it and it said to operate that thing for a year
