our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil\nNow ... is Saudi I don't know if he is related to add ... ... is is a as a Saudi or Arab name and then they show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity by a\nA lifestyles are the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer and that the source of his

prince is the chosen son he is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king as such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically\nTo reform the some of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and a oil\nFocused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things uh Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making\nFriends in the United states who spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know he's winding dying the Google guys he's winding dined Facebook guys spend a lot of time an apple he wants to build a brand new\nCity out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two if\nHe takes off the Arab garb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy uh apparently attractive short little stocky\nBut he represents if he is being truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women he is the guy who wants to relax\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them all but not being able to drive a go places on their own without male a company but this made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past summer last night it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the

rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I so I was there I was in the uh for the three days of the non than last week I saw the the the screaming and yelling and attacking us\nAnd the folks and and so why was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan is it the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same market and the luck in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that's a whole lot you know that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind\nThey do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented Kavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done just stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing a new policies to counter Trump's 'cause they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're\nThe right one were silent and they they are so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away at\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media a well some conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the for rats lying\nYup threats flying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs if we don't show up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discouraging us enough to make us not show up that's the only way they win but Republican conservative\nStand up went every single time we just have to show up we have to convince other people to show up you convince them to convince other people to show\nUp you say you were in Washington for three days what did you actually see what kind of activities really engage like you saw I was\nI was right in the middle of it I Would live

most from your Medicaid benefits were more than I did go family care dot com that's bill family care dot com will call a three three four six seven eight to five nights for Medicaid plans from up to my health\nAnd then shortly after this political story hits\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday he will weed out individuals in side his administration\nWho he does not like echoing remarks from his wife the bully millennia Trump about it doesn't say that but you know they wanted to write it [noise]\nDuring a live phone interview a Thursday morning with facts and friends are president said it was more true in the past when he was first setting himself up in Washington and he just trust and members of his team\nHe cited Nikki Haley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the great people who now feel his administration he said he's going to do away with people he doesn't like are there some I'm not in love with yes we're going to weed them out slowly well\nShe said that to this is not coincidence\nIf it was not happenstance so ... and Trump both are putting stab you in the west wing on notice\n\nA Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get to it I don't want to jump ahead what's going to the audio soundbite starting with number seven teams sorry sorry sorry uh Thirteen [noise]\nThis is Trump calling in to Fox and friends that I was talking to Steve do see a do she said you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nI really had very little eat other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some we had thousands of people lined up by the time either make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours already\nThat I'm not coming and I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously is not affected at all by it we had it on a great control I don't think really\nThey go to Sherry hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people are lined up they've expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do what it did and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment\nSo the next question in from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder former attorney general said they go low we kick them and the whole room\nMr President started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics\nTo be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's working to discuss things safe and for him to make a very dangerous day for older\nWhat has held in contempt by Congress owned or went after Christians he went after our great evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that case\nA holder is they've got some problems\nYou're not used to being told you like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever we sat and the Republicans win Wimbledon away or not even acknowledge or are they would say so\nWe strongest term ... we did not ... rhetoric go out and buy a attorney general holder written hundreds but much oh totally totally uncalled for and we we were kingly a unilateral condemning\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful what he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I get you better be careful\nWhat he's wishing for now the stock market's been kind of see song has been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced would willingly\nTake a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not that well but they would they would they would incur some pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes on the left who willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it it\nFlies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it there believe it looking our polling\nData people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThat this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to Trump but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was ... pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute so when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression that was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [noise]\nI'm paying interest at irate because of our head and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional\nInside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going to grade\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've\nAsked myself why\nAnd let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so for renting\nTwo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what doesn't offend do they leak\nThey leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets if these people think defense is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing\nWhat Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy\nAt the time and totally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out\nHe's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump from the ... no you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way and the federal\nReserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors is going to be you know a bunch of\nTommy leftists as they are at many financial institutions are not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning the cause of Trump\nSo Trump calling them out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election soybeans down so they react to it\nAnd and this roller coaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day roller coaster I\nThink there's positive action today I Will I Will check it ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah a\n... heart so your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust that you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are working are there are some that I I'm not in love with us and we'll weed them out slowly but surely\nUrban and some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get my legs I think a lot of the lake so not only that made up by the newspapers the meat is very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand\nNow even a letter to the times that there is a chance there is a very good chance that that was written by the time so I wouldn't be surprised 'cause at times is totally corrupt and dishonest\nWhere did you first hear that right here\nWho was the first or maybe the only person to suggest that the times itself wrote that piece\nThat memo that some pose a memo written by an angry staffer in the Trump Administration claiming their up close and personal things the president doesn't know what he's doing but don't worry there are adults in the room and we're doing everything we can to stop this guy we're conservative they we love business\nAnd they started a massive manhunt to find out who did this\nAnd they couldn't find anybody and I think on the first day on the first I Would have to go back and check the transcript\nHearing west has taken over the oval office Donald Trump smiling\nWatching listening John Brown sitting next to a country country does not brave [noise]\nI won't guarantee you the civil rights coalition um CNN people referring to ... is the Trump house negro I guarantee you they are exploding right now Kanye West is\nBam bam bam issue after issue after issue explaining why whatever he's talking about is good for America including jobs things Trump has been doing [noise]

I'll be thirty three ...\nSo you're right there will be up for it but I I I remember about passion I remember I had it\nI still do that's the great thing a lot of people outgrow it a lot of people out of it when they when they don't see as much success as they envision when they don't see it happening as quickly or some people it's not that they give up they they just lose some of the pack don't lose the passion\nExactly who not only the passion as you continue to do this\nI Will not I'm so fired up and I just got left kind of gave me the more people like him to come out I feel so bad for him like I've experienced that sort of like\nUm attack me thing like oh I'm Republican or a conservative I Can't imagine what it's like for him I think he's doing an amazing thing and I think this is a really pivotal time and I think I have hope that the less it just losing it and the unraveling and\nI have hope for my generation I think\nI'm so enthused to hear that I I I you're you're the second is maybe the third\nMillennial age color today with the same belief that that that what you're watching on on the left is among rabble you're watching them come on glued and I I Hope you're right I I Would make perfect sense to me the thing is well here I'm up against time look\nThanks so much for the call appreciate it keep the passion [noise]\nOh [noise]\n\nOh\nThe bumper here for a while to sort of kick him here in a minute\nWe go to the bus with\nGod\nAnd it was the\n\nNew York magazine and looking at is Obama had a secret plan in case Trump rejected the twenty sixteen election results is is not a wary of looking back which which retrace steps it was the last debate between the Trump stir\nAnd the hill the beast\nAnd Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them which swear pledge to accept the election results\nAnd Trump said no I'm not gonna sit here and tell you right now but I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes we've counted the boats\nThey want it\nI think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for the drugs\nHave you with knowledge that you'll accept the results of the election of course I'm a great American ... that go sit at that time everybody thought that Hillary was going to win in a landslide then they the soundbite would be the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely to feed their upcoming election\nBut Trump cross them up and said no [laughter]\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans these people gonna play I'm not going to concede anything tonight Hillary Clinton gets in here\nThis is the biggest threat to our democracy that we never\nDid believe in saying that this is an unwritten sold them Obama we didn't know until\nRecently devised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump Williams to steal the election away from it\n\nIn October two thousand sixteens senior staff and the Obama White house\n\nWhat they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the result\nThey had caused to be worried at that time Trump and openly speculated that the election might be rude during his ... was Clinton on October the Nineteen if you said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would conceded\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical Ben Rhodes Obama senior aide and speech writer told intelligent just New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail\nBen Rhodes seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a hypothetical question what\nWe will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nHe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and condo leaves a rice to cry and forestall a political crisis by validating we election results so\nThis is not funny looking by their hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump

Camille ... soundbites us Ralph in Las Vegas looks intriguing up there once up Ralph [noise]\nWell I have two questions if you don't want to take one that's fine uh\nDuring the judges hearing all I heard was yeah vi only investigates they do not come up with conclusions or oh pinion or anything I heard that too but Fox News and the president have both bought in\nThe fact that [noise] honors did\nExactly the opposite he was judge jury and loud executioner but a probation officer or Hillary jade did he violated all of it so why did he get away with it and nobody else can I I don't understand I really don't\nUh who is ... ... you mean Comey Coleman Oh yes I'm Sorry [noise]\nYeah I I made the same point when I heard they don't drunk and cook calming exonerated her before even interviewing her\nJudge jury and probation officer right\nAnd and we all know the reason why she was a Democrat nominee their jobs and futures end the shenanigans they haven't pulled\nRequired her to win for them to stay employed in front of the tricks they unfold on Trump to remain unknown\nSo she had to be exonerated she had to be found not guilty and not even charged in relation to the emails and the ... and the trafficking in classes my data and so forth [noise] see I have the same reaction you ... what do you mean or coming out in collisions I Andrew\nI understand that that you had to get off but he did not have the right to he was not a judge it was never in trial\nIt was oh he has no wait wait wait wait he claimed that he did because Loretta Lynch ended up having term she didn't officially recused but because she met was slick willy\nOn the plane on the tarmac out in Phoenix ... said she's compromise so he basically took over the gang of eight gee for the purposes of exonerated Hillary and he went out there on July ... did that press conference under the auspices of making the decisions because Loretta Lynch couldn't\nThere why can't we just ... open it and say it didn't have the legal right to make a decision so let's start over from where he just gave that speech\nI agree with you and this is why you're not the only one\nDevin newness and a bunch of his um other house members that are on the house Judiciary Committee\nAre hell bent on getting to the bottom of this\nAnd not letting these people get away with it they have been on the investigated that's not the right word they haven't even been invest they haven't been looked at you've got the special counsel what you're saying nor ring the real crimes and criminality that's taken place while spending all of this time trying to find the crime\nThat they can lay on Trump and they haven't been able to\nIt's frustrating this is why by the way there isn't greasing frustration at the president for not declassify these documents that will answer\nThe question you're asking don't understand why why the president is protecting Rosen stain the guy who end up meeting suggested wearing a wire in his next meeting with Trump to try to get incriminating evidence that Trump's unfit\nThey were going to gather the cabinet after Rosen's dean had had a\nConversation with Trump which supposedly was going to show that Trump is insane in an unfair never going to play that for the cabinet to try to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment Rosen steam so I'm just kidding I just it was ... the people in the media they say he was not getting none of us were\nAnd I believe that I Believe these people back then were hell bent on getting rid of Trump\nI think they still are I I think I think official Washington the political media complex of washing it is still\nInside out and upside down over Trump and I think what every success and every smile on Trump space with every piece of\nEvidence that Trump is enjoying this I think they go a little further insane each and every time\nThe Trump succeeds it something that Trump is not damaged by saying every effort every thing they have done the take Trump out I think they are beyond frustrated that it hasn't worked\nAnd I don't think they are giving up on it I don't think they will give up on it now the Rosenstein Rosenstein however pronounces it hurt it both ways\n[noise] this is really curious Trump pat him\nA on air force one people thought that roses you know why he's got to be fired after this after credibly being discovered\nSuggesting wearing a wire to win trap the president you got to go but Trump says I got a great relationship with the guy I'm not let them go I'm not doing anything about that now and I'm not declassify those documents yet\nThat people are scratching their heads", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "11"}
