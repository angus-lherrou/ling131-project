a radio station [noise]\nSince Nineteen twenty six according to the Senate associates the average annual return to the U.S and the five hundred end the Dow Jones industrial average is about ten percent per year that's assuming that you had a portfolio that consisted of nothing but that now who on earth is going to put a hundred percent of their life savings\nIn the stock market I wouldn't I don't think you would either because although the stock market has been historically the best performing asset class we also know it's a very volatile asset class remember two thousand eight\nOf course you do and that's the problem is that we don't want to expose ourselves to the possibility of suffering massive losses in a very rapid pace and that's why you only have part of your money in the stock market so up until Wednesday people have been\nSaying how am I Am a minority that I'm not doing as well as the stock market how come I don't have all my money and the stock market\nBecause the more diversified my portfolio is no worse that's been doing relative to the stock market because it's been the u._s. stock market that has been out performing everything else\nOf course that's what they were saying up until Wednesday on Wednesday everybody started changing their tune to\nBoy am I really don't have all of my money in the stock market boy I'm really glad I have a highly diversified portfolio boy am I glad I have money and investments other than\nThe stock market see my point in other words just because the given asset classes performing well and even might be\nPerforming better than alternatives doesn't mean that you ditched the alternative instead we have to recognize that every dog has its day\nAt any given moment fortunes can change as we saw was striking evidence on Wednesday and Thursday when the Dow fell Thirteen hundred point this is why you don't place all your money into stocks\nAnd it even goes beyond that because what Wednesday and Thursday demonstrated for us was something else that's really fascinating\nYou all know what's been going on with General Electric\nRight we've been talking about gee for a few times throughout the year because this company which was at one point one of the biggest companies in America and one of the best performing companies in America certainly one of the oldest companies in America\nHas been doing terribly over the past several years the stock was down forty percent over the past year GE he was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average earlier this year wow really awful so far this year\nGee is still in the S. and P. five hundred but its stock performance in the U.S and the five hundred year to date through Tuesday\nRanked at the four hundred and Ninety six best stock yeah out of the five hundred it came in at four hundred and Ninety six only for stocks were worse than gee\nYou're the date\nAs of Wednesday for the past week jeeze stock performance is now number one [laughter]\n\nIn other words nobody wanted to own Ga all year long because of all the terrible things that have been happening in that company but certainly with the stock market dropping so much on Wednesday compared to everything else gee did fabulous and became the number one performing stock for the week through Tuesday of this past week\nI mean this is why you really can't try to decide what's gonna happen next because you're probably going to blow it in fact it wasn't just the gene anyone from among the worst two of the very best for the weekend and Tuesday\nIf you look at what's been going on in all of the deaf filed the top ten percent of all stocks compared to the worst ten percent of all stocks there has been a complete flip flop\nYear to date the three best performing stocks of the S. and P. five hundred or advanced micro devices a bio med and Netflix they were the three best performing stocks of the year\nBut now as of Wednesday they fell to number three hundred and Ninety three number four hundred and eighty one and number four hundred and forty three respectively\nThey went from being the three best\nSoup for the past week as a third Tuesday among the very worst in the marketplace there has been a complete flip flop\nAs a result of the changing of fortunes as of Wednesday the very best performing stocks have become the very worst and many of the very worst have become among the very best this according to analysis published in the wall Street Journal on Thursday\nSo what we have to recognize is that all of this is fleeting the ability to make an investment decision based on how things have performed in the past well that's just the suckers bat and therefore my message she was very simple number one\nLet's not get overly anxious and fixated on point declines in the Dow Jones industrial average number two this is an argument a reinforcement for why you need to maintain a diversified portfolio\nBased on your goals and objectives and number three to maintain your focus on those goals and objectives if your goals and objectives have not changed if your personal circumstances have not changed\nIf your attitude about risk has not changed when there is absolutely positively no reason for you to be making any change in your investment strategy\nThe fact that the stock market had a lousy day one day this past week is not enough itself enough of a reason to make a change in the portfolio now I'm not suggesting that we aren't going to see continued volatility in the market my point is very simply\nWe can't draw a conclusion one way or the other new or should we attempt to make a prediction about what's going to happen next instead look at the economic fundamentals unemployment is at the lowest level in this country since Nineteen sixty nine wage growth is at its highest level over the last ten years\nThe economy is still humming along just fine and on that basis the argument for staying fully invested in a diversified portfolio remains completely\nIntact and so if you're upset about it if you're watching the news and worried about what you're seeing\nStopped watching them lose it doesn't mean you should change or investment that means you should change much at all that's the most effective advice I can give you on the show today I Want you to stay with us because if you're still struggling on what you should be doing with your investments I had a number one piece of advice\nAnd I'm going to tell you what it is when we come back here on the record them and show so if you're struggling not knowing what you

hundred two one five fifty one forty one pharmacy [noise]\nWe're taking telephone calls here on the regular one show headmaster Troy, Michigan polls on the line how you doing fall\nOn my question is about the option of taking a a lump sum a passion\nBriefly I've been given the opportunity to take on and what did your input on it\nSo uh the question is whether you take the lump sum a or a series of monthly checks for as long as you live and uh it's it's an important question isn't it because once you give them your answer you're like stuck with it forever [laughter]\nSo that's a yeah it's like they're no re do do do overs and such like that and that's why it's pretty vexing for a lot of folks the good news is this it is\nStraight math in other words we simply want to look at\nHow much money they're going to offer you on a monthly basis versus if we take the lump sum\nPay any taxes associated with that invest the rest how much income can we reasonably expect to produce from a a an investment we make with that lump sum and is that money going to be equal to what you would have gotten from the pension\nSo the good news is all requires is a bit of math and I can tell you this usually\nWhen we do that math for our clients the answer is take the lump sum and invest it on your own to produce your own monthly income usually not always but usually that is the more\nCost effective more economic uh the the superior answer given the two choices now I say usually and here's one big case where it's\nUsually not true of great Australian our federal employees and the reason is that in some pensions\nThe pension amount you receive will grow over time they will actually increase the amount of income you're receiving sort of like Social Security increases the sheer they just announced that there will be a\nVery small Social Security increase for folks mostly about thirty or forty bucks for most Social Security beneficiaries\nUm so if you have a pension where where the monthly income you're receiving will rise annually than a clearly that are in most cases is the better choice but most pensions don't do that most pensions it's a fixed amount\nWhatever they're giving you one day one is the same you're going to get ten years from now Twenty years from now Thirty years from now and that's a big reason for choosing the lump sum over the monthly pension because when you take the monthly pension\nThere are several pieces of fine print\nNumber one is I just said that amount will not rise which means overtime inflation will take its toll on the value of that monthly check\nThe the ability to buy goods and services diminishes because those costs rise but the check your receiving doesn't second is that when you die that pension benefits stops are you married Paul\nNo single okay so it's not an issue for you if you don't have a spouse or a partner you don't have to worry about that but for people who are married to have a partner a vet pension check stops when they die\nAnd that leaves a huge crisis for their surviving spouse\nUh so that's a consideration a that's not a problem for you so not as big a deal another major one his lack of liquidity once you take the monthly check that's all you ever get as a monthly check if you ever need access to the big bucket of money it's not available to you whereas if you take the lump sum now invested and generate your own income\nYou can increase that income whenever you want to keep pace with inflation you can reduce that you can start it stop it if you need a lump sum it's available to you you have greater flexibility and when you die whatever you didn't spend stays there for your heirs so the lump sum has greater flexibility that is often\nSuperior to taking the pension benefit but here's one final point in favor of the pension\nYou don't have to worry about your own habits in other words some folks if they are given a lump sum\nWill blow the cash and they will discover at some point that the money was spent on vacations and on jewelry on on big screen TVs on lottery tickets and beer and they have nothing to show for it in ten years and now they're in trouble whereas if they had taken the monthly check\nAnd they can be pretty confident that they will get another monthly check next month like Social Security checks and so they can protect themselves from their own\nA tendency to get my ... so you have to know your salary you have to know can you be trusted to receive this lump sum manager permanently properly for your own personal benefit or will you be your own worst enemy\nAnd he would say the best thing to do is put in a A R a\nYes assuming you're eligible and in most cases you are you roll the money over to an IRA and then you begin making withdraws from that account whenever you're ready to start taking it if you want it right away you can start if you don't need it for a while you leave it there until you do need it\nAnd you go from there so in order to find out the answer for sure we need to do that math we need to do those calculations to evaluate how much money is your employer offering you and can you reasonably expect to generate a similar amount of income from an investment strategy you create on your own\nAs I said usually the answer's yes we can do that but not always\nAnd that's why we need to go through the exercise we actually have an office in Troy on in your neck of the woods and so happy to sit down with you and go through this one detail looking at the amount of pension benefit your being offered and contrast that to the lump sum they're willing to give us an alternative to the which strategy is best in your situation\nThat sounds good so yeah but it is is like I said it's largely straight math that doesn't require a too much judgment will show you the spreadsheet analysis and say here's what yet this way and here's what you get that way which number looks better to you and it'll be pretty self evident\nCarrie thanks for your question uh yes you can reasonably expect that further increases in interest rates will create further declines\nIn the value of bombs now a couple of caviar to this number one yes the markets do anticipate\nActions by the government in other words if it is clear if the government has sent messages which they sometimes do that they are going to do things the market's doing to dissipate that and they adjust\nSecurities prices based on that in other words this was called the leading economic indicator and that's what the financial markets are they are leading indicators in other words they are pricing securities today based on what they think is going to happen as opposed to a lagging indicator\nThat occurs when prices are based on what already happened so the market as a leading indicator not all lagging indicator so yes to some degree prices are based on what everybody collectively things is going to happen but having said that\nWe are never really shore truly what is going to happen or when so while many people believe that the fed will continue to raise rates nobody's really sure when the fed will raise rates next or by how much and therefore bond prices are not fully baked in\nOn that answer so for that reason you can expect that there will be further declines in the bond market if there are further increases in interest rates\nSecond bonds react differently to interest rate increases depending on the maturity date the duration of the bond a thirty year bond will have a much bigger decline than a thirty day bond\nThat makes sense longer the duration of the longer the maturity date\nThe greater the swing in value due to changes in interest rates so if you're fearful that there will be more rate increases and then you should probably not own long term bonds\nUnless you plan to hold them to maturity if you'll never mature you don't have to worry about it you'll get your money back at maturity regardless of what interest rates are doing but if you're thinking it might sell your bond prior to maturity\nMeaning you'll be subject to whatever market prices are being offered at that time and then you would probably want to own shorter term bonds rather than longer term bombs in our case we tend to recommend three or five years seven year maturity is rather than twenty and thirty year majorities of for that reason\nSo yes you do need to be aware of this and this was something new and different for investors most folks are comfortable with unfamiliar with unaccustomed to\nInterest rate risk for the past forty years if we go back to the early Nineteen eighties interest rates are pretty much done nothing but go down\nAnd when rates go down bond prices go up so for a generation many people have grown up in an environment not realizing that race could go up not just down\nAnd they haven't been used to the fact that bombs could lose value because for the past since Nineteen eighty them bombs are pretty much done nothing but go up in value because when rates go down bond prices go up we're now in a different environment\nGenerationally so a lot of folks are unfamiliar with us and that's why I'm Glad you raised your question 'cause a lot of folks at the very same question don't buy a bond unless you're planning to hold her to maturity if you're going to own a bond fund you should probably on bombs in that funds that are shorter immaturity rather than longer\nAnd to know exactly what kind of bonds are best for you\nAnd how much of your money you should be placing into them\nYou should talk with a financial advisor and we're happy to help you triple each plan Rick to tackle that question for you\nHere's another question we got this on a lot of people's minds that comes from Mick here it is a direct this is Mick more prone to answer\nHave a question about terrorists we're hearing a lot about additional tariffs being applied all kinds of products and the fact that this is likely going to lead to an increase of crisis for a number of the products that we can see where it's purchase\nMy question is where does all that tariff money go doesn't go straight to the government coffers\nDoes is in essence become an indirect tax for the people the U.S thanks for taking my question\nYeah Mick the terrorists are getting a lot of attention and rightfully so and yes you are you are correct a tariff is essentially attacks\nIt's attacks targeted on a foreign company that is selling goods and services in the U.S and it's a way for the government to tell American consumers don't buy that foreign product instead by a domestically manufactured provided product or service instead\nSo yeah terrorists are essentially taxes and the money essentially does go into government coffers I'm\nReally that simple foreign governments retaliate by doing the same thing you know when one government you know throws a punch the other governments throw equal punches and uh and there you are so yes the terrorists um make products and services more expensive\nAnd the money goes into the government and taxes which is good news right we've got a massive deficit right the government is spending more money than it is receiving this helps to solve that problem but the burden is paid by American consumers who a\nFoot the bill so yeah that's what terrorists are terrified his synonym for tax\nRevenue generation protocol right I mean they come up with all kinds of you ever noticed that you know longer right your taxes at the end of the year to the IRS they want you to write your check

school of management and more to my heart she's the director of the Boston College Center for Retirement Research that might not sound like a big deal you but in our circles and the financial planning world\nThe Boston College Center for Retirement Research produces some of the most important data a useful in the financial planning world so at least you're I'm really excited to have you with us on the program today\nOh I'm delighted to be here and I like your endorsement\nAlicia is a former member of the president's council of economic advisor she was former assistant secretary the treasury for economic policy um so how is the retirement outlook these days for today's workers\n[noise] it it's not good um little league calculated in ... shows about fifty percent of today's working households are not going to be able to maintain their standard of living once I stop working\nWell that's not very exciting and ... is the situation been this way for a long time or has the landscape changed in recent decades\nUm the landscape has changed a lot in recent decades has gotten a particularly ah or ... such a natural ...\nMean to some to those me why\nWhat should ask why ... ... a lot of money in two thousand and eight and a lot of house values and those items haven't totally returned\nWell wait a minute hang on I mean if you sat through two thousand eight and took no action I mean the stock market back then was at fourteen thousand before the crisis\nUh today the Dallas pushing twenty five thousand housing prices back you know seven weren't as high as they are today in major markets so shouldn't people actually be better off today now that we've had an extra ten years of savings on top of it and yet you're saying that's not really true in a lot of cases\nThat shocked at the stock market the people who hold stocks or the people in the high income which show if you look at the top third and yes they have equity holdings and they have 'em in their stock values have gained ... and\nTheir stock of Italian um but for the bottom two thirds of households they really don't hold very much stocks and I think the housing a story is yes for almost back to where it was our our data ... two thousand and sixteen and hadn't quite gotten back to the off\nPeak of the bubble up by two thousand sixteen but the house values have really high on the ... as you know in Boston New York and California and and not so high in between and not even high in all parts of California\nAnd this is I think the point that a lot of folks really don't fully comprehend them and we see this every day and our financial planning practice that\nAlthough it's true that people who own stocks and oh seven had they held through today they'd be a lot better off\nThe first fact as you point out as most people did known stocks that all second those many of those who did hold stocks and those seven panicked nine sold at the low or near it and so they're kind of frozen in time their account values are pretty much were they were even though we're ten years later they haven't enjoyed the run up in value\nBecause they didn't hold on to their investment for having continue to add to their investments and so they are still stuck where they were ten years ago\nNo that's right and it's and it's a lot of people lost their jobs the twin two thousand seven in two thousand nine and had to turn to their four one K. and rich other retirement holdings to make ends meet during that period\nSo even if I hadn't panicked events just demanded to withdraw the money's level of marriage issues medical issues other family issues they just didn't have the luxury of holding on to their investments [noise]\nSo that means people are now in the coming down from because here we are ten years later everyone's ten years older retirement is ten years closer\nAnd they might not have the retirement savings account values today that they had hoped they would have by now that's forcing people to work longer but is that as viable or an answer as you might hope\nSo I'm a great fan of people working longer I think it's the most powerful lever Pete that people can control and has a huge impact on their wellbeing a in retirement\nSo we've got the issue that people in order to improve their situation and generate income for themselves that they won't outlive is one key working longer the longer you work\nThe more money you're adding to investments more but those investments can grow in value and let's face it the longer you work the shorter your retirement will be and that means the less money also when we need to accumulate so it was a double benefit or by working longer\nIf you take your Social Security benefits Seventy and set of sixty two it's Seventy six percent higher and so your lifetime benefits will be the same but your monthly benefit will be um that Seventy six additional present\nSo work longer so that you are saving more your investments can grow more in value your ultimately going to get a higher monthly Social Security benefits and all that money isn't going to have to last as long as it otherwise might have exactly right\nBut loses to only one other us up is left that a lot of people I think ignore and that's the equity in their homes is that a potential resource for\nOh I'm Sorry I just I I Love the house almost as much as I Love working longer\nUm you're right for many people their houses their largest asset outside of the\nWealth that they have them in their Social Security benefits and\nSo wow pretty interesting uh illustration of the technological changes that are coming to society I talk about them a lot in my book the truth about your future that's what it's all about exponential technologies and how they're impacting every aspect of our daily lives\nHere

of physical disability just by thinking they're able to communicate\nIt's amazing what's going on in the field of medicine but it's not just the field of medicine where we're seeing some pretty amazing innovations in the field of robotic scientists of MIT of made a robot that can teach itself to see and identify objects\nAnd how to manipulate them as well new robots been able to do this before this robot as capable of picking up an object it never seen before\nAnd without resorting to trial and error it knows what to do with the object how humans do it you pick up an object you've never seen before and you know how to pick it up without breaking it you know how to turn it so that you can examine this robots able to do the very same thing\nThis is just a few of the illustrations

with your host best selling author Chuck Oliver [noise]\nHis mission is helping you discovered and uncover your hidden well\nProtect yourself from taxes inflation and market losses and now here's Chuck\nBy this shutdown welcome to hidden wealth radio where they've been\nTeaching baby boomers and business owners how to eliminate unnecessary taxes strategically ethically morally and of course legally\nAnd teaching them how to grow money without this tax distribute money without tax and to do it with market double digit potential upside without ever a negative market downside [noise]\nAnd I want to teach you how to have what I called the baby boomer retirement break through the unfair advantage to a safe and secure retirement and we've been keeping a focus on taxes\nEspecially with the house just passing this last week tax cut to point of making the tax cuts permanent now that's looking to be the case but of course there's obviously a lot of pushback\nA fact it it passed the house a hundred and Ninety One positive votes to twenty two negative votes of course with the Republican led house right to approve the legislation\nAnd things pretty much went along party lines but here's the challenge that we have right is that many people are accusing or making the assumption which I think there is some validity to it that this could really blow up the deficit by already adding one point five trillion to\nA tax cut one point to and then add fuel to the fire with tax cut to point out you could create a serious danger to the uncertainty of where tax rates will have an impact on taxing un I those of you listening to save at least a quarter million or more towards retirement\nThat somebody's going to have to pay for these tax cuts\nAnd the reality is those folks they're gonna have to pay for the tax cuts are the people that work the hardest and save the hardest unfortunately are going to get taxed the hardest\nAnd here's why this is important because with this vote right\nThere's a lot of let's say other party opposition because of the concerns let's just say with the midterms there's I was going to be a lot of pushback but that was interesting\nUh one of the um professors economic professors I've been studying for a while Theresa ... to do see I don't know that I've always ever pronounce her name appropriately um her question isn't an article this past week who benefits from the tax cut ten months later from tax cut one point out\nAnd she goes on to say ... regrettably the president's tweets turn out not to be true right with the economic expansion unemployment at an at a new record low gross domestic product better than it's been over ... basically a decade and perhaps that's why voters aren't so enthusiastic about the tax cut she says\nBecause she said there's really no definitive detail of proving\nThat this tax cut is actually doing anything well folk so low I mean look look around the only thing that's keeping us out of the dismal massive recession and I would argue to say we're in a recession we're just faking that recession out how long we can fix that recession out is anybody's guess right we've kind of kept this Bull Run going\nBecause Kennedy the trees that goes on to talk about that you know the claims of the president which I Would say are true has obviously continued to keep this bull market in check because again the buybacks right the corporations that cut their top tax rate from thirty five to Twenty one and now that looks to be\nA permanent as well as the tax reform bill\nFor the cutting the tax rates obviously for a lot of folks especially the folks that have strong income and have have strong savings\nHas actually created a false positive right because a lot of companies turned around and bought their own stock back which is giving this sense that the economy's going to just continue to roar and go positive in a bullish direction and many people are saying the market's going to come because being nine and a half years into this Bull Run\nNoble runs ever made a ten years\nAnd nobody knows right and I talked about last week on hid wealth radio the top concerns that boomers your friends and neighbors are sharing likely the same concerns you have are the the the uncertainty of the economy and how long this is going to go I talked to apply this week that said Chuck\nAh he calls it instead of Murphy's law his last name as the last thing you know as soon as I\nSense that things are good I can see the market going bad this is the client the last fifty percent twice between two thousand one two thousand two that was one or two and then again between two thousand eight and early two thousand nine and they said you know I Can't afford to do that and folks he's right you know this is the client\nA wife or his wife are in their mid to late sixties between the two of them and the reality is they don't have time to make up for another two thousand and eight or two thousand to two thousand and two market debacle\nAnd many people are predicting even the great Warren Buffett that there's not a matter of if it's a matter of when and when is unfortunately going to cause what some are even claiming to be the worst recession or the worst economic downturns in their lifetime and these are folks that are talking about this that are well respected on Wall street\nThat have been doing what they're they've been doing now for forty years\nFolks look here here's the importance of this point right and I and I think this is this is key the the top retirement solutions that others miss\nIs the tax peace now this is the tax piece impact us all heavens no it doesn't impact us all because a lot of people haven't ... due to this retirement crisis it's been proven with all the polls are a lot of people haven't saved appropriately\nFor retirement and they're going to be in big trouble we talked about the pyramid right the pyramid back in the day for a lot of us thinking about our parents or grandparents retirement\nWas very simple a a good solid foundation of that pyramid was our pension\nThan it was our Social Security and the little peek at the top of the pyramid was money that we could generate off of our savings well now you got to take that pyramid and in standard on it's on it's on its ear because now it's the opposite [noise] now we need the majority very little is coming from pensions\nAnd then of course Social Security is obviously been restricted with\nLow cost of living adjustments the threat of a being cut Twenty one percent within technically the next roughly Fifteen to Twenty years and the fact that most people went from a defined benefit pension paid by the employer to a ... defined contribution plan which is what I call the yo yo plan which stands for your on\nYour own right you eat what you kill what you put away is what you're going to get to draw from and that's what's causing a lot of people to not be able to retire or retire with a lifestyle that they had envisioned\nAnd it does is it doesn't have to be that way folks but the harsh reality is we're on our own for the majority of you listening and I know this by having a front row seat with baby boomers now for going on to a quarter century read twenty three to twenty four years we're in and have had a front row seat with boomers\nAnd have learned the very real things to prevent and boomers from having an optimal retirement and here here's what they are some of these are basic but we are going to get into the specifics number one even forks had a great article that said the number one thing that's preventing people from having the retirement that they could have is number one having a plan\nThat one seems pretty common sense right having a plan I\nAnd the reality is they're going to end up getting stuck paying more if they don't shift in time while the tax sale is in place\nAnd force goes on to say a having a plan we had a ... a couple of clients this week and said you know what we really like about the hidden well solution is that you find strategies in solutions that other people miss or we've never heard of\nBut what Ford's goes on to say is not only having a plan but implementing a plan\nBut also making sure it's a holistic planned no words that plan is obviously a plan that encompasses all things financial taxes inflation market upside without market downside we're seeing a lot of people fully exposed more than even realize they were exposed with a an assessment that shows them if the next oh wait hits\nOne client in particular we met with just this last week would lose forty six percent almost fifty cents of every dollar folks and that's assuming it's only as bad as a way some people are predicting the next crash will be worse than a weight\nNow that's not the fear martyr you but it's the wake you up because having a plan and then implementing a plan taken a step further they said the key piece to that third step is then in proving aunt pond the original plan in other words finding ways to continue to optimize it so what I Want to encourage you to do\nIs the mindset of having the importance of the investigation\nInto retirement optimization in other words really having the understanding of how all the different puzzle pieces fit together and can synchronize those orchestrate those where you're paying the lease legal amount of tax\nYou're protecting the greatest amount of what's going to support your lifestyle income and we've been talking about the the the pyramid problem\nAnd I'll make the simple you know back in the day when many of us listening our parents or grandparents retired think of a pyramid\nIn sync at the bottom of the pyramid being so you understand think of that being your the pensions that our parents and grandparents received\nThat was kind of the basis or the foundation of supporting someone throughout their retirement years than there were so security in the consistency of that Social Security and then that little point at the top of the pyramid that was just this supplemental kind of a portion of savings that the other two didn't make\nA U.S fully hole that we could count on because at that time banks actually paid interest and people didn't have to take unnecessary stock market risk well now you take that pyramid and flip it upside down and that's where it's what I call my books the yo yo plan your on\nYour own right no more defined benefits pensions now defined contribution pensions right so at the top where the pyramids no upside down right now we have the need of what we saved to produce the foundation to our retirement\nThen we've got a shrinking Social Security with lower cost of of living adjustments\nEighty five percent of our Social Security can be tax now and of course Social Security being bankrupt and having to make massive cuts here within the next foreseeable future years by around twenty twenty nine many people are predicting at least a Twenty one percent cut before even twenty thirty\nAnd the very bottom right of that pyramid is unfortunately the few people that have the next little to nothing of attention like our parents and grandparents had and folks that's what's creating dilemma so by getting a complete plan a holistic plant a plan that incorporates all the different facets\nBy having a plan implementing a plan and then optimizing the plan on an ongoing basis is hidden wealth helping people discover and uncovered they're hidden wealth I'll give you a couple of examples [noise]\nSee see very many clients are sharing the concerns like a shared last week to be two top boomer concerns so I'm Talking to those of you between the ages of sixty and Seventy five predominantly\nIn predominately those of you that have saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand or more towards retirement folks there's never been a more important time especially being nine and a half years into this Bull Run and noble runs ever made it ten years folks\nAnd because of this first tax cut some of these articles are saying all that went into his first tax cuts were for corporations to turn around and the tax corporate tax savings turn around and buy their own stock back\nFolks companies have been doing more stock buybacks and into the individual investors now for three or four or five years\nPuts artificially propped up this marketing folks this market that the party can't go on forever\nAnd eventually the party of tax cuts can't go on forever 'cause someone's gonna have to pay for the tax cuts and eventually companies aren't going to be be able to continue to buy back as much of their own stock to artificially propped up this market so the two biggest concerns is you can well imagine a very simple the uncertainty of the economy and when the ball runs gonna stop and when people are facing\nA downturn but they don't want any more of a downturn and they can stomach because they know they can't stomach one that's going to last them especially if you get those are you listening in your sixties\nAnd the the the known of what's predictable of higher taxes having to come to pay for all these tax cuts especially with two point oh tax cuts just passing the house\nI'm a big believer in tax cuts unfortunately with the government's not telling you is where they're going to go collect the need attacks from from these tax cuts and it's very simple it's going to come from you in the form of your IRA distributions with a higher tax rate because it's going to push you into a higher tax rate\nEventually as they change the tax rates\nIf especially if they're not made permanent which I think's a long shot end taxing your Social Security taxing more of your Medicare part B indie premiums called penalties\nAnd folks that doesn't have to be that way out to be teaching this Tuesday or I'm going to be teaching introduction of how to grow money without tax use it without tax and not leave the tax

let's talk about it\nThink of the American dream build a business have equity on something you know have a piece of it most people trade their time for many many of you driving down the road right now you have a salary or an hourly wage and if you don't go they stop paying your\nNew trade your time for money and successful people entrepreneurs people that become elite in life financially leach they

money's got employees you can't count on it's amazing and think about this think about if you could have the results of that business without the headaches and I'm not saying that trading in investing as a business without headaches what I'm saying is is imagine\nIf you get a business with no employees no overhead are very low overhead no liability insurance 'cause you're not dealing with people's property\nDon't have to worry about customers 'cause they're online you can literally post something and every time you want to sell something there'll be somebody to buy it every time you need to buy something if somebody wanted to sell it to you imagine if you didn't have to deal with worker's comp releasing a building or inventory housing was selling products are recruiting people think of that\nAnd imagine if you had no limit on the profitability in other words the cap was off you can make as much as possible that's the dream\nThat trading and investing seats of business and if you

think some Democrats do not think that this deal range psychological upset\nIs tied to them\nWell let me put it this way if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think\nThat conservatism is made up of deranged lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be so up to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it then the question becomes this\nWhen you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms and by the you

of it is I mean it's just so dead wrong in the simple recitation of the facts of all this that it stuns me\nThat people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and react to them they continue to react to what they think has gone on base\nAnd how they feel and these are some of the standard bearers of American journalism on the left\nOne of them is or isn't John Harris and political one of

this is pretty common to there are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side as\nA bunch of ...\nBut I don't know how anybody paying attention on the left can think that their side to a bunch of\n... but the fact that they do is fascinating to me now here's another such pace\nAnd we have said that this woman once before I don't remember specifically when her name is Alexis Grinnell

[noise]\nI Can't prove anything all I have to go on um\nExperience guided by intelligence and intelligence guided by experience an instinct I just I don't I everybody believes is blue way if it doesn't matter where you go every story that drudge for example links\nLinks to on his page is a story of the Democrats with a massive landslide retaking the house of representatives and there are stories where Republicans supposedly thinking the same thing is going to happen\nCertainly you you've talked to swamp dwellers you I mean you do hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast\nBig march you do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell what\nI Know what what what what ... well\nYeah I'd like to get an individual polls show nine

I'm always having to dial myself back um I\nI'm One of these people you probably are too I'm One of these people are thinking everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries if everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at America the way I Do nobody would ever stop us\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with reality this is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons have you heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour bill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump\nAction now I I'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party cried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not dumped me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly\nActed on concerned on interested in and would always say a variation of you\nCan't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies they're not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it's not that it not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said at every Trump rally\nPrivately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies\nTo her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows but seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds\nThey were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by them they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd be\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrump with his airplane perfectly placed so the Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it\nJoe Biden I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got\nTo be able to show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention\nAs

rush they're all expecting a blue wave what happens if they lose it well let me share with you a headline from political [noise] just just today political story ready for this\nPolitical race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ... there are now\nTwo hundred nine seats either family or leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believed\nThis okay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly or leaving Democrat I guess this is according to polling data two hundred and Eighteen is a number of seats unique in for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority\nSo\nTwo hundred nine seats firmly are leading Democrat I mean this if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nScientists and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have any insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans you know I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people in Washington and live and die by their stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an ounce of sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nIt can you tell me what it is anything one thing a series of things than\nAs American voters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans\nThat they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat so that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nation wide disgust with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump has a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since the election\nNight through thousands sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it is to vote against Republicans\nAll right well\nAs I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that kind\nOf discussed other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what he wants to it\nAll started when he said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and us you'll be or something and and\nUh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the FDU\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy is a rubber band of the first order and\nYou know officer you know\nOur government money is separating the two that are born or and I am having them\nAnd the cops we fought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch the civil that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country

was on Anderson Cooper twenty nine last night\nNow\nSally Quinn alleges that former Texas Senator John Powell that's how his name was his name was John Tower he was a short little guy five four pockmarked face acne greasy hair and this guy was apparently\n[noise] Don Juan running around the Senate just begging everybody they got a nice way this guy had more allegations I literally\nI remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend it while telling him he needed to resign one of them was um [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget his attempt saving the reputation of John\nTower I knew John Powell\nI think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was only\nBut I'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a ... folks by reputation cocoa get a picture\nTo guy put him on put him on Rush Limbaugh got caught I'll Try to find one here in the show you a little camera I mean we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n[noise]\nBut anyway Sally Quinn says that John Tower\nOnce assaulted her but she didn't come forward and here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John tower basically tried to sexually assault you in the back of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in senator you don't drive around on yellow cabs\n[noise] you have a car service a limo and drivers right well anyway she starts to happen in a cab\nThat John Tower tried to sexually assault during the back of the ... you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was they nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out\nBut Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything\nDrag now where did this nightclub and ordered brandy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and rat out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me and basically tried to assault and the and the poor cab driver was desperate because I was screaming and pounding Adam senator a stop and\nI was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father with fish and he was in general and the army at the time and a cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the carbon centers screech to a halt in front of our corners and I think that in power and got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shot in God\nBut I went in the house at night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never tell my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn or assaulted by John Tower um but but you know she doesn't want to hear yeah there's one more by we got Times Square here here's another reason why number forty three\nAnd I think about it I thought I'm so glad I didn't do it because I could have been Anita Hill\nAnd Anita Hill's life has been completely ruined destroyed it had been going to

democratic presidential candidates for decades now\nThe white vote has only then won twice didn't last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being made us was not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and the swerved in to a truth\n\nExcept for of a very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in the Democratic party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left as as as started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged in\nSo that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three through Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to seat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy arriving\nImmigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate\nThem all well Nineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course led to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they can only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm poor of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters\nWhat they had to do was change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night and the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christie on 'em and pour it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution look to the apps\nThat judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton and the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and um you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal ...\nThe steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture laws and reality today is because Democrats activist judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most startling example of\nThis but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ... P. S.\nNot by you in fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n... did you see any way even a conservative state of college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each\nOther Hillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned to civility Christian I'm poor\nListening to one another working on our differences but that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again\nMiss characterizing that blue in the face\nThat's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule\nAnd she knows it but the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of this is\nThat Hillary Clinton says it's it's a time for instability in is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice cannot believe a Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urged Democrats to be even more uncivil\nWhat an irresponsible statement every Democrats should denounced they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage ruined by applauded they support it that is who they are\nThis is the party by the way that has been railing against all this and civility for I don't know how long this is why [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know what happens but it's it's a mystery to me and my hope is my faith is that this incivility this insanity this on the hinge Democrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh effect\nPro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that that's real if you want to believe polling data but we're never going to get a poll\nOf people who this approve of Democrat Party tactics and techniques that poll is never going to be run and if they did if somebody on the left didn't run that poll and the results came
