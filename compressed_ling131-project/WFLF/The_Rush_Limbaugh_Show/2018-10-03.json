the ... have you ever hear Rush Limbaugh doing you know what I was born to do\nThose things when I was listening to radio talk show in the country and there's a big [laughter]\nLack of a reveal in the New York times tax story on Trump\n\nThe New York times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where they got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody up the IRS doesn't care I mean the left as infiltrated everything's so obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has um that that but they've had them now for a year and note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to make me wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we got Trump out there they claim is mocking balding forty wasn't marketing or walk I\nI understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is all they don't know why president that\nHe did it for some reason everybody's pointing out that the Trump just ...\nWe were saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to\nBefore all this is a investigated and put it but you can't run out there and start ripping on her even if it's desert even if it's warranted last week you could not read up on Christine balls before there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying there were teeth and you can demonstrate all last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus\nI find a compelling I find her very\nCredible will now she's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed them out all Trump did is playing out the flaws in her story which should have happened during the hearing\nLast Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't\nSmart [laughter] specially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her whether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing\nCommittee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tests that they weren't not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's the only did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's Kevin uncovered Trump writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't\nStep and it it might look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me as this one year the New York times has been investigating the trumps for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often just say no that's not the word what one word is\nNot in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint it was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia ah ten for bad yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump colluded because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and then not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump was it Tony Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nActually or whatever or something somebody and James borrow things mostly are too young to remember\nBottom line and I know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people as audiences don't remember the Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all John's\nYou never know what you gotta do when you're grabbing got about ... what'd you do to come up with you what you know you're going to come up with the women like New Hampshire not great but it's not a\nBill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience to know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall [noise]\nNo I have a transcript and anti Kavanaugh protester was confronted I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been allowed to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back\nHe asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there said it didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there her best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it protester so you're okay as a doctor to harm us\nWoman Cassidy wait a second are you OK as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life if you destroy your life your son's life or your husband's wages to answer that question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated would you like that\nProtester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy push back but it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCastle you know no would you like and on corroborated charge destroyed I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestor\nOh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up Cassidy you know it's unfair protests I Would fight and I would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court castle you know I'm not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protested no there is evidence looking at a standard how many people are in jail for west\nSo what does this unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I I've told the story when I was first at this very\nYoung wet behind me years naive and the media would want to talk I thought there too they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taken off I thought they were legitimately curious\nAnd that's how I went into early interviews I found out that's not an all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you\nCan't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically and that's happening\nThat somebody has to have to say you should probably try being met for\nHills that goes with George neurons light one\nNews radio not everyone\n...

Democrats announced her and stayed at her to be credible\nShe's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge or she is the accuser so the Republicans they've they they they played ride along and without ahead Rachel Mitchell ask personal questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time we were all kind of curious to know what what's the purpose was um\nAll Trump is still is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really goes wrong in this

with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements\nInto what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially when he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and I have taught people how to beat them we have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything it's\nWhy I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there had been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that Trump\nWill tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... the ... the ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at at\nThe moon to the right to oh so he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what he thinks really\nThinks if the pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a ...\nThat after he makes an initial statement on something if he can make fun of things\nAnd what really irritates ... he gets away with it that cannot tell us how if he ever teach them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you how ... insane it has made the with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off Trump hasn't been attacked\nSo much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much\nHe doesn't care anymore it doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski and Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible we thought was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress\nVideo audio we played mocked both before Trump didn't\nThey just simply pushy she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation from what she said why you're not relevant why does that not matter why have we\nGotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accusing any man of anything and it's gospel and\nBe joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined that can you imagine if there was something\nIt can you imagine if men organized for the express purpose\nOf destroying women you can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell\nRush or a million women or nor do the research we well yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not\nAbout even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political move but I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed and made fun of the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers but it's so out of balance all Trump\nDid was say what everybody following vis knows even the Democrats are Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nThe Trump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many

weekdays knew until three volumes radio Ninety three point one [noise]\nBreathing so walking back Rush Limbaugh but he I mean I'd work books to your ear is the there's the James with them to the gym and guarantee quotes\nFrom a National Review um the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for bad description for years I have no problem admitting\nThat I was unable to put this together as one of the\nRare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the written benches actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something could\nBe made to pay a price for it that's what the ... this this um [noise] well the me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nThere's a and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the um [noise] Occupy Wall street movement to look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to do that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether\nBoys\nWant to pretend to be girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nSick it ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating movement that has been constructed to push\nAll of these disparate various agendas and the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand\nIn for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth\nOr not it doesn't matter because it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard rather than just deal with the specific incidents have happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white ... every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this [noise] the Democrat Party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat Party is happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it\nAnd they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders the White House press briefing is going on and she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply resign did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats there are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n[noise] we have a survivor community now\n[noise]\nA survivor of men community now son CNN\nAnd here it is they ... they didn't even ... Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target of attacks from Trump the target of attention from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target\nOf attacks from Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all\nAbout do you think that maybe the birds we shouldn't have done the marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd man by the way they bowed horrible you'd think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was dating facts that were given during Dr Ford testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold a position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right young cat challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have a gun adds to do it Trump did it in yeah he's provide no little stray and for some of these people hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done a Dutch outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ab ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever among glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a right to have your back yeah it's\nTo be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into a girl but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them or coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN ... like a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped her because he asked her for her phone number [noise] can't believe any of them and I think\nWhat this this whole me to get away ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe\nShe thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it\nBut it's relevant capturing McCann and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the oral sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time from\nThat the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her she may literally believe that men don't have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her that's my\nPoint she may really believed it\nGoes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um [noise] um you're right sex without consequences it but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the ... hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine you\nKnow the hook up at a ride by the way here's this ... you're also random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include women women on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement against their will it's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media\nOr making I think I Am from you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman a but you've got to be real careful about it just gets

and I think Christine balls the Ford is an\nElement of that whole movement or that\nWhole desire the Democrat Party is in on it they are as much a part of a deep state as the FBI ideal Jay people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specific maybe I look I think she's an activist and then on it but that's neither here nor there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination\nOr to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't fair\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin I Would not sit there and let his life to be destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there and let\nHis nominee me be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they thought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been so now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christie and Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story and the media is all over the place now saying well you know\nThere's just many screwed it Murkowski and Collins they both think that Trump was a horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay\nWell ladies and gentleman I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but they're no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heap being ... reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate not a blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll taken after the Democrats\nBegan smearing Kavanaugh but before that committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer the Republican opponent the high camp has opened the ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana is similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that

cat what's actually for Donnell a McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping that Collins caves that maybe even McConnell what came and the Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states they're held to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed [noise] in fact in North Dakota voters back\nKavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\nBut if they if if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\n\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford and I want to share something with your wife found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line writes that a reader of theirs\nNoted\nThe changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself\nPresented\nThe power and wind reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic he created a chart in essence based on public

not even consistent with the ... so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story change correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second\nHis question why the sudden change within a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat orbits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\nSalt the charge here and try not try to serve a difficult to convey but this is a text charge\nThere is some ah some bars in this thing but it isn't titled Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\nIn the therapist notes the incident is said to have occurred in the mid ... Nineteen eighties the when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapist notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties\nIn her
