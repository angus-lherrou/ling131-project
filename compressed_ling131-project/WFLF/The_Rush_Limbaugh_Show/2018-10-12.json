play ballet [noise]\nLand sank [noise]\nI'll talk to you later per se [noise]\nTo the program glad you're back I'm just talking to Steve off the air is fascinating is they're really really really a fascinating and he's one of those guys to his you know really walked through the fire for his principal um and uh I I that's something I really respect\nI really like what he says about Donald Trump Donald Trump south problem\nNot just days of reflection of of us and he's reflecting that part of us that says get him when he's really he's really done his homework on on Donald Trump in and and how bright he is on reflecting the people and it really when you look at\nHow Donald Trump is reflecting a the ... will\nIt really shows how wrong the Democrats the the democratic leadership really is they're just they're off the deep\nEnd I think I much I don't know if I mention this off the air but there's a story in the New York times today isn't the headline in the New York times Michelle Obama wanted Democrats to go high now they aren't so sure\nAnd it goes through the Eric Holder a quote or when they go low we kick the Michael ... when they go a low Isay hit back harder um Hillary Clinton a you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for 'em when we when that's when civility concert again\nUm there was another ... a Joe Biden if I were in high school I take 'em behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\nI mean this is as they sit there in the new democratic ... what's the difference\nBetween that and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him\nBack twice as hard well I mean I I you know that the ... this what they're saying they are trying to pose as Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're certainly not selling themselves at the new Donald Trump's mhm they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm so I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who is the only one that I saw out of all of the Democrats who came out and said holder comments were bad\nThat's her phrase that was being criticized rain but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that is complete lip service they Obama administration played lip service just civility paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip service to ...\nWhat made them almost unbeatable for the average\nPerson right they they won twice based on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nose as any other Democrat justice hard nose they at least\nTried to hide it\nThis switch is now overt we're harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said there's no it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic part and it's amazing\nHow they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders\nBecause they're all emulating Malcolm X they are not\nEmulating Martin Luther king yeah that was really the the the that was his deal mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung back and that ... that they would have followed Malcolm X\nThings might have been worse for ... for a for blacks for a while\nI mean you're back very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean\nPeople want\nThey don't want to think of themselves as no you know animals harassing innocent people in a restaurant I mean that's not something that anyone wants to ... you want to associate yourself with those people right and you know you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who who go down these roads\n... you know the all right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the alt right generally speaking\nIs either they're horrible horrible and the people in a totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist\nRight like there's very few people were like you know what the All right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know and I don't know not to get a bit Steve Bannon was the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really\nOutside of Steve Bannon you've seen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like who wants to I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right it's just a normal human instinct\nAnd that's not even Nazis that's all right really nobody even knows what All right is I mean the average person\nThey just see them as people who are going out in the streets and you know a beating people up or torturing people or or marching against you know Jews and blacks and everything else and you're like I don't want to be part of that I just don't want to write a ugly I don't want\nThat I'll be ... there was an actual death in Charlottesville right and I and everyone would say that that is horrific um but you know there was also over there right like we're just marching around with torches and saying horrible things do you want to be associated with any of them well no\nBut the left also there was ... the shooting of of our of our congressmen a year ago and it's like it never even happened\nNobody the guy who was arrested this weekend the I think it was CBS that was reporting this he was arrested because he had built a two hundred pound bomb and who's going to blow himself up on election day they didn't even report that he was a leftist\nThey just won't recognize it uh and you know who on the left\nStanding up against that\nWho's standing up and going oh we don't want to be you know that's not us we don't want to be a part of that they just denied that it ever happened\nAnd it gives them disability just

I hate ...\nOkay so\nThe point is this guy doesn't even when he's talking but he goes to the next day they basically figured oh Rush Limbaugh does believe in climate change do people were more than just rank amateur on professionalism but the reason I played this is ...\nNot not to mention this guy because while this guy is jumping all in\nMy Shelley listen to this story this is from the federalist papers liberal professor says hurricane victims deserve to what thank God because they support Republicans now do you think these clowns in\nBoston with zero in on something genuinely get range like this no they're going to make up the fact that a bunch of people like me who know the climate change and man made climate change is a hoax are somehow responsible for people having lost everything including risking their lives\nDoes University of St Thomas engineering\nSchool in Minnesota thermal and fluids sciences professor Dr John Abraham he's a professor actually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a catastrophic hurricane because they elected climate deniers\nHere's the headline in an article written by this\nGuy was published in the guardian not some obscure little rag or penny saver this was published in the guardian\nOn Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we are reaping what we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it\nThis is the logic my reasoning that he is teaching any engineering school a guy is still range this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states who voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans and his name\nIs Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham\nBlames Michael's intensity on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricane to ever hit the panhandle\n\nYet he blames the intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claimed that southern voters brought this upon themselves\nBy voting Republicans into office\nIt's a wonder that a state like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio and his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office that more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction others op so this clown\nWho is disguised as a as a an engineering professor literally is saying that if you want to stop\nDestructive hurricanes striking where you live vote Democrat he literally this one is what he said in an unrelated story a bunch of which is somewhere are putting a tax on Brett Kavanaugh this week it I'm not making that up\nAnd they are disguised as Democratic Party activists are hacks on Capitol I I I don't know what the nature of the Higgs is\n\nI mean this [laughter] if it if it weren't so irresponsible it would be funny meanwhile you have the entire left now attempting to destroy Kanye West\nAnd what\nKanye West Dan is simply venture off the liberal Democrats plantation that is a no no if you're African American you venture off the Democrat plantation they are going to destroy your meanwhile idiots like this professor\nA professor of engineering literally tells people that if you want to stop hurricanes\nFrom blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you know do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking there were people\nIn the leftist medium who literally weren't trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana\nHe wanted it specifically the strike New Orleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas\nWhere as Democrats they wouldn't be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if you can get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and so there are people out there saying that Bush actually wanted the hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents would\nHave to leave would have to go to Houston there were\nSome even saying that Bush was doing what he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service\nTo downplay the warnings well I didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead mentioned there were some that are now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out there talking on a tax on the Internet Hoover claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane\nRemember that\nThat Bush was steering that hurricane Bush himself the president was fearing the hurry and and what this guy is professor at the University of St Thomas is no different by claiming that simply the way people vote determines where a hurricane\nGoes how stronger hurricanes going to be and whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't know\nYeah it's the redneck Riviera and yeah traditionally in the panhandle of Florida blow both Republican but he doesn't know there might have been some democratic voters got wiped out the odds are there were\nBecause so many people didn't get wiped out you know we we we look at these events are these people do as one wants to political events some of these people who have been wiped out you you look at that devastation and you say how are they ever gonna come back\nThey didn't have much to begin with\nIt's just some of these photos that you see from that area do look like they have been leveled with explosives\nOr it is it's just heartbreaking to see what happens and the only upside as it was not\nYou know I'd densely populated area but that doesn't change\nThe impact on the people who live there ... there were some who didn't they evacuated and they made up their minds themselves maybe a found them talk to them they want to stay they wanted to hang in they wanted to see what it was all like every hurricane has\nThose people who are hell bent they either want to protect the homestead or they're curious to hear how devastating and how big it how rock as the storm storms are they want to see it and they roll the dice thinking that they'll survive it or what have you\n[noise] takes all kinds of people but this when I when I saw this today I thought it had to make sure this is not you know some satire sight and it isn't\nClimate deniers making these storms worse by stopping action on climate change so see if we hadn't just not gotten out of the Paris climate accord and if if Trump would stop ... stop making fun\nShow archives at Rush Limbaugh dot com and we have every climate change story I'm disgusted including those which say\nIt's too late there's nothing we can do now\nAnd there were two or three of those stories within the last ten to Fifteen Years so why now are we getting getting we've only got ten years to fix it for minimum\nFourth time in Thirty years that I Know and this is the UN's this ... they alone may have given us ten year warnings three times and you add in Al Gore in ... dancing and all the other disparate\nKooky environmental groups and the numbers of people in times warning us really at ten years couldn't be more than we can count\n\nThe reason they're doing it is because they realize there's always gonna be a group of news consumers that have never heard it\nThe left recycles all of their greatest hits it's like\nThe Clarence Thomas Anita Hill hearings HBO made sure to do a movie about it that ran just last year or the year before I forget which\nThat all happened back in Nineteen Ninety\nBut twenty eight years ago so that's a whole generation that's grown up and had no idea about it so the left has to do a movie to let the current generation no how outrageous and isn't it interesting the timing short years after just a few short months after the HBO movie on Clarence Thomas Anita Hill here comes Dr balls e Ford\nWith Brett Kavanaugh they leave nothing to chance they control the media and they plant things and then they revive for them to make sure that a new groups of people audiences based on generations and maturity always get the leftist propaganda on\nEvery particular issue that's why they recycle the ten year morning [noise]\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you the loan them you write for\nCall today and let's get started\nThat's right and ... friday\nOr whatever you want to talk about the folks have added that the ah the rule it's not that way Monday through Thursday you might not hear any difference has a list of\nBetween friday and then the other day but there is in terms of how we screened a program not Victoria Bissell brown

grandchildren yelled something that ridiculous I'd have to stifle all\nLaugh my husband at fifty years did not have to stifle the laugh heats up dead serious like I don't have I doubt that he did [noise] I don't think this guy is probably ever last with his wife in fifty\nYears [noise] but that's just me speculating let me continue my husband\nDid not defend his remarks he did not defend the men he sat hunched and hurt and he listened to me\nFor a moment it occurred to me to be grateful that I married to a man who will listen to a woman\nThe wins calmed ever so slightly in that moment

I have never heard of Paolo Alto university so I began to dig deep\nWhat is Paolo Alto university\nWhat do they do there\nAnd the short version of the story is it is a place run by women\n\nThey count themselves as a school that prepares women to become experts in psychology their website\nCouch saw the wonderful things they can do for women and Seventy three percent of the faculty the students whatever are women never on their website is there a mention of seeking men about psychology so I concluded that this is a haven for women\n\nNow this this this professor here from uh ... university Victoria missile\n\nYeah I I I Know women my age who grew up with the Gloria Steinem ms magazine Betty for Dan version of militant feminism\n\nAnd back then it was basically about equal pay for equal work and not getting married and not letting demand defined your happiness a relationship a marriage or what have you\n[noise] but where do these women come up with ... where do they get to have I have a theory that it has to be it has to derive from the fact that a lot of its media I this\nParticular woman published in the Washington Post\nProbably listen to NPR religiously probably read the New York times religiously probably watches CNN religiously\nAnd as a professor at a university\nThey are surrounded she is surrounded by other like\nMinded women\nThey feed on each other's bad experiences with men they retail and retail story after story after story\nAnd it's kind of like all Kanye West said yesterday Kanye West said that\nIn groups of people were there isn't any male energy people are going to go nuts after awhile\nKanye West noted philosopher an Oval Office visitor made that point yesterday and I think that's where this comes from I think hanging around with with the other angry politicized leftist women whatever anger there is gets\nRetold retold and it becomes more and more intense and the raid to this woman does not hide the abject range the almost on contained a bull anger even for her husband who she admits it's perfection\n\nIs is the reason why this is Rob this is the American left folks this is the Democrat Party this is the group of people that thinks Hillary Clinton as the Hillary is one of these women\nHillary Clinton is exactly one of these women\nRunning around filled with rage on controllable rage hatred an anger that is compressed and intensifying each and every day\nAnd I'm telling you no matter what the drive by just think it's not infectious it does not make you want to join the team\nIt makes you think that these people are nuts\nIt's that far out of the mainstream yet to them it is the main stream\nAnd\nThis is not going to step well this is not a good day for me to move but actually happened yesterday in New York judge drops sexual assault charge against Harvey Weinstein\nNow we're not hearing much about this shocking way because Kanye West is eating up all the oxygen in the news bubble\n\nMovie mogul Harvey Wang's team has won last count a sexual assault being brought against him before\nAll begins according to the Daily Beast\nOn Thursday morning a judge dismissed one of six criminal counts brought against the disgraced mogul by the Manhattan da ... or ...

relief from Trump anxiety disorder ...\nI I don't believe this for a minute I think this may be the case in Washington it certainly will be the case in the Upper West side and probably in a lot of Hollywood but nationwide people are not seeing shrinks to deal with Trump anxiety disorder\nBut yet this guy these two people think well all of America is if it's happening in Washington or New York

of plenty Seventeen study found that two thirds of Americans the the nation's future\nAs a very or somewhat significant source\nOf stress\nOr more plausible interpretation for all of this in the view of some psychological experts is that Trump has been cultivating adapting and prospering from his distinctive brand of provocation brinksmanship and self drama\nFor the past Seventy two years what we're seeing is merely the president's own definition of normal it's only the audience who finds their performance disorienting imminent words Trump's not crazy but the rest of us are getting their fast\n[noise]\nAnd people are going to psychiatry and paying money to be told this we tone Trump is driving them crazy he literally is\nCausing and they'll lose their sanity you thought I'd been

[noise]\nThe ABC exclusive event don't miss it tonight at ten nine central on ABC\nAnd the ad council\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nBy the\nWay it folks I I've got two more stories that focus on the insanity of the left I mean I'm not using the term loosely [noise] here's another one's Susan Glasser staff writer at the New Yorker she writes a weekly column on life in Trump's Washington\nShe writes a weekly column on life in Washington in Trump's why what life in Washington has become because the Trump once a week [noise]\n[noise] this piece the headline I listen to all six Trump rallies\nIn October and you should to some had it's not a reality show it's real it's a long piece but do not misunderstand\nThis lady Susan B. Glasser listed in didn't watched six Trump rallies\nAnd she is up set that they're only on CSPAN she's mad that Fox has stopped covering them that CNN is stop covering them that pie MSNBC uh stopped covering them because she thinks they are damaging to Trump\nShe thinks if the people of this country's solve these rallies that it would be the end of Trump She points out how Trump lies all the time how Trump exaggerates all the time she\nTotally miss understands the purpose of the rally she does not exactly yes I predict that she does not get the connection or the bond between Trump attendees after rallies Trump supporters and Trump\nShe totally does not get this\nShe does not know how to listen to the Trump She does not know how to uh empathize with Trump rally attendees she has no\nAbility\nTo relate to Trump has his supporters do she watches these things and she is appalled at Trump personally politically he lives all the time\nHe ... he reminds people he makes fun of people he's mean meanwhile\nPeople at these rallies or having the best time of their lives it's the highlight of their week to go to a Trump rally and this woman is studying and\nShe's watching six of them so far this month and totally does not get it\nShe is missing the purpose of the rallies she does not see that this is Trump's mechanism for getting past the media she does not see that this is how Trump negates and goes over the drive by me something Reagan also a master\n\nTheir masterful they are formulaic even though everybody thinks they're improv\nAnd off script they are formulaic there are segments in every Trump rally and he follows them to achieve what he says differs in some cases but the point is here's a drive by media specialist studying and totally doesn't get it\nIt's the exact opposite if these rallies were televised nationally\nAs they used to be there wouldn't be any talk of a blue wave anywhere except New York and California\nRush Limbaugh America views the bombing I be worth your smart speaker\nThe plain news radio not green\nPoint on WFL I\nMy friends like you I Am thankful every day for the brave men and women are protect our freedom and our country now is Veterans Day approaches I Want to announce that my friends at Mahendra are holding their fifth annual military salute give away\nThe winner will receive a hindrance retriever utility vehicles that's right a brand new read my Hendra retriever one thousand gas model\nLast year's winner army captain Robert forty of Ohio is loving here's my handwritten you could be next\nTo nominate somebody who is active duty or a veteran of the U.S military and to get official rules\nIs it Rush Limbaugh dot com and look for the Mahendra military salute give away\nThanks to my hindered the makers of the toughest utility vehicles on earth and God Bless all of you who protect our freedom\nTake advantage of rock bottom prices and test drive a hindrance today at cops triangle tractor in used is or visit cobs tractor dot com that's cobs\nFrustrated at what she doesn't even know Stephen Miller she is just been told a bunch of stuff about it but maybe what he's doing now [noise] so I I don't know what the big deal is saying he ate glue um [noise] ... [noise] but she put it up and of course the media randomly\nBut and they've had to withdraw it because she had to withdraw because it wasn't true and it it's fairly common that these people on the left\nEngage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump or ... or it's\nThe Democrats and blue wave is drying up oh that's not to be a disappointment\nDon't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly govern the twenty eighth team mid terms\nStill point to a good a great night for Democrats they are the out party and the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely he'll Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten of Republican numbers around now\nYet yet and we\nPointed out that all of these national generic polls show this gigantic wave what if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way if you don't see the evidence in the polling\nAnd people have been asking how can this how can this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots that shows that Democrats plus ... plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must mean the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslims is\nHow could it generic ballot the lemon name on it by this time when you start pulling people a month three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote\nWithout a name and the question what do you think the result is going to be a\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning\nThe ... and the Senate that would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole day every other seat that they have they held\nBy incumbents that at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up\nOne of their seats so [noise] it's and it goes state by state to show her and this is all happening and then the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut [noise]\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hopes that this is a\nTraditional here party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls would say that's exactly what's going to happen but then you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see won a close race is something that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight and he probably has opened in some cities all running in certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's\nBiggest serial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wants to the murder of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that climate guys know\nWas the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion\nThought of and categorized as\nSomething other than what it is the media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much\nThere have been a lot of people who did and covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the end Morsi an hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred\nAnd sixty different articles so that trend has been how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in movie\nEquals Hollywood how'd he get stars that again people start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get it distributed it how do you find theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine\nBut they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula it doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie\nHas a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of\nHardly any abhorrent\nGore and violence in the movie it's it's ... picked him in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie in a responsible way\nTo do things that movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe inform it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but it is\nExceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murderer\nHe was a mass murderer of people in the room\nThat nobody on the left wanted anybody to know about\nWhat he did ... guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh even and this trial it was said that he was charming people now are old buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie of target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so the way I looked at it I didn't\nI didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course\nThe left abortion is not even human and some Bible tissue mass or what have you ah it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is dean Cain is one\nOf the ah the actor who plays a gazelle himself as a as an actor in\nThis is what the American media is now [noise]\nBeginning district you know this is just a tweet from a Yahoo guy holding cough but this don't be surprised\nIf this starts blowing up [noise]\nFrom this point forward right now [noise]\n[noise] [noise] then again those satisfaction of stone Nineteen sixty five before we got back to the phones one quick\nThing there's an NBC opinion piece that uh has appeared in opposition to the guys know movie\nAnd here's the headline with his face legal abortion is vilified by the pro life cause no movie which inadvertently shows the dystopia of a post row America so whereas we have a bunch of journalists\nTrying to blame Donald Trump\nFor inspiring Mohammed bin ... to murder a sort of a Saudi journalist\n[noise] now we have this NBC piece which is basically saying that what this movie is in\nBerkeley showing is what will happen if abortion ever becomes illegal guys like God's noble springing up everywhere\n\nThat God's now could not have be calm the mass murderer he became\n\nIf abortion would have been illegal which is a crock he did his monitoring\nAfter abortion to become legal [noise] but they're trying to say everybody you know you better you better not get what you wish for here because if you ever if you ever get abortion and we have a real versus Wade overturned you're going to have\nPeople like guys know popping up left and right which misses the entire point of this movie\nBut that's not a surprise at opponents would try to miss Kass what's going on with this tweet saying\nThat the crown prince may have felt embolden by Trump's anti media rhetoric to murder a journalist [noise] see how that happens in this country right we have a history of murdering journalist Donald Trump got it was the first was the first hurdle is the Trump a quarter to be killed Kevin tell me [noise]\nIrresponsible jackass is okay head back to the phones to Jim in Jupiter, Florida right up the road great to have you with us or high\n... Rashad that down in Miami last week driving up work I pass by what is to be the ground breaking up the largest mall in the United states and it got me to thinking\nI said to myself this is off plus he underwater two years ago it was off posted the underwear all of Miami a it was based on a two thousand and seven Nobel Prize winning award winner Albert Gore predicted it full of Miami to demand they global warming\nThe rising sea level twenty feet which would be underwater and I just got to think well you know he's not good at predicting the future maybe you can explain the past or someone please explain how about twenty thousand you know\nThis is really a great point and you're you're you're making a really great point here and and because it you're right on the money Al Gore had said\nJust in general that current shorelines and he has he has mentioned Miami in South Florida in Manhattan he has predicted when they are going to succumb to rising sea levels will be underwater and he did say about Miami\nThat it was only a few short years at Miami certain parts of it would be inundated by rising sea levels and one of the places where he said so they are breaking ground on one of the biggest malls in the country do you have to ask yourself\nWho in their right mind would go out and get the financing and make all\nOf the decisions that hire all the architect everything else has to be done to build a gigantic mall only to realize it's going to be submerged underwater in a few years\nWho would do this what kind of response smoke planning commission would permitted what kind of developer would waste is money the point is nobody really believes that word is mall is being built is going to be inundated by rising sea levels anytime soon\nThere's a there's another analogy that this ... Gulf Stream\nWhich is a manufacturer of one of the largest most popular corporate aircraft in America the gulfstream series there's the G. five fifty or ... about forty five ... four ... four fifty\nOr when they announced they were going to build the G six fifty\nThe G six fifty is ah like a foot wide or a little bit taller um has a massive range days of the art interior\nAnd they announced this at a time where the media was telling us that we were on the verge of running out of fossil fuels and that the supply of fossil fuels was finite\nAnd we were gonna have to do something real fast because we're losing fossil you'd have to start serving and fossil fuels it's a good thing anyway because they caused climate change and so forth and I asked myself why would Gulf Stream I happen to know the c._e._o. at the time\nI said why are you guys doing this if you how you're going to power this jet how are you ... if there isn't going to be any kerosene refined which is jet fuel ... if you're not going to have enough jet fuel for anybody who buys this plane to fly it why are you going to make it\nSo well what you're hearing isn't true", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "12"}
