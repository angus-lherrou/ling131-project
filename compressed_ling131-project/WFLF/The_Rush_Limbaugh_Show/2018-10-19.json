problems that because the Saudis\nAre too close to the United states\nThe Saudis are the number one buyers of American weapons number one they spend more money by young American arms than any other nation\nThat might surprise you but it happens to be true the Saudis have also become recent allies with us and Israel against Iran\nNow don't laugh at this maybe go back and look at Iraq Hussein oh who the drive by the media loves\nWell Obama loves the Iran and to Obama paying Iran one point eight billion dollars in power loaded cash Obama signed a nuclear deal with Iran was\nEssentially a pathway for them to achieve nuclear weapons Trump has since torn met up that ticked off that's that's another rewind of an Obama policy\nSo if Obama loved Iran or thought it was okay at least to have an allied relationship with them or less adversarial then so just the drive by media\nBut\nNone of this about ... is designed to ... not not intended they deserve to die don't misunderstand this just folks were were were between a rock and a hard place here every day we're faced with a challenge to the media picks a story that is their number one story and its purpose is very clear damage\nDestroy whatever as much as they can Donald Trump we have to defend is at least I think this this is my reaction to all of this\nI don't want 'em taken Trump out I don't want them damaging Trump I don't want any of this to happen\nThis is all bogus I Want the trajectory this country is on to remain I Want us to remain on that trajectory I Want to beat back\nThe insanity Emmy abnormality and the

does I Can't I got an email from a friend of mine last night who just beside himself over the fact that Republicans might lose the house he is convinced this guy's a former New York liberal by the way\nHe reformed about Twenty years ago he can't he can't he's having trouble dealing with the possibility that the Democrats might win the house he's having trouble dealing with the fact that a majority American people might want that\nI can understand I agree with him completely doesn't make any sense of Democratic Party doesn't deserve to be winning anything just on the basis of the way they can portray themselves and link Kavanaugh's situation but that's just the latest the Democratic party has become the home of the mentally unstable\nWho have used the political system to fix whatever\nProblems they have the or their grievances that they think they have it all revolves around the age old argument of the purpose of government\nIt really is used to take all of this that's happening domestically and when you're synthesize it now when you boil it all down to its essence it's about the role of government\nAnd it's about the fact that the Democrats do not want to promote self reliance they don't want to promote rug in individual lives and they don't want to promote people dealing with life\nFixing situations dealing in facing adversity and overcoming it becoming better people they want people to remain inept incompetent dependence grown up in a mass thinking the government is the solution and the solution is not really a solution\nThe solution that the Democrat voters want is punishment for people they think are responsible for the misery of marijuana is why when we want that\nTo try amp\nWhat we don't but in the in the in the mission to bring that about here comes this ... story and as far as the drive by shooting concerned it's an open an opportunity to blast theme Trump\nTo damage Trump the ultimate aim is to get Trump to cave in a band in Saudi Arabia\nNot it and it's not that the drive by have anything on that Saudi Arabia is just to get Trump the cave period just just just to prove that they can manipulate intimidate Trump\nInto

I'm Sorry to interrupt you serve but if I may quickly I became a Pittsburgh Steeler fan December twenty third Nineteen Seventy two which was the immaculate reception and I've listened to you since Nineteen Ninety One but I don't recall ever you know and I'm sure you have but I was curious about uh the initial way that you became\nI moved to Pittsburg I left home my first job away from home was when I was twenty\nNineteen Seventy one I moved to Pittsburg Jesse of a suburban station called McKee's port\nAnd I work there for a year and a half and then went to a an ABC owned and operated station in Pittsburgh when I got to Pittsburgh it's Twenty years old and\nThe closest football team to ride growing up was the St Louis cardinals and they they were very rare [laughter] I really I I was a baseball fan not I like football watched it nominate but was not really into it but I got caught up\nAs a as a resident of Pittsburgh when that dynasty was warming I got caught up in it and I was there\nNineteen Seventy five and I just got I I like everybody in that pets are amazing to me that's where I first involved the\nTheory of how the performance of a sports team can have so much impact on the self esteem of the population of a city\nThe lawyers own that city well they did even before they were they were lovable mumble urged but then when the super bowl years came it hasn't it hasn't dropped off it hasn't it hasn't evaporated or if it's if there's a credible I got caught up in it and that's why I became a Steelers fan\nAnd in retrospect I think that the writers of Nineteen Seventy two a bad some level of characters and some crazy players but to me there that they were the policy back then and the Steelers were the Trump as soon as Franco made that catch out there wasn't\nEnough polo see about the rate is the\nRaiders were man sized Kleenex\n[laughter]\nLet me tell you something for people who do this or\nThat this is obviously true\nPeople who have come of age or that if you're watching the the NFL of today in the past ten years if you weren't alive or old enough in the sixties and seventies and even the the early part of the eighties\nWatching the NFL you would think the game today\nIn many ways not all but in many ways has become Ropper room compared to the way\nI'll give you an example I got very\nLittle time here but there's a lot going controversy between the Cincinnati Bengals in the Pittsburgh Steelers the Bengals have is linebacker number fifty five ... perfect to purposely try standard people\nAnd he purposely tried to injure number eighty four Antonio Brown again last Sunday for arms to their helmets should have been suspended but wasn't as leagues tired as suspending him\nWell after that\nAfter a bad place shortly after rap was burgers says he's going to get under center and birth ... points lumber Nineteen ju ju Smith ... says your next\nDoesn't surprise you at all does it not not not when the media is promoting better ... as middle name Kennedy\nThey're promoting his good looks they're promoting the woman ... thing that promote well I mean if you're going to promote Kennedy you got to promote it all\nI'm not accusing about all of that but if you're going to say hey I'm just like the Kennedys then you've got to be just like the Kennedys stay away from sixty nine Oldsmobile\nOn bridges but I mean ... not a single person voting for Beto can tell you one of these issues because it doesn't matter\nAnd in many of these other places the Democrats are running on issues that are not at the forefront of people's minds or they are on the wrong side\nBut if you're really stop to think about it mob behavior bullying the appearance of insane rage an anger is all they have left\nThey don't have any issues or policies to run on for the same old reason they can't be honest\nAll they've got plenty of policies all they got plenty issues all\nThey have plenty of ideas they just don't dare tell anybody what they are\nNot F the run up to election time\nThey have no leaders to rally behind wondering I mean look at the presidential front runners of this party\nJoel bite me\nCrazy Bernie who is losing popularity and if you haven't heard Hillary Clinton has all but made it official she's running again and twenty twenty\n\nHillary Clinton me a two time loser wants to go for the trifecta and I'm telling you there are a lot of people in the Democratic party hierarchy particularly in the media who don't want her anywhere near a presidential campaign again\nKamala Harris big war by the time the microscope to get through her we're going to find out how really\nIntellectually vacant that woman actually is\nAnd the same thing with Cory Spartacus Booker these people survive on the image and reputation built by the drive by media but when the time comes to find out what really goes on between their ears you learn that it isn't much\nThey're frustrated because they've tried everything they can to get rid of Donald Trump and not only have they failed he has thrived so\nAll they have is rage and the rage is actually the anger associated with fatal here\nThey have failed in every ah tempt every effort\nTo get Donald Trump's approval numbers down to the thirties and forties so one of the primary parties in America the Democratic party has now become a party of range and violence mob like bullying behavior it's their only\nAngle and they're actually paying people to go engage in this kind of behavior\nLet's review some things that were in the news twenty\nSeven and the reason they were in the news twenty four seven because this was held a drive by media working with the Democratic party was going to get rid of Donald Trump\nAnd yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump I I don't think what this has been about is simply waiting until Republicans lose an election and such as the midterms I think they've actually sought\nTo have Donald Trump for being moved from office since the day after the election I guess what Mueller's about that's what the collusion thing is about that is what every one of these stories has been about is somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is\nAbout been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box and twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House that has been the mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders to the enraged abnormalities that make up a Democrat base [noise]\nAnd I mean that specifically I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is me cause usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican they want to destroy Mitt Romney or\nGeorge W. Bush praying pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all been about\nHaving Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road day how many times that they brought up the cabinet needs to get together to determine this man's not fifth they they want him out of office every day now\nThe failure compounds the rage look at just some of the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks\nAnd then no particular order hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Kristin ...\nForward that was a two for that was get rid of cabinet as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career his past his future\nNo problem that's what they were trying to do\nChristine balls the four Stormy Daniels a porn star became a hero\nTo the Democratic party and her creepy\nPorn star attorney Michael ... who was then towers and as perhaps a Democratic Party presidential front runner for twenty twenty\nAnd Donald Trump's taxes\nThat was an issue that was ever investing below the surface for the entire time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead\nHow about the shooting\nAt the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nAnd the creation of a couple of new Democratic Party activists camera hog and I forget the other one how long did that story go on how big a star did they turn camera hog into and where is he now\nWhere is the issue of gun control where is this story and that young people\nHigh school and college students who had enough of them are going to take control of the apparatus that government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the an Iraq where\nIs that today what [noise] but\nOh camera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to live there he will be again\n\nMy point is these are all manufactured\n\nTailored people and the issues based on a happening or a moment but none of it is organic or real one of your man rush in David ... he's totally real but he's a media creation\n\nAs David ... doesn't have an audience David Hawk did not literally create a bond neither does okay seal ... these people do not have connections\nWith an audience they don't have connections with voters like Trump paths are like other successful people and maybe you do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real\nLike ... gone but nobody's alarming ... where we miss hawk we may want to see it in Albany saying where's hog\n\nI'm that's not a criticism he hasn't had time to build up a connection or an audience point is not on this is real it's all soap operas script material what's another one the me too movement\nHillary Clinton has affected link killed that by saying my husband you can't say that he did anything wrong with Monica Lewinsky she was an adult she was consenting adults jihad Meyer print she was a consenting adults I Know what Bill was\nIt not abuse because Bill Clinton knew that she was an adult\nWell bye-bye me too movement\nI mean if the babe that random bimbo eruptions unit to destroy women\nClaiming her husband abused them comes up now to defend her guy what good as the me too movement\nAgain another manufactured moment it hit by manufactured my my point about all these is none of these issues or people have the legs to survive on their own without the media\nPart furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nHow do you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive dealer network on line at rhinos safe dot com veteran own didn't veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our H.

Central American country with the hopes of making the were born with ... nothing about this is organic he looked Trump's right to ask who's paying for this who is buying food\nWho is buying the water

have some shelter at some point who is\nBehind this and we're going to find out we're going to find the thing about this I'm I'm trying to when I open the speculated about this yesterday somebody in the Democrats' side wants this to happen\nI'm trying to figure out how this caravan let's say they get to the border and storm the border and just run across a holiday I think that helps the Democrats unless it's just the pictures of chaos they think they're going to redound negatively the Trump anyway\nOkay I look I promise I promise soundbites and your phone calls are coming up after this break I\n\n\n\n[noise] that's\nRight that's right and of course of course we're back\nOpen line friday Rush Limbaugh to Springfield, Illinois Todd\n... thank you sir Hi\nRochelle are you today sir no good really good do you remember when you have\nTo take cell phones up front because they cost so much to use\nA when I used to take cell phones or ... what do you mean\nYou would you put them at the top of the line because it costs so much for oh yeah oh yeah we\nThat's right because we'd so wait wait the eight hundred number didn't apply their cell phones cellphone callers had to pay money to be on hold yeah yeah yeah I Do remember that way and I are way back that up are you back you go I\nI've been way back before that even so uh but hey I've got a theory about this caravan\nThe last two years there's only one thing that the Democrats have won on and that's the wall and it as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income Trump is caved on\nAnd I think that they've done that fit this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought\nThat it that the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't get a phone call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon Trump do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as that as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds one of these uh one of these things to keep the government going that's got nothing in it it burns me up\nAt all the time so are you are who are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNow I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe\nKnow Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I\nThink he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that if he wants to do their next year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's just I all I can say these are smarter than than I Am\nA maybe but but I uh [noise]\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off\nA lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to and for for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding was own with four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate the Trump pass a bill for wall Trump really can't stop these people to Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nOh I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well but my question is what else do they got well\nThey've got my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't been that he's promised and that's the that's the uh no that's exactly\nAnd right there that was four in the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want it's not even you know that they aren't even\nFoundation yet and I think even start so it really aggravates me personally but this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all of that you're talking about all of the spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions\nUm we Democrats can't stop anything in the house and they can in the Senate what what here's what Trump's up against and I'm like before you go to Todd I Want to get your thoughts with the Trump is still up against the fact that the leaders in both parties do not want that wall\n\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\n[noise] they they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's a lot of other\nThings that they didn't want that he's he's a a that he's come through and he's twisted I'm a into doing what he wants\nOut and many of the ... I think many of the Republicans have blocked the idea\nThat Trump was going to be a garner a before now I I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the meaning of targets\nI I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen\nTrump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\n\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace it didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected [noise] and it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around palm pay or is there a palm pay all left Saudi Arabia after having met when king Solomon and Mohammed bin

which is also an Islamic country not happy with the way the Saudis are running Islam\n[noise] there's so much more to this then the drive by his are\nSuggesting 'cause the drive by just want to use this to get Trump to show Trump's ineffectiveness or to show Trump puzzle lined with tyrants or whatever I by the way I was thinking there is one\nIssue that the media and Democrats you have to say had some success and that was the\nAllegation that the Trump Administration was separating children from their parents at the border\nThat one had some legs that wouldn't work and that might be what this caravan as about\nAs a as well\nUh even though it was totally manufactured and made up it required the ignorance of a lot of people for it to a I don't mean stupidity\nIgnorance of a lot of people on the policy for that technique allegations separating families at the border to up to work so up next\nWhat I promised that was going to do in the first\nOne to his own south of rush ...

memory secret isn't it\nThere is that despite all the talk he hasn't done a thing to stop illegal immigration\nAnd I think that's a pretty good theory\nAnd then you add in the chaos that will happen then you throw in the possibilities if they do get to the border and do cross but they wouldn't be separated and that's the one of all those issues and I went through the last hour that came and went and didn't have any glue or have any legs that went dead\n\nI'll never forget I was out in California I I I got so frustrated I was playing golf with a friend of mine was one of us\nAnd it was during the times of Dr ... and the Democrats are making all this noise about how Trump separating families children from their mother is in their heads\nAnd this guy who's up to speed on this stuff says Russia's pictures look past come on you know the pictures are made up this is who care is the picture spoke ban it looks really bad you don't you're not really for one for the rest of the pictures look bad we've got to do something pictures Louis oh my gosh I I was on\nThis guy was smart enough to know that he was calling for a media trick\nBut at the pictures with what he was telling me was I Can't defend this I have people\nComplained to me about Trump's separating ... I can defend the pictures rushed the pictures\nSo that's the one thing that has had legs okay so the audio sound as if you're on hold if you're on the phones be patient were coming to you ill quick oh this is the soundbite from the hands of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen and then I'm going to determine\nOutcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans and Democrats really blew that\nBut there are four hundred and thirty five of these things I don't know I just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been the rights\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately want Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectivity side this process if I put on the spot for addiction but we hold the house and we increase the Senate because I think that's just I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest the electoral landslide defeat in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel today our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer or anti ... Julie ... call host out there talking to fame and Republicans strategic wrist Ed Rollins about my comment\nFans deserve to lose like he's bar act on that front half right on the other front I think will lead some Senate cities I think the house was very very much in jeopardy\nWhere you are not buying into his or her scenarios they'll hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold and they don't count votes like I Do I ran a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seat has another twenty five to thirty that are our seats that are in play only about two or three Democrats in certain places totally on defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\nLet me run through them and say this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this just walk or stuff\nAnd to me this is totally abs and um the Emmy Emmy what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling and\nI Know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite I'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome\nOut of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixty and I mean that those people were literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of predictions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election or two thousand sixteen the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama's there that could be a factor Obama's gone\nSo maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years\nTo make people all of a sudden you want to elect Democrats again\n\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rush the Senate yeah we're probably pick up look up the house is gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar well not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates\nIn them [noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done at one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no\nNot in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow support their promoting rage and anger there promoting\nInsanity and the lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump is there's this much\nOpposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters\nWell that would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not when the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country and they're not even\nTrying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out remember Obama's trying to say the economy was his well that went on for like a lead the balloon\nAnd they died with it so they abandoned map and outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey haven't dad continued to try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\n\nExceptional superpower that discriminates that violates that ... that\n[noise] it's all negative so I'm just so where is this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance\nWell you know kind of typing and so I thought that was\nBasically yeah I don't know yeah yeah yeah well maybe you know uh yeah yeah uh-huh\n[noise] she's [noise]\nSadly clueless ah and in front of a typical ... typical of the people that Democrats think represent\nTheir future hang on Fox coming back me back before you know [noise]\n\nThe cutting edge him societal evolution meeting and surpassing all audience expectation everyday Rush Limbaugh\nAnd residents\nCoast to coast we go to Dover\nNew Hampshire and this is George welcome it's great to have you with us George how're you doing\nGreat thanks for taking my call\nI was calling I just wanted to make a show that you actually think um that you did years and years ago that I thought it was just great it was probably one that shows that you ever hacked and we're really simple\nAnd you basically had a roll call and people just called in with their startup businesses small businesses and talk about\nHow they're doing you know and where do they are and\nSo yeah yeah you don't we don't want that was you know you hear what you remember there was a a it was it was a period of time it was the early nineties folks and white collar employees were being laid off\nExecutives and magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy\nThey were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executives it's finally white\nCollar people and not blue collar people [laughter] and so I decided we did three days of this we took calls\nA ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and asked what they were doing about it\nRight and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing that ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things I Love I finally have because of necessity I'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting a business or what have you and they were they were\nAll amazingly upbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumps or angry or anything about\nRight now it was it was just it was just I mean with my my second year in business\nSo I remember I remember it well because it was working in January one or\nOr or at least one maybe with another a rip off from that other\nThree day thing that that are right I just I just think it'd be a good a good thing to try you know what I mean just maybe on a friday instead of doing you know Republican good Democrat bad stuff I mean which people the people were part but um\nWell don't won't downplay the Republican or Democrat bad thing because there's still\nA whole slew of people who don't get how bad the Democrats are but let me ask you something do do you think that\nPeople need to hear business people calling in describing how great the economy as before they'll believe it\nIs that why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it or you ask are you thinking some people don't believe it or to doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that run an operator own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I work a lot of hours and I'm and I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but\nUm it's just it's a good inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make make this country work\nYou know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that way I see it\nWell small business small business there's no question that small business is uh the vast majority of of employment in the country and some ... saying the backbone well okay\nI I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to the individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and why\nThey they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do other hosts would maybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not that week and I'm not I don't have any self doubt so I can take any kind of criticism from any one and not take it personally\nSo don't ever fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George thinking this is Lloyd in in in\n... lost in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi\nHow're you doing their young man why not just fine thank you\nAnyway and I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was in Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but there's not a Britain has been all aimed at stopping anybody crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting it remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump is a phony is not who he says he is\nAnd they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHell I don't think that could happen either done too much into a little\nTime oh I don't either get\nAnd the leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this caravan is uh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall\nBut his point was how many continuing resolutions if we had independent budget deals if we had and then there's not and we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "19"}
