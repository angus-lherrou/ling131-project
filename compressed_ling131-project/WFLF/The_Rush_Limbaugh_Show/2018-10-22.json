ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking it was nice long walks or playing golf for tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor may be all you need\nMuch is the Washington establishment would like to deny it much as they would like to change it it is still the issue that keeps Donald Trump\nIn the forefront of his supporters mines so I've been studying the media to try to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show the\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty\nPercent of their time on your shoulder you better not focusing on the care of him that tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be\nCovering it and building it up and\nWith people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean\nGuy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show Gabe and of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look at it\nSee wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known weather's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election hasn't happened yet everybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan shocking north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a\nMicrocosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats if they're behind that was one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about setting the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't all white ... infant didn't want it to last and so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you wouldn't know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still mayor ... year about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them at their not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually you're not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't no doubt is the right word but they would be my only disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get to him\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this then there there's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be somebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many\nTwo thousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states since ... Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start walking to the United states two thousand miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so you've got seven thousand people\nWho all of a sudden it aside all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people's choice but I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams of what would the environmental wackos thinking about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they get maps and San Francisco for tourists couldn't voided the piles of human feces\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles how long would it take\nRemember they're vowing together I just hit the southern border may go there and vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know\nHow many miles a day you can walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next day\nThat people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those every unreal Linda that's over three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day [noise] so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen\nVideo of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten\nThousand [noise]\nAnd then of course ah ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan\nThan we are just hearing about Fox News and the a P report that the second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras and has already crossed into Guatemala\nThey're hoping to catch up to the main group\nAs the massive migrant caravan Bush's during the southern us border a second group of about one thousand people from Honduras is rushing\nTo join the main group which reportedly and swelled the ranks with several people who've already been deported the caravan which has around five thousand uh seven thousand members\nWas on the move again Monday morning departing the southern may cause city\nOf ... the smaller group trailing entered walked a mile away from Honduras late Sunday according to be a pay\nSome in the second the caravan are said to have experience in getting across the border with includes a number of deportations have some of whom have been sent home multiple times eight twenty nine year old the inner Anthony ...\nCNN's outrage or what if something else ... by the way this is not a caravan folks this is this this is it's an invasion\nIt is an invasion just like that which occurs every day and has been at the southern border for many many decades I mean it's it's an invasion that has so\nFar lead to a minimum twelve million illegal aliens of the country and these incessant calls for amnesty for all of them but let's see what happens when they are supposedly a week out let's see if the organizers of this thing\nBegan to deny the members food and water let's see if the people behind this creating a humanitarian crisis one week before ... rival [noise] oh my God\nLook what's happening it's in the middle of the Mexican does or doesn't they've gotten out of water and there's no for my we've got to do something we got to do them but\n\nThere is a hurricane coming that Mike oh well it's a perfect storm that couldn't be coming to fruition here this is the\nUltimate October surprise that we're still trying to figure out who's behind this here's lonely Gohmert from Texas He was on today with Sandra Smith on Fox question what can you tell us\nWhat you're seeing the way the president to respond to that is what are your thoughts as this mob makes its way more than\nThe president made no bones about it and uh actually he can take his lead from the Democrats a Democrat and I'm Woodrow Wilson that one of my favorite presidents ten Nineteen sixteen after ... gangs came across\nThe border and New Mexico and killed a bunch of people and not only did he put Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's are going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs to stop\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the border you gotta stop bogus asylum claims and basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from\nAnd also we need to remember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not made and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so ... El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim\nAnd Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Lowey knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the they do I talk to the lawyer he'll talk about Jeffrey is talk of the Jefferson I won't even know who these types of who you're talking about\nJeff Sessions with Jeff Sessions or big buddies that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great\nPoints they already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in afterwards gaping\nTheir own country and if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nAnd it's what leads me to believe that the primary mover is behind this are the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprises it's adventure waiting but I think this was the left\nBehind it for a host of reasons every one of which we should uphold\nThe point one [noise]\nHammer back great to have your Rush Limbaugh kicking off a brand new week a broadcast excellence here an eight hundred to eight two to eight\nLouie Gohmert he is from Texas He's on with the bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill ... says\nMike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them are also deeply concerned with the violence provoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way the [noise]\nThe details on that story are from the uh oh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying sectarian saint palm pale raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders headed\nFor the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nDeployed out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media in a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their right\nMind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote their son wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world wouldn't want that and why\nIt\nMakes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat every bit motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals political world it's so damn hard to understand about this\nI think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived\nLong enough to know what's best are being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a mess the bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and said to the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party has calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democratic party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who think that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement\nWe have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning\nAny thing in the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense\nTo support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nThat need the method provide the rock solid math foundation they need for the day and there\nWere the story and math education and try to buy more than half a million parents magnesium\nChanging lives to match you know up against him first visit to one of our nine hundred and ten just today at ... dot com and\n[noise] um [noise] I'm going\nTo get to that CNN [noise] CNN playing an impartial ... invited me to make it look like I was trying to make the case of a shell game\nDeserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lotta people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or ... same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification\nAnd I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert by again bill hammer outward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nOr is this ... saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion\nAnd thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor\nThing call out military troops to stop and invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out of ... that normally prevent some military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military just stopping invasion from another country so there's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what Woodrow Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you you he may not\nSend the military and I may call as a as a congressman government says there but there's no law says he\nCan't this isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections [laughter] what if we can make that\nIs what do you think the people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the joke you never know who's listening I'm just asking you\nWhat if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in an invasion either\nWay you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good\nRussian I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized just a border that if they\nBomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just ... deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that short\nI mean you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and he started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own she leads to put everybody else or but on the line get 'em on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nPolitico had a story over the weekend that warning Democrats not doing expect anything from Mahler not when it comes to Russian collusion\nBe prepared for and major disappointment Washington Post with a similar story\nAnd there are similar stories on the on the midterms in the blue way about how it's looking less and less likely and more and more toss up up for grabs as Republican strength is surging in places that it was not seen earlier\nAnd this is shocked and surprised the Dr ... and their polling catalysts that I'm here to tell you again\nThe I don't believe this I don't believe this is the way\nThings have\nI mean you can you know for individual voter to individual voter but when you're talking about blocks of voters it just doesn't make sense that the vast majority of people back in December we're we're all intending to get rid of every Republican make could cause they have a Trump made a mistake voted for Trump knew it\nAnd then nine months later changed their minds but this is what they ask us to believe\nAnd that's why I Do this polling nine months out eight months out which doesn't mean anything other than a you know interesting talking points at the time [noise] so still lots to get to as the program on falls before you're very eyes and ears up back to the Caribbean story 'cause we're not quite through with this\n... the the the the thing that that argues again for this being a Democrat Party\nOperation or an operation intended to benefit the Democrat Party the Associated Press has changed headlines\nAbout the caravan after a bunch of liberals complained about an original headlined describing the illegal caravan as an army of migrants\nThat is the original a pie story on this that in range and a bunch of leftists so the a P yesterday changed the headline after a backlash\nFrom liberals furious at them for describing a caravan of illegal immigrants heading toward the U.S as an army of migrants\nA rag getting growing army of migrants resumed marched toward us read the original headline on the AP story a ragged growing army of migrants\n... changed the headline to replace the word army with caravan\nWell that's not a caravan either it's a mob it is an invading army might away not all of them are walking I mean you've seen the vehicles they're on a flatbed trucks there in pick up ... million by whoever is paid for this is paying a pretty penny I've\nSeen estimates of seven thousand dollars a person for this but I was seven thousand dollars a person's eyes I say I've seen estimates I've seen estimates assistance costing upwards of twenty million dollars and I\nDon't know about that but I Know it's it's not cheap you have to feed\nSeven thousand people you have to provide fuel for those vehicles that are being used transport them now the cartels have that kind of money so the Democrat donors have that kind of money some of them are walking a lot of them are walking\nAnd now there's a second caravan that has sprung up in ah in Honduras another a pie headline I'm Sorry to Los Angeles times stretching from ... seven thousand strong migrant caravan trucks throws stifling\nHeat in southern Mexico [noise] you know I often break out a map\nI mean I Know my geography I Know where things are in fact you know this what's fast Apple TV the Apple TV for cake in the latest software and they have these ... screening service a screen servers savers\nAnd they have added as of the most recent software update four cave video of the world from the international space station as it orbits\nAnd it's fun when they pop up and you can you can make them topic we don't have to wait for the screen server to automatically load it's fun to try to figure out where the international space station is what it is flying over because it doesn't just go east to west\nUh for ... I saw one recently flying over California north to south\nAnd you were gonna find straight down the coast in North Carolina of California in to the bar hopping on ... and then the Mexico and it it's fun just to figure\nOut at the Knight\nViews you can see Ireland and the U. K. you can see a North Korea is just dark as it can be\nBut because it's not a standard map view it's fun to figure out what's what as as a space stations were two\nHundred miles high if these are fascinating for cable news signed off in Krakow to map\nWe're talking here about ... ... what the ... door Panama and according to the map that I cracked\nCosta Rica in Panama are much closer to Honduras than the u._s. is\nCosta Rica's only four hundred miles\nFrom Honduras Panama is five hundred Ninety miles away the United states is twenty five hundred miles from Honduras [noise]\nSome people say it's two thousand miles from to goose ... to a Tempe er Phoenix in Arizona but take your pick twenty five hundred two thousand miles versus four hundred miles or five hundred if you're a scraping\nAbsolute fills in the harbor if you're a scraping poverty if you're a scape English from all you've got to do is get to your neighbors and stop or maybe southern Mexico but they're not stopping anywhere they are heading right to the United states\nThey're blowing past Mexican police they're blowing past immigration officials\n\nIt's a microcosm of what's happening every day in this country this invasion of people end up becoming illegal immigrants\n[noise] there's a lot of money behind this\nWater Marla remember this Trump said that in Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador did not do their part in stopping this that we were going to severely cut off or reduce massive foreign aid that we give them Trump has tweeted\nGuatemala Honduras El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country in the coming illegal to be us we will now began cutting off\nOr substantially reducing the massive foreign aid routinely given to them [noise] let me grab a phone call quickly this is Stephen Moore I'm In California\nAnd that that that that uh\n[noise] after this I Want to go up to the line to Steve great great to have you how you doing sir\nNo good how are you sir\nFine and dandy great to have you on the program today\nIf I talk to your call screener and what I see is probably Democrat Party strategically because they had a problem in twenty sixteen not Hispanic came out and voted for Trump looking at one of them do [noise] I've seen some stories that they aren't going to do it this time because the pocketbook issues but making good money\nAre lower jobs so he's your heart a whole thousands and thousands of people on that border and start buying the storage we're talking about where the suffering there's no food there's this and that is that you're looking at people who are the Ken banger country man may be extending the nephews\nYou go to the polls that week beforehand you look at those stores worried about the oil level I think they're a guilt them with their strong sense of family I daddy\nDidn't you come back to the party even though they know their own interest they should vote Republican\nOkay All right so let's let's let's walk through this\nIf I understood correctly you think that this is a Democratic Party operation because the Democrats are having problems with Hispanic turnout that happens to be true\nIt happens to be that more and this is this is a presidential approval polling numbers Hispanics and African Americans are rating Trump's performance higher than anybody ever remember wildest dreams imagined it would be\nAnd in pre election polls the span of vote is trending Republican more than anybody ever thought it would be the Democrats are panicking over this and so if you're right than what they've done is put together this caravan\nOf Hispanics and Latinos hoping\nTo show how they are missed training in so that the Hispanics trending for Republicans will change their mind\nAnd not

Cruz has been creeping ahead\nIn even in the polling data and it's it's being acknowledged by the Democrats that that it is real and yet they have continued to maintain that Beto O'Rourke gonna be the guy and it can take God Ted Cruz\nHas anybody found a hundred thousand people trying to get into a Beto O'Rourke event\nYou have a venue that whole Seventeen thousand people you have anywhere between

running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy
