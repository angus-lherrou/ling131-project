says they have to win the house and Senate just save America no they have to win the house and Senate to transform\nAnd change America against the will of the American people what the Democrats and the American left want to do to America is not what most Americans want America to be\nThey don't care about that they are willing to force what they think America should be America's transformation on everybody but\nThankfully they still have to win elections and I still maintain that I don't know when but somewhere down the road they are going to realize that winning elections is the lone remaining obstacle\nTo them getting what they want and at some point they're going to suggest that elections are not worth it [noise] because they don't win and they'll come up with some kind of alternative\nI Know it sounds like a long shot but don't don't me I Know these people but only a Democrat folks\nWouldn't think that report\nFrom a scientist saying that\nShe might be one one thousand twenty fourth unity and would make their claim a minority status valid\nOne one thousand twenty four\nIn the\nElizabeth Warren possibly that that wouldn't be point zero nine but that's not even one\nTenth of one percent fault that's how little Indian heritage and\nPocahontas has now scientists said that the average European American is zero point eight team percent Native Americans zero point one eight she is point zero nine she is last\nNative American than the average European American is these are New York times numbers by the way\nElizabeth Warren last Native American than the average European American\nAnd let's see what else we have here a than it did it that if Mollie Hemingway favorite part of Warren possibly being one one thousand twenty four Native American is\n...\nIs that her twenty twenty campaign is rolling it out as if it's not a complete self own how do they think this was a good idea\nI'll tell you how they think it's a good idea\nThey think they're naming Trump wouldn't they think they're embarrassing Trump remember Trump\nOffered to donate a million dollars to focus hottest his favorite charity if she can prove that she were Native American so she's come out today and she is according to her doctor and sciences and so far she's established that she\nIs maybe American and now she's asking Trump to pay off to the to the indigenous peoples circumcision for America group or whatever it is an indigenous peoples uh circumcision information of resource that or some such thing\nAnd if Trump gives Trump's denying that he made the pledge even though we [laughter]\nFlat out denying it like ... ... a sale\nYou I'd never had sex with a woman not a single time ever ... that's what Clinton was ... I I Do you need to go back and look what I said I did not say that\nAt most Trump owns a oh it was one\nOne thousand twenty fourth of one million I run that number he always maybe most of the thousand dollars\nIf he's going to pay a percentage\nOf the million dollars that equals her percentage of Native American that means he just a little over a thousand dollars if he wants to let's go to the audio soundbites we have we have Elizabeth Warren herself this morning\nAh let's see this is on her website she released a video in titled Elizabeth Warren's family's story\nIsn't that queen\nElizabeth Warren's family's story in one part of the video poker hottest here talks to Stanford University professor of genetics Dr Carlos\nBustamante and here is a portion of their conversation\nDr tomorrow can freeze\nOn her genome did fine vi segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the error rate is less than one\nThing I'd like to call my mom a liar\nOne of the fact that we have a Native American ancestry and you're\nJust casual reader\nNeeded\nInformation like the violence for generations and\nCan say whatever he wants [noise] mocking Native Americans or any\nIn order to tighten\nIt now I understand why Jim Messina and the rest of the gang of the left are all in a Twitter here because she is making it about her on a basically\nNon story I mean this is the election coming up isn't there is a a single vote that has anything to do with her\nShe hasn't even announced for the president's in fact she said just the opposite she says she's not going to run so given that why is she intruding here I'll tell you she thinks\nLike all the others on the left do they think if they can be the one to destroy Trump if they can be the one to illustrate that whatever they think of Trump\nIs true that they will be heroes heroines are heroes they think they will be loves that adored that's\nThere are so Trump focused their so Trump obsessed\nThat it is taking them off of their game again reminder New York times Elizabeth Warren is only possibly one one thousand twenty fourth point zero nine percent Indian the average European American is zero point one in eight percent other words\nShe is less than half as much\nNative American is your average European American is\n[noise]\nHere's Moore this is a again on her website she was released this new video and title Elizabeth Warren's family's story in another part of this exciting\nHe's totally mocking her Leslie stall so sleep deprivation dietary manipulation ministers are well yourself the u._s. doesn't do that\nWill say Rodriguez well we do\nIt would've been a perfect set up for Leslie stall and Donald Trump or going to get to that coming out of the break here at the bottom of the hour hang on\nWill listen to it together because like I say I didn't see it last night [noise]\nPutting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you a loan them you\nPeople were not talking about millions appear people here [noise]\n... other where the ... and the top fifty percent of all taxpayers pay Ninety seven percent of total individual income tax so in other words the bottom fifty percent paid three percent there isn't much more you can do to cut their taxes\nAnd yet how often do you hear every pot both parties politicians\nRunning around and we're going to middle class after it was a middle class pregnant burn through brand but we got to cut middle there isn't much to cut any more\nWhen it comes to wake up in Texas\nNow which small percentile of tax payers also paid three percent or more\nIt's fourteen hundred taxpayers\nThe top point zero zero one percent the top one one hundredth\nOf a percent for teen hundred taxpayers\nThat group alone paid free point two five percent of all tax is one thousand forty nine people is the exact number one thousand or fourteen hundred and forty little round it to fourteen hundred fourteen hundred tax payers paid more\nThan the bottom Seventy percent\nIn two thousand one in the bottom fifty percent pay nearly five percent the top one thousand percent pay to point three so the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the rich\nNot decreasing it is not true to say they are not paying their fair share\nNow this is as it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce income tax rates you generate more tax revenue\nBecause people sheltered last they avoid if if if if you tell people they're going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping\nForty cents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll be more inclined to pay it\nPlus you have more tax payers because all these people end up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more is actually part and parcel with the theories behind supply side economics supply side tax policy but the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that's fourteen hundred people for\nGene hungry people out of three ... some odd million is it fair to fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent combined and yet we never stop hearing how unfair\nIt is\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever going to change\nBecause if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not going to win anything\nYou need the votes of the people in the bottom Seventy percent so you need to pander to them you need to constantly tell them how they're getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the left ends up doing is telling people\nGoing to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fair to them so much more money than\nIt's not fair to not paying your fair share and their fair share in taxes and we're going to ... bottom somebody just go yeah baby punish them\n[noise]\nCNN's Chris Cuomo the son of Mario the pious\nSaid that\nHe thought Donald Trump looked like he was thinking racist thoughts listening to Kanye West last week\nThey repeat that Chris ... of CNN\nAfter playing video of Kanye West\nTalking to Trump in the oval office said he didn't care what ... said he wanted to know what racist thoughts were going on in Trump's had\nMy curiosity wasn't about what came out of ... miles of my one daughter went to what's going on in Trump's head let's take a look at him here is my educated guess okay if other than a warm serotonin flash of happy hormone imaginary headlines black loves ... black urban Obama Cuomo said\nWhat other kind of racist thoughts as Trump may be happening here is Kanye goes on so is the racist here\nThe son of Mario the pious who sees race everywhere all the time even when it's not president even when he cannot pinpointed\n\nAnd my house in an educated guess of the critical moment it was like an educated guess you're in an hors ... west ... speaking Trump is thinking this is great this is great this guy's blacker than Obama this guy's on my side just guys going to do wonders for me how does he know what's going on in Trump's him\nThey have a crystal ball but no he's not racist\nI this is the kind of think it's I Know this is not going to be widely known until I tell people about it but I just who these people are and the things they're saying and doing I I just\nI Know they're going to get votes I Know people are going to support him befuddles me though back to the Trump sixty minutes interview with Leslie saw we were up here at number just as a big\nNumber three this is Trump talking about the necessity\nOf consequences for illegal immigration Leslie stall question what about the force separation of migrant children from their parents\nHas the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books by painted and enforce that line for them\nWho launched that zero tolerance policy [noise] terror families with children and then everybody decided and of course you don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate when you\nAllow parents to stay together okay when you allow that\nThen what happens is people are going to porn talk console you gonna go back to that cat in the west is\nLeslie for coming into our country illegally and part\nMain part of the reason that I have the blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states my fault\nLeslie I've done such a great job in the economy everybody wants to come here I'll take the blame for it now she's she misspoke there\nThis law on the bus Obama certainly didn't for separation that just didn't get reported because Obama was cool and couldn't do anything wrong and if it was happening when Obama did it than there has to be good reasons for it\nRemember we've got a two tier system of justice in this country and we have a two tier system of media\n\nWhat it was on the books but he didn't force what\nIs that what you mean it was on the books that Obama didn't enforce the law but Trump begins enforce it but Trump didn't make the law\nThe Democrats Leslie stall included a tempted to make people think that Donald Trump purposely wrote a law or just enacted one that's separate they don't run from the family the ... and you wouldn't believe the number of brain dead people actually believe this happened I was watching\nAn episode of law and order in your S. U. V. the other night and they had a whole premise some guy keeping a band in kids in his basement in a cage was a hero because he was saving these kids after Trump policy and force them to be a band and he was saving them\nAnd he was just running child sex rings with them but they tried to make this guy out to be somewhat\nOf a hero because the whole point of the episode was to bash Trump for separating families whether it's a law that he inherited I've looked ... why the law exists and it's above and beyond they're having to be consequences for coming here illegally a pass to do with the quest for asylum and the\nFact that\nWhere the parents are taken while their cases are decided is not suitable for kids the kids were put in much better surroundings and Sanders wild their uh their family their their their adult\nParents cases are big adjudicate there's nothing\nThere's nothing I mean this is the United states of America we do not due to kids what these people are trying to tell you the Republican Party does the kids it's quite the exact opposite it's just more in a smear\nAt the Democrats on the left of engaged in and Trump does not back down from it and even as I say for writing magazine was stunned that Trump got away with dominating even with these questions a couple of more before the break up next\nShe says do you think that climate change is a ...\nI think something's happening something is changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that is manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give Koreans and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage I Wish you can go to Greenland\nWatch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the oceans raising the sea level and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know\nThe Republican Congress is taking power and money\nFrom Washington and giving it back to you but Democrats think your money belongs to government they want to raise taxes protect criminals was things were cities and reverse the twenty sixteen election within feet but\nThe Democratic agenda the only way to keep the seat immigrants from raising taxes is to do your part vote for Republican Congress on Tuesday November ...

soundbite from Trump for the last movie you saw and we're going to get to the phones after the break in the bottom of the hour this\nIs the thing that happens is not this is classic Mrs Trump saying you never know how this honest\nThe media was and then he decides to put Leslie stall in her playing\nNever knew how dishonest media was I really made it I'm not saying that as a sound bite I now I knew how to do just that they think well no but even that way you asked me a question like about separation\nYeah when I say Obama did it you don't want to talk about how when I was making I don't mind your answer but you did it for time I'm telling you that you see it in me much differently on the subject\nI agree but I don't want to have that fight with you know hey I like I if I don't get the nighttime I'm president and you are not in the mean\nTime I'm president and you're not reminding her who she is she is talking to you know a lot of\nThat's really rude what'd you say that he didn't have to say that she knows\nHis point was that he was not being given\nEven a modicum amount of respect similar to what other presidents have got and he's right about that these people despise him may still despise him and they're always going to simply because they can't get rid of him\nThey've thrown everything that they know\nThat Donald Trump they have tried every maneuver\nEvery strategic curry every tactic they have tried everything that has always work getting rid of Republicans\nThey have tried intimidation they've tried for ramps they've tried to why is named tried reporting a bunch of stuff that isn't true they have tried intimidating voters they've done everything that has always made other Republicans back off\nOr cave or sue for peace or what\nHave you and Donald Trump does not respond to any of it\nAnd I loved is challenging the way she asked him the questions in the way she is not following up on his answers the way she was with others\nWill take a break and your phone calls are coming up right after that smokes hang on [noise]\nWork in Florida too\nFor decades gambling issues were decided by voters then politicians took that power for themselves\nAmendment three returns to the people in the last decade casino lobbyists gave nearly fifty million dollars to Florida politicians so restoring voter control of gambling is a common sense safeguard that reduces corruption and empowers you\nVoters across America already have this power usually\n[noise]\n\n\nAs\nUsual thank you for your patients we head back to the phones what we have to the phones and this is Scott\nIn Oklahoma City right to have you here Hi\nRush good to talk to you know it gives her\nLook Elizabeth Warren is resurrecting the one drop rule or an anti bell I'm a a rule created by a southern plantation owners Democrats say if you have one drop of blood that was black you're black\nOr this was this was a grotesque cruel her her percentage are so small\nThey don't have ... excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop you are going to be called black\nBut that's exactly right intersection analogy requires quantification yeah\nAnd so when we need to know how much of a percentage of pressure you are versus oppressed\nThis ... this this rulers is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany against the Jews here she comes again\nThis is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives is about her future run she needs to tell her base\nI'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of a pressure to [noise]\nWould you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists concept\nThat I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define that let\nGlad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so much more than welcome to find a good host I have ever that no one no thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection now to come straight out of Marxism march said that at every one is either on oppressor or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl of heritage\nAt its later it's now being adopted the idea of being able to declare ... so what you are how oppressed and how much of an approach where you are it's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other it spread across race\nGender sexual preference and other variables yes okay that's it intersection\nNow it'll be for me great on wash your you're talking to your your speaking in language\nOf ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful\nA Senate intersection out I mean it's basically something that has been constructed by these Marxist just saying that all of these different leftist organizations Meek somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that I'm\nA ... with that with militant I'm a Islamic lists that then with illegal immigrants and their activists and we're all of these people intersect is worried about unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor\nOr oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this and there was recent white privilege stuff pops ... absolutely\nRight so now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press she's asked him anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth Indian she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know if I could say I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you'd never see me but believe me I'm whites\nHowever when I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa well that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professor of shifting African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times\nMore a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American square\nJust submitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor\nFor the Afrikaners are not black uh I well I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to blacks down okay All right\nI just want to mess up because that sub Saharan this is somebody what ... what is it what it was it and then you start talking to the sub continent than some people really get confused you're coming from from India or over to sub Saharan Africa is below the arid desert a which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it\nThere is some north of this arid desert as well and I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this\nAll of that not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this because they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything but distract\nAmerican financing and in the last one to three three four WWW dot in MLS consumer access dot org\nIf you're concerned about

via Barbra Streisand\nWait wait you say you're sooner born and bred you are from Oklahoma absolutely I just when you say sooner born and bred and people in in real limited think you're you're you're saying that you just too soon to be born dead\nNow and I I Am a proud proud Oklahoma and I love Texas too but my my my big ... in Oklahoma and I am a I have a she set a folk on and says her great great grandmother the Cherokee well so is mine we have\nA family history but I'm a one sixteen Cherokee\nLet me ask you a question you're one sixty so you you are ... that's a lot you're you're you're considering what you're considered jerky right case issues her great great great ... great great great grandmother and she is one thousand twenty fourth\nIf she had enough to become a Cherokee I mean it to go out on a member of the tribe\nNow and that's the deal rash\nMy my grandfather was one quarter it was his grandmother my mother was one eight I Am one sixteen but if you're not on the Cherokee row then you know we try and Oklahoma that doesn't live in a if you don't\nIf you're not on the road and it was shameful\nIf someone that you think she is doing what do you think what she's doing with is Susan\nIs Barbara Streisand rush\nI'm a sixteen I'm sixty four years old almost in a few weeks if she were it but it doesn't matter if your mother or your grandmother great grandmother didn't the Cherokee are the only tribe in Oklahoma you had to sign the road and it was shameful\nFor a Indian woman to marry a white man and they didn't think they wouldn't sign up it was shameful\nWhat about the high cheekbones businesses that are that\nThe wanting I Am one sixteenth fresh and I'm can't be a Cherokee and I didn't want any of their benefits I was just kind of kind of proud of it but if your name is not on the road you weren't on a Cherokee and then\nIt just it just goes to show I mean here you are one sixteenth and you're not eligible is what you're saying if I'm hearing you right she's one thousand one of one thousand twenty fourth [noise] it's all about the identity politics what these people she wants\nThat to say something significant about her what would that be\nI mean it it it it it [noise]\nAll silly and that the people denying that she used this for employment I think that's the sole reason she did\n\nWell yeah it's welfare but you don't say that because it's going to offend people um ... they wouldn't be on the\nReceiving end of the payments if I didn't have a health problem and the fact that it's pre existing what his preexisting it means you get the disease before you have insurance then you get the disease and you want the insurance you know other walk of life can you do that\nYou can set your house on fire and then call State Farm or whoever and buy homeowner's policy to protect you against fire they won't sell it to you\nYou can't\nHave a bunch of stuff stolen from your house and they go by theft insurance\nNobody will sell it to you but when it comes to health care uh if they don't sell it to you then all hell breaks loose and their ripped to shreds there's there's no there's no making money ensuring people with preexisting conditions which then engenders a reasonable\nIf that's what's wrong people profiting from other people's readings certain just shouldn't be more drama people should be given no cure for nothing and the people should provide it for other for the good news took their hearts\nAnd that's how it works out and when you have a political party that promotes that kind of thinking it's very very tough to compete with it so\nSomehow in this polling data preexisting conditions has come up and the Democrats are once again try to make hay on it by claiming the Republicans want to take it away in fact in Pennsylvania Bob casey in the Senate Senate race there\nBob casey has run an ad claiming that the Republican candidate for the Senate wants to deny his own grand daughter\nMedical treatment she has cancer she's a
