they're literally is no place for placing blame when when nobody knows who actually is responsible for this\nBack to my point it takes it takes some expertise here\nTo manufacture ... like this if it's true that they're not intended to go off and if it's true that they're meant to look crude and made by people that started in the movie delivers it takes\nBomb making skill to put together bombs like I mean these bombs mail bombs have timers on them what their mail bomb any bomb expert knows you don't put a timer on a mail bomb a mail bomb is designed to go off when it's open\nYou put a timer on their ... strictly for visual effect because every bomb on T. V. has a timer\n\nRemember we are at TV ingrained society and what we see on TV we tend to believe therefore bombs are featured in many TV shows and movies\nAnd every bomb has a count down timer on it so these due to except they're not acting they're not turned on and not counting down and they're not connected to anything\nThey're just there for show\nThe stamps\nHave not been cancelled I mean this is as though they would have progressed through some sort of\nStandard procedure at the at the post office but why am I why might the drive buys think that Republican momentum has stopped why might they think that there has been a a slow down\nWell it's possible\nThat\nThey see the shift in soap opera narrative coverage every day from the invasion the caravan Kavanaugh the economy the Trump rallies all of that stuff is gone none of that stuff is being reported or talked about at\nAll and those were the things that we're talking the talk of Republican enthusiasm not to mention all the polls and\nNot to mention the story is on the on the slippery away blew away all of those stories are gone now every story that dealt with the men terms and those stories had shifted toward Republican momentum all those stories are gone now and pretty much every story has to do with the show he\nAnd the Turks and the Saudis or in the bombs\nAnd how Trump's not Trump's gotta learn to shut up Trump's got us these gotta stop stoking emotion like this I mean they're blaming Trump for this from beginning to end but if you're in the drive by media and all those other stories\nThe caravan slash invasion Kavanaugh aftermath the economy which is a fabulous story and the Trump rallies if they are not news\n\nAnd the only thing that is news is the bombs these mailed devices\nThey've taken all of that other stuff\nOff the radar so that Dr buys reporting this stuff may feel like\nThat the enthusiasm for the midterm elections protecting why only on the Republican side by the way\nWhy only Republicans do they must be because that's where the enthusiasm was I mean if there is a significant sea change in voter enthusiasm and the drivers are going to report that it's Republican enthusiasm that is happening down\nThen it must have been Republican enthusiasm that was very high on ratcheting up so now they're saying enthusiasm has waned it's Republican enthusiasm\nSo they are in their media capitals are in New York and there in Washington there in Los Angeles they're reporting this stuff and in their world the midterms are off the radar in their world anything to do with them in\nTerms and well not off the radar it's a very important point the enthusiasm on the Republican side they see us having vantage why because there aren't any stories about well yeah they determine what stories are covered in what stories are not they determine what's reported and what's not\n\nNow at what point will be mailed device story from the southern jungles of Georgia said\nWhy why are you laughing in their\nCome on you know as well as I Do that that I\nKnow these people like I Know every square inch my ... friend of mine glorious naked body I Know how they think I Know what they're thinking I don't know what they're hoping\nI Know what they think of the average Trump voter I Know what they think the average American the average American may as well be a co starring deliverance\nAnd that's who probably in their minds put together these bombs and sent them around and so Fort Trump targets don't forget CNN calling them Trump targets you think that's not blaming tromp\nWhile out of the other side of their mouth\nBut but writers has destroyed Democrat anger may help Democrats in November sixth vote and what did they manage\nChildren in cages in capital ending abortion I just don't believe in the ... I I think [noise] I think that Dr ... are still attempting to manufacture of scenarios they wish were actually happening in this country got an interesting email Mr Limbaugh\nYou have made it abundantly clear that you can damage the use of\nBombs for political advantage in American politics but we'll you condemn the use of fake mailbox\n[noise] now that's a toughie I have just been challenged to condemn the use of fake well of course I watch that's not a that's a that's an overdose of course I Will condemn the use of fake mail bombs as well\n[noise]\nIf they're fake if these are all fake bombs\nWe may not find that out till after the election because if these are fake\nBombs then who would be behind\n...\nWho would what would the odds be [noise] so I think you'd better prepare yourself for the fact that they're fake bombs and by the way this emailer is not the first person who has made that point a lot of people are out there thinking these are fake bombs that's why the the the the expertise needed to manufacture a fake bottom like this that\nThat could be close enough to cause mass reporting on them being real is a it's a pretty good talent so do you think one person's behind this or is it a team of people wouldn't\nWant anybody say that what we have here is meddling in an election I think this is the drive by so clearly think this is meddling in that election and they're happy about it Dr buys clearly are happy to report\nThat they think that this bomb business\nIs making you Republican voters less excited less enthusiastic that this bomb story has totally destroyed all of the energy you know that's what they're reporting out there\n\nIs that what the media is trying to do with all this over the top coverage of this Trump target bombs received by Trump targets\n\nIf this is indeed the election meddling depending on how it ends up here this could be a pretty successful case of election meddling\nAnd we don't even know if this is per se or a perp we\nDon't know if it's a Russian government agent or operation we don't know who\nBehind those whoever it is doesn't know how to spell Florida\nOr whoever it is is not sure how to spell Debbie lab or mouth shows his name\nNow the drive by maybe they don't know and right now they don't care they have a story they can only dream about and they are running with it\n\nAnd have you ever have you ever seen in the media less interested in finding out who the purpose\nIf you watch this carefully you don't see a lot of curiosity about that just the fact that they can do banner headlines Trump targets receive bombs or whatever it is is plenty enough\nFor them let's take a brief time out we've got a great audio soundbite roster\nAnd a much else coming so hang on [noise]\nStill putting

Limbaugh meeting\nAnd surpassing\n\nAll audience expectations everyday Donald\nTrump has been busy tweeting among the things that he has\nTreated ... by the way this [noise] I saw this all day yesterday on my blog and there was a story to New York times had a story that Donald Trump has three iPhones and the one that he uses the most is totally un secure and at the time comes\nAnd the Iranians listen in on every conversation and the Trump knows it but doesn't care\nReally\nReally really and so all of my little tech blog buddies picked history up and running with ... with the snarky laughter they believe it because like everybody else on the left they believe Trump as a\nBlooming it because their God that the New York times and the Washington Post and CNN tell them that so you put on a story this stupid this stupid\nThat Donald Trump knows that a cell phone he uses is routinely regularly monitored rather try comes and he uses it anyway\nAnd they don't say maybe Trump is spreading false intel maybe he uses that phone to confused now they automatically assume that Trump is such an idiot such an eagle maniac that he's so much smarter than not even a ... to understand what he's talking about that's the tone of the coverage\n\nI happened to a Trump does not use a cell phone for these kind of he uses landlines folks he does not use email he does not even taxed\nIf you get an email from Donald Trump it's from his office and it's from somebody else he does not send email he does not\nReceive email he has seen too many people with emails that have been produced for years and years and years ago come back to haunt people he does not have an email trail\nHe has never use the mail and he doesn't do text that he'd eat sweets and that's about it\nWhen he makes a phone call a ton of land line so he tweeted the New York times has a new fake story that now the Russians and the Chinese are listening to all of my calls on cell phones except by rarely uses cell phone and when I Do it's government authorized I like hard lines just more made up fake news\n[noise] [noise] he don't want my reactions to this is all these little smart ass\nLeftist out there who

pedophile\nWho called himself Carlos danger can you imagine what the New York times and the smarmy leftist would think if they found that ... I'm Sorry they do know that\n\nThey know that we actually have a ... state who was using on secured servers for her tenure as secretary of state trafficking in top secret classified dot a document some data and they didn't care they thought she was so brilliant they want to do one term president\n\nI mean ... ... this is this is worse than than hypocrisy this is Adam ... stupidity\nDonald Trump poses great threat knowingly uses phone compromised by truck columns and they praise Hillary Clinton for being so damn smart oh yeah it's such an injustice she's not\nThe president and she actually was hacked\nDay in and day out she was and so was the president of the United states when he was communicating whether\n\nTheir vaunted but rock who's saying oh you know I really there are some days I just have a hard to contain disdain for these people and their ... condescension about things\nThese are people that are really in genuinely going to put this nation at risk it isn't Donald Trump putting this nation at risk\nIf Donald Trump that is helping to with grandma this nation from the jaws of risk and transferred to risk to our enemies it is Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama at all who the smog leftist seemed to adore\nWho puts this nation at risk in so many ways economically foreign policy intelligence you name it and they have the audacity to chime in on this so called stupidity and ignorance of Donald Trump\nThis is a good time to speak with a financial advisor\nThanks Michael your path to investment advice starts with your staple financial advisor to find yours go to Steve full dot com that's S C I F ing L. dot com staple Nicholas in company incorporated member sci fi C.

notion that govern much shorter and could take care of\nEvery me in every once and that's just been an irresistible tug and yet I mean there hasn't been a no nobody is targeted medicate here nobody said as a policy\nPriority that we're going to reduce medicated role but nobody said that it's just happened and it has happened\nAt the same time as a booming economy is happening it just it just more evidence I think these are the kinds of things that in some cases of people around the country either consciously aware of maybe subconsciously aware of what these\nBits of evidence of a roaring there there's a reason for Republican enthusiasm there's a reason why Republicans are out voting Democrats an early voting there's a reason for all of this upsetting the apple cart that's going on there's a reason why conventional wisdom is taking it on the chin again\nAt least up to this point and the reason is resolved the reason is reality\nAnd it's a um [noise] it's a great thing okay to the audio soundbites as promised this was on the Fox news channel America newsroom do they built a hammer and Sandra Smith were hosting a round table out there was that there was a three women\nWe had Republican National committee spokesperson Kaylee Mac and Fannie a bustle dot com head of research and Jessica tar love I I refer to her affectionately as Natasha on a top\nAnd Washington Free beacon a senior writer Liz Harrington they're talking about the ... the package bombs these these a mail order devices that have not exploded yet\nAnd bill hammer\nStarts off I go into came back in any case I mean what are you what you've been watching what you've been observing over the past six hours what do you see\nBut I haven't heard a president who leadership ... attacks and called for unity response from the liberal media ... price that they should instead of blaming the president has a cue from the president said yesterday for the country and kind of can gather instead of attacking one another with partisan politics\n... head of shameful I at the New York times today tends to publish an article and to put the fascination with the president of the United states we're twenty four hour I mean 'cause I can think of her and how painful and the New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they publish fiction piece\nBy a writer fantasizing over a secret service agent\nTending a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president not know named Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate his gun and does that go off\nAnd so a nearby Secret Service agent hands the Russian assassin his gun sincere use mine the times runs this story and they excuses by saying well we must publishing stories that relate to react to live with the Mueller investigation of\nTrump threatened put what they've got to do with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there's not and and then they're preaching to us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about\nCivility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying into Donald Trump needs to dial it back in Donald Trump needs the training to Donald\nThrough the meanwhile they can call him a Nazi they can call him Hitler they can lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mack\nHe's talking about here now is Natasha on a top response\nI think that the president controls ten thousands ethic I buy it has rally that he was poking fun at the whole idea of all I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be a presidential which is essentially saying to the audience you know what I'm thinking and then this morning that it with than his fault\nWhich basically is they can tell if a woman gets actually thought that was her fault for wearing a short skirt has been completely ... saying that CNN and was responsible for the fake news that they're spreading because no one fall but the ... that offending does I\nHope it will let me just add\nA van and that's what they want to be on the record of metal python showed up and not culpable\nFor in the python culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth than any of that an anchor on that network indoors to play in Central Park to pick the me assassinate the president\nSaying that the leader right now you heard Natasha on a top there say you really you you want to be on the record saying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about her analogy that Trump blaming CNN as they can to because they got about never see again\nLike blaming a I'm a ... a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the analogy she used okay so so um the conversation continues you're now you're hearing a senior writer for Washington Free beacon Liz Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the ... thing for years recently commanded that Congress men about body planning the reporter he has called the ... the enemy that people have to pay the legal for anyone in guiding fellow at about\n... what about the language and I'm having an outlet and every time kind of ... Harris Brennan\nAnd CNN had a choice yesterday he saw the president announcing his abhorrent white America than for black man if I Want to be an engineer who can blame this on the president can blame it on ... John Brennan echoing that\nMove at Fort Worth far to find a have a low around President Trump put the highlights what Clinton said last week we cannot have civility\nRight we cannot have civility so what your hands here yet on a top actually trying to blame all of this on Trump\nAnd of course using this I'm from the high road and I'm I'm from uh I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on\nThe on the left now before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears you're just a bit to talk about the caravan\n'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there\nJohn Case it and he is\nBeing interviewed by I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN matter being interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would ... those who were legitimately in need of asylum can be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter deal if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal\nNow they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the ruse here or the technique here is moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God go live Phil Donahue ... all the time Phil Donahue was hosting the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be start preaching about the accident of his birth\nYou know I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's look different it's made for me and if they started ... the guilt if he felt over how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on the air and that was\nTo want to other people in the world as though being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with this\n\nThat matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world they answer the solution is to spread our area of dominance influence and to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAnd condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around on the belief that it's good and decent but there are way too many people don't think we're the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an imposition\nTo others and that we don't have the right to impose our views on people but somehow we ought to stay on the side and let everybody who wants him in\nBecause of our guilt and he\nSays I'm you know ... they're marching nor is it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan that we're marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nOr does it come to redirect dot com that's Coventry direct dot com [noise] one eight hundred and four or five
