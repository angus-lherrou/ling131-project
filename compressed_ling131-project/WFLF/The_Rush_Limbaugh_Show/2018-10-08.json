because they're white racist white supremacist ... totally totally justified so there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part I think some Democrats do not think that this dirt range psychological upset\nIs tied to them ... let me put it this way\nIf we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think that conservatism is made up of deranged lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be so up to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it then the question becomes this\nWhen you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms by what people are now saying Mr certainly

interesting question though will any of the passion fade away on either or\nBoth sides of this and that's on the Democrats' side it's not going to fade away and I think everybody needs to know this on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has\nBecome the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left\nYou have to remember these people have been\nOff their rockers since November of two thousand\nSix team they have been mad insane crazy percolating compounding\nCome pressing all of this ever since then they have been loaded for bear ever since election\nDay and the day after a two thousand sixteen and his cabinet situation comes up and I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical\nAnd I don't think they can get any more motivated than

I Can't read but she says that a family show\nAnd then she admitted she was emotionally shattered by the current state of affairs which just proves the theory that Democrats are mentally disturbed people who project or mental problems on to the public\nOn the politics is exactly what is happening here\nDo not underestimate that and don't think that I'm I'm I'm being flippant or an exaggeration or to make a point I really do believe that we're talking about mainstream mental and psychological disorders becoming standard operating procedure politics the American but there's no other way to explain this\n[noise] now folks\nTo show you how deranged this is I have and the stack today I have um\nTwo maybe three one night when called teachable moment things they are opinion pieces that appear in the mainstream media both today and over the weekend\nThey are related to Kevin ... button they\nThe pieces attempt to say what all of this means for America and of course for the\nFor the Democrats and much of it is I mean I just saw dead wrong in the simple recitation of the facts of all this data stuns me\nThat people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and react to them they continue to react to what they think has gone on based on how they feel and these are some of the standard bearers of American journalism on the left\nOne of them is or isn't John Harris at Politico one of the founders Democrats fear of there are a wet rag party you know what this pieces about this piece is about how the Democrats get their rear end handed to them every time because all the Democrats are a bunch of cowards\nThe Democrats have no guts the Democrats are a bunch of paper tigers and Democrats or Republicans walk all over\nNow how many of you think it's the exact opposite this is pretty common to there are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side as a bunch of ... but I don't\nKnow how anybody paying attention on the left can think that their sights a bunch of voices but the fact that they do is fascinating to me\nNow here's another such pace and we have said that this woman once before I don't remember specifically when\nHer name is Alexis Grinnell she has written on gender and politics for the New York daily news the Washington Post and other outlets [noise] she had a piece\nOn Saturday in New York Times it may have been actually published on Sunday and released on the Web on Saturday Night the dates October ... since I don't read the paper anymore I don't know when the stuff actually shows up in the print edition\nSo my guess is this thing was released Saturday Night on the Web to be published in the Sunday paper but it could have been in the Saturday papers well doesn't matter white women come get your people\n\nI I don't even know where women who is thoughts are this convoluted and you're going to hear\nI don't know where they come from I I\nI don't know who's responsible for creating the motive but I think it's gender studies I think it's a combination of feminism and gender studies\nThat\nLiterally corrupt young minds in fact there is a there's a there's another link the peace [noise] today\nThat describes

four to eight went out at eight five nine four to one thousand now [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd this Alexis Grinnell is not the only woman writing this way liberal writers and activists are attacking white women all over\nToday white women are to blame for standing by supporting cabin on helping him get confirmed Alexis Grinnell in her piece writes this blood pact between white men and white women is at issue in the November midterms President Trump knows it\nEnded up Tuesday news conference he signaled to white women to hold the line he said the people who have complained to me about it the most about what's happening are women women are very angry men that don't like it but I Am a woman there in the sense that what's going on everybody knows\nWomen and that's going on because they have husbands that they love and sons that they're worried\nAbout envy is leftist women think those other what your mother is the sons are sellouts in traders did including with your your interest is\nThis is it is down rights that give you is not even based us in a common sense\nWith a with a even a community of understanding and the Democrats think this kind of thing is what's going to generate this massive blue wave in the house [noise]\n[noise] now more on that I Want to get started on the phones were going to go to Denver it this is David David thank you for calling you are first it's great to have you with us high\nRoche reforms Android user did Oh thank you sir thanks very much um I Wish I could be excited about this justice Kevin on\nYour corner to the fore finally raw who to the Supreme Court but the level of vitriol V.\nOut right in the face for the whole entire and you kind of alluded to this whole already result has been thrown out the window with with the left and we are a nation\nAs as you said a number of times we are a nation of law and to be lawless she'd she'd be ... willing to any city to undermine or get somebody\nFrom consideration to the nation's highest court because of his life for the last bastion of hope in heaven forbid these individuals going to power this fall I you know there's I don't believe in a blue wave either but\nIf they do in our country is based on a very fragile tension almost\nOh I agree with you totally his point I don't like taking\n[noise] people are not talked\nAnd people are taught this way hatred and rage and anger has to be taught or inspired or a mobilized you don't come out of the world and that's what everybody comes out of the womb smiling and happy\nNow when the baby mix of massive itself from the diaper yeah there's anger but you get my you'll get my point here the natural state of a human being is not rage an anger the natural state of humanity is not that as a ... by the Democratic party get that has become the Democratic party I firmly believe and I said this Friday\nAnd even if it makes me sound naive I'm going to say it again in a same world\nIn a decent and just country the actions of the American left just in the past two years would result in the biggest landslide electoral defeat of the Democratic party's lifetime\n\nThere is not a single thing in a decent unjust country that the American left at the Democratic party has done by virtue of its behavior that warrants a stamp of approval of winning elections yet they win them within their closely contained\nBases districts and states their enclaves\nWhich is actually a very small portion of this country in terms of square mileage\nPopulation centers of the big cities on the coasts and and the great lakes\nHere's the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but it's some things don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program and the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal democratic presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges who rule of law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this\nFolks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nThe numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not have the numbers\nTo implement and pass their agenda legislatively other words they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as laws in America\nThey have to rely on activists job just to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or ... before no nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its in its relevance its power and it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin I'll Fight and explains in one reason\nWhy why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land a rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that\nWas forced on the American people by a leftist activists judge and a majority on the Supreme Court and any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure\nThat's the left so despises insult hates that they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively\nThey need\nActivist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the\nPoint what they believe in\nThe idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\nThey\nCannot withstand legislative tests it's the same\nReason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years\nIf Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you running he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be\nThey routinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of Alexandria or gifts so Cortez who is one of the on display in a leftist district of New York is harmless\nBut you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that sounding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and besides you to stick in all these other things that are despicable we must do away with\nIt they don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively are you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review this every thing they want\nEverything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced on the country the country has been bludgeon into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the underway and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they sue you they try to ruin\nYou or they bully you or they harass you or what have you\nThis is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this is going to lead to this giant ... blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on them you're going to find a story saying yeah it's over Democrats when and when bang and even the Republicans think so\nA P has them Reuters has some\nNew York times CNN doesn't matter where you go there's always going to be a story where Republicans agree it's over the Republican is deathly afraid Republican scared to death no way they can resist that coming blue wave\nSorry don't buy it\nMay happen I don't buy it\nI don't trust anything I say on the news anymore and I certainly don't trust the bunch of polling data\nGiven what\nFallacies existed in both the news and polling leading up to two thousand six team\nHere is a story [noise] [noise]\nI'm a website called the Babylon and be a Democrats shorter and idea of having to legislate through Congress should Supreme Court lean right\n\n[noise] I I don't know if this site is legitimate or not or if it's if it's a hoax site what they're doing a satire on the truth because it absolutely is the case they are petrified\nOf of capital a Kevin are being on the court simply because of the shift in the courts that it represents\n\nBuddies undeniable functions factual it's right in front of us they have not been able\nTo succeed\nImplementing the leftist socialist communist agenda via the United States Congress they can do it in their state legislatures I give you some places like California and so forth they haven't been able to do it nationwide it has to be for them\nAnd of course for that to work for the use of force to work you have to have to it\nYou after it came to the bullying which has happened on gay marriage it's happened on transgender bathroom issues it's happened on every oddball leftist cultural demand out there they count on everybody caving they count on everybody suing for peace until Donald Trump came along\nLives

I Wish you could live forever and be on the airwaves forever\n[laughter] and I took her thank you very much [noise] I'm just a quick question for you um\nYou know I think that the senators knew they weren't going to get the votes of the Democrat senators that is to oppose Kevin are and make make sure he's not on the bench and the Supreme Court so I was wondering [noise] um do you think that\nThe way they framed him with the media is something they're going to use later on to find the entire Supreme Court [noise]\nWhen they don't get their way bingo [noise]\nThat's already been done the de

Kagan who was the dean at Harvard law and hire the guy was so good she's not a Supreme Court justice thanks for Obama she has said it would not be good for him to be on the court it would not be good too controversial the integrity of the court would come into question\nThere's no question this is what the left does they lose control over an institution the institution loss in their minds is corrupt unreliable and must be eliminated from the power structure\nYou're exactly right the assault on Kavanaugh are going to continue and they will\nBecome as they already are assault on the court and rulings itself [noise]\n\nPainting and surpassing all audience expectation every day Rush Limbaugh here behind them old and I\nGot an email from a friend rush you are so right you're so right so often it's scary\nAnd you've convinced me that the leftist right\nRussia I have to confess my son Eddie came out of the womb skiing all over everybody female Dr nurses even his own mother and sure enough my son appears to be growing up to be a white guy\nSee what'd you say is true in the white patriarchal power structure at work\nI Love the satirical reaction [noise] that's what the left is asking everybody [noise] to believe [noise]\nFolks I I'm I'm telling you these kids that have now become adults but maintain this\nAdolescent degree of range psychological disorders and what have you may have been taught this stuff and they really haven't been taught\nThat the founding of America was one of the greatest injustices in the fall of\nHumanity and anybody other than white men are victims and if you are a white woman happily\nIn a relationship with a white man then you're part of the sellout you're part of the problem you're letting everybody down and you are subordinate in yourself to the patriarchy for the benefits that you get\nYou get a relationship you get an income you'll get a nice house you've got a family and so you\nAre a sellout and I'm not exaggerating this is what they're teaching and this is what these young people believe\n\nThe audio soundbites we've talked about this woman before Rebecca Traister she was on C. span two on Saturday\nSaturday show called afterwards what does she was running for attorney general ... is an attorney general and she said something outrageously stupid that we highlighted here and I forgot what it is but it's in the Alexandria\nOcasio Cortez fame and it just it it just after nine stupid I Wish I could remember it it's in our show our cars but this is the first I think maybe we've had a sound bite her before but this is\nAn appearance about a book that she has written called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nAnd the host of this CSPAN afterwards show is Rutgers University women's engender studies professor Brittany Cooper\nQuestion if the devastating to me that if a white women cannot have a public life private life professional life or even protest in what are we to do\nLet me read that question again it feels devastating to me that if white\nWomen cannot have a public life for private life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white linen before we take they started seriously or or I think it's an do we also acknowledge that we need to wake the white women and\nAnd their power their products will power can be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed\nAnd then in fact this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask do we need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported Kavanaugh and I don't know if it was so much that white women supporting Kavanaugh is that they were ... it it is scared to death at what they saw being set up\nAgainst men they have sons they have brothers\nAnd anybody with half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind just see the Democratic party had a line the itself in such a way\nThat men were told not to lay guilty simply because they exist\nSimply because they are capable in fact [noise]\nLet's see there's actually a story with that exact point may the here and I think I moved to the bad bottom of the stack but it is it is a woman making the point that Kevin wrong\nIs as good as guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it\nBecause he has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe both the Ford that Kevin ... could have done it or if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this\nKaren I Know somebody listening is in a similar situation and could use your service what's the best way to get in touch

sexual assault folks I don't think they Carol with about it it was just the most convenient way of attacking and getting rid of Kevin other too many Democrats who commit sexual assault if they never complain about for the Democrats don't really care about Bob Menendez senator in New\nJersey he was caught it went to trial over having sex with some underage women in the Dominican Republic he's got a ten points reelection lead Democrats don't care about that is look at Bill Clinton Ted Kennedy any number of of\nDemocrats that you can point out yeah they've they've had their sacrificial lambs like Harvey Weinstein but they don't get rid of too many actual elected political people unless they are\nConvinced of getting rid of ... going to hurt them\nBut they stand by the ones that they think they need but Kavanaugh was not even about sexual assault folks that was just the uh the hook that was just the train they decided to ride to\nThe railing the nomination anyway Derek and hazel in Pennsylvania you are up right to habeas are high\nA rush to begin to your show you are you at a rhetorical question about the does the Democrats really believe in this this new tactic with the mob and amend the Democrats learning surgeon said they become a political uncertainty and as you know what if they're just either to feed it\nThey just change tactics\nThe new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine balls before they had a two for that someone that not only educates argued\nThat someone that was going to put on a suicide vest for oh I just think that this is the new battlefront and thankfully we have Trump who cannot has put some ... on the spine of Republicans\nAre ... true true but maybe I'm maybe I'm silly for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since\nYou have talked to is willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency is you've described it which is this behavior but just that we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was\nWidely publicized Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make he rose up for these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so\nThey got an elevators they shouted these people down to the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think the American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it\nOr do you think the American public doesn't care one way or the other end doesn't even really notice it [noise]\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue color class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow\nUm increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely that that the American people are going to be turned off\nAnd I I think it's all going to come down to a who who was able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty\nLet me okay this is my ... I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think that Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this one is that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats are just succeeded in getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king book titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to punish this month just common for the way they have treated in this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans are not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kinda frustrating to me but that's the case [noise]\nDemocrats thinks they're going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election uh Democrats think the whole country is except they really\nDon't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\n\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people going to be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energize I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think ... says the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the the event had happened and what twenty nine days let it happen\nA true yeah when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is going to be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lot of people I saw him on Fox say a lot of learning puns and commentators oh this was going to be so old by the end I actually heard a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet I just have to chuckle\nUm\nThat I can I can see with the passage just be you cannot main thing and this\nRiver passion for long nobody can welded but we're talking about I'm Talking about reasonable people I'm I'm I'm saying it's it's understandable to me that some passion on our side is going to fade there's still a month ago the other side\nThey had been chomping at the bit since election night two thousand sixteen and they're only getting more\nAnd Rush Limbaugh middle\nShiite fees for\nThe latest news Adam we're talking about you know Ninety three point\nWFL Larry your brain is an amazing thing but as you get older it naturally begins to change causing a lack of sharpness or even trouble with recall thankfully\nThe breakthrough in privileges helps your brain and actually improve memory the secret is an ingredient originally discovered in jellyfish in clinical trials production has been shown to improve short term memory ... healthier brain better life\nNow available in stores everywhere things up and evaluate anybody at the product is not intended to ... prevent any disease\nDoes your dog itch scratch stinkers shed like crazy come to dynamite for help order Ninety Days supply of dynamite pick up two bottles of liquor chops get the third bottle free new improved liquor chops with omega six omega three vitamin E. and now it's six extra direct fed microbial\nEven better for the digestive tract and immune system and dogs love it try liquid shops by to get one free this is Henry look authentic for die by\nNow I Can't [laughter]\nWherever LA [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd it's all most identical than Democrats weren't enraged at the Supreme Court stopped the count\nIn Florida of the hanging chads the Democrats believe that the Supreme Court Hamdan George W. Bush the victory illegally\nNever mind the Florida Supreme Court was out of control the way it was handling all the legal issues\nHere the U.S Supreme Court heading to step in and stop it because it was out of control and when they did the Democrats were fit to be tied and from that day forward George W. Bush was an illegitimate president\nAnd he didn't stop being illegitimate and they finally got his approval numbers down to the money's six years later\nIn the middle of his second term so we get the two thousand two and it's the first chance the Democrats have to pay that country back to pay the Republicans back to pay Bush back and they\nAre going to retake the house and they're going to retake the Senate and they're going to reopen the Florida recount and they're going to make sure that justice\nIs finally done and that Al Gore being duly recognizes it legitimate winner of the presidency\nEven though Al Gore didn't want to be part of it by that time\nThey were feeling so up so shore so confident\nThat when it came time for a memorial for their late great senator from Minnesota Paul Wellstone they totally blew up what was intended to be a memorial\nHonoring and celebrating the life of Wellstone\nIt was about three weeks [laughter] prior to the mid term elections in November of two thousand two\nThe Wellstone memorial was hijacked by activists Democrats and turned into a store Paul lyrical rally\nThe purpose of which was to destroy George W. Bush and Republicans in memory of Paul Wellstone Republican senators who were friends of Wellstone who's doing it for you showed up at the arena\nThey did this arena in a place that whole Fifteen thousand people if my memory serves ten Fifteen thousand people\nIt was some time after a while most of them died in the plane crash and it was some time after that but this was the official memorial and it was\nI don't think it was ever intended to be a memorial I think it was a political event from the get go disguised as a memorial anyway Republican senator is not knowing up from dominance I'm Trent Lott into\nBoys all showed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial\nA religious memorials honor their former colleague Paul Wellstone\nThey worm booty and bullied and harassed out of the place within thirty minutes of having a driver didn't sat down\nIt was identical to what we saw the way Jeff Flake and others were assaulted in elevators animal hallways of the Senate office building\nExcept this was after memorial and this was a Democrat voters going up to the worthy Republicans receded and getting in their faces and pointing fingers at 'em and Boeing at them they thought\nThey were there to participate in a solemn occasion they got up and they walked out and they left and this memorial turned in\nTo a hate fast a hate fast aimed at George W. Bush a hate fast aimed at George W Bush's policies they couldn't even set aside what had happened on nine eleven for this memorial\nThis Morial took place about fourteen months after nine eleven\nTook place so then the men terms a curve\nAnd I remember I was in my this is the last time this happened I was invited for election night coverage on NBC Tim Russert asked me to join him and Tom Brokaw I Do to fully accepted and I went\nAnd I was not on camera all night maybe four or five times while they they cycled other people through and they brought\nMe and after it was clear that the Republicans hadn't gained ... seats on heard of\nThe Democrats just like now we're supposed to win big because the Democrats\nTold it everybody hated Bush everybody of resented the way the Supreme Court stole the election for Bush\nThat Al Gore had won the popular vote just like three [laughter] and then the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and nine eleven and Bush's general stupidity and competence and as such couldn't not wait for the Democrats to take back control of what is right\nProbably there's Washington DC except it didn't happen the Republicans gained ... seats Tim Russert was great broke all brought me out and so what do you think happened here I said the Wellstone memorial\nBut Wellstone memorial is what happened and I went on and told them why in a truncated version of what I just said they knew they were shell shocked\nThey were shell shocked is just not in the formula the party in power does not pick up seats\nIn mid term elections the first ones after a new president is elected so that's a formative experience for me\nAnd if it's unlike ... if it's happened once it's going to happen again something that hasn't happened before probably won't happen but if it has then it can happen again\nAnd this is a replay of that except this is a replay of even more outrageous behavior but we'll still memorial took place on one night the Democrat Party has been insane on display for two full years\nAnd actually longer than that but in the in the context of Trump's election it's been two consistent ears of public arrangement public insanity\nPsychological disorders on display childlike temp by the way I too have sat in the Senate gallery\nAs a young boy my parents took my brother and me in Washington DC one summer and the Senate was in session and I'll Remember a Barry Goldwater was among the senators speaking when we were there he was speaking on the farm bill\nI was fourteen or Fifteen\nAnd I remember being in the gallery and I had a it was a pamphlet or a book some some kind of a a manual explaining what the Senate was and what was going on and I was turning the pages and the Senate page came and grabbed that book\nAway from me and said you're making too much noise I'll give you this back after you leave just turning up page was not permitted\nThe gallery could not do anything more than ...\nYou were not allowed to chew gum people\nWere chewing gum and the pages said you're leaving Russia or putting it in a piece of paper and tossing it you're not staying in here to income\nThey would come which for this to you they took my little pamphlet a way\nI felt like they just stop all had just come and then I'm watching this thing the other night in these in these these these these women are\nGoing batty sounding literally like they are infants out of the loan that and they don't want to be there and I couldn't even make out what they're saying it\nLike Christian Adams said it sounded like we were in the middle of an asylum in there and Tom my pencil saying over and over the sergeant alarm started an arm to restore order\nSheets when you use my name is the ... code free shipping to boot beautiful packaging\nBalding branch dot com V.

loves the Ford and could not backup or corroborate her story that has not happened that did not happen in the hearings\n... got away with being credible as far as the hearings were concerned only when when Trump unloaded and told American during his rally that she can't tell anybody where it happened when it happened what year it happened where the house was\nHow she got home what she said after it happened to whoever none of it\nThe people that she said were there all for the night at the American people didn't know that the drive by sitting reported Trump was the turning\nPoint chronic

need a ... a member of their own party\nYeah ... ... they had their chance to do that and and uh they didn't want to go there\nBecause they couldn't take the risk of offending people who believe bossy\nBut the fact of the matter is and I will say and again the Democrats don't care about sexual assault\nAs evidenced by your recitation of the facts of what happened the women who accused Bill
