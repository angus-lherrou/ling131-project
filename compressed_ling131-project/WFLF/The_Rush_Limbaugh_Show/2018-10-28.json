you got to be aware of the studies that have been done on lottery winners there is a preponderance of bankruptcy I mean how can a lottery winner go bankrupt hey Michael Tyson had three hundred million dollars and ended up bankrupt\nPeople think it's a bottomless pit more okay one point six billion is pretty bottomless but it's not it's only four hundred Ninety two million metal taxes in a lump sum\nIf not a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start throwing out a lot of money to family and friends and charities you'd be amazed how fast you can plug for the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced they end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say I'm going to keep going in my work every day like always now you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful because they got to be there

know what you can do for them in whatever you do for them\nAin't going to be enough and their opinion\nLet me give me another reason why I didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket\nIf you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying the lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invested into the U.S and the five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five years I'm On the bet\nYou'll have more than a million dollars guess what you'll have\nWon the lottery of course past

here says question he sent to ask Rick and Rick Edelman dot com\nDirect this is George from California\nMy in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for those states needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stock investments since they could earn over three percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation rate\nSo Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks face this question in my older years I'm In my seventies my ... my nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even find curb massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and the money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed investments that\nThey might not pay much interest I might only pay one or two or three percent but so what you don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you tried to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of a good\nSo traditionally we would argue don't take any more risk than is necessary\nTo achieve your goals\nBut let me turn that inside out and give you a different reason why you might want to consider\nRiskier investment strategy and their strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nYou're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago\nBut the money into those call today but think about this when you die who get that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse\nAnd ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast view and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids you could argue that that money really isn't yours is ... and you are merely the steward\nHere the custodian you're the caretaker of that money and if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs\nAnd the achievement of their financial goals\nFor then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind\nMeaning that if your son or daughter had the million dollars they invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that net of taxes than inflation is growing and real economic terms\nTherefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age but based on ... and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us ... sit down with one of my colleagues here at the firm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic\nLook at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources and design what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it\nAs an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George thanks so much for your question and if you would like to have this

managing debt saving money and invest in for the future they both shown some interest but more so my son\nI got a book from the library which my son read the entire thing and when it's very excited when he read something about how to invest you know three thousand dollars from a summer job into a rough IRA in forty years later it's worth the you know big number it was all excited and told me Dan I'm going to be a millionaire\nSomeday I'd like to continue\nUm you know that thirst for knowledge but didn't find anything more at the local library for him to read however I Would also like him to

inflation and market last moves and now here's Chuck\nChuck our welcome to hidden wealth radio\nWell we're talking tax folks and for those of you listening that you're concerned about your taxes\nFolks who should be um I'm going to talk to you about the biggest trap that prevents baby boomers from having the retirement outcome that they could have that ends up being different because of not having a proven tax savings strategy to save them\nThe most unnecessary tax folks I Want to share with you that what you do now\nHas to be in in in implemented before the end of Eighteen for you to save taxes for twenty Eighteen and why I think this is so important\nUh yeah I'm I'm somebody that writes books and has national radio show but I I work with a certain number of clients each and every year and a half now going on twenty three years in the financial arena\nThat I've seen first hand the uninformed it I think a former federal judge hand said it best he said you know in America there are two tax systems one for the informed and one for the uninformed both\nAre legal and I think this article kind of says it all so if you're somebody listening and you save money towards retirement let's say a couple of hundred thousand or more typically for those of you listening to save money in tax deferred accounts meaning the it hasn't been taxed yet 'til you take it out\nYou should have some concerns and and I'll tell you why because there are so many tax traps that the government's counting on you believe me they're counting on you in a big way that's what I write about my books you become unnecessarily the perfect taxpayer\nYou see one of the articles out this week says why retirees tax rates may be higher than they expected says higher income retirees may see their tax brackets fall\nBut still face higher levels or levies of tax because of tax on their Social Security or tax on their Medicare part B and be right through the form of higher premiums\nConsidering the additional taxes many will see a marginal tax rate that could jump as high as forty percent\nOf folks think about it in in in at a time when the greatest tax cut is ever been passed and our country's history people are going to face higher taxes\nAnd it's like I've said for years with the government give us the government take us away and you've got to be informed right if you're going to save the most you've got to be informed the most talked about a few clients like yourselves friends and neighbors other boomers that have basically said well you know\nThis is Charles Oliver I understand why you do what you do folks my story simple I I can tell you how to overpay tax I over pay tax for years\nBut being a a well strategist in in writing in teaching\nIn teaching tax attorneys in CPAs and and really learning the impact of how retirement ties into taxes it's amazing how many people were overpaying unnecessarily they're overpaying tax and it could all be prevented and I want to teach you how you can eliminate\nThe IRS out of your IRAs getting the government out of your tax return I'll I'll talk to you about clients that have legally zeroed out their tax liability\nI talked about how people actually untaxed their IRA money how people can avoid having up to eighty five percent of their Social Security taxed\nBecause folks many people are being cut off guard and some of you listening I've had the opportunity to sit with and you've shared yourselves while truck I had no idea of this tax scam that the government and Social Security holds\nA we I would've never know and I had a client in this week that said gosh we've been with the same advisor for Twenty years and he's never mentioned is\nFolks reality as it\nGets tiring it into a comprehensive plan right it's not just what you make as we've all heard right it's what you keep\nIn in in learning and teaching and seeing and having a real life experience\nWith what it means to be self employed and pay taxes on taxes and seen a unfortunately people that are more in the accounting area of taxation not the tax savings area of taxation it's kind of a rigged game\nTo be quite candid and the reality is ... you've got to become informed in order to benefit the most\nAnd you know even when we look at what what\nSay a book out called the ... rules of retiring rich one of the main goals are one of the main rules I should say was the rich stay rich because they are savvy enough not to let Uncle Sam to too much of their money in other words\nRight they understand that being informed legally ethically morally to reduce your taxes is perfectly allowed it's just the government has a tax plan for you\nIf you don't have a tax plan for yourself and when you think about this that the deficit ride the treasury just reported that the deficit for fiscal year twenty team ... said over seven hundred and eighty billion its up Seventeen percent right now what kind of peculiar about that\nRight when you really think about it is that in in the end unusual jumped in a year which unemployment hit a five decades low right that the economy experienced a significant expansion\nRight but the increase demonstrates that the tax cuts signed into law late last year have reduced federal revenues considerably even against the backdrop of the booming economies to think about it in an economy that just booming and similar view is shared that Ryan and we've been blessed to have this booming economy the reality is\nTaxes are are are unfortunately going to have to be collected more heavily\nBecause the revenues are falling falling because more people retiring so they're not consuming as much because now they're conserving but also the fact that we've had these tax cuts on top of ten thousand people retiring a day\nAnd on Monday This past week the treasury reported that revenues acts that were predicted to be three point five three trillion were only three point three three trillion which is a two hundred billion dollar shortfall\nAnd guess folks where they're going to collect that shortfall\nYeah they're going to click the shortfall from the people that have worked the hardest to save the hardest are going to get tax the hardest right and the tax the\nCost the boomers can avoid that's costing them the most or will cost of the most\nIs taxation and the irony is the area that's causing people to most gets the least amount of attention until tax day rolls around so I Want to give a battle cry a shot across the bow of the importance\nOf thinking about taxes before the end of that President tax year right so what you can do to save tax has to be done and twenty teen if you want to save taxing twenty Eighteen\nAnd here's the reality that tax sale that's on with this new tax reform bill is only going to run through twenty twenty five so to take advantage of\nEach and every year Eighteen being the first year to take advantage of this this tax sale is vital you see a couple of people has learned that over the next years they can completely untaxed their IRAs which means they won't have any require minimum distribution\nThey'll think about that in in a year that we have ... of the first year implemented of the greatest tax cut in our country's history\nMany retirees taxes are actually going up and folks I see it first hand I've witnessed it I can talk to you about a few clients that that hit home that we just met with this past week right so for example [noise]\nAh I think of Marty and daddy okay and Marie and daddy had no idea about having up to eighty five percent of their Social Security being taxed\nRight but they also didn't realize that they could actually zero out their entire taxable income for two thousand and eight team which is one of our hidden well tax savings solution strategies and they were able to do that\nI think Don and Steve um they had some highly appreciated assets that they sold this year and as a result of that was exposing them to a massive capital gain and some of you may be the same we rented a lot of clients have sold now that real estate's come back they sold off\nA ... you know fully depreciated out rental property or commercial building a or a business and the capital gain is pretty sizable\nAnd unfortunately that game then gets transferred onto their ten forty and then it's looked upon to determine then how much of that as as a taxable income is then going to subject taxing their Social Security\nHow much of the as an example of they're required minimum distribution\nThat for those of you listening that's when you hit Seventy and a half some of the view that are Seventy half know exactly what I'm saying that the government then forces you to take a certain percentage it's a universal percentage formula\nOut of all the totaling of your IRAs that you have one or more however many you have they are going to take the total and then force you to take out a distribution if you don't take it it's a fifty percent penalty of what the distribution should have been\nAnd folks I just met with the client this last week whose requirement of distribution was almost Ninety thousand dollars because he waited and waited and waited he deferred deferred deferred and now the day of tax reckoning has hit him and as a result now in it he at AT and his wife it eighty eight they're paying more taxes in retirement\nThan the amount of taxes that they pay to their highest wage earning years books we see this time and time again but the good as as it doesn't have to be that way also think of mark and Donna\n[noise] who legally on tax their IRAs right so they they took money out of virus but they they that's a district distribution of of of tax exposure but they used another section of the code with the hidden well tax savings solution to them directly offset that tax with a tax deduction\nIn essence zeroing out the tax liability on their IRAs which means they will have those pesky required minimum distributions because they were before the age of seven and a half which is the ultimate goal is not to have requirement of distributions for those of you listening to have requirement of distributions let me talk to you about Mick\nMix somebody that had requirement um distributions and we actually eliminated\nHim ever having another required minimum distribution by using a proven tax savings solution this year in twenty team\nFolks are you ready for the taxes are going to pay in twenty four twenty team or are you ready to see how much unnecessary tax you can avoid for twenty eight team right one of the most important steps that people can take is getting informed dry\nTaxes are on sale folks but they're not going to be on sale for long back Andrew shelling said don't wait to get ready for the twenty Nineteen tax season right avoid making huge tax mistakes the head of the next year right were ahead of retirement\nEven goes on to say to validate seniors are likely to pay unnecessary taxes in retirement if they fail to avoid making financial mistakes before they retire\nAccording to marketwatch to improve their future right clients should not assume that they're going to move into a lower tax bracket and they should avoid ending up being forced to have a high or large required distribution because that sets off a triggering of other forms of taxation\nRight and when you have more money in your pocket and let's go into the government folks that's money for you to use for your grandchildren for your travels to visit and do the things you can do while you're still allows you to do them and don't forget what judge hand said right because it's true and I've seen it I I'm somebody that you're listening to that for years\nOverpaid unnecessary taxes and then got super serious\nAbout learning what the ultra wealthy do and what the tax savvy due to pay my legal least required amount share and unpatriotic folks I have no problem paying tax I just have a problem paying tax not required to pay and he said it best you said you know in America there to tax systems one for the informed one for the uninformed but both are legal\nFolks get informed here's the opportunity\n[noise] I'm going to give those of you that are very curious to say how much tax and my overpaying or how much unnecessary tax can I be avoiding and especially for those of you that are likely predicting your taxes are going to be higher\nIn twenty maybe you sold a highly appreciated asset\nOr maybe you you this was the first year you had your required minimum distribution maybe some of you this is the first year you elected your Social Security maybe that's some of you ... have not requested or locked in your application or choice excuse me of election of Social Security because\nYou may find that you can prevent that Social Security for being taxed like one of our clients we were able to show them how to avoid having up to eighty five percent of their Social Security tax and you know what it had everything to do\nWith whether he they were going to elect the lump sum pension option from the employer or the pay out of the monthly payment\nFrom the employer you see if he elected the payout from the employer for the rest of his wife and his wife's Social Security eighty five percent of it would have been tax which would have given up anywhere from six to ten thousand a year of unnecessary taxes as the Social Security benefit continue to draw higher\nFolks simply email here's what we're doing um ah we're we're there's

I'm a farm guy whether you know that are remembered I have a dairy farm and I feed the cows\nThese alfalfa color so you have those\nYes of course it was very funny uh I came home from school and started ... of stuff in my pocket is holding the next morning I threw the back to the cereal out to the chickens in the yard and filled my breakfast goal was to these ... put milk and starting to my mother was horrified she's animals so you can't eat it\nDad said let them eat it and then three days that most cured because of the vitamins and minerals in the alfalfa pellets and because you know we supplement these al ... has alfalfa and soybeans and corn and other stuff\nAnd we put vitamins minerals in there [noise]\nAnd so I carry myself in\nThree days with these alfalfa ... vitamins minerals in it as opposed to five years or twenty doctors twenty different doctors couldn't figure it out and all all their medications examinations and everything\nAnd so that got me started when I was nine um went to school I wanted to be\nA scientific farmer and my roommate I was wrestling the University of Missouri so they put me in with the athletes in my room mate [noise] um there's ... of trying to get into very school and I didn't want to do that yeah come along anyway so I tried and sure enough I got put in very school and that started me off and that well then jumping forward to Nineteen Seventy seven after\nMy thesis was in the Smithsonian Institute isn't as a national treasure from those twenty thousand autopsies\nI'm working at ... primate center in Atlanta Georgia and Emory University and discover the first non human case of cystic fibrosis supposed to be the classic example of a genetically transmitted disease and birth defects\nAnd I've found that to to make little search aren't there was a simple nutritional deficiency during pregnancy or after a pregnancy could reverse it and they fired me he said while like you can't see this as a [noise] a simple nutritional deficiency is it genetic disease well again you know test me because it's not a genetic disease and they fired me\nAnd I went back to school and became a physician because they knew that they weren't they treat the kids right so that sort of got me started trading humans [noise]\nSo you have a degree or a doctor a veterinary medicine and you have a doctorate you have a you're a doctor primarily\n... medicine\nYeah when they call a ... D\nYou know what the deal is a is a osteopathic okay house you panic physician so I'm In ... Dr ... yeah yeah and there's the ... yeah\nSo you used to all of this to come up with all the series the lectures your experiences over the years and I guess we have the occasion from time to time to talk to you directly spend an hour or so together and and have the opportunity to address\nSome of the things the alternative health approaches\nThat you have discovered at the first discovery at nine calcium or the vitamins and minerals that were in that alfalfa tell it do you think that stuff today is as good as it was when you were a kid\n[noise] oh yeah and probably even better than it was I was a kid and when you're talking about animal fees 'cause we have no insurance for them [noise] it'd be cautious twenty five bucks for a loaf of bread if if we weren't putting vitamins minerals and alfalfa pellets or\nA for animals and so the reason why people have economical source of food and stays there because we do give animals livestock these nutrients and it kind of like an insurance policy and of course what I thought well why can't we do the same thing for people so I came up with a basic program they call the healthy stark pack\nNowadays dark back originally called Dr wallich pig arthritis for him and the gate and like that because they didn't\nLike he was the name of a disease with with\nThem or a nutrition and so I had to change it from Dr wallich bigger threat is formula to the pig back and people didn't like that so I changed it to the healthy stark pack\nAnd uh the healthy start pack of course gives you the Ninety essential nutrients sixty six zero mineral sixteen vitamins troll ... is that all vertebrates and that's that's the advantage I had um was it um I'm\nA most doctors are people from pharmacy departments are in universities or pharmaceutical companies when they do a study on a pharmaceutical they'll use a hundred white rats are fifty chicken or something like that or maybe a hundred people uh I did my study on twenty thousand\nOr vertebrates a four hundred and fifty four species of animals is Seventeen thousand than some change three thousand human beings twenty million chemistry is twenty million sized special things looking for polluting those so I can say that these are the animals to get the same problems when they get contact with the St Louis lead to looking for that canary in the mind so they can save\nAmericans from pollution way back then in the middle sixties [noise] and so that was an advantage dealing with four hundred and fifty force bases in great numbers twenty thousand ... tenor of fifty or a hundred [noise]\nAnd so I was saying things that were very obvious but nobody had been in place in a situation where they can see those things [noise]\nAnd so I had Seventy five scientific papers fourteen books and it came out of all that\nAnd I'm One of those things were a city of the many times in federal court ... for instance on the guy that got folic acid put into prenatal vitamins for events than it is a guy that are in January of two thousand Thirteen\nThat was my ninth to lawsuits against the FDA in federal court\nForce them to put a trace mental selenium into baby farms now we need sixteen

and so but I learned that his sudden death than sitting in the death syndrome and muscular dystrophy and says her bills are all caused by the efficiency of the same nutrients\nAnd so I force them to put an end to the baby farmers and you'll notice that last couple of years you haven't heard much about mustard ... are ... are setting them a desk syndrome because by putting that nutrient that one mineral into the baby formula is it eliminated those three major diseases\nUm and doctors are foolishly thought that babies died from setting him and this and are owned by getting tangled up and their

to deny it much as they would like to change it it is still the issue that keeps Donald Trump in the forefront of his supporters minds so I've been studying the media to trying to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending\nAlmost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may have even if it's just sixteen percent of their time on your show again they're not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it and building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating ...\nI'm stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show gave and of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just resigned themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen\nHint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure\nThat was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electric hasn't happened yet everybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a a\nMicrocosm of\nWhat's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf they're behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military now and they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump with their stories earlier this year about how he separated\nFamilies at the border and how Trump didn't all white the narrative and didn't want to blast so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this despite\nEverything that you think you know with common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\nAs elected still they are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not gonna do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump there's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't no doubt is the right where they would be my only disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than that it's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be somebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance say Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start\nWalking to the United states\nTo thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what conveyor politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because the money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden 'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it\nSeven thousand people to sign to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom we don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people killing things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams that what would the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the ... in the street and they get maps and San Francisco for tourists can blame the piles of human the fate [noise]\n[noise]\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing to get her I just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how many miles a day\nYou could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest\nFor the next day that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those every unreal Lyndon that's over three months\nAnd the objective is to show up\nRight as the polls open on mid term election day [noise] so if they haven't been walking for what two and a half months\nHave we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand in the word is it may become ten thousand [noise]\nAnd then of course ah ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan\nThan we are just hearing about Fox

happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why\nIt\nMakes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica\nWhat ever motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what takes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they've they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night pump pale who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging at a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nOne of the world is so damn hard to understand about this\nThink it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting and one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best\nThey're being driven solely by emotion govern ... by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a master a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and said to the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\n\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\n\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any\nThing in the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any room breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\n\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nA message from the national association of broadcasters education foundation and this station\n[noise] down to\nGet to that CNN [noise] CNN\nPlaying an impartial soundbite and made to make it look like I was trying to make the case of a shell game deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get through it uh in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification\nAnd I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert by again bill hammer outward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nThat this punt pales saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion\nAnd thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like\nThis but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop and invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because of ... that normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman government says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis is what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way through the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections what if we can make that case what do you think the people would eat demanding Trump do\nStand aside laughter seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the joke you never know who's listening I'm just asking what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God I was trying to get in\n\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized is the border that if they\nBomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this himself\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is the by the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own he leaves to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's

still works it's still rile people up\nDivides us horribly\nYeah oh it's just it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear every election there's Jeff Flake or

most commentators forget to mention\nThe Democrats have no issues the economy is booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased prince says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared ...\nIn contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any on us leftist for future generations the\nCapital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty the left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to the shore rains and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan\nThe whole Kavanaugh episode was was intellectually bankrupt it was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persisted with it even to the point of\nTearing not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared\nLess this is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has non left\nAs a surrogate Lerner says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday left just pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the ... only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America and hate America it does folks\nNot that every leftist hates America but the leftist either no right to alert or at Yale\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood as they hate his\nCertainty that America is exceptional\nAnd they hate his mistrust of intellectual they hate his love of simple ideas that work they have\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable\nAnd worst of all she doesn't have any ... except getting the job done his goals are to do the task before him\nNot be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself invents\nAnd uses I'll tell you folks this is a heck of a paragraph is instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocratic Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity a day but they sit there and hypocritical claimed to despise Trump's\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they\nHate he is certainty that America is decent than exceptional they hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have had some serious problems\nWith me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so certain that I didn't have any doubts about what I believed I've had so many people just not right and everybody is\nThat you you do some way to do nobody can be that\nKind of an open I Am I Know your full of it I Know you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this a you'd be

the conflict with\nTheir own now back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates him or because he's filthy rich always has been\nAnd unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever he never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities

it was only a few thousand\nPeople and then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality\nSaying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the order Johns and the ... making his eyes water so they use a mob\nThey don't want to say mark they use what whatever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people but it's good for them but when it's not good when they want to use the humanitarian side it's such a disaster\nBut there's you know thousands of the line well and they couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh and the ... the great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what to enemies doing or what they're up to you that for that day listen to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can you hear for\nWe've got a bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here about the only time I registered NPR is when they run pieces to translate what I've said\nOh for the audience and and then happened is why get\nThe soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\nA ... of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people we're\nBeing led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nTorn poverty and the violence and whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day citing believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human beings just to have a decent life you know in in in in ... and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an assault Mays grew with Trump Trump simpler trumps the Nazi this there's no doubt this was a political movement it has been orchestrated and designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American a southern\nAnd to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm\nA they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited and cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of deny the entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but there's no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of\nWhat's this guy's Jorge way most Ramos or whatever it is it is what does he tell among do ... what what what is a tell her tell her no but what is it Univision right and he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob\nWhere packs and three and four or walking by and by the way folks [laughter]\nThey don't look like they're kind of people you'd want to run in to [noise] you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at 'em they're behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder and he's now gene for\nHe's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and then there are different people and all they want is a better life and we as Americans we owe it to these people are what's up man that's all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how to work and this guy vouch\nFor whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him that these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nHe doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and is doing everything it can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead and TV pictures of thousands marching north\nHave the Democrats book asked about the\nTiming worry them a national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this\nEven before the caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them\n\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on immigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony in the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which she has doubled\nDown on by the way so this is a story trying to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this\nSome of the stuff in the media is literally mind boggling that that they they attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are every day anyway whether people show up and groups of two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind those and the reason I say this it may make no sense that makes a word that has this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this smoke they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta put yourselves\nIn their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and they've read in the New York times I'll Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's the co loaded with ... there's going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has been goods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them and I got ... out there promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done has worked in a White House at work that you can it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you\nTo look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nFit to be tied\nOver it they're at their which candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five

is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average\nAll of the so called response civil polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so combat and co founder of this place was on a C Fox Business network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top of it here and Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they have a real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave\nWas coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way and that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now is\nAnywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according
