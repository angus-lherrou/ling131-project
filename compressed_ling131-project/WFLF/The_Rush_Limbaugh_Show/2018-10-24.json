think the Republicans are behind this to try to scare Democrats away from going to the polls\nThat's a new one on me that just doesn't compute that that's not the kind of thing Republicans do\nIn fact you remember when Steve ... got shot by a deranged Democrat at congressional baseball practice you know what our side said\nWe did not make a political the Republicans in Congress said this speaks to all of us we join everybody in condemning this the Republicans did not attempt to make that part is in any way or to try to make hay out of it I'm not kidding go back and look at it if you've forgotten is\nThe Republicans did not make a point of singling out the guy as a Democrat and condemning the Democrats as essentially said that this is about all of us Republicans just don't have\nA behavioral history like this so it's a political staunch who is behind it and for what purpose\nWell the cabinet thing was a set up but it looked real for a while the Kevin off thing was a set up from the get go we of course here at the E R B network knew that about a lot of people thought it was real on tail it was exposed as a fraud the Democrats couldn't cover their bases long enough\n\nTo want

see this election as their last best chance to take down Trump and his agenda\nIt's October [noise] another way of looking at this\nFor the last few weeks the Democrats have had all of that horrible

way to do with that is still well what candidates that can bring us together\nAnd of course that means Democrats so you're ... by the way the bomb that was sent to the Clintons and Obama never got to

Clinton blamed Trump and Republicans for these devices [noise]\nSo I guess Trump and Jared Kushner had just got back from turkey after killing a shaggy right so Trump and of course they're going to

what's going on barring a the revelation of what really this is about if we ever learn that I think I'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative and you've watched everything\nBlow up on you you watch cabinet blow up you have watched uh the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you if all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in the airports in at restaurants at all that's blowing up on you\nAnd it is by the way it's not working what could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs storm\nRestaurants and harassed and threaten and bully Republicans\nWhat could you be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing that really makes any sense to show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system and what's so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans\nThat other people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans do not words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt just brandy hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got\nIs we hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment that's all they've got\nAnd so if none of that work if all of that backfired and bullied me and has especially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of words that has backfired on them like you cannot believe\n[noise]\nSo what would you do you might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side\nYou might want to do something to make it look likely in saying lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact of lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it\nOkay let's get some of the election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average all\nOf the so called response civil polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so combat and co founder of this place was on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top of it here and Tom ... all the polling data that they have it real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave\nIf a wave was calming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding\nMeaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... says but they're not building on anything\nThere's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of seven day competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five states twenty five and a half so two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold\nThe house [noise] so all of\nThis synthesized and stripped away and it went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising all her on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans and gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past

could be missing a Republican syringe\nHere's why certainly looks like Democrats will do well in the midterms but this cycle present some unusual risks for pollsters not ... the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all\nThis down for the last six months the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys a showing everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's got to beat curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge and guess what\nThey're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen Hillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it\nIt's a good reminder that even mid October surveys mislaid change the story written before the bombs\nCould it happen again it probably won't don't worry about Bloomberg says but it did in ... and it could go either direction Democrats could still win big or they could lose make it go even ... what what is this an decision all\nOf a sudden versus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\n[noise]\nPolls couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months\nYou name it then when the polls have to be shown to be correct so they still have their reputations all of a sudden it could be really\nReally close much closer than we ever ever new it's a cycle and you can print it\nGuy answering that question seriously [noise]\nMany Republicans right now in the midst of this political campaigns on a [noise]\nTwo thousand sixteen midterms how many how many Republicans [noise] because they\nHave the Clintons or Obama on their radar\n\nSo no I mean how how many are are the Clintons an obstacle to the upcoming midterms the Clinton no ... is Obama an obstacle and they know what the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar except they are today\nI mean the Clintons announced yet this at Clinton's announced this nationwide Katie I'm sure third teen locations stadium tour they're gonna charge admission for people to come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and\nTalk about politics what\nWhat if there isn't a whole lot of interest in math [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clinton sucked on anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest\nThat happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state and Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phone in collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred in so much anger their wife and I remember I hear it's not safe that just it's just too packed it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what in form\n... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is [noise] uh we'll see we'll let time on the phone\nHere in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Raasch then within that there was a kid or riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate it thank you very much\nFor us you know it's a you talked about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh we have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting these bombs in the mail\n[noise] you know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be run by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information it's just not out there for the masses to obtain you know there was never any country to use devices to make their way through their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right on me to point fingers at certain de but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats the proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't stoop to everything from they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to they'd even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that will tell\nGoing along along those lines if you want to look at it that way it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning leaves elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be\nInstant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever ... flip\nThat flip that around would\nIt make a lot of sense for a democratic operative word Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today\nAnd the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have assured us for the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe their lives remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and I believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like think Kavanaugh trick backfires and these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the Swedes here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously a set up\nRight on the money here Here's Mark in Orlando or as I guess Orlando\nIn Florida right to have you here with us mark ...\nMake it did U.S Russia a truly an honor to speak with you so well I was holding for you a couple of things popped in my head and I'll get to the point two seconds\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and and you know and and homo and all these guys and then Brennan the deep state\nAnd this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOh yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to all about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nWill tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the health of east\nUm there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight with signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and you know what you're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and got my slippers that kinda thing right\nIt was a point it was a plant it and it was all the it was all nonsense to garner empathy in\nSeparate it was already planning to go to waste it was Hillary's plant
