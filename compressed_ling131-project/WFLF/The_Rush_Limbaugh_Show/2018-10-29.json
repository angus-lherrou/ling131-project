be selling it saying a Democrat part of the first thing I think they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad deed to the Republican Party or\nThe phone call conservative movement and of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly I'm worn out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up to during the Obama administration there were mass murders and no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory\nTo say that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passed a law anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up when it then\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world we're trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence a bunch of government bureaucrats and left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system\nMeanwhile Obama is lying to everybody about it claiming that if they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not\nCalled out not reported and then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not how\nMany years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens the Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets fixed\nIt's why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [noise] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party or it's the fault of a president's and and so predictable 'cause they hate the president will do anything they can to get rid of him\nThey spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger and\nIt's it we were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person it did it\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not think of somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the Trump\nWell I I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\n\nEven though whether we can even get away from it from the winner extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump\nBecause we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global

Dr buys cropped bar icon out of the photos\nOne of the examples those at the funeral for Aretha Franklin at any rate uh your Democrats are demanding a Trump told it now did you love it when Trump said I have sounded down if you want me to hold it back up by well\nDonald Trump was elected to be different Donald Trump was elected because people were fed up\nWith politics as usual I must tell you this people set up a politics see the Democrats in the media politicizing everything it's not going to send people running the Democratic party quite the opposite of what the media thanks\nTo the meeting and the Democrats obviously think that a majority of the American people want to see the country the way the Democrats do throughout the lens of everything being political\nAnd people don't want to see it that way the Democrats and the media telling Trump to tone it down\nBut they tone nothing down themselves what was it the mayor of Baltimore said the protesters we need to give them space to destroy we need to stand back and let them get it under their system\nThey say nothing when Republicans were gunned down they abuse power to hide the Hillary's crimes to fix elections to runs silent coups against a duly elected president\nSo the left wants Trump to tone down his efforts at self defense that's what Trump is doing he's assaulted he said countless times if I'm here I'm going to hit back\nWhen Trump is blamed for the actions of a lunatic he's told to be more dignified remain silent be like Mitt Romney would be a be reserve\nDidn't so forth\nBoth just sit back let Occupy Wall

Washington\nPeople under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not a Donald Trump is it wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political\nStunts\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you just sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're going to have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy being elected and he's supposed to sit there and take it\nHe wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was weird and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works in Washington\nNot personal just business just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined\nAnd he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed\nTo fight for himself Trump ditto not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up for us today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nI can tell you that last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down to one\nWell it's been happening in school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented and then you have a mayor who's very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop that's what we need is more gun control\nI mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control markets are not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the ones who tells you are but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you see it's really not about guns he thinks it is and it's important but it's not really about guns it's\nAbout something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't pay if it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that's kept but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] ah yeah and you you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except Denise ... but but but but but but\nWe're all for freedom as we define that he mentioned\nThis let's go to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with um [noise] Trump himself this is this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked a\nOn Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews\nIt used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by to unify them all the cotton joint base\nWhere multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's for air force one is parked for Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter said\nMr President do you think you need to revisit seem\nSo a guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill\nAnd the first question a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit\nGun laws [noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\n\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things [noise] anti\nSemitism they think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focus on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nThe worst part is that the rightful owners of those names never had a clue who he was they never had a clue they were being ripped off until retailer started calling

I thought\nThat's exactly right but this is where this was all headed this was all headed towards atheism anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the Web or whatever they claim their

rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so\nThis event in Pittsburgh did it did it\nAnd to any of the uh discomfort or an easier having about things in general\nI I I don't\nI don't feel like that there's a ... million people out there targeting I'd choose in a way that they would Monica she'd have to bring it on I think that that these are isolated is an

I I mean I Know I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because they didn't Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think I Trump has anything to do it at that absolutely

you thank you so much\nRachel I preach that's racial Thousand Oaks California [noise] um [noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with them in terms of a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what you think I'm wrong or you\nYeah I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after Caesar say a dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipe bombs none of which exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by and the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember\nAnd even Trump alluded to the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that OK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people to politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people look politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this is going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\nI have an entirely different fates why I did the show open today that I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people\nIn fact I think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday shows yesterday with is the attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nInto the public domain hoping the influence people to abandon Trump and it hasn't happens to these two events come along and they have it on this ... this has to be what it is they're thinking [laughter] and they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started\nAsking the president what he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible and what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how is washing the solution Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be punished is where the enemies of the laughter going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the left is

rampant and on the rise all against the backdrop of the ugliest political climate in modern times at the center and unapologetically incendiary president on travelling by traditional norms of civility\nTraditional norms of civility they do know that\nTrump is a reactionary he's reacting to the way they treat him\nAnd there may be\nBlamed to go around on both sides here but for the media just totally claim they've got nothing to do with this is\nAbsurd now here's Matthew Dowd this guy formally and George W.\nBush Republican now he's gone off to the dark side on ABC\nI Would put specific responsibility on the president said he has an obligation to try to read us up much of this tribalism and I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years is helpful Matt ...\nOh yes he says oh Trump's fault all of this is Trump's fault and\nThe media wants to be exempted from any impact ... they they damn well one of the things they influence opinion and shape the outcome of elections but they don't want to be held any kind of responsible for what people do the same time that seems in Congress to me here when they when they get called out\nOn this they deny it this is a montage Tom boss search who a former national security adviser and Stephanopoulos and\nMary Jordan of the Washington Post I Want them to be calm but I don't think\nThat the American viewers

like that is normal life\nSo when ... calls them out oh yeah I don't think Trump responsible for a ... and it was a murder we didn't say there's no well we didn't see that Matthew Dowd but he is responsible for his own for the rhetoric that led to murder\n[laughter]\nNo they are so they they when when they're when they're confronted with what they're actually saying then they pulled back and

getting away with the idea that they are the compassionate people and the tolerant people and their side has no hate and their side as no bigotry and so forth [noise]\nWhen it's the exact opposite so here we have NBC if Americans are fed up and made it they'll vote against Trump with a GOP that's a story about the synagogue [noise]\nABC Trump at the center of all the political violence right now something they cannot be established something they cannot be proven but yet there is reported as fact\nGleefully I might add\nSo now we have a a a tweet from Max Boot [noise] you know\nI I don't want to happen to Max Boot Max Boot used to be a columnist a reporter for the wall Street Journal is the international political expert [noise]\nPet what have you and I used to think of the guy that was a conservative being a journal opinion writer and he would occasionally send me pieces in advance thinking I Would enjoy them but ever since Trump was elected he has\nGone off the reservation I'm going to the point that a lot of ... ... people asking what what what happened to Max Boot [noise]\nAnd now he's on CNN is often easy as he can get on that just ripping Trump I knew one who primarily from the standpoint that Trump's manners and his behavior and his ah compartment just isn't press a central and you know the usual complaint from the\nEstablishment Grasso he tweets out\nThere is partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum but know left wing outlets\nPropagate extremism as successfully are widely as conservative media do conservatives are being brainwashed in an echo chamber form rumor and conspiracy theory\n\nThis tweet is then replied he'll by John Harwood a former New York times Wall Street journal reporter now at CNBC who has never been anything other than and Wilbur ultra leftist\nHeart what it says Max Boot is one hundred percent correct most important extremism on the right has gotten baked into the entire movement and the G O P White House Congress Fox Limbaugh right bart seat pack\n[noise]\nI maintain to you as I said in my opening monologue the program today\nThat we get up every day and we see people\nAnd institutions that we admire and respect under attack I mean every day the left is politicizing everything including mass murder\nWherever it happens they are politicizing the whether\nRepublicans have been called murderers by the Democratic party and willing accomplices in the media Mr boat simply because we don't believe in the man made climate change folks\n[noise]\nMurderers Republicans have been called murderers for not supporting Obama's takeover of the American health care\nIndustry for the purposes of putting it under the auspices of government for the purposes of controlling the way people live\n[noise] [noise] ah\nPartisanship on both sides but know left wing outlets propagate extremism successfully or why\nThe mainstream maybe is extremism if you ask me that's what they've become daily media\nReporting has become extremism it certainly isn't factual it certainly has an investment in the outcome of events and somehow we conservatives\nIn the media are far more successful\nIn propagating extremism and it you in this audience are being brainwashed in an echo chamber by rumor and conspiracy theory\n[noise]\nWhich takes me to President Trump President Trump tweeted and I'm also mentioned in the first hour the Trump was elected to behave differently [noise] he was elected\nPrecisely because he is cut from a different cloth these people have never [laughter] look it's\nKinda understandable one sense I mean the guy goes down the elevator and talks about these hordes of illegal immigrants containing a people who are murderers and rapists and you just don't talk about them that way I mean nobody's supposed to talk about them that way but Trump\nDead and so they all start laughing they miss guy can't be serious he is not gonna last his campaign two weeks\nAnd then the first poll came out and they saw Trump waiting and their\nSize is not going to last this craziness\nTrump kept slowly but surely eliminating all of the other Republicans in the primary on all of them had this preferable a laid back uh you know walk all over me attitude toward the left and Democrats that you want\nTrump kept eliminating them one by one by one with catchy nicknames and so forth\nAnd they fought this is to sift it can't happen at Camp David ... you'd never going to survive in the Access Hollywood video convey thought that was it was over and nobody can survive but\nTrump survived and then they started the two years silent cool\nAnd that is the real reason for all of the suspicion about those of you on the left I'm going to tell you something Mr boat there is nothing that\nI\nOr anybody else I Know in conservative media couldn't do that even approach is what the Obama FBI department of justice and intelligence community did and is doing\nIn corrupting\nThe highest levels of our government for the express purpose of overturning an election I don't care how much power you think I've got I couldn't come close\nTo doing what was done and has been done in the past two years\nIncluding the Mueller investigation including the planning of out right lies five times a day in media all over the country from anonymous people alleging that it was only a matter of time before proof the Trump ... loaded with Russia to steal the election\nFor two years Mr boat for two years with no evidence and everybody in on it no there was no evidence everybody in on this know that there had not been any collusion they were hoping\nThey were hoping and they live every day with the ideas are going to wake up and that the smoking gun was going to fall into their lab but they knew\n\nThere was any collusion they knew they were trying to create some they knew what was going on the FBI the D. O. J. they knew the tricks being played and they willingly supported those tricks they ignored the real collusion and reading of elections on the part of a Hillary Clinton campaign the DNC I don't care what kind of power\nYou think we've got over here on conservative media we couldn't get anywhere I mean we couldn't we couldn't come close\nTo getting away with running any kind of a soft or a silent coup using the upper reaches of power\nI Know where I can remember there ever recording this before even after the Farrah Khan turned my comments I'm also during the report when addressing the issue of armed security for places like the synagogue more than one person commented that if we started this winter weather and\nI couldn't help but think what a classic liberal response to think we can't do anything that might make sense because of their fears about what might happen on my own thoughts were um about armed security for\nThese you know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more intrusive may never worry about where is this\nGoing to end but if you if you do things and give people more safety more control if you give people a greater feeling of security that liberals can't lay claim to the all of a sudden they fear where is it leading to where does it gets absurd what are you where's that had a\nYeah my own thought is people are getting killed armed security if you think about that issue my thought is where can we START I mean if it's true that anti Semitism is on the rise maybe synagogues or a great place maybe in our schools since that's obviously a very common target these days\nWell except the ... the lapses you'll you we we have gun free zones and schools now you can't put gums in Arabic only people get in with guns and the bad guys who people up [noise]\nUm the left thinks that's the way it should be that if you put more guns in there and then somehow so the gun itself to the left as the problems so the presence of guns mean [noise]\n\nI'd say my grandma the soundbite number was go ahead and play on um [noise] this was from\nLast friday torn the other was in the last half hour and a program or maybe the last hour I'm not sure which [noise] um and that that was the day that we had a we've learned about the pipe bomb or a Caesar say\nAre in his perfectly uh uh [noise]\nBumper sticker van and and all that but I drive by Mary very angry at me for pointing out that everything and that man was symmetrical you get in shape and that none of it was fated drive by very angry at me for the fact that\nIs a ... point in time I'd ever to play that one first just to illustrate\nA I I don't think these people understand the extent to which they have a damaged their own credibility\nAt what we we simply don't accept what they say anymore without questioning and they do not get that I think they insist that we accept what they say without question and they lost that that's that's one of the\nSomewhat say sad things that's happened but that there's this constant doubt\nSo here we have a montage of MSNBC yours NBC here is CNN ours and others apoplectic that I dared make any observation about the stickers on Caesar say ox man\nRush Limbaugh this afternoon talking about how the stickers were to symmetrical on the van Rush Limbaugh\nIs casting doubt on the suspect than\nRush Limbaugh say something like you know what those stickers don't look said it enough\nI don't understand why Russ Limbaugh would say something like that I'm Amazed they hear people talking about this is a false flag operation I'm Talking about prominent Republican voices Rush Limbaugh Rush Limbaugh was questioning the sticker on the band\nRush Limbaugh and now\nMust be really tied windows ... covered I looked out the window when he drives\nRushed [laughter] I'm being lectured to on intelligence by fried okra mow their [laughter]\nThis is the guy who\nThinks that Cubans needed to be straightened out on one communism [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nAnyway so you're not supposed to notice that in the heat of South Florida none of the guys\nBumper stickers are faded and then it somehow is Iran is a to notice that every one of those bumper sticker or whatever they weren't the cows\nAre perfectly symmetric way place did it in the in the windows of the guys than any right up here is what I ... I called my final summation that happened on friday about why we're\nSuspicious of the drive by media and the left in general they have\nMade me suspicious and all of you that attempt this ongoing attempt to destroy Donald Trump to overturn the election results two thousand sixteen and it was codified epitomize if you will in what they tried to Brett Kavanaugh it's no different\nAnd they aren't going to stop I don't need to be told reminded how fit to be tied enraged they are over their failure to get rid of the Trump\nI Know they're psychology\nI Know these people in the media and I know that these Democrats they are just ...\nBeside themselves that everything they've got in their arsenal of weapons hasn't worked\nSo given that this is the sum total of\nIntelligence guided by experience I don't believe\nI'm not gonna believe just because I'm told that something happened the way it did\nAnd that's a shame it's a shame that the highest levels of our government has gotten to the point where this trusting them is a common sense ethical thing to do but they've brought this on\nAll of these nameless faceless anonymous sources with all of this order be asked\nEvery day for two years New York times CNN intelligence community\nResources and former American intelligence officials tell the New York\nTimes ... blah blah blah blah blah blah every day sometimes many times a day for a year two years stuff's\nMade up out of whole cloth news stories literally made up\nAll to advance advance the agenda of essentially canceling the election results from two thousand sixteen and finding a way to get Donald Trump out of office\nAnd it was to people Democrats Republicans bother it's independence never Trump voters on the conservative side the whole of the Washington establishment so\nHere we are two weeks before the midterm elections the Democrats [noise]\nDon't have to win it\nHave told everybody to the American people are tired Trump and they want to get rid of it and they realize their mistake they've been telling everybody there's going to be a blue wave it's fate accompli Nate Silver eighty five", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "29"}
