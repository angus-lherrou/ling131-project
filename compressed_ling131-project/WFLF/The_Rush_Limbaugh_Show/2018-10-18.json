watch\nMy friend's ... this\nIs item number one but a rousing as my suspicion about this there's even a tech blog ...\nOut there called apple insider this tech blog has been misappropriated as a source for this in certain on Google searches they have run a piece of apple insider denying any\nRelation any any complicity in this story\nSo whoever is behind this idea that the murder and the conversations that took place\nPrior to it and during it were recorded by the show you a sample of watching her now somewhere on iCloud\nA\n... and ... when you find out that a tech blog that has a famous name hasn't been misappropriated and has been falsely accused of reporting this in order to give it legitimacy in certain Google searches then I started to question a lot of things about this story\nNot very briefly here's why the the apple watch angle this doesn't work\nI Know that most of you don't have apple watches let me just briefly explain to you how they work there are three ways that an apple watch can receive and transmit data\nAnd the biggest one the one with the longest range the one that is most capable is not even available in Turkey and that is el he or cellular signals two years ago when apple in well actually a fourteen month when apple introduced the series three watch they\nActivated L T E cellular service which for the first time\nMade the watch independent of the phone\nYou could take it out of work out you can do anything you can take it away from the phone and have it operate it would still get emails and messages and their record your workout data and so forth if you could receive a self said we didn't need your phone nearby\n\nSo it was the first time that they they watch it failed to be doing just ceased to be a slave to the phone the other two ways or blow to and wife ...\nThose are the three ways that day they can get to watch in data can leave a watch you take out he out of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey and there there there's no watch no apple watching the world and that it's an apple watch they claim it was wearing\nThe story is that his fiance has his phone out in a car in the parking lot at the consulate there is only one way that watch could communicate with that phone\nWhile there's two ways there'd be why and blow to blow to if you have to blow to this week by design it doesn't have much rain sixty feet max\nYou get into an embassy the shielding the I are the protections against\nOther nations being able to monitor and over here and steal signal there's no way that the Bluetooth component of a watch\nWould be able to permeate the protections that an embassy would have to protect itself from just that there's ... ... that couldn't happen so he only under way would be why\nBut that one only work if\nThe wife fine network password of the embassy or consulate had been answered\n\nAnd the wife I connection on one just because the phone connects\nTo why when the phone does the watch automatically comebacks but not the wife I can next to the phone it's a slave to the phone now if the watch knows why fight network because the phone it's parents who uses it\nThen like if you're at home ... your ... your your phone is inside you have to go outside to walk the dogs you'll come back to the wife I network on your property even if your phones out of range\nIf you've entered the password to the wife I network on your watch as well as on your phone I just don't think she'll be did that he was probably know to do it um\nI don't know that they would give them the password how'd he get the password of the Saudi Saudi console don't want to find the idea that that watch\nWas recording whatever happened to your show and then somehow transmitted up the cloud is just so outside the realm of possibility has to be next to impossible and yet somebody is still pushing this\nUnfortunately this meeting ended and another stalemate further concerns without a follow up meeting has

didn't I keep that train of thought going or whatever\n[noise] so I Want\nShow you something on a digital camera I got an email here this is about yard signs you know what I've been hearing\nIs that people all over the country are afraid to put yard signs out because literally afraid of leftist knobs\nComing to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses and so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs I remember we had a call here at this maybe three weeks ago now from a caller who said Russia I'm worried I'm not seeing in the yard signs we saw\nYard signs everywhere in two thousand six now I'm not seeing any yard signs at all\nI said well back camp at camp that says it looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist scaring the hell out of a lot of people and if that frightened also includes scaring them not to go vote\nThere are a lot of people scared to death of these maniacs and that's\nWhy yard signs of not being put out I I just part of me understands it another part of me she's afraid of the yard signs are you kidding [laughter] from the country that stormed the beaches of Normandy we're afraid of a yard sign\nBut it's a different era and these people on the left or crazed or making doing good job of making themselves look that way [noise]\nSo I have a video taken by it Ted Cruz worker I Can't I'm not going to show your video on the digital camera so I put it\nTook a still shot that what a puppet pop up here just like at this picture you're going to see us from a video\nTaken by cruise worker who was putting up crews campaign signs in uh Houston neighborhood Montrose\nAnd there was this guy get mon make looking guy following the Cruz supporter around ripping up every yard sign ripping it out of the ground and then the ripping it to shreds and at one point\nHe stormed the Cruz supporter who was a video showing him on his camera and got this demonic threatening look on his face\nStarts shouting to the cruise support or how much she hates cruise despises crows [noise]\n[noise] and I've taken a still shut up put it up there and this is the guy that was running around taking cruise lines down ripping them up out of yards\nAnd this still shot he is storming the Cruz supporter who is holding the camera he actually got within two inches of the camera I didn't know shot that point 'cause all you see is the guy's flaring nostrils\nBut this guy is out there following cruise people around taken a cruise yard signs out and then threatening\nThere's no place for that kind of language you shouldn't have said that\nSpeaker Paul Ryan who is usually measured in his criticism of the president Republican a strategic has Liz mayors have yeah yeah it's just another Trump tweet in an on going pattern when you constantly behave in an outrageous\nFashion people get immunized and numb to it and in fact [noise]\nRight on cue I have a piece in the wall Street Journal than they were written Mr certainly there's a name Lance tomorrow ring a bell to you [noise] Lance Morrow used to practically run in time magazine back in this I mean he was the premier journalist you not was not an executive but he practically ran the place\n[noise]\nI met him at Mr Buckley home here in Boston where you were good buds but Lance Morrow\nWas a a typical turtles which means means left in so far he's got a piece\nIn the wall Street Journal that is the headline is we've grown accustomed to Trump the always concern is\nThat Trump's outrageousness no longer fuels anger on the left as it should gives people just got used to it\nAnd that if the anger subsides it's bad because that's the only thing that Democrats have to get their people to the polls\nAnd here comes ... mayor a Republican strategist making the same point but she's not doing it in a positive way yeah you know what this guy's been a river bay for so long and just people who have gotten used to it\nShe says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attacks fuel report well maybe the headline is true the Republicans fearful about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think for men of here\nThere may be an isolated case of a suburban woman [noise] thinking that\nI Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race\nBut this election is really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is people that have voted for Trump in the past\nAnd have voted Republican know how important it I just don't I don't think the media's learned his lesson yet ... this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean there's a few votes here\nIt may it may have caused other Republican candidates to lose maybe holy elections but but but\nNot Trump's [noise] I just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand it because they're not curious to understand that\nAnd so they take these things that they think are just outrageous\nInsults just so totally\nPermissible in American politics and they assume this is it that Trump's finished this has to be it and not even the Access Hollywood video then it\nThis isn't going to do it\nFrom the hill dot com Trump threatens military action of Mexico
