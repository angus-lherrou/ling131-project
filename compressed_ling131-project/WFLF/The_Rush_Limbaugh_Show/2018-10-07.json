I don't know what Fifteen Years\nAnd we are in fact finding that back in ... wage there was about a half a trillion\nInvested in each yes that was you know ten years ago today not half a trillion it's three point four trillion dollars that investors have placed into ATF\nAnd that is exciting it shows that hey you're getting the message that's that's really fabulous you're paying attention to diversification you're paying attention to investment costs are and you're staying up to date with the ...\nInvestment opportunities which maybe aren't the same as what you grow up with what you were familiar with but you've accepted the need to adapt and stay current with the marketplace so I think that's a really very exciting\nOr is it\nBecause if we take a look at data that has just come out from a a recent survey\nHe'll back ten years ago to the credit crisis of two thousand eight you know it's great to be chips have skyrocketed in in value from five hundred billion to three point four trillion you know part of that is market appreciation of course but a big part of it is your contributions in the ATF says well\nBut not everybody's been\nTaking advantage of that and I'm not just saying that they're not taking advantage of each shift themselves they're not taking advantage of investing at all\nTen years after the crisis we discover according to this latest survey research that twenty seven percent of Americans stopped saving for retirement they stopped contributing\nTo their four one K. entirely they were so spooked by two thousand eight they'd lost so much money so rapidly\nThat scared them out of the markets apparently for ever twenty seven percent one out of four Americans no longer saving for their future and fourteen percent have continued to save what they're doing so in\nCash oh my goodness so instead of\nWatching their investments triple and values since two thousand nine I mean that's what the stock market has done its tripled in value instead they've been earning less than one percent a year because that's what you know bank accounts have been paying over the last ten years zero point nothing only ten percent of people in the survey said they invest more today than they were\nIn two thousand eight two thirds are saving less today than they were and\nAlmost eighty percent say they can't explain what happened in the financial crisis they don't get it they don't understand what occurred\nAnd so it's no wonder that Seventy eight percent trust Wall Street less than they did in two thousand mate and only forty one percent say they feel\nFully recovered financially in the face of an economic expansion unraveled in American history with the stock market tripling and values since the steps of two thousand nine\nThe majority of Americans still say that they are in behind where they were ten years ago and you know what the biggest crisis is about all of that\nEverybody's ten years older everybody's ten years closer to retirement and that's the big problem\nAnd just permeates through out American society regardless of age group according to another survey forty six percent of millennials said they believed that they need at least a thousand dollars to start investing Seventeen percent say they think they need at least ten thousand dollars\nTo start investing that's simply true anymore due to advanced technology you can invest\n... you can open an account with a dollar not a thousand not ten thousand now I'm not suggesting you should necessarily do that before you joined your retirement plan to work before you pay off credit card debt or before you Bill cash reserves but the point is it doesn't take a lot of money anymore to build investments\nAnd oh by the way\nA lot of parents are are not saving a lot

astonishing amount of money the parents are spending on their kids who are in their twenties and thirties\nAnd how it's impacting the parent's ability to save for their own retirement and how kids are now recognizing that they're struggling with their own personal finances but it's not just\nThe parents are damaging their own financial security for the benefit of their kids and that their kids are scared that they're not going to be able to accumulate enough money on their own\nThere's another survey that shows the reversal of this then it's going back up line\nSixty four percent of teenagers according to a new survey by junior achievement sixty four percent of teenagers are concerned about their parent's ability to retire\nSo in other words mom and dad you're doing a great job doing whatever it takes to support your children\nAnd you know what your children know it even to the point that your teenagers are worried about your financial future\nAnd what's really so fascinating about this whole thing is that even those sixty four percent of teens two thirds are worried about their parents preparedness for retirement\nSixty nine percent of teenagers\nSay they know little or nothing about financial planning well actually I think they know a lot more than they realize if they're worried about their parents ability to save for retirement and their parents ability to in fact retire in financial comfort in security well that's what financial planning is all about and teenagers are looking at you mom and dad\nAnd they're worried about you first of all I think there's something a little bit wrong with our country of teenagers are worrying about their parents' financial security but up a whole another conversation but here's the problem\nTeenagers in fact as we pointed out earlier on the program today they know very little about personal finance one third of teenagers according to the survey by junior achievement one third of teenagers I Hope you're sitting down for this\nAnd if you're driving a car you might want to pull over as I give you the ... one third of teenagers believe they will need less than five thousand dollars in order to retire [noise]\nOh my goodness gracious they think they're going to need five grand or less in order to retire\nOr a hello I'm so clearly kids have no\nReasonable conception of what life costs they don't understand how expensive cars are or houses or food or health insurance\nThey have no clue and you know why because mom and dad\nYou haven't told them of fame so my recommendation my advice for you mom and dad is next time you sit down to pay your bills have your teenager sit along side you have them write the checks on your behalf out of your checking account when you're balancing your checkbook let them participate\nIn games with them when takes time you go talking about investments include them in the conversation\nYour kids are worried about this and maybe they don't need to be as worried\nYou know kids are grown up with a lot of stress and strife they've got challenges dealing with issues you and I never had to deal with when we were growing up school shootings and and massive drunk epidemics and\nOh my goodness gracious the whole political environment and yet the last thing we need to do is to pile on with them worried about your\nRetirement security so I think the time has come to eliminate that last taboo in American society you know we're willing to talk politics with our kids ruined his talk religion with our kids were willing to talk sex with our kids it's time we started talking about money with our kids as well\nHey let's go to our asks Rick segments as you know You're welcome to send me your questions and an audio file just use your smartphone to record your own voice send it to me by email to ...\nAt ... dot com we had two questions this week on the very same subject which is kind of weird but here's the first one from caster you remember him he's from Brazil you call this a couple of weeks ago there was a castor has to say\nHi Ray cares cuts are against from Brazil\nYou seemed a little bit surprised with affects that to your show was listening to all kinds of other us but I think everything should that's because of course I don't pay much attention when they talk about for one case Roth IRAs and stuff like that because the roads here are totally different but\nI Do for the opinion when it comes to principals like financial responsibility a diversification editor location dollar cost averaging or or in my case ... and my question is about one of those general principles budget is\nIf I'm not mistaken you said here as a shows that budgeting is not a very good use of so much time but we'll take a look at my case for instance I have two daughters one is eight or so they're all they're run this two years old the youngest one would go to a private school next year just like the oldest\nSo far as being able to save a little more literal above twenty percent of my income but was this extra expense you don't make Kennedy adjustments or want to be able to save as much and I'm going to be facing about tough as much of a lot on saving health\nStarting at age Seventy and a half you have to begin making withdrawals out of the account\nNow the rules are very complicated in technical in terms of when you have to start\nA and how much you have to withdraw and which account you must make withdrawals from if you don't follow the rules very carefully you could not only in her taxes but you also encourage penalties of as much as fifty percent\nOf what you were supposed to have withdrawn but didn't so you've got to make sure you get it right but here's the point once you do start to make these withdrawals\nThese are called required minimum distribution the IRS tells you how much you must withdraw there is a minimum amount you must withdraw and it's required hence the name are empty required minimum distribution\nWhen you begin to do it you have a choice\nYou can take the money is a single lump sum once a year or you can take the money during the year whenever you feel like it or you can do it systematically such as taking the same amount of money every month like clockwork so you get a monthly check out of your account just like you would get a Social Security check\nIt doesn't really matter Chet how you do it provided\nYou do it consistently in other words if you're going to receive a monthly check every December which you said your doing fine go ahead and do that your dollar cost averaging and reverse you're making withdrawal every December and you'll do that for the rest of your life\nIf you want her to do it on a more frequent basis instead of one check once a year you take twelve checks once a month that's fine to do it however you wish just make sure that whatever you choose you maintain on a consistent basis that's how you will generate the best value\nFrom a reverse dollar cost averaging perspective this way you'll get the average cost of the withdrawals based on the values of the count all the time what I'm more concerned about\nIs not so much whether you do it once a year or once a month I I'm really not worried about that so much the difference isn't that huge the bigger concern I have\nIs whether you're doing it in conforming ... with the IRS rules as I mentioned if you don't do it correctly you could pay a fifty percent penalty\nAnd what do I mean by doing it correctly well if you have multiple retirement accounts which most people do they've got an IRA\nMaybe his name and other Iranian her name the guide retirement accounts from several multiple employers in the past\nThe IRS generally says we only care about the total dollar value of the accounts\nBut we separately care if any of those accounts were for a one case in other words you can't take money from an IRA that was meant to be withdrawn from a four O. one K. even though you might have taken the proper amount failing to take it from the proper account\nCreates the penalty problem here's another concern the IRS calculation is not based on the date of the withdrawal\nThis is a big mistake that people often make especially if you're withdrawing the money once every month the iris doesn't face the calculation on when you withdraw the money they base the calculation on the value of the town on the prior December thirty one\nSo based on that you might accidentally withdraw two little\nBased on last year's market values conversely you could accidentally withdraw too much more than is necessary cause you to pay taxes unnecessarily so the calculations are complicated\nThe rules are cumbersome and the penalties for ever are usually not only severe but they are on yielding meaning if you try to complain to the tax court your blood most likely going to lose that case\nSo we strongly encourage you to work with a financial advisor and attacks advice\nThey're not only to make sure the calculations are correct but so that if there is a mistake you're advisor will alone that liability instead of you because you can hold your advisor responsible for negligence or errors or omissions\nAnd a reputable advisor will certainly stand behind their advice to say oh we told you to do it we were wrong we will make you whole not for the taxes you have to pay those but for any interest or penalties that you may incur\nSo we'll be careful make sure you get it right don't mess around when it comes to withdrawals out of your account\nSo that sounds good Rick and and we do only have two accounts and uh I Do coordinate with my accountant so good we make sure they're not the amount is right I always take out an extra two dollars [laughter]\nVery clever so chat I'm Glad you got it on the money I'm Glad you're on the ball there I Wish everybody else was too so thanks very much for your call\nWell You're welcome have a great day you\nTo a that was Jeff from uh Charlotte hold Marilyn if you have concerns or questions or confusion about your retirement accounts and the required minimum distributions and you're approaching aged Seventy and you haven't the gun withdrawing money yet\nGive us a call triple a plan wreck let's make sure we get this right and let's make sure we tend to this much sooner than the deadline oh by the way you want to hear another way that people make mistakes\nThey know they have to withdraw their money by age seven eight and a half so they withdraw the money in the year that they've turned Seventy but they haven't yet reached age Seventy and a half guess what\nReal draw doesn't count so when I talk about the complexity of the rules quite frankly it's a whole thing's a a set up the rules are so complicated they're designed to trick you and trap you\nEnabling the IRS to nail you with penalties these rules could be made so much simpler so much easier so much more fair\nThat would eliminate the need for the complexity which does no useful purpose for anyone other than to frankly provide job security for accountants I'm Rick Edelman now's the time to take advantage of our free\nRetirement

which stands for your on\nYour own right you eat what you kill what you put away is what you're going to get to draw from and that's what's causing a lot of people to not be able to retire or retire with the lifestyle that they had envisioned\nAnd the good as as it doesn't have to be that way folks but the harsh reality is we're on our own for the majority of you listening and I know this by having a front row seat with baby boomers now for going on\nTo a quarter century read twenty three to twenty four years we're in and have had a front row seat with boomers and I've learned the very real things that it prevent and boomers from having an optimal retirement and here here's what they are some of these are basic but we're going to get into the specifics number one\nEven force had a great article that said the number one thing that's preventing people from having the retirement that they could have is number one having a plan\nSo that one seems pretty common sense right having a plan I just talked to two clients this last week and by the way I'm not just a a best selling author or radio educator I'm someone with my wealth architecture team that takes on a certain number of clients each and every year all over the United states and I can tell ya [laughter]\nThe reality is these particular clients of sit\nYou know what we've never had a full fledged plan some of them said we've never had a plan and many of them said in particular two of them this past week we've never taken the time to actually do a budget Chuck in your budget woke us up what I call a lifestyle\nIncome budget that is in other words not just the essentials but the wants to travel more to do more while you can to see your grand kids as they grow up and they said you know what we had no idea we had that much money going out to folks that's the that's the real first step\nThe second step is than implementing a plan the third step in probably the most crucial the Forbes article went on to say was then managing the plan for further optimization so here's what I Want to encourage you\nThe importance ... more so probably than ever before in my career I'm seeing is the investigation\nInto the optimization\nOf an actual full fledged holistic comprehensive whatever you want to call a plan that incorporates\nStrategy solutions to save tax folks because as much as I'm for these tax cuts somebody's going to have to pay for them\nAnd so that somebody or those that have worked hard and it saved even harder and typically it's because they've saved and accounts that the accounts until they start drawing money out have not been taxed yet\nWhich means deferred taxes equal increased taxes because the cost of living will increase of the distribution out of those accounts will have to increase to ... the higher amount needed to spend\nBut add to the fact ... you know tax tax reform one point oh and now the passing through the house of tax reform to point out all of these cuts\nIs causing massive increases to our deficit now we're seeing some positive things come from that but some of them folks are false positives the corporations cutting their tax to buy back their own stock to keep the party rolling\nIt can only last so long until they run out of the ability to do the buybacks and artificially propped our market's up candidly for about the last three years if not for\nSo it's kind of prolong the party but folks the lights are going to have to go out at some point in having a plan that not only addresses taxes but also addresses\nThe protection to the downside right a few clients this week said you know what I really like about hid while solution as you guys find\nTax savings in wealth strategies that other people miss and folks it it's not just seeing what people are missing it's a Dennis ... where the advantages are in the timing of having the advantages and I gotta tell ya [noise]\nOutside of the the chance of Trump getting uh unfortunately uh impeached\nWhich could make a lot of these tax cuts a timing go away very quickly is the fact that they're going to expire unless this permanent tax cut gets put through but even if this permanent tax cut gets put through the reality is the tax magnitude for those that have worked the hardest and save the hardest is going to be even greater\nAnd let me make sure that you understand the the the ... the key if you don't remember anything else I share with you remember these two words shifting and timing and we'd like to say in our practice shift\nBut it happens as part of his strategy to a comprehensive plan and other words one client I'll I'll share a couple of days with you that I thought were very impactful because the folks just didn't see it right so for example\nA client was very taken back recently because they were going to have to have a earnings provision penalty on their Social Security benefits that they never knew they were going to have meaning over Seventeen thousand forty dollars if before full retirement age you draw your Social Security\nEvery two dollars you're over Seventeen thousand forty dollars you basically have to give one dollar back\nThey had no idea if you've not drawn your Social Security for a full twelve months you can get a redo\nIt but you've got to see what makes the most sense for you we had another client that learned\nHow eighty five percent of their Social Security would be taxed because of a choice of the type of pension payout that they would elect as opposed to doing a lump sum roll over which would enable them strategically to avoid having eighty five percent of their Social Security taxed now here's the big one right\n[noise] one particular client had no idea that in the new tax reform bill now the taxes are on sale maybe not permanently but at least temporarily which means take advantage of the sale while the sale last that there's a one hundred percent tax deduction\nThat can be is between now in the end of twenty twenty to that one client we met with this week we were able to move two hundred and eighty thousand dollars out of his remaining IRA and the net result is paying zero tax for those qualify under the special provisions of the code\nAnd finally [laughter]\nWe had a client who was unaware right that the legislation now that's being passed is to prevent the stretch IRA meaning\nBefore when the second spouse passes the remainder of the IRA can be passed on to the next generation and then there's an inherited required minimum distribution over their inherited age lifetime will now Congress although it's passed a hundred percent before in the Senate a few years ago its back on the chopping block\nAnd likely to be passed in a recent article that now any inherited irate money has to be fully closed out in under five years\nWhich means when people can afford the tax the least while they're making the most they are going to be forced to take a distribution that indirectly makes Uncle Sam the biggest beneficiary of your IRA\nFolks I'm going to be teaching this coming Tuesday an introduction of how to ... tax the deer growth of your money on tax the distribution and use of

spouse predominant makes the financial choices for the family\nBut the choice of pensions the choice of when to draw Social Security the choice of what to do with your IRAs or rollers or for for one case\nCouldn't be more important than right now folks because again shifting and timing what you shift and what you time will make all the difference again that's retirement protected dot com

strategies that others miss a baby boomers are in particular I'm Talking to those of you listening between the ages of sixty and Seventy five\nAnd particularly to those of you that if they've at least two hundred fifty thousand or more towards retirement I Want to share with you a story in particular about friends and colleagues just like yourself all within that age group\nThat are sharing what they are real concerns are in properly positioning himself for their most optimal retirement opportunities and what boomers are sharing in that age group and with that asset range of two hundred fifty thousand to typically\nTwo three four five million dollars or more but at least a quarter million is that they're worried about the economy and they're very concerned about losing money to the federal government the form of unnecessary taxes and I want to talk to you about\nA really just in its simplest form a couple a Cindy and Jerry\nOr they're in their sixties\nAnd uh we help Cindy retire [noise] ah we actually met her shortly after retirement we helped her position her retirement and then we're helping Jerry get retired so if you're somebody listening that is getting one or both spouses to retirement or you're trying to get better\nThrough retirement I don't think the timing of this message could be any more valuable and I want to I like to teach so I'm not just a best selling author and a national radio educator I'm somebody that takes on a certain number of clients each and every year and a half now for almost a quarter century which is hard to believe\nThat we've helped insulate their serious retirement savings so they sleep better worry less and have more to do what they want when they want how they want by just having a plan but a complete plan that addresses taxes market risk inflation\nAnd obviously economic uncertainty\nWell folks I don't think the the economy could be more on certain that it is now but I've been saying that now for gosh the last ... you know ten plus years and it just seems to become more and more unstable but when I Want to talk to you about with with this particular client\nA Cindy and Jerry is this tends to be what we see a lot of and that's people saying you know what we've never had a complete plan we've\nNever had somebody address how we can not just make the most but keep the most and for those of you that our business owners listening you know that's the name of the game is not what you make it's what you keep strategically obviously there's a lot that goes behind that but here was the here's the reality\nRight that the two greatest risks\nAnd slashed concerns that boomers are sharing ironically are predictable right the markets obviously going to to have a loss we don't know it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when and we know taxes are going to continue to be a big threat\nAnd it's very obvious why that's the case which we'll talk about then let's start with taxes as I get into this case study of of a in this particular case of sin in Jerry one\nIs in the past month roughly the longest running bull market in history which has now standing at about nine and a half years well here's the reality folks know bull markets ever made it to its tenth birthday and we're already over nine and a half years into this one\nThe second longest Bull Run a now was the dot com right which was fueled back in the nineties which caused investors to lose eighty percent\nNow while there's no guarantees that a bull market will crash before its tenth birthday right we do know that historically the longest running bull markets go out not like in a in a in a small fashion they go out in a with a big bang right it's like a drop\nAnd it's a pretty significant drop especially for those that were heavily into tech stocks back in the tech boom and bust that lost literally about eighty percent of their their assets\nAnd experts who study behavioral finance which I thought this was interesting note again and again we humans have an enormous capacity for for getting the lessons and pain of past\nCrashes right and the reality is this folks and we've seen this and I've seen this with my wealth architecture team now more than I've ever seen it is that people are woefully unprepared for this next crash in fact they've positioned themselves to be in a worst position\nFor another two thousand and eight to hit\nThan the amount that they lost than in other words how little they they didn't realize 'til we ran a stress test of their retirement road there on of how actually exposed more so they are this time than they were the last time and they said well Chuck wait a second I told her advisor we don't want that type of risk\nFolks their risk is worse\nAnd that's exactly what we found unfortunately in this case was Cindy and Jerry well I'm going to talk about in a moment but\nHere I mean people all over right I mean ... J. P. Morgan has the date set for the next financial crisis right that was a Fortune Magazine article I'm nervous the market meltdown is in full or unfolding as a top one of the top hedge fund managers are on a CNBC interview\nNobel Prize winner a Schiller sees bad times and stock market ahead CNBC or the worst financial crisis of my lifetime or by Mr Rogers who is one of the longest ah best track record a performance\nOr in the in the investing world a that anyone's ever ever other than the great Peter Lynch lived up to is saying he he sees this to be the worst financial crisis of his lifetime and he sees that happening sooner rather than later and then even\nSadly the great Warren Buffett right his saying hey there there's going to be a major recession and he sees it sooner rather than later and it's going to have a devastating impact of a projection of the fifty percent loss or more in fact buffets rule I think couldn't be more timely which is\nRight be greedy\nWhen others are fearful but be fearful when others are greedy folks people are greedy I mean at this point there's more money on margin banks are bigger than the last time they failed\nEveryone does it rich and poor like an all do right for nobody knows any public duty to pay more than the law demands folks let me teach you something the law is going to demand view unnecessary tax I see it time and time again\nAnd the sad part is whether you call that tax a truce tax tax on your income tax on your growth\nTax on your Social Security tax on your Medicare tax on your kids the reality is taxes are everywhere and the good news is is predictable as those taxes are likely exposing you'd have to pay them there is ... ...\nUnpaid by not having to go the direction of the government's perfect tax planning plan right don't become the perfect taxpayer [noise]\nAnd I teach people just because when you were able to show people the retirement road there on the truly exposure that if they continue on this course it's a crash course for a major market correction this going to set them back and maybe even force them back out of retirement [noise]\nAh it's going to force them to pay such a high tax than in some people's case they're gonna have to work or take a part time job just to pay the tax to sustain or maintain the lifestyle then come they're looking for and soaked just isn't fear mongering this is what almost a quarter century of having a front row seat with baby boomers\nI I've learned by having that front row seat of the very real challenges the boomers have and will continue to have if they don't get a complete plan and part of that plan starts with what's predictable well it's predictable folks that if we're nine and a half years in\nTo the longest Bull Run in history and no bull run has ever last uh ten years\nRight and you've got some of the biggest and brightest out there like a Warren Buffett saying the market will lose it will lose fifty percent plus and it will lose soon and you've got J. P. Morgan predicting when the financial crisis is going to hit\nAnd you've got the ... congressional budget office predicting how high federal tax rates are going to have to do which by the way is north of sixty three percent\nAnd we've got our own Social Security administration telling us that Social Security benefits are going to be cut by twenty twenty nine to the tune of about twenty nine percent\nAnd that's down from twenty thirty for folks and you've got Medicare saying that premiums are gonna have to continue to go up up up but you've got a government that continues to spend spend spend right I Love the tax cuts the folks somebody's gonna have to pay for them and get to\nThose of you that have saved money in tax deferred accounts you're the biggest tax target of the federal government and the reality is some people are the last to know it\nWill folks here's the opportunity\nTo see we we helped Cindy and Jerry this week\nAnd you know they had a couple of objectives right one was to not outlived their money or to was to learn the key tax savings strategies that saved them the most tax because they to understand is not necessarily always about what you make it's what you keep and they didn't want to become a financial burden to their family because they each have taken\nA elderly parents one already through in one currently through\nAll farmers in dementia\nAnd folks if any of you listening I've ever had to do that it's a it's mentally exhausting and its financially devastating and the fact is our own health care is projected cost somewhere to the tune of about two hundred and eighty thousand\nOr from age sixty five on many people are are woefully unprepared\nSo here's the good news by sitting in understanding exactly the retirement road Cindy and Jerry we're on\nWe're able to demonstrate for them what\nThat road looked like if it played out as it were but we're also able to show them where the proper detours right or the bypasses\nThat could be implemented that avoided unnecessary tax avoided unnecessary market loss exposure risk avoided losing purchasing power to inflation I'll talk to you about a couple of those number one\nA Cindy had a couple of different pensions that she could elect from her employer but they didn't\nNeither of them had a cost of living adjustment well for those of you listening if you've got to make a pension decision\nPlease make sure it's fully audited\nBecause in this particular case or not only was she able to get a better a rate of return on her own\nBut also able to make sure that the income lasted for both her end her spouses' lives on top of that with the ability that the pension didn't die when the second spouse died it continued on to their two daughters\nAnd not to mention the fact that when you do take the pension into your own hands right you also have the ability to an tax it\nWell that was a huge hit in wealth transformation for this client because we were able to show them how not only that but how on tax all of these to lump sum pensions to the tune of about four hundred thousand dollars that not only will they not pay tax on their children and their children's children will not pay tax on that money\n[noise] after the fact that had they continue down the retirement rather on their exposure was constantly having eighty five percent of their Social Security being taxed basically by where their assets were position so shifting and timing so by shifting assets in timing the shifting of those assets in particular with the timing of this\nTax reform bill that's going to expire this tax sales going to be over by the end of twenty twenty five\nAnd teaching them one that they qualified for that is only good through twenty twenty two we're old actually untaxed them to the point to where they will not face a required minimum distribution when they turned Seventy half because we got the IRS out of their IRAs completely\nTherefore none of their Social Security will be tax which also they were setting themselves up to have a higher Medicare part B in deep premium penalty\nAnd if you looked at what the tax was going to steal from them and what the Medicare stealth hidden tax of higher premium penalties was going to cost them that was going to be about Nineteen thousand a year\nThat they were woefully unprepared are realizing that they were going to have to pay and very grateful for realizing now that they will not have to pay it folks\nHere's the opportunity I might be teaching one of several of our crediting or one of our a couple of strategies want I'm gonna teach you how to have crediting of indexing where you get credit on your money's growth when the market's up never exposure when the markets down\nBut also to teach you how that's designed as the ultra wealthy design that completely tax free so the money grows without you being taxed and you can access the money without being taxed and you can leave the money to your children are your grandchildren without leaving them with the tax burden of that tax\nSimply go to retirement protected dot com that's retirement\nProtected dot com if you're married please plan on ten and a get together it's imperative hum I've said this like a broken record where people are like you ride of got to get my wife on on border I gotta get my husband aboard look to yourself a favor get them on

phone pick exercise\nWas because of the small vessels these micro vessels we looked at your big vessels they were fined ... ... the big vessels are too small this and we gave you some more small vessels by doing this noninvasive procedure called EC pie which proves the blood flow to the heart and we read\nStudy you and you had normal stress tests so we had improve blood flow and now yet normal blood flow and everything was working well\nAnd that seems to have been consistent 'cause I stopped he CPA a couple of years ago and then my tests last year and I'll have another one this year it showed that the thing in return to\nThe grown hills around the old went into what actually happened\nWell the CPA does stimulate new blood vessel development you do that out in California right I did\nYes yep yep went to a place in California for item for five years in a row I go over there every week sometimes more than that I think it's a it was a twenty treatments\nAre supposed to have well

on so excited to have you listen to us and\nWe're really making a big social media push to try to get the word out\n... one of the things that we always talked about um ... embarrasses understand that the financial markets is not a game it's not a hobby\nIt uh it it can be a business they can pay as a business you know early we're talking about trading for income trading as a business truly set this up where you can receive monthly income where you can get the tax deductions where you can do this where you can build your business for you and your family that's what I Want to talk about I Want to talk about how someone can utilize the market and trade as a business\nWell let's talk about the American dream build a business land of opportunity is not the land of a secure job with benefits and the opportunity comes with people that take advantage of the free market and so there's a lot of ways to do that you can buy a franchise you could start a ground up as you can run a restaurant I mean there's a lot of ways that you can own a business in America but think about this\nMost small businesses are not successful and the reason is because there's a lot of liability this cost this hard causes fix cars\nYou know you have variable costs you also have employees and benefits in ... insurance an inventory to house and lines of credit\nAnd it can be overwhelming and for a lot of people it's basically what causes them not to have successes that they have to deal with all these day to day incidence of traditional business now imagine another business imagine if you could\nNot have to worry about inventory if every time you needed a customer you just posted online something to sell no somebody there to buy it or if you need to buy something\nAt a lower price at a wholesale price somebody was there to fulfill that over and sell it you never had a housing been tore never had to deal with employees workers' comp liability ... building didn't have to deal with employees that right there what's that worth\nThat's trading that setting up your trading and investing as a business you have all the tax benefits of a traditional business and yet you got a lot of the non traditional headaches taken out of your business when I saw that when I saw a trading as a business when I first got introduced to the financial markets [noise]\nIt was just amazing to see because I run small businesses for years and I had some success some failures lots of failures and when I began to realize that I could do the same thing as far as income and potential income without a lot of the daily daily grind and stress of running a small business\nFor every day when I'm Out on the highway or I'm driving down the road I always get behind that truck with letters on the top and I talked to that guy all the time here at bowls and bears radio and I always say there's a guy right now driving down the road with a bunch of letters on the top of his truck was going from one job or the other is chasing my good employees that are trying to stiff him he's got people that are showing up for work he's got people that own money\nAnd my heart goes out to that guy 'cause I was that guy then I found them financial markets in this as a business is the dream and when business owners get exposed to understanding how the financial markets can be treated like a business\nIt's a game changer an eye opener for then we see it all the time and so many of you you don't understand that the markets can be treated like a business you have these dreams of owning a business\nSeriously inquiring to looking at trading for a business because what's important is the\nLong term results are still there but a lot of those traditional headaches at most visit deal with you can get those out of the picture and guess what the sky becomes a limit\nWell and that's exactly it champion a lot of individuals out there that want to start their own business they don't know how to get started they would love to utilize the business from home and that's what the markets can do for you online training academy\nThe sponsor bulls and bears I teach a class specifically on training as a business now

accord with us in may call sending new NAFTA deal to Congress so where renegotiating NAFTA\nCanada Canada which said they want to know part of it they ask in the last moment hey don't forget that can we be why did this to prompt said come on in a reporter just asked Trump what about just meaningless\nThe terrorists come said hell no it doesn't mean the end of tariffs if the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products into the United states we're going to slap tariffs not\nRemember how to drive by and the Democrats than the slapping tariffs on Chinese goods\nWas

from us\nThis year amid rising tension with some of its biggest trading partners such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started a B and C I think he's pretty much closing in on see\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs his economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits for Amri ordinary American\nWho makes this country work and it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one that bought it was necessary to do and it's not done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number then that with Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money\nAt a loss for point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs lost about twenty five percent of our order jobs even more than the\nThroughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe even longer than maybe forty five minutes or\nYou know an extended ... statement\nOnly recently started taking questions for the time what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocated he wasn't just announcing that deal got done he was teaching why it was important including to the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nUh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works\nAnd how the United states has been victimized over the course of many many years because of American leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back pockets picket\nThere's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy and doesn't mean because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not have ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important and how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other\nType people about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question that Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement does it puts anybody else that's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as announcing is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country an overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this caught that cut this reform that reform a lot of people didn't know what they're talking but I got scared to death\nAt less than has been learned by none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] it's kind of thinking we haven't seen we've\nSeen thinking but both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nA ... or in the\nRespect of others it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump's turning this a

... as\nHe has just if Mr raided the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats or Cory Spartacus Booker to Richard Blumenthal Dianne Feinstein or what have you with Feinstein if you'll recall\nToward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came\nSomebody raised the question of how the world that Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it we're\nMade to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know our name and that she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written in the Washington\nPost she called the Washington Post tip line in the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public\nSo people were trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her real busy you most a note ringer\nIt's fair it's such button light and\nIt became obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of low rider one would be Senator Feinstein and or her staff\nThe other would have to be somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine ... for a new it's seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and as all the other possibilities were mentioned she eventually ask for point of order\nThe chairman Grassley and and said a German wrestling I I Need to react I Need to respond to this

sits over here and has to undergo his seven FBI background check here\nAccuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it and Dianne Feinstein guess will turn around and ask her staff hey did an interview late this letter and they own nor nor was it was with us\nShe turns back around so we we didn't do it unless you're German as though case closed it wasn't us they had done it it was strategic just like what happened on friday was statistic strategic\nLadies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday\nOf a transcript\nOf a conference call that have occurred last

Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of 'em and Democrats once again broke away and all during it I your host have been doing this a long time said it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything let me remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England

their choices tape resumes\nThat much ... stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds half the final turned ballot checked stops the type of horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional beds or get out of ones they've made\nPlayers do what they do that much ... resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known at the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is gonna win yet look what you were doing you were making beds you bring guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom\nLine is finish you never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter halftime of third quarter finish doing your job [noise]\nSame thing here polls in January in front of a November election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything\nThey're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not a contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could've been answered none zilch zero not up [noise]\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in my house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot\nThey've had this in in in the in the can it's been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the calendar play out now all of a sudden

the sound bites me predicting an all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite\nHe's just the exact opposite why all this attention on Kavanaugh it and what the Republican is actually going to help them how can that they live on just said they were gonna lose\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win and the people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that are really find them up that will

Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time we were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was a\nAll Trump is still is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking\nKristin balls the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible entered testimony was compelling I have explained this before and I'm going to explain\nIt again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box I have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers are in this case soccer balls e for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat\nGives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility to later\nTo be critical and to step away he said yeah I found her credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there had been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\n\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... the the ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it than will do the right to oh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans\nHaven't Trump has Trump has a stab wished that after he makes that initial statement on something if he can make fun of things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot\nTell you how ... irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane it has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed ... adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand eight this was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much\nHe doesn't care anymore it doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night\nI Know Murkowski and Collins or shuttering and cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for\nTrump didn't\nThey just simply boy she came back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accused any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined can you imagine if there was something going on they can you imagine of men organized\nFor the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell Roche women women or nor do there should we do\nWell yeah yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even ban and set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female range\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and I've been ridiculed and made fun of for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not\nUh in numbers but it's so out of balance all Trump\nDid was say what everybody following this\nKnows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story Trump doing what he's doing provides a lot of cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed\nSaid guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous for our country that's what this is\nThat's what the Democratic party is and so and that's what Democrats senators have said that the accused has to prove we didn't do it that the accuser doesn't have to corroborate anything the accuser doesn't have to prove anything where in what civilized society is that real Trump said guilty

the gym and guarantee quote from a\nNational Review um the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for bad description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together as one of the\nMoments I was unable to this is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or The Revenge is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it\nIt's what the ... this this uh ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the um [noise] Occupy Wall street movement looking black lives matter if they take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes\nBecause the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people they capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nInsult people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to you that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up in debates about whether\nBoys\nWant to pretend to be a girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate sick it

didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be
