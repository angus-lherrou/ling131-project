Patel and I just want to say thank you um and that's I think you know you always say that if if we're to save the nation that it'll be your audience that plays\nA huge role in it and I think that's true because I think when history looks back if we do save ourselves from this that you are going to be a huge part of that and uh I really appreciate your approach in what you're doing\nWell and that just wanted to thank for that that is um the amazing thank you so much how old are you ... twenty six twenty six and what are you doing it with your life\nI I own a tree service and wake up\nFor a few bad entrepreneur twenty six good for you how how's business give yourself a plug\nIt yeah it's it's good uh I can pals tree service a business has been great um I'd be remiss if I didn't ask for I haven't read it yet but\nI don't know I ... a ... at the outrage ...\nI just made it out to you so it's going to be on the way so I Want to put you on hold we'll get your address and where to send it and we will send it out to you do you ever do treat service up in the Dallas area invaded Iraq yeah occasionally I go that far north\nOkay well I may reach out to you because I've got a lot of trees that needs to be a college town and we all over the years yeah we don't like them all down into their health either beautiful I've just been cut them down\nAnd they say I'm going to stay in the grass and then there are others that I Want to stay and I'm going to protect my home I'm an eye hanging here at my home stand I'm going to stay here with my pets I Am not leaving you can't kick me out so there will be some people\nWho will hang on in state now this area is popularly known even among the locals has the redneck\nRiviera in modern political parlance it means a bunch of poor white privilege people live there and\nThe drive buys ours are surprisingly interested in this I say surprisingly because\nThere's not a central ... major population center\nThat can be totally wiped out that they could equate with see see how dangerous global warming is\nBut there is a midterm election coming up and there is going to be a federal response to this and as far as the media is concerned is an opportunity to federal response won't be any good and so they can call this Trump's Katrina don't get mad at me for talking about this because I'm telling you\nRight now is exactly how assignment editors and producers throughout the drive by media are looking at\nThis they're looking at this as a potential political event\nThat they're hoping might be somewhat helpful to them in the mid term elections that are only three weeks away there is a heated governor's race in Florida mayor of Tallahassee Andrew Gillum running against Ron this answers and\nThen Rick Scott the current governor is running for the Senate against the incumbent Bill Nelson and so there's a lot politically at stake here you can't deny it\nFolks and you can't you cannot ignore the way the media is preparing a bunch of different scenarios to report on this um it's\nIt's got the global warming component that's number one as a category four hundred and fifty miles an hour lots\nOf destruction of a human a destruction as well it's it's got all the ingredients there it is the Republican voting stronghold of the state in in the in the views of many\n[noise] no no if you look you can get mad at me hold you I'm just telling you I Know the media you may think insensitive me\nTo be speaking this way I'm not I'm telling you how day yeah I'm a drive by maybe our planet and they'll react at some point little Ryan styles or go out there I Can't believe that the strangest things were being showed about should we remember the danger of ... I'm just telling you that won't be long to find out\nIt's a hurricane kind of came out of nowhere it was a little tropical storm down off the primary tobacco growing area of western Cuban known as the ...\nThat it sprang a life as a category one and the national Hurricane Center you know this thing is it's looking very bad nobody was paying much attention to it and then all of a sudden it's a cat three and it's making a beam line\nFor Panama City in Panama City beach\nAnd here we are\nUm the media is now focused on this new thing Mr certainly do you think there is I Know it's going to sound crazy but do you think that Dr ... might be looking\nFor a bit of a respite from all this ... stuff that\nYou don't think so and you don't think the hurricane is providing some momentary opportunity for [noise] [noise] oh I Know they hope it turns into Trina for Trump I just I Am capital all they hope it turns ... and Rick Scott of course they want it to her turn that Katrina for every Republican involved here\nUm you know what Hillary Clinton\nWent out the other day in an interview with Christian among poor and pretty much it meant and everything I had been trying to warn people love about the American left and the Democratic party\nShe went out there and the and her best Maxine Waters impersonation was encouraging people to be an civil and she was saying that it was justified being on civil given the opposition the Republicans and if they win the house then they can go back to being civil\nIf they win the Senate then they can return just civility\nI mean they're making the case they're proving the point and there isn't I don't see in all of this in all of this crazy they're ranged unhinged behavior of left wing activist\nI haven't heard one elected Democrat did announce it I haven't heard one the elected Democrats attempt to distance himself or herself or the party from it I haven't heard one\nBe elected Democrats suggest to these deranged protesters to dial it back I haven't heard one they're all encouraging it my point is this is who they all are and what Hillary Clinton now advocating this incivility\nWhat did I tell you yesterday were not in a battle of ideas anymore we're not in an argument over ideas they don't they don't they're not even looking at any of this is about ideas\n\nThey see America today as flawed and the illegitimate and therefore in need of a new set of defining values that will serve to unify\nThe people who want to be part of American not anything to do with our founding not the constitution not the declaration that's out the window because all that's tainted all of that was written by a bunch of privileged white guys who were setting up a system for themselves\nAnd their families and their descendants and they didn't care about minorities and they didn't care about transgender where did I see some state I've got it in a stack I'll have to find some stayed on birth certificates is now going to offer a third option third jets\nWhen you're in it if there is a multiplier effect\nOf massive wind speed so that if if the fastest the highest winds you've been in is Seventy five miles an hour and you think OK a cat for is going to double does it won't it on the ground miles per hour it is but the impact of\nA hundred and fifty mile an hour winds versus Seventy five the just the destructive capability alone is a factor of three or four\nOr so hundred and fifty miles an hour is dead serious that that's where the storm surge will be or the worst of it\nThe further you get from the high end depending on the structure be the more the wind speed decreases the rainfall pretty consistent throughout a much larger area of the storm but the devastating the worst when the storm\n\nAre only in the eye wall area and people can look at these storms and the graphics while a hundred and fifty miles an hour winds all that's all I met a whole ... no it isn't not trying to downplay the or the damage I've just I've learned all this uh we live in hurricane alley here\nAnd every time one of these things I moved here in Nineteen Ninety seven and I quickly became a consumer hurricane expert I became an expert in how to interpret and watch the media I became an expert in how to analyze the graphics that they use\nAnd I became an expert in where the actual worst\nDamage of a hurricane is you do not want to get a direct hit everybody well yeah of course Russia everybody knows that yeah but but outside the direct hit the damage or the strength of the of the hurricane diminishes quite a bit\nIt's always the direct hit that that is the most destructive and then it it starts to decline as you get away from me I depending upon the strength of the storm just going to have a wide destructive swat\nAs a as a category for a ears Governor Scott of Florida this was this morning a press conference audio soundbite number one just to give you a taste of how local officials in the governor's office are dealing with\nI just spoke with a president who again offered all available federal resources we continue being cuts in contact with FEMA and their team in the state of emergency operations center\nThat includes experts from homeland security the BPA the department of defense health and Human Services and the Army Corps of engineers along our coast communities are going to see a Nashville devastation\nOn imaginable devastation [noise] those little hype always in this to get people to listen to get their attention but there's always\nA lot of hype and these things and as an expert a local resident expert I can tell you that people who live in these areas for a long time I've heard this over and over again and very rarely are these storms as bad as they predict and so people over the course of time\nAdopt an attitude yeah they're making it worse it's going to be for whatever reason they started to scare everybody get them to evacuate or what have you\nUm\nPeople deal with these in different ways who live in areas and have experience with um now\nI'm there have been four major hurricanes in the two years of the Trump presidency\nAnd\nNot a one of them outside this mess in Puerto Rico not a ... one of them have the media been able\nTo label Trump's Katrina they've tried in advance they have not been able to see the premiere good\nDeals putting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options consider find you the loan them you write for\nCall a civilian storey\n\nMy point is again\nDo not fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and that there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats in their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they\nReally believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be this theory of hand or depressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ... Ning up turnout ... up interest and they're really flux and ticked off\nAt a bunch of polling data there is an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News pull a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women\nAre saying in polling data that they have veil reading new interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote\nThis is not what we're supposed to happen\nThat's why all these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white\nConservative suburban women and do we need them or not and we don't they say so this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand six in as you remember any pieces\nBefore the presidential race\nAnywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here where Trump good when you got a diamond back we've got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were ... they were definitely of a a convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\nHad been put through what do you make about Hillary\nAnd what message including the president's mocking of Christie ... Ford for her allegations of what message does that send to women\nAnd remember women went for President Trump in two thousand sixteen Hillary said white women did I'm an for yes that's right white women I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one\nWhite women all white women all women went for me white women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against\nDemocrat presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice didn't last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're\nIn Hillary Clinton's stumbled and the swerve into a truth\nExcept for a very exceptional election year of Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK\nAssassination the Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circle there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women have been rejecting them this is why this kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left as as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again\nFrom about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to seat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through with the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to\nDo it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell Nineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course led to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted it here it's a Christian I'm poor up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they had to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do was change America\nSo back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christiana on poor it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillar of our constitution look to\nThe apps that judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton's the rest of the Democrats as your private\n\nLooked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal\n... the steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture to log on to reality today is because Democrats activist judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most certainly example of\nThis but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning legislation to\nImplement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's\nAt stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ... the ass not by you in fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state of college so I was speaking yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other\nWe're not going to destroy each other Hillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christianity I'm poor listening to one another working on our differences but\nThat is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland and here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nYou're blue in the face that's what Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies\nI was just calling to make a comment about Hillary's about painter slept\nIn twenty sixteen Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry were out there banging down college dorm doors telling people to get out to vote and obviously that that didn't work Miley Cyrus was crying after Donald Trump was elected I I I think most of\nThe mainstream Americans middle Americans aren't afraid of the Democrats and Taylor Swift telling people to vote\nOr I you know I I totally understand that I I don't miss it I\nTried to say that I'm go either way up or down inside out backwards forwards on Taylor Swift my comment was on the media\nReaction the Taylor says well here's Taylor Swift and comes out so she can't stand that woman running for the Senate and Tennessee just can't stand her\nThe median desperate\nThen reports that Taylor Swift comments caused massive Democrat voter registration\nJust just making it up\nThen the president announces he's going to have lunch with Kanye West than the oval office tomorrow what happens next\nMr james dean and Mrs Jay Z Beyonce come out and denounce cognac\nEnd and Kim ... a tool for they denounce ... and his wife came ... meanwhile Taylor Swift hosts some music award show last night nobody watched it the ratings plummeted doing all time low\nSo how can it be the Taylor Swift sponsored inspired massive voter registration drive after criticizing a Democrat or Republican Senate candidate in Tennessee\nNow where is this massive belief and support if he's got this popularity and people can't wait to do what she says and express their support than why didn't the same people turn around and watch her show\nThat we're not supposed to ask the question to different things Russia camp extrapolate do voter registration drives an audience was for award show I can you people can make it up left and right I can draw on my own analogies I can ask these questions\nI'm happy to hear you say out there but that this stuff doesn't um\nIntimidate you I think I think it has an intimidated average of Republican voters in a long time elected Republicans are a bit of a different story Dennis in a ... great to have you is or how you doing\nWell thank you longtime listener measures her first time caller thank you\nSo it was just a wanting to comment on on the ... thing with Muslim due to last night and I can't quote it exactly but she said if you disagree or if\nIf the party is destroying the things you believe in a low that you should be a civil would that not apply to the Democratic party is will Republicans conservatives I'm being uncivil to the likes of her\nShort would sure what I mean that's the standard if the party that you you you oppose is destroying your way of life and you must be an civil against\nBut [noise] [noise]\nAnd you know this in the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party world\nUm our world should be destroyed that is just is that\nIs what's called for conservatives and Republicans being destroyed that is the new morality\nFighting back are resisting we deserve what would that\n\n\n\nI Walk about yeah we got some juicy audio soundbites coming up there was a there was a new replaying all old refrain aimed at a new target last night that the Trump rally\nLock her up a was now\nIt now includes Dianne Feinstein at Trump rallies all that's coming up in the mean time Susan in Cary North Carolina great to have you here Hi\nHi thanks rash thanks for taking my call you bet anytime\n[laughter] hey I Want her in for a while

he gets gets up at the White House and things like that would be the most efficient way\nI can honestly say that I Do not know\nIf the president listens to the podcast now he's told me he listens to the program and it gets a chance I mean he is is but you know who knows but he's told me he does I I I've I'm very flattered by by your comment can I ask you a question before we go on I'm sure I'm

hear your taking advantage of the of the of the opportunity we were among the first to make to make content available in this program available via podcast\nAll these people out there with their podcast these days cereal this and breakfast look that and all that we were at the front of the gang of people do it and podcasts\nOf the reasons he doesn't is ... ... the media and everybody see what
