which is no doubt to crash the U.S border\nWhat is more likely that Trump could loaded with putting the influence the presidential election today I was sixteen or Democrats loaded with organizers of the invasion to influence this election serious charge\nSerious serious charge this is an attempt to interfere with our elections is\nWhat if the Democrats are found to be behind\nWelcome back is Rush Limbaugh right the heavier the excellence in broadcasting network where we need and surpass audience expectations every day our telephone number if you want to join us eight hundred to eight two to eight eight to email address I'll rush ... at\nThe ivy net dot US and yes I'm going to get to Obama\nIn Nevada you know the the CNN graphic that's been running all day Trump spreads lives ... stokes fear ahead of election\nI don't care what Donald Trump lives about mistakes are there is no body in Morocco bombers league in terms of purposely lying\nTo deceive people such as you like your doctor you keep your doctor if you don't like your health plan you get to keep your health plan with\nObamacare your average and you won't premium will be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars those lives were told over and over and over again to dope\nOn winning Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to a centrally be\nCost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they like their doctor in plan that wasn't going to be any change and we later found out of course we knew from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody\nHe was lying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about such things so much hope was invested in Obama\nMisplaced as it turns out those lives again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant to deceive people\nThose lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's status takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives if you control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you control them\nYou can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line at the doctor and this is exactly what Obama and the Democrats were doing it didn't get a single Republican vote did the media run\nBanner headlines Obama's spreads lies and stokes fear to pass Obamacare [laughter]\nNo way how about the Benghazi disaster with Obama and Hillary lying for months\nThat video produced by somebody nobody ever heard of cause the unrest that led to the riots in ... knowing all along that it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\nThose are all lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protest himself\nAnd Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn fool decision how about the law is Obama told about drawing red lines in Syria\nThe Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the polls in record numbers starting at the two thousands hadn't been terms\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody\nWell when you think about it was great to government knew remember who started or remember\nWho was and he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God like you've got to look up seeing him but you're you're so far beneath him he can't see you just woken up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where it is critical I'm going to strike for rock Obama\nClinton and create these economic circumstances if his wife depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe what has happened in the last two years was possible but beyond that he did not want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf that if they stand aside and led government take care of things\nThis guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years about Obama colluding with Russia\nOn getting rid of American nuclear weapons or an open Mike after the twenty ... right before the twenty twelve presidential election Obama's overheard\nTalking to ... number one the aid he says you tell Vladimir to be patient I'll have a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meaning I'd have to run again and so I'll be able to even get rid of more nukes in our stockpiled than I could be for\nThe guy was just an auditor disaster that the American people quickly realized as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nThat it was okay to vote against\nThe interest of the first African American president than the country began its recovery\n\nThe American people when it came to voting for Obama they couldn't pull a trigger not do it but when they came to voting against Democrats they did it in droves every chance they got starting in\nTwo thousand Sam put a picture up we got a picture for even a digital camera going to send us up to Rush Limbaugh not can we have to picture side by side make the switch on the left is Obama in Nevada on the right is Trump last night in Houston\nTo media reporting it or they have heard it and are ignoring it\nWe're we're we're actually in a political battle with people who are not right mentally forget emotionally these people are not right mentally see them protesting Mitch McConnell and his wife having dinner at a restaurant in Kentucky I mean they're not right\nThere's something really really off about these people and I think they've been driven to various degrees of insanity by professors teachers and the media [noise] they've been lied to for so long about things that the things they expect to happen in the things they think are real are so devoid\nOf reality and truth that they're on the table do except to Jim Jim Jim Acosta having the president whip people up\nAt a rally after rally he says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this is the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job\nIs covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what Trump is doing to America the danger is\nHow America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally and you know people would give you a hard time I you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the two thousand a campaign\nBut at a rally after rally after rally\nHaving the part of the United states where people up into a frenzy and attacked the press to me is the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist man\nOh man we're has this guy been to the Trump whipping\nPeople up at rally after rally and having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as a gym you can get but you've got\nAll kinds of 'cause you could go be a waiver you obviously listen well Mr\nAcosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here you know thousands\nAnd thousands of people who are willing to join in and do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised grudging enforced\nThey for body slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man who was doing these body slam moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm gonna cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to him after was over and I talk to them about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you could find Hillary's emails and media is looking for making maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty pounds name was let the media they love to hear from me\nAnd everybody in the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack Hillary server Hillary's already done the hack Hillary's already done whatever she has something to hide the emails\nNo sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises it guy for being able to body slam somebody they see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that\nThey think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence\nThink Trump is recommending and praising germ ... but they just I I've never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and absent from reality from day to day life and how people talk to each other he goes up to this\nGuy and the guys laughing hey man hey Jim Acosta how you're doing I really didn't want to see what you're ... you know I'm just wondering what your dude you're out there trying to destroy everything I Believe in Mr ... I'm just having a little fun with\nTo know what's good for you which is how the left looks at the body politic in general it is how the left in how Obama it's how Hillary Clinton the deplorable Z why Hillary Clinton says well\nYou know instability is warranted until we get our power back\nThings will get civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power they've done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them\nThey've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack\nPlans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way Republicans in the past them kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning to promise to do this that and the other to get an office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the media\nThey've had Republicans who are elected properly intend to David\nDavid able to persuade you that various Republican stink not worth your support we've been able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to their Jim Acosta in Houston\nTexas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside and just roaring and cheering and having the best time they've had in a week or longer and he can't stand it after\nAll his hard work trying to get you to hate Trump after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you'll keep falling for the lies and you keep falling for the hate\nYeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer is afternoon show\nAt some convention setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now [laughter] it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president has it anymore but what is troubling as to look behind you see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how is this who believes [noise]\nAnd he does it I think because it still works Jill rile people up\nDivides us horribly yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear every election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you went to Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling the look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now who believes this he does it I think because it's still\nWorks at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows what he's Trump knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working is spend golly like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake in the Washington establishment never Trump hers have resent the hell out of Trump Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid now you are which takes me to one piece that I had ready to go yesterday but\nDidn't get to it David go lurk brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale his specialty is computer science but Williams cited his work countless times\nOn this program over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the ... way back when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist at detach L L C most recent book tides of mind\nAnd his piece yesterday the real reason they hate Trump\nAnd let me give you some quotes from this piece every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating in for a reason most commentators forget to mention the Democrats have no issues\nThe economy is booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased print says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared\nIn contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any honest leftist for future generations the capital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to the shore rains and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan\nThe whole Kevin episode was was intellectually bankrupted was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it even to the point of carrying not that they ...\nDestroying an American life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has none left how's this trigger\nLerner says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands\nBut then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction today left just pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the ... only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America and hate America it does folks\nNot that every leftist hates America but the leftist either no right to alert or at Yale\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood is they hate his certainty that America is exceptional and they hate his mistrust of intellectual\nThey hate his love of simple ideas that work they hate\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable and worst of all\nShe doesn't have any ... except getting the job done his goals are to do the task before him\nNot be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself invents and uses\nI'll tell you folks and this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocratic Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity a day but they sit there and hypocritical claimed to despise Trump's they hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blunt they hate he is certainty that America is decent\nThan exceptional may hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have have serious\nProblems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nCertain that I didn't have any doubts about what I believed\nI've had so many people are just not right and everybody has to you you just don't wait too you know nobody can be that kind of an open I Am I Know your full of it I Know you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this or you'd be doing the right thing\nThey can't stand that they\nLove it quick vacation they love people see the both sides of the things they he reaching out with the heart\nThey hate certainty especially when a conflict with their own now back to Trump he lacked constraints\nThat the left hates them or because he's filthy rich always has been and unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever he never learned to keep his real opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities\nGuy went swimming doesn't see the need to apologize for it\nSometimes he's treated women disgraceful you for which Americans left in writer shamed of him as they are of JFK and Bill Clinton but\nGartner says my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America I'm Sorry about the ... of ... constrained average American that Mr Trump conveys that caution is this unprecedented makes us look band other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents worry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself losing sleep over it\n[noise] the difference between citizens who hate Mr Trump and those who can live with him whether\nAs a gardener with one final point here he uh he observes that many left wing intellectuals are in fact counting on technology\nTo do away with these jobs that I just went through that sustain all of those old fashioned truck drivers have people they're looking forward to your people being a robot and out of jobs\nBut he says they are laughing wide the markets impossible to transport food and clothing or hug your wife or a girl or trout are sitting silently with your best friend over the Internet you can't do\nMany of these jobs over the Internet maybe that's obvious\nBut to be an intellectual means nothing is obvious Trump's no genius but if you master the obvious an ad common sense\nYou were nine tenths of the way home scholarship is fine but the typical modern intellectual cheapens his learning with politics is proud to bury his teaching with a broken down the left wing junk [noise]\nDavid Gardner computer science professor at Yale basically\nBasically saying the real problem the real problem is all you people voted for Trump view continue to ignore your betters you're ignoring the Democrats are ignoring the never Trump or his you are ignoring the media who are trying to warn you but you persist and go with the Trump rallies they can't stand it\nThat's why they make up these stories about gigantic blue wave sweeping you out of the ways sweeping\nYour candidates out of the way they can't wait for you to except they're the ones that are losing elections\nDonald Trump was elected president by a significant electoral college margin\nThey can't win these elections that they've been hoping and praying to win ever since all these special elections now the midterms coming up looking out they're lying to themselves about the future they're going to win back control of the house or what are they going to do with it they're going to investigate Trump\nNancy Pelosi can't help herself she is bragging talking about the subpoena power\nIs that really what the American people want they want Donald Trump and the people who work for him brought up under investigation for two years\nInstead of real life on the ground improving the way it is is this what the Democrats and media really think it's just what they're left wing candidates really believe that the American people\nAre so filled with rain ... Donald Trump and his administration they want all of them investigated they want all of them put in jail they want the truth to come out the Trump cheated against Hillary with Russia they're still obsessed with the stuff they're obsessed with the fact that this election was they're stolen from them\nAnd now it's time to make it All right\nAnd they are convinced you\nWhat Trump investigated too and they're\nJust fit to be tied they haven't persuaded you to join them so now you're part of the problem and so the American left in the media are actually trying to create a nation\nThat consists of a majority of angry deranged lunatics in order to get what\nThey the media and the Democrats want that's what they're trying to create right in front of our eyes I'm heating and air conditioning traffic center\nFound I from person to thrown into convoy passes there isn't a clearing pages that you have to lean plot threats appointed a ... driver for Seventeen clearing season that accident blunt alone will drive at him like that in the office of science\n[noise]\nOkay time now to get to the phones and once again I sincerely appreciate everybody holding on we're going to start in a biased Ohio David Europe first today high\nHigh rash thanks for taking my call Yes sir\nThis morning I was listening to NPR and Steve [laughter] I ate a reference to the mob but he didn't want to call 'em all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality\nSaying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the hardest jobs in the ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mark the here's one whenever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people when it's good for them but when it's like when they want to use the humanitarian side it's such a disaster\nBut there's you know thousands of the line well and he couldn't even see the end of the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so ah your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's at great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to that for that day listening to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can do for\nWe've got a bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here uh\nAbout the only time I registered NPR is when they run and pieces to translate what I've said uh for the\nAudience and and that happens why get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\n[laughter] ah but of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people who are these people\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemala El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and the violence and whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day he was signing believe\nAnd they just they just they just they just because they're human beings they just have a decent life you know in in in in ... and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an assault base screwed Trump Trump simpler trumps the Nazi this there's no doubt this was a political movement it has been orchestrated and design that is being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nWays this could be helpful a Democrat causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited and cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of deny the entry in this kind of thing but but for the\nMedia to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but that there's no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of what's\nThis guy's Jorge way most or ... or whatever it is it what did he tell among do ... what what what does it tell her tell her no but what is it Univision right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way folks [laughter]\nThey don't look like the kind of people you want to run in to [noise] you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at I'm behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAs it benefits the Trump\nEarlier and as long as the story begins earlier this month Trump's political team review and polling firm congressional districts that were competitive\nIn the twenty sixteen election they showed that border protection safeguarding immigration officers standing up to illegal immigration resonated with voters there according to a person with knowledge of the ... what do you mean according to a person would [noise]\nCommon sense the president made a big deal you people or maybe ever heard of the wall\n\nImmigration illegal immigration shoring up the border protecting the sovereignty of the United states is why Donald Trump got elected unique focus group research to prove this to you\nPresident seized on the issue is is winners for Republicans are attempting to preserve their congressional majority\nOh so Trump was locked into this because these people in the caravan chosen the wrong time to show up\nNext paragraph Trump is since found the perfect opening with a migrant caravans sneaking up through Central America toward the U.S border and hitting his favorite cable news TV shows\nAnd now the president's talking tweeting nonstop about the caravan hoping strategy don't pay off in the final two weeks before election I like these people in the media got nothing to do with this caravan like their buddies in the Democratic party and there are a leftist donors have nothing to do with this why this thing just happened and\nTrump and we know this because we looked at research data the media says Trump made a big deal out of immigration and two thousand sixteen and he's doing it again\nWhy don't you people go all the way and accusing Trump of putting together this caravan [noise]\nI've been waiting for the ... to try that I've been waiting for somebody in the drive by just suggest the Trump or the Republicans might actually be behind this\nThey quote Trump from his rally last night the Democrats don't care what they're extremist immigration agenda will duty or neighborhoods or your hospitals are your schools they don't care that the mess\nCalming will totally bankrupt our country and then they quoted tweet from Trump every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws remembered the germs\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north\nHave the Democrats book asked about the\nTiming worry them and national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this\n\nEven before the caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on immigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony in the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers\nPersuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which she has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story trying to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him\nBecause it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it when when you get down to brass tacks\nMost people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are every day anyway\nWhether people show up in a group detour five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nThat are worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind those and the reason I say this it may make no sense it may as well with that because this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this smoke they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so\nPoisoned with hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta put\nYourselves in their shoes every day they've gotten up for two years and I've read in the New York times I'll Trump's toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's the co loaded with food is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has the goods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them now you got ... out there promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality and their perplexed\nBecause none of what they have done has worked in a white has worked its it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nFit to be tied\nOver it they're at their wits candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance of Democrats win just to make themselves feel better about things but they really bumped\nReduce the number one of your personality appalled by Rush Limbaugh hardly be\nAmerica's worst news we're going in the everyday five to six AM\nRadio and I enjoy going on or well may take cigars for example the details are what matter same goes for simply say home security\nTheir attention to detail and craftsmanship makes simply say system truly different from everything else out there it's easy to set up and it's easy to use and it works in the event of power outages are downed wires because there aren't any of those\nAnd there are no contracts get ten percent are simply say usa dot com that's simply safe usa dot com\nYour brain is an amazing thing as you get older macho really begins to homes housing Alaska for even ... three calls [noise] thankfully the brain feeling president how your brain and actually improve memory\nThe secret is an ingredient originally ... in clinical trials Kravitz sound can improve short term memory\nHealthier brain better life ...\nStatements have not been evaluated by the Afghan this product is not in the store or prevent valet\n[laughter] [noise]\nMore consideration to people who come from Central America than from Mexico in our asylum and an entry policy it was originally intended to dissuade people from Mexico\nFrom Washington and Lee attempting to immigrate or cross the border\nBuddy it's had the exact opposite effect it has forced people that want to come into the United states to first go down to Guatemala\nEl Salvador or Honduras and start the track from there because current US law makes it easier to get into the country if you're a trek starts south of Michael\n[noise] and that's a lot of what's going on here but if you in any way permit\nThe this mob but to enter the country after the track you may as well just send out engraved invitations to anybody else around the world\nAnd say come on it just can't do that and I have no doubt that whoever is behind this is attempting to pressure border control\nA American political systems and it's it's designed to make people I think put up their hands like some are starting to we can't stop at rush we can't stop but we just got a lot of men we can't stop it\n\nI I think it's ... it's almost a variation of of course our proven or even Easter sociologists who believe that the way to really transform America the way they're really get this country right is to destroy it\nBy overwhelming the welfare state just living as many people as possible demanding and claiming benefits to the point they cannot be paid there isn't the money I have the whole system collapse and then the left will be there to rebuild it\nIn their image based on the disappointment an anger of the people who were left out\nAnd that is a strategic plan it's right alongside the ... lights for literally destroying the United states by overwhelming the social safety net apparatus and that's of I think another microcosm of what\nThis mob is it's a visual aid that shows America being overrun\nIt illustrates America is by itself in\nWealth and prosperity and that we owe it to the rest of the world to Sharon it's not fair we have so much and they have so little and they live so relatively close\nDon't\nDoubt the politics of this for eight minutes and they are not humanitarian the politics of this are decidedly\nRelated and associated with an assault on America for the purposes of trans forming it into the kinds of country of the Obama heights\nWe're seeking and failed to accomplish thank goodness now\nNew York times anatomy now does not determine gender what what is this about why in the world we're we're talking about a percentage of the population it's not even one percent here\nAnd yet it has become a this group of people has become a major major support group of the American the left and the American media for what purpose\nDefining janitors says the New York times as a condition determines strictly by a person's genitalia is based on a notion that doctors and scientists abandoned long\nAgo as oversimplified and often medically meaningless\nAre you kidding me determining whether somebody is male or female\nDetermined by a person's genitals is old fashioned is no longer applicable and needs to be abandoned because it hasn't been abandoned long ago by sensible scientists\nSo this is the party of sites a Democratic Party science consensus of scientists and so far to climate change\n\nResearchers who studied gender issues and provided health care to people who do not fit the typical male female pigeon holed said that the Trump administration's latest plan to define gender goes beyond the limits of scientific knowledge\nQuote Dr Josh it was safer and in droves endocrinologist an executive director of the center for transgender medicine and surgery at Mount Sinai health system in New York says the idea that a person sex is determined\nBy their anatomy at birth is simply not true and we've known that it's not true for decades\n[noise] so you have a baby and your baby has male genitalia\nBut we've known for a long time that you're a baby is not male\n... necessarily the same time and you have a baby that has female genitalia but no it's not necessarily female as we've known this\nFor decades\n\nAre anatomy does not say what it says\nSo then the New York times asked well then what does that term and gender identity a person's powerful core knowledge of who they are is not so clear\nHere again as the doctor from\nMount Sinai in New York we know that there are a and there is a significant and durable biological underpinning to gender identity well we don't know are all of the biological factors at play that explained gender identity\nAs far as we in the mainstream biological medical community understand it in two thousand eighty and it is hard wired is biological it is not entirely hormonal and we don't have\nIdentified dean so we cannot specifically say that it is genetic\nGenetics plays a role in determining your a gender has [noise] ah in studies of twins if one is transgender the other is far more likely to also be transgender if they're identical rather than fraternal identical twins are ... what is going on here\n\nAnatomy does not determine gender experts say a companion story here that's also in the this is NBC News\nUS President Donald Trump said Monday the transgender issues were in flux in that he aims to protect the country after a report that his administration was considering defining janitor as male or female based on gender tail at birth and that drew wide spread condemnation\nTrump's that we have a lot of different concepts right now a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now asked about a campaign promise to protect the L G B. T. kill community Trump said I'm protecting everybody\nI Want to protect our country under a proposal first reported by the New York times on Sunday the Trump Administration would\nNarrow the definition of gender to male or female at birth than it would be an changeable later in life\n[noise] okay\nYou're asking what's going on let me very simply and yet very controversial you explain what's going on here\n[noise] this is all politics pure and simple\nTotal politics disguised as something else\nThe Democrat Party has embraced\nAll of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities\nAnd is in the process of trying to normalize them all by in training them as policy planks ... issues in the Democratic party platform and this is how we we end up with people that represent ...\nCreate if you if you think of it this way as a group enough large enough to join the rest of your coalition that go out and help you win elections it's it's there's no doubt what this is in Trump's instincts on this are right on the money the idea\nThat you can determine gender [noise]\nBy Jenna town is under\n\nLet me try\nThis one more way why is trans gender stuff in the news anyway\nFolks\nNormalizing psychosis is what the modern day Democratic Party has been about what what is what is more fitting proof of what we have been saying how about how the Democratic agenda is driven by people with mental disorders and and uh when I say this I say this with all\nCompassion towards people with mental disorders the Democrat Party is converting those mental disorders and really lying to these people they're converting these mental disorders which need to be treated\nBy professionals are converting them into political issues they're whipping up a bunch of anger\nAnd they're convincing these people that the mental disorder is really the result of Republican conservative mistreatment and lack of government sympathy and so they're going to get even with people are going to get whatever is troubling people fits that are going to punish people who are responsible for it\nThe Democrats used Kavanaugh to whip up the women's vote\n\nThe Democrats think that every one of their voter groups can be whipped up into action by pointing out the mistreatment of conservatives Republicans or what have you\nThey are using immigration and this caravan mob to whip up the Hispanic vote because they can see the Hispanic voter approval for Trump is skyrocketing\nThey are using the show the story to try to whip up the Muslim and Middle Eastern vote and of course the journalist vote which and I have to do much whipping up there because they own the journalist vote but all of these issues are being used to focus hatred on Donald Trump\nAnd to try to convince people that Trump is responsible for all of these things and a half people so upset and so angry and now they're using transgender to whip up again vote and and other related people in the Democratic party who are running around thinking that life is filled with nothing but unfair discrimination\nYou just you wait let's see you wait till the first male conservative Republican candidate decides to self identify as a woman\nTo get votes and let's see how tolerant than drive by media and the rest of the Democrats are when a transgender conservative pops up if such\nThing would happen [noise]\nYou just wait and see what kind of tolerance they've just like there's tolerance for black conservatives and there's tolerance for females who are not feminists that you know how that works out [noise] and there is not any tolerance for homosexuals who are not part of a leftist\nMeant if you will [noise] by the way my pants [noise] says that\nThe Honduran president told him that Venezuela is funding this mob say Breitbart story vice president Mike Pence that ice other Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez told him that the migrant mob marching toward the U.S Mexico border is financed by Venezuela\n[noise] now I've got serious quite Venezuelans have any money but I take that back\nI take that back the Venezuelan government it's like oh sorry [laughter] [noise] it's the Venezuelan people that don't have anything because their government has it all [laughter] my bad Venezuela couldn't be funding this now\nHence may be allegation while defending Trump's assertion that middle Easterners make up part why by the white why is have you noticed that Dr buys are outraged by that Trump is saying that there's some Middle East there are some middle Easterners in this caravan they'd been identified we've got people down there and better than this thing\nThere are people from all over the place in this caravan they're not just from Honduras in Guatemala and they're not just Hispanic or Latino\nBut why get mad about that what what what's the point to me that there's middle Easterners or why wasn't why does the media and go bad crazy trying to deny that\nWhat's wrong with middle Easterners being in a caravan to destroy us immigration system\n\nThat's made this allegation while defending Trump's assertion\nIn an interview with Robert Costa of the Washington Post Pence said it's inconceivable that there are not people admitted ... Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than seven thousand people advancing toward the border\nIn the last fiscal year we apprehended more than ten terrorists and suspected terrorists that our southern border from countries referred to end the lexicon as other than my uncle that means from the middle east region\nVice president then revealed that her name just told him the leftist groups from Venezuela organized the caravan financed by Venezuela\nTo challenge our sovereignty and challenge our borders [noise] levels the [noise] Venezuelans do have is the Venezuelan government does it you know it's it's\nBecome almost habitual to to associate all this with George Soros 'cause he funds so much of this kind of stuff we will eventually find out [noise] we'll eventually find out everything we need to know about who this is and none of us are going to be surprised hey folks there's all kinds of advantages to being able to work from home\nEvery now and then uh\nIf you are relying on the computers and programs in your office down in working at home can be a challenge\nBut there is a solution for this and it comes from our good buddies I drive I drive have introduced a service called remote PC it's an online service remote PC lets you securely connect to your office PC or your Mac from anywhere whether\nYou're at home working or you're", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "23"}
