helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more in line to go family care dot com that's bill family care dot com will call a three three four six seven eight to five nights for Medicaid plans from up to my health\nThe course of the many recent months I have made the point that one of the objectives of the modern American leftist to transform America\nThem away from its intentions and its designs is founded\nAnd in many ways this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration looked into it in a stealth white Obama couldn't come out and say\nBeyond that his policies were transformative uh he couldn't define what that meant a there would have been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transforming America man so what he\nClaimed it man was taking on issues like climate change and health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do was transformed America away from\nOur unique founding converted\nTo a socialist democracy some of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist\nBack look and there's a poll out here today this was the Daily Caller de Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials identify as democratic socialist according to a study that has been taking\nA [noise] you know you'd like to not believe this but the facts on the grounds as to what you see [noise]\nEven though maybe anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify of some kind of socialist than women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how ... how can that be\n'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't drivers socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism socialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism and communism attempt your race self reliant people self reliant people people do not need do not depend\nOn anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo social is in Congress on how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennials men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism which has had as one of its targets the the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjured up terms for it toxic masculinity dangerous\nMasculinity they are doing their best to erase mailed natural mailed characteristics\n... many young guys as they can and since guys want the power around with women\nWhatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course\nYou got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want them to do if the big book as famous and hot women did get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant and it\nJust the nature of things and so they're being highly highly successful and targeting America and its founding not just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept\nThat government is the institution that needs to be limited most in a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communist socialist so I have an evidence base here\nNot just slapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by Michael lift up a

quote\nKavanaugh has no avenue of appeal though except his own hurt feelings [noise] he's in touch with them as he was taught to be and so he seemingly weaponized crying the way a little boy does when he's in trouble\n[noise] another poll quote\nBut Kevin last performance last Thursday was something entirely different distinctly contemporary it's combined the post war attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings to the point that they make crime\nWith the intrinsic American ideal of white male privilege because Kevin is accused of sexual assault and may be denied the career elevation he has long why did he blah burned like a newborn\nHe has plot to end his career you've said\nHe hasn't had a series of goals and achieve them all all that guy is that dangerous schemer he has plotted the get on the Supreme Court\nI realize a lot of people think that that's what's uh that's that's what's in store here\nAnd of course I'm hearing I'm just going to happen I'm hearing from droves of you who say the proof is the timing\nThat she's going to do this after this program and is mean it means rush it can't be anything you're going to like I'm getting emails that say you think that's right too\nCertainly has absolutely thinks that's right as well well we'll we'll see I'm not I'm not going to withdraw my uh acknowledgement that I think she did the right thing [noise]\nBut I'm going

first with Chris hello\nThat rush a good to talk with you [noise] um this Monica McClain who you were just speaking of the person that contacted 'em as Kaiser on trying to get her to possibly change your testimony ...\nUh she she used the same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how a sheep and those coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Leland Kaiser to change your test those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either of that\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in the Senate and the testimony she she mentioned regal Delaware was where she was at and that's the last known address of of this moniker McLean\nYeah there's a ... absolutely that's when they wrote a letter when when when balls the Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was ... ... a dumb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat men are acting like they're having won\nBut you're not supposed to say these kinds of things\n\nYou know you were you what Trump allude in any way to women's time of the month and all hell is going to break loose\nHere ms Rubin gifts to talk about it as though it's common and every day and everybody gets everybody understands it\nAnd everybody knows what it means it means to stay away leave it alone don't engage yes ma'am yes ma'am three bucks or whatever and go on\nShe's with us\nBy alleging that Republican male senators are acting like the ... mentioned does Senator Grassley the chairman of the Judiciary Committee he has um I've never seen him this animated I've never seen a turtle this animated\nThis week the turtle and Grassley has been fit to be tied Grassley still Grassley sent a letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he sent it to Schumer you might've Senator Feinstein and in this wider he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by e M Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass with his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations us shortly one producer this quickly is you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucially Dr Ford's allegations\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence but the the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even low balls the Ford admitted\nThat she took a lie detector will her warriors did and that that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass and we've been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed away in fact we want to see it\nThey won't let him see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have\nClaimed some reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not gonna lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details tour therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce\nAnd Grassley said you're must be you must have something to hide that and he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in my October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices of Feinstein and Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ ... my ... and fried Debbie Ramirez Julie sweating underrepresented what what what Grassley is getting at here how much consultation if you had with his witness\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes them they are how how much time spent with this witness discussing her testimony\nOr coaching hard whatever I mean he loaded for bear\nThis just the kind of ... out of the violation and I shouldn't call it that these are the witnesses the kind of decorum\nThat you you don't see broken senators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules and and Grassley\nYesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphone do run into the senator or the the\nPeople as [noise]\nUsing by us and so forth in fact grab audio soundbite number five this was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference were not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an exam\nFull of grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning and washed but let's listen\nTo what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen Elijah\nIs centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged Marlboro when you hear things about get in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member theater coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society\nAnd it's been made worse by what has happened\nTo judge Kevin ... I Hope we can say\nNo to a mob rule by voting to\nConfirm studs Kevin ... before\nThat was during his ah southern for remarks today in favor of capital he was he was singling out by the way Maxine Waters for promoting this as he calls the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule\nAnd that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee\nAnd in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like this\nI may have to be tied now I think I have some might relate to it I got an email\nLast night from Salinas veto who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaigns season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned everything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo uh never Trump or his or anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be said of Republican political consultant so they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left at impugn didn't made fun of so I get a known for her last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the camping on hearings have meant and what has happened out there in these areas she has studied\nAnd she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump to gather now a lot of us ... that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six saying that they did sell for very specific reasons\nAmong them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six day in that they would not forget that\nAnd if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known results something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populists

the Kaiser is referred to as\nA heat wave in Kaiser is one of ... the ex wife a Bob Beck all in the letter to Feinstein\nLeyland Kaiser is referred to as a he'd this has led the analysts do believe that Ford didn't write the letter Ford would know that we ... would presumably no legal in Kaiser is not a man\nIt will in Kaiser is one of ... best buttons and she would know she's a woman but she's referred to as a heat\nSo now we're back to Monica McLean balls ease buddy who helped her ride the letter from her home in robot Delaware\n\nGuess what McLean is a former FBI agent said to have worked as a spokesperson for for Preet Bharara Preet Bharara former staffer for Senator Schumer he went on to become us attorney southern district for New York so Trump fired him\nAnd uh and now he is one of

board refers to her best friend Leyland Kaiser is a he falls asleep Ford's best friend is a woman mostly porn will notice\nSo if we win Kaiser's referred to as a he and the letter it's logical to conclude in Boise for getting write a letter\nOkay well then who might have helped her well that would be Monica McQueen whose home ... was in ...

Feinstein Kamala Harris\nI'm telling you this party the Democratic party in a just world wouldn't suffered the biggest mid term electoral defeat in this nation's history they deserve for this country to rise up against them at the ballot box because of everything they've done\nIn the past two years alone just to Trump and the people that voted for him specifically Kavanaugh got to\nTake a break

Court right now just not the right man\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo Kimberly stressful now she changing you're not changing she is saying that our minds not made up\n\nThe wing is a writer story and it says essentially Murkowski has not made a final decision\nYou could have fooled me it sounded awfully final to me this morning when I read it Brett Kavanaugh is not the right man for the Senate\nRight now\nNow she's saying it's not her final decision [noise] something is happening in that regard [noise] here Kimberly ... tweets again the first one to hear what they're they're both right on the money\nJust to be clear yeah I'm trying to amplify days\nI'm I'm trying to make sure more people hear about these tweets and then we'll see them yeah absolutely it's worth it\nKimberly straw so Wall Street journal columnist editorial page editor and writer just to be clear on what Lisa Murkowski voted for today\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska voted to legitimize and sign off on the most this pick a boat tactics ever in the Supreme Court nomination\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska voted today just stand with\nDiane Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris to leave judge Brett Kavanaugh's subject to claims of perjury and the impeachment which they're going to pursue by the way [noise] [noise] oh yeah or doing [noise] [noise]\nSo the other interesting thing had let her do develop it here but hang on to a second here's a second tweet from Kimberly stress all\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska today voted\nTo abandon due process and the presumption of innocence she voted to potentially if the Supreme Court and a four Ford that block\nWhich puts loaning Ninth Circuit court of appeals in control of everything that matters to Alaska her state development property rights gun rights environmental rules\nLisa Murkowski has made quite the statement\nThese are two devastating tweets as they are right on the money legitimizing and signing off on the most is fixable tactics ever standing with Feinstein Cory Booker\nKamala Harris who is in a class by herself in men das city and and a number of other things just just [noise] not much redeeming there but more importantly\nLisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh's subject to claims of perjury and impeachment\nAnd then leaving the court if he has not confirmed the court stays up for for a deadlock what the ... the reason that matters is that in a ... ... if the court votes for four and then the case then the decision prior to the court hearing it is affirmed nothing changes\n\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals wouldn't be the highest ranking court\nThat could make decisions\nRegarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be idiotic\nTo put the night if you're a Republican and and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in a bunch of left us in charge of those issues in her state this is shooting herself in the foot\nAll just supposedly\nBe in unison with me too movement\n[noise] so I mentioned that we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein it looks like she has cornered Murkowski I don't know when the photos\nWere taken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have checked Feinstein's wardrobe on a particular day of hearings\nBut go ahead Scott put it in the sweat you're for those of you I'm watching the dental ... there is a picture on standby 'cause we have a close up there is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally wasn't Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway of a Senate office building\nAnd\nThey are chatting with each other and Murkowski has a pain to look on her face Feinstein looks like\nShe is\nWhere the picture speaks for itself it it it it was that hand up she got her cornered she's got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski\nIt's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein leaning in to Murkowski\nNow\nLet's switch to the close up of that photo for those will be watching on the dental ... do you see the pain expression on the face of Murkowski\nAnd the expression of in hand\nSeriousness and you better be listening to me\nOn the face of diet for\nNow we'll have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave it buddy out but I Want to you watching on his little came to be able to see these that's that close up as the same shot\nJust to close up of the previously televised photo is that right\nWell done here looking here's this why Feinstein sure does look like a bully in Murkowski looks very uncomfortable does she not\nI mean it's it's been a really pained look on her face and it\nIt looks like Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what for\n[noise] [noise] I don't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong\nWe we have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been going\nWell I wouldn't call that romantic I take that back ah one of these is from California and romance there has all kinds of shapes and form so you could be right ah it it could be a romantic amateur load I certainly what's\nThe old saw it's not for us to criticize who loves who and why [noise] so\nUh yeah it can be a lot ... we don't know\nBut I've got to get these photos up the cocoa unless cocoa confined to assure cocoa confined them himself or he\nMay beat me the punch now the other [noise] breaking story [noise] that it's not a breaking story but\nIn the Senate campaign in Tennessee this is\nKind of interesting this is the marsh show Washburn story or race or let's see [noise] Marsha Blackburn I'm Sorry Marsha Blackburn a story her opponent is Phil Bredesen\nAnd\nBreathe is and is saying that he's discussed it and then if he was in the Senate he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh and he's a Democrat running against the incumbent Marsha Blackburn what is a Democrat and doing\nThings\nHave fresh and everybody's minds go after ... heard juror rainy and sexual harassment\nNot I mean serious serious things for which\nA conviction could ruin his life as well and then after they get ... then they go after Trump as the guy knowingly who nominated capital then they added all the other things\nOn Trump this is my guest that they would go after Kavanaugh first ... ... that Gorsuch they would leave alone Gorsuch\nShift the balance of McCord cabin on does\nThan we are backed by the way folks [noise] me to tell you were running a
