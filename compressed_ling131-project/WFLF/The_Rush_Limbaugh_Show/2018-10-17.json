possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did you I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central if at at elements\nProving their case but then when ... said this to me I had to pause I had to contemplate and then I had to consider he has a point but it was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just know it's

getting the word I we have the greatest autonomy and the history of our country and there's nothing we boarded\nOr you go it's that simple he's the only way he get his message out he's not gonna stop he loves it and the fact that they're getting frustrated than the CNN News media\nMedia whatever guy said\nTo merge talking brands and it's just too much media there's too much he's gotta he's gotta

have you ever hear of telephone number eight hundred to eight two to eight eight to look at this [noise]\nThis headline from Nuremberg knows Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump pro ... sources say\nDo they think that we are idiots\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings encore aspects of is Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections as he faces intensify and pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed but we don't even know if they're alive U.S officials\n\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something and they think it has got to be in tents every thing has blown\nUp autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus on us in her latest blew up on 'em Hillary blow up on 'em Stormy Daniels blow up on 'em\nEvery attempt in October surprise this year alone previous October's is blown up and now you know they've thought\nAll along that mother is gonna get the goods on how Trump's Foley election by cheating including what the Russians [laughter]\n[noise] and when this story broke that Mahler is not going to deliver a key findings adult after the election you mentioned me anger and the frustration not so much with all the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the game here but they're there and look at tech\nThe rain psychologically screwed up bass\nHe's probably beside itself because this is really ballgame for this is what they have been counting on they have been they've bought it they drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump treated with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished\nAfter them in terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this folks\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here include that report such as this from a special counsel will not be released\nWithin this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated rural it is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise I mean it's it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing wrong if not that we [noise] if if it's got things in it that they like which the ladder is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies and the drive by media rather\nThan break the rules and release the report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing they're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump pro ...\nSources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that ... Don moment just wrap it up while he's got big mother is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment they're going to be talking it up before the midterms\nIn hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping\nThat the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump stole the election\nIs imminent that is what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that will then influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is\n\nThey will create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger\nThat port handles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\n\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms when mullet releases his report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiving just see who will be running Congress before he decides to really ended this because his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically is bars at the department of justice and to Congress and there is decided whether or not that it is made public\nThanks rushed thanks for doing everything that you do Russian I had two quick points a one on a a lifelong Democrat [laughter] I was a teacher I just retired and I have been the biggest Trump supporter out there\nFor for ... when does your support for Trump again during the campaign OK okay go to the campaign\nAnd one of the reasons that I see\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against the seven anyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one reason was because she got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life\nThat these people aren't happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy in trying to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in and I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only my shelf if you put in a neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says she only reason she only way I can get my message out well his choice are good but not that many people really hear it and I can't understand why he does not address the nation I understand [noise]\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm going to really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn if she did acquire which ... most of the time\nAnd the fresh prince fish they skew anyway show if he addresses the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done the greatest time economically that I can never remembered I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like is\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit for the country doing well and that shocked you write\n[noise] you know not any more it a year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy ... regular I've ever seen or we can take bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with him because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't read short audio ... that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration of the U.S is with a news media and many people are in the same boat\nWho are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me it was me out of the country should so well and so many people going to go out and vote and they have no idea your newscast and they\nWell I think that you are a well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nDo you reach\nThe but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all them a wage is going up or my ...\nMy point is I think you're going to be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you can be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nWe take a break for that has to have much to say\nRussia's probably by being met for\nAlready we're doing good morning or let him do they do not I am more news radio Ninety three point want it to\nAll of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy or larger I Want you to get a pen and I want you to write this information them\nIf your age Seventy five year old and I'm a hundred thousand dollar larger my policy did you know you can convert that my policy into cash right now I'm not kidding you can turn your life insurance policy and the cold hard cash\nI Know

hours\nWhich are straight ahead we have a brief obscene profits we do make those\nRight here at the top of the hour and back\nKeep on keep an eye on after that\nThey didn't know I mean the Brady Fox knee is President Trump suggesting Saudi Arabia's leaders shouldn't be guilty until proven innocent\nContemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current\nIn either country it is a modern\nEra of generic peaks lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspapers one of them's big one of them small one of them is very curious take them very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise]\nDon't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is but one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\n\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there\nObviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the gun stitch breaking the rules there has to be something there miss treating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something\nAnd the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and and and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their\nCrosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that to its about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalists in these little medium sized markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's\nIt's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy\nThe day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the white like Brett Kavanaugh it's all\nAbout destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about\nIt I I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in a thing for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this\nI've seen two episodes so far out of the ... and I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen early on is this is one of the the editor the head honcho\nOf the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\n\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life to him\nEverybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job they're trying to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just that they're that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet\nThe story is not about the prime minister being a Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you would have ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it live with it\n\nAnd the ... I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to post or the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you would have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief\nThat everybody is law that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen nobody is decent nobody is white [laughter]\nIt's amazing how this in the eyes of a journalist an editor now I imagine\nReal journalist I got to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\n\nThat competing editor of the clean paper the above board and paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirmed the pita file story while the other paper puts it on the cover of having confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls they got as Peter found just get it up there and get it on the newsstands whereas the female editor didn't have the guts\nStill running until the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking they obviously are not worried about me too movement here that would put the same thing I saw the name of his press\nI have no idea it's it's I think it it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um it's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever and I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here and if you watch these kinds of things\nIt's fascinating 'cause it's not about politics but not a current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that [noise] if it's the it's bad hit everybody everybody as a rubber baked including the people at the papers\nThe reporters [noise] um\nI I have to admit I was so [noise] anyway here's Donna Brazil now I Would I did not lose my place ... bill hammered a day and they're talking about the blue wave where she thinks we're headed\nAnd remember now this is a woman that used to be one of the head honcho those are the DNC the Democratic party who in hurting normal countenance would be out there's oil yeah blue wave Democrat's gonna win ... gets it's our time people are fed up but that's not how she sounds\nSee how many days in a long time in politics [laughter] I'm not breaking out the champagne and I'm not trying to scramble my eggs before I get my chickens why\nWe still have to improve turnout turnout turnout turnout\nDemocratic victory depends on turnout among millennials want on a farm millennials voted in the last midterm we also got to make sure that we get a bank way before we can get a blue tie we need these women to when they're wearing says I'm confident not over confident\nWelcome back Rush Limbaugh half my brain and\nTied behind my back just to make it fair NBC News [noise]\nUncertainty over a blue wave NBC News fines Democrat and GOP voter registrations at the same level as past election cycles\nA but but but but but but but but but\nThe Democrats had Michelle my bell out there during a do a whole big voter registration drive out there\nThe Democrats have been registering voters in prison they've been registering voters is a DMV they've been registering voters at the at the at the at the medical marijuana places they've been registering voters everywhere in the world is it possible\nThat democratic voter registration levels at the same as past cycles the Democrats have been telling us that there's so much energy there is so much excitement there so much motivation there's so much inspiration to nothing can hold them back and yet and kept\nThe generic ballot once again is showing that this massive Democrat blue wave is not as big as once thought\nNow NBC is is is very very worried [noise] they're worried that something\nThat's not a blue wave may be shaping up here\nThat's what this headline is certainly the over a blue wave NBC News finds Democrat GOP voter registration at the same level as past cycles comparing registration activity from twenty fourteen to twenty sixteen with activity from twenty sixteen to current\nHelps put these numbers in the context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen include\nA complete picture of registration in front of those years\nWhereas twenty Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time well what that's all you need if you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to be registered in time to vote so it's that seems like a little\nHope will we don't have all fooled database or numbers for two thousand ha well you've got enough to know\n[noise] so how can this be how can voter registration with Democrats are supposed to be smoking us\nIn voter registration because there's so much more interest there so much hatred for Trump there's so many people that want to fix\nThat mistake then they call 'em from the Washington Post by Megan McCarthy dull trying to help the Democrats who she believes are morally\nSuperior and smarter than Republicans\nHeadlined will the blue wave collapse before it reaches the shore\nWhat Megan McCarthy ... Washington Post is doing is trying to help Democrats is saying that the Kavanaugh hearings backfired on the Democrats because it alienated man and now she's warning the Democrats\nTo stop to hide their agenda of identity politics until they get into power she's telling you guys have got to put the masked back on you Democrats have got to read camouflage yourselves she's warning the Democrats to hide the identity politics agenda\nOf course we should fight mythology and racism whether or not it's politically expedient these are important but the country faces lots of important moral questions\nDemocrats can't answer them without first getting into power she's saying these shot up stopped\nYour your your everything's backfiring until you Democrats shut\n\n\n\n\nI welcome back okay back to the phones we go I I'm I'm not through making the point is blue waves dumb but there's a lot of like\nHere is that the NBC poll do not expect a big democratic wave this fall I got three stories in a row here plus sign of Brazil\nAbout this now I don't want to make too much of it but that's the best thing that we can say about it is that they are losing confidence\nOr maybe they are just purposely dialing it back for Strategic\nReasons and I still think there is going to be what I I I don't think that's what's going on here I don't think they're able to discipline themselves\nUniversally unilaterally across the drive by leftist board there's always going to be some renegades that'll bust out of any attempt\nA in something like this but we'll get back to this I Need to get back to the phones first Canton, Mississippi and a ... nice to have your welcome to the E R B network\nThank you Mr Limbaugh free shaded this is definitely a bucket list item for me\nWhy planet I appreciate that very much\nUm so I had a a different take on why they're not going to release anything from them Mueller investigation before the terms\nThat not that I Would say you're wrong I mean I just uh I don't think that they have anything against Trump and they don't want it to the fight the Democrats' chances and you know boost the Republicans' chances in the mid term [noise]\nWell uh I that would be a wonderful and magnificent if that's true of all I can tell you is for what it's worse\nThere is in in the in\nThe quote unquote cannons a procedure in our revered and vaunted department of justice that nothing they do should impact elections I mean call me even cited this\nAs reasons for doing some of the things that he did it now I Know I Know I Know it looks like he was doing the exact opposite\nForget what he did for a moment it's what he said there is all I'm telling you is that there is this it may even be a written the regulations for all I Know\nBut it I I I Am for certain that it is and the knowledge gentlemen lady procedure that the the O. J. you know Doug balances of justice\nThe scales that justice are blind the department of justice does nothing including indictments that would impact and election now\nHillary cases do they had to exonerate heard their futures dependent on it their careers dependent on it and she was a Democrat nominee they're not going to be in the business of charging and pursuing indicting the Democratic nominee again\n... V. unwritten regulations not impacting the election so it does exist and it probably is a factor in smaller report not being released\nWhat I expect to happen well I don't know what could happen\nSince they've decided to leak that Mueller is about finished since they've decided to leak that the report is imminent let me get them headline again just to [noise] not have to paraphrase this Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\n[noise]\nThat you know this was going to drive the left literally batty\nThat it it it they're not going to be able to restrain themselves\nHow long do you think it's going to be before somebody on that side of the aisle starts demanding that Mahler revealed is how long do you think it's going to be before dawn lemon or little Brian\nStyle turned Jake Tapper any of these are the start demanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we know it shouldn't affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nYou're you're right to\nBe wary of career left wing deep state or is in there [noise] I look I wouldn't put anything past these people you can conjure up any\nScenario you wanted and I I Would bet eight out of ten of them I Would\nTell you I think are possible so given who these people are and given what they think is at stake here\nSo if you want to tell me if you have an idea that the the GDP numbers that come out next friday might be say monkey with but it's increasingly tough to use that word and get away with it and might have been Jimmy it might be\nA a\nWell reworked and so forth to make it look like we're about to fall off a clip art we fit this recovery is just hit a wall\nUm [noise] I don't know how effective it would be um but I don't I I wouldn't\nI wouldn't sit here and unilaterally suggest to you that it couldn't\nIt couldn't happen a and particularly the areas you mentioned they would love to be able to discredit Trump's tax cuts they would love to be able to ah to\nDiscredit a whole bunch of like the tariffs and what it's doing the trade the problem is\nReality reality on the ground if the if if the if the if the numbers are a ring\nTo that extent it just isn't gonna jibe with reality\nAnd it's and it wouldn't be I don't think nearly as effective as something as personal but I think you have to you have to look at the history of these October surprises they've tried October surprise in October they've tried them in September\nThey've thrown everything they've got at Trump including during the campaign the Access Hollywood video and that didn't work\nNow he's out there are calling the porn star who by the way is a back stabbing black mailing\nDouble crossing porn\nStars are combing her horse race and there are shutters and the drive by maybe s U D D the\nPresident's doesn't next you know what I find interesting about this\nAll of these so called parent kinds of virtue on the left where want ten per version has become normal in their world and they demand that we accept wanting perversion as normal they sit there and act like\n[laughter] all women Austin but we're not talking to a woman we're talking about\nA dual at ... ... ... ... what porn star double crossing back stabbing\nWoman who has tried to destroy the guy with her third rate lawyer\nShe's not just an innocent ordinary everyday woman the Trump decided to call it a name she is a woman who attempted to him\nBut for these liberal Democrats these people in the media to act like people don't talk to sweat prejudice still to come on\nPeople talk this way this is what resent what I resent about this the idea that they are cleaning shores the wind driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock simply look after the things they say about us during the course of your average political day\nFrom\nYour Hitler through your Nazis to Europe this or that they make fun of people's appearances they make fun of people I mean they ... their their comedy has become literally hate\nAnd then they act like one of the greatest social ... question Jim ... history of humanity is occurring when Donald Trump uses the term horse face when he did not mark balls the Ford but simply ... feet in\nThe truth about her allegations\nI just I just find that to just a little bit\nHollow as low take your pick ticket they take your pick any left wing or on media\nGriping about Trump's using the word horse race and ask yourself if that media reporter never talk that way and the answer but Russia these people are president and he is and this has been nice the dignity the presidency\n[noise] [noise] well I Know they look at it and think of it that way my point is they can try\nAll day long that's not going to separate Trump from his voters that some of his voters and she sent it back that there's so much good going on here focus on and don't don't need to distract every body with that stuff\nBut he did\nThey're also going to they're not going to give up trying to link Donald Trump to the murder of the uh of the journalists is in the Saudi conflict is some ... uh ... they're still working on that\nBut I think they're frustrated to no end that nothing they do works\nAnd now I have a story I have to print I haven't had the chance to printed yet just cleared the transom here uh it's about Trump's approval numbers are probably much better and much higher than anybody on the left and the media wants to add Mitt\nYou're smart as being home with news radio not agree on WFL\nI learned about your heart health or know

A. R. T. I. A. dot com\nBoom [noise]\nHe was gay MSNBC [noise]\nHas now gone back to the twenty Fifth Amendment we we need to use in plenty of the members and got rid of\nTrump is not that he's not that it was harsh punishments he's not ...\n[noise] uh\nIf you want to go back to the twenty Fifth Amendment it must be that you don't have anything else seems like the twenty fifth amendments always fall back when nothing else\nWorks now the CNBC story [laughter]\nA woman is still suffering from Pete TST in the shock of having been a salt in by Brett Kavanaugh on Trump's laughing at nothing to the store it happened and\nDonald Trump simply took it upon himself to inform the American people wouldn't drive by maybe were hiding\nThat she didn't know anything about the event she couldn't tell anybody where it happened when it happened she couldn't describe the house where it was she wasn't even sure of the year much less than a month she\nIdentified for people over there all four said they were not there she did not have any answer for how she got home what she said to the person she first met after this happened none of it all Trump there was remind everybody of this or actually inform them because the drive buys had not\nAnd that then cause the meat eater run the story of Donald Trump saying this because they hadn't been hiding it\nThey hit it because it was not helpful to their ... their cause which was getting rid of Cavanaugh I mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence\nPlaces people there who deny there were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer immediate not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap and reports over and over Trump saying it while accusing him of mocking her\nMocking is not what he did\nTo my career he would've had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonate her he simply\nReminded everybody in the real world language that she had no evidence and it was the turning point in the outcome of those hearings make no mistake once Trump\nDid that and caused the media to end up reporting what they hadn't been ignoring\nThen\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls the Ford van is she has no evidence there was nothing to support\nPeople with the common sense there was nothing to do you believe her yeah the basis of what well I just thought of that one but she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said that were there and say they weren't\n... she became impossible to support and defend other than by partisans and that was the turning point and Kevin came in and of course his his re testimony is re appearance was a subtle factor in the whole thing is happening again\nThe story was that the porn stars defamation lawsuit a Trump got thrown out\nIt was nothing burger\nForum on ... drive by media reported that Stormy Daniels\nAnd the creepy to warrior that she hired ever not we're going to destroy Donald Trump they were going to prove that Trump had violated campaign finance laws to remember all this\nAnd there was Michael Cohen in the mix and he'd paid are often Michael Cohen's slipped and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how last he is\n\nBut the media invested a lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform whatever poll she was slithering around the drive by Israel they're making a hero out of her\n\nStormy Daniels became a cause ... even before balls the Ford did\nAnd then that fell apart\nA judge in Los Angeles for rule out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump\nClaiming it was bogus it had no merit so\nIn one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political\nAnd so did the lifespan of her creepy porn warrior who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges it that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump did\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to what news story that the drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was drunk Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact she\nHad been found guilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay is legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here ... the prostitute porn star is paying\nTrump who among us can arrange it that way folks but Donald Trump can\n\nThey also ignoring that part of it ignoring that the stripper\nPorn star and been ordered to pay Trump's legal fees\nBut when Trump called her horse space in a tweet all of the media were forced to run the story of his victory so you can sit there and say that Trump is embarrassing\nI guess they were stopped talking about people that way so it makes it so hard to\nRemember what I told you about the white Trump operates and pacing how he his original tank or opinion on any issue might make you think he's selling out but he gets that first take\nOn the record media says while it was very reasonable you said that Dr Balt the Ford was very credible very compelling shake Tony surprising then after the passage of time with Dr balls the Ford clearly has no evidence Trump says you've got no evidence and here's the evidence that she does however there's blah blah by the\nTrump gets his news covered the media\nWas not reporting this lawsuit have been thrown a media was not reporting and she had to pay his legal fees the media was not\nReporting of being Trump win and remember what was this woman and her lawyer we're trying to ruin\nTrump campaign finance violations and all of that [noise] so you can say you may not like the methodology but it ends up working as an email friend of mine said this is ingenious at work\n[noise] trust Trump\nYou mean so but he thinks it calling her horse race was genius somebody\n[noise] you have an email that I have here let's see what the Democrats try this headline this is\nFrom the hill dot com Democrats damp down hopes for climate change agenda what what does this say\nDemocrats are on the likely to pursue major climate change legislation even if they win the house majority despite a growing body of evidence suggesting time is running out to address\nThe issue is represents a shift in strip the jury\nFor one House Democrats last controlled the chamber in two thousand nine they they're not going to pursue it even if they win the house majority if they're not going to pursue it [noise]\nI Wonder why\nCould it be that in the span of forty years we've now have the force ten year warning at least the fourth warning we only have ten years\nAnd in the midst of these forty years we've also had reports that we're beyond the point of no return that there really is nothing we can do [noise]\n\nThey've tried everything now they're even saying that climate change is going to destroy beer and there's nothing we can do you know why is climate change going to ruin barley it's gonna ruin the ability to harvest and grow barely barely won the primary ingredients in beer [noise]\nBad news for judge capital right\nBusiness daily Trump's approval rating is ... better than you think some pull quotes as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now higher than our time with three of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with all\nThe alternative is it somehow they decide they're on the end of a sudden [noise]\nWell I you know I Try not to do much differently as when predators be consistent uh all the time of year round and so forth um\nI kind of ... well I I look at vote turnout a in an election like this I I like to assume that's why I ask you I like to assume that the audience of this program\nIs fully aware and up just like you are I think your typical of people in this audience there you're here because you're concerned you here because you're educated informed and involved and invest in in an outcome\nI most of the people in this in this audience are exceptions obviously\nSo I I I worry that it's somehow talking down to people to\nNot remember you're gotta get out there and vote you know you don't want the Democrats\nRunning a how long people already know that I don't want it so I'm looking for\nDifferent ways to accomplish the same motivation [noise]\n\n\nPlaces and I have a question I continue to get the emails about the [noise]\nSo how Washington Post journalist or Jim off your shoulders [noise] my\nQuestion is a really rather simple one where was this concern for our ambassador and three other men brutally murdered in Benghazi\nSomebody explain that to me you realize how much attention is being paid to what has it\nBeen confirmed as something happened since this program ... has it been can firmly that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia hasn't been confirmed not confirmed so they'll likely or thought to end the story is that it took him seven\nMinutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out and then they listen to music\nWhile they did all of this and of course\nUntil I blew up the theory that the apple watch contain the evidence they were going to try to make it look like proof existed in the form of audio recordings ... knew what was in store for him and it\nGoes apple watch the recording this stuff and the somehow is iPhone that very very unlikely\nBecause of it being technologically impossible barring a ... just only two exceptions that I have a tough time believing shall we even knew to do or how to do\n\nAll of this concern and remember\nHillary Clinton when repeated questions were asked about how in the world for Americans were allowed to be murdered in ...\nWith no assistance and Hillary Clinton's reaction what difference does it make now she said in frustration is is anybody see a a disparity here in proportion now of course\nWe all understand why the Democrats seriously believe they have a way\nOf blaming Donald Trump for his CNN\nAll afternoon has tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\nThat's it's despicable graphics that they were using to try to make that case\n\nBut I think there's a lot of a proportionality missing here and again I don't think the media realizes how obvious\nThere's subterfuge is to people now anyway you know every uh every home has a a front door with a lock on it Dr balls the Fords home had two ... two doors did you know that\nDr balls the Ford had two doors that's something to do with a claustrophobia and fear\n\nAnd handed over to Google employees reading this\n\nWait a minute it was a five hundred square foot place you had to front doors at the\n\nOther Google employees going back and they had her own separate front door oh well that's that's a big difference than needing it for claustrophobia and the the as the like being afraid Kevin always going to show up at any moment in the last thirty five years [noise] well anyway\nEverybody has a home with a front door and a lock on most people have one front door\nFor some people that's all they need to feel secure for others securing every door and every window is what's important\nTo feel safe in the side now how you go about securing all of those entry points now that's another thing early home security system providers gave you one solution and it was his name was fairly expensive and then simply save home security came along offering a solution\nTo protect all of your doors and windows in the most effective ways for far less money\nAnd they get that done by using state of the art technology and the systems they make\nThey use ... folks to connect all of these components together the sensors on the doors and windows the H. D. cameras the motion detectors the glass break sensors all of that they communicate with the primary base station in the house my wife I certainly wires drug that is so\nSo important so crucial in making this\nLast complex less of a problem and it makes it much harder to hack it I mean cutting wires is easy but disrupting wife I connections takes a little bit more work\nThey use ... and they use computer chips in their sensors in an detectors in the age the cameras that come with every system that sends signals would doors and windows are open\nAnd if you arm just simply say system as you've left the home you get a notification when there is activity I e somebody tried to break in or there is a fire or something simply safe pays attention to every detail of their home security system so that when you do the installation it's\nSimple and actually fun to do and when you finish", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "17"}
