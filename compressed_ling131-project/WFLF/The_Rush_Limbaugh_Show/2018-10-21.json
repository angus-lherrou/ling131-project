a and I heard a radio\nStation [noise]\nLawmakers aren't buying Saudi Arabia's story I'm Pam who south Fox News\nFees because you can't buy an index you can buy an index fund but the fund is\nGoing to have expenses\nMeans you're not going to earn ten you're going to earn ten minus the costs so if you have a diversified portfolio as the Ohio public employees' retirement system does they're projecting seven point two percent a year\nSo we need to keep this in mind for two reasons number one to make sure that your expectations are reasonable and realistic and number two to make sure that you recognize\nThat this is a long term projection and at any given moment this month's performance the last quarter the year to date the past one or three years\nThere's anything can happen in that short a period Ohio was suggesting that that's the rate of return that they're gonna hit in twenty Eighteen they're not suggesting that the return they got in the third quarter of the year or year today they're saying that over the long term they're expecting\nTargeting an assumption of seven point two percent and oh by the way\nThat's before fees because you know\nOhio doesn't pay the kinds of fees that retail investors had 'cause you don't have a hundred billion to invest and we all know that people will invest a hundred billion don't pay the costs that retail investors who have one million or one hundred thousand or ten grand et cetera et cetera get my point now let me take another step further\nWhen you are making your investments\nWhich investments is it your assuming are going to perform well because a lot of investors think that the key to generating six festival returns is by picking the right\nInvestments in other words there are Thirteen thousand mutual funds out there which one are you going to pick\nWell\nLet's look at it this way according to temper on in twenty twelve\nThis is six years ago\nThere were five hundred and Ninety us stock mutual funds that beat the S. and P. five hundred that year only five hundred Ninety out of the thousands of mutual funds that exist only five hundred Ninety of them beat the S. and P. five hundred so I Want to ask you the question do you think you could pick\nThe fund that's going to beat the overall market first of all the odds are probably not since such a few number did that in the first place but let's assume that you manage to successfully pick one of the best funds of the year good for you\nFive hundred and Ninety of them in twenty twelve of those five hundred Ninety Gino how many of them beat the market again the following year in twenty Thirteen\nHundred and forty two of the five hundred and Ninety who did it in twenty twelve only a hundred and forty of 'em did it again the next year and of those hundred and forty how many of them did it again in twenty four team only twenty two\nAnd a twenty two only three of them did it in twenty Fifteen and of the three only one of them did it in twenty sixteen in other words of the entire universe\nOf stock mutual funds up about ... of them that exist over the five year period from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen only on\nThe the us and the five hundred every year for five years in a row\nOut of thousands so unless you again do you think you can pick the funds that are going to outperform the market\nI don't think so I don't think we can do it and are from we don't even try instead what we do is provide passive\nInvestment approaches for our clients instead of trying to beat the market we're trying to provide the returns of the market minus fees and taxes and expenses associated with the investing exercise and guess what\nIf you're investing in that kind of a pattern you're not trying to beat the market you're trying not to get beaten\nBy taxes than inflation so that your money is earning a competitive rate of return which should be sufficient to enable you to achieve your financial goals and objectives and that's really the point it's not about beating the market it's about achieving your goals think about it this way two thousand eight\nIn two thousand eight the S. and P. five hundred stock index fell thirty six percent\nSo of you patch and above average fond of funds that beat the market instead of losing thirty six maybe\nYou lost thirty two is that like you know any consolation of any crime [laughter] right\nI mean we should be feeling really good we didn't lose thirty six percent of our money we only lost thirty two percent of our money you see my point meaning the markets not the goal that's not you should be trying to accomplish what you should be trying to\nAccomplish is making sure you are long term\nFinancial goals and objectives are met and to that end I'm going to cite a new study that just came out that shows that forty percent of middle class Americans forty percent\nAre facing\nPoverty in retirement [noise]\nForty percent nearly three quarters of American workers say that they are going to have\nTo work past traditional retirement age because they don't have sufficient money\nSaved and invested so instead of saying the key to my financial future is beating the market wrong the key to your financial future is making sure you have sufficient money saved on a regular basis\nAnd that the money you're saving is earning a competitive return if not\nBuying a lottery ticket and hope you get rich quick\nJoining the latest hot fad getting into what's hot and avoid and what's not that's not\nThe key to achieving your long term financial goals our goal here for you is to make sure you are not among that forty percent of the middle class who's facing poverty\nIn retirement your financial future is much more up to you than it is up to the markets and if you're not sure if you're saving enough if you're not sure whether you're saving and the right way if you're not sure you're saving and investing strategy is designed to get you where you are trying to go\nWell that's

[noise]\nBack to the gentleman show hey Melissa told you have a couple of clients were unhappy with me we also got a couple of radio listeners who are unhappy with me here's a voice mail I got this week on\nGood morning my name is John I'm listening to the ... right now I'm looking to eight expert discuss those people that don't have enough in their finances to retire and this must be a sixteen year old that quote expert I sixty four\nI'm lost a tremendous amount of money during in the market my husband who passed away a hedge fund and\nI'll make a choice to say that I had nothing other than my Social Security and I and again for just a jet at companies should work until Saturday because the guy in there\nTo provide money for their retirement\nIs you know it's not just saying I can recall hearing number one number two the other thing that should be considered in one's life\nOn them their finances is the quality of their lives and many times working can be very exhausting um for people that are stepping day\nAnd um and Seventy five I mean I think that it's an incredibly um thoughtless comment she has made on the show and It's MORNING and I'm horrified that he is agreeing with everything she has to say\nWhy don't we get swept job where Ninety or totally guy maybe that's the thing to do\nThat with that is now worried with our finances\nSo I'm Sorry that she saw said but it's not my fault that her husband lost all of his money and the two thousand a credit crisis by investing in hedge funds and it's not my fault but she's not finding herself in retirement with nothing but Social Security\nAnd so when we say that given that situation you really don't have much of a choice but to continue working I I guess all I can say is well maybe the truth hurts\nUm and maybe this is why we need to plan butter and we need to more effectively get professional financial advice before throwing all of our life savings in the hedge funds just in time for the biggest market melt down in our entire lives\nI feel badly for her but I have a feeling that I'm just the messenger reflecting on the severity of her personal situation\nUm but here's another voice mail that I got and this boys you might recall hearing before was\nCalling to say that I ever catch him and tell us quite a while\nAnd I decided I Would never invest and him company take us on ap knocks him about a simple answer that take three minutes it takes ... minutes and can't treat keeping them help\nLike he has to have time as he no longer a good example of like clear\nThinking it's boring now that it takes up most of the show with questions that she got and stop answering he needs the help\nI think she can do to keep going on with your show it becomes very boring let's talk about the financial crisis this week is going on and on\nAbout questions come out and sell the show I don't feel they're a psychotic sound like my friend has led to feel the same way he cats wander all over the place like a lawn care\nSo the fascinating thing that voice might be familiar to you because nearly seven years ago in January of twenty twelve she contacted me for the first time and here's what she said back then\nAnd maniac on\nAnd on one second maniac planting you can ask if man and the cat to land tang individual\nIn there and they\nHave a life depended on it I Am absolutely I aged out of him and his crazy ranting game hands him and shame on him by God man\nBut no it was fascinating here is look\nUh I I don't know if I'm really doing anything wrong at all because she's still listening to the show so obviously I'm doing something right to get her to keep tuning in and I'm not quite sure why psychologists would be recommending psychiatric help ah she should be recommending psychological help but anyway\nUh it gets to just chose to go you not everybody's a fan of the ... show so I don't know maybe I should have you know some regrets of how um handling the show but I'll tell you who does have a regret Suzie\nOrman has a regret she says that she has a major money related regret that back in Nineteen Ninety seven she bought five thousand dollars worth of Amazon's stock\nAnd sold that just a few years later is she still owns the shares it would be worth more than six million dollars [noise]\nSuzie says quote it makes me sick to even tabulate it unquote she says she purchased the Amazon shares because she liked the branding she said quote I thought it was such a cool name for a stock I could identify with the idea of me being a woman\nTurn them into other investments and they strip out\nThe interest in principle from the securities because some of the investors want the interest and other investors want the principal a different time periods so they\nTake these treasuries and they strip out the interest giving them to one investor and another investor gets the principal back maturity and encircle strips in so Wall Street invents lots of products like this they invented lions liquid yield option notes\nUh they've got tigers treasury interest grand tour receipts there are page after the income generators\nBut no nobody on Wall street has ever created a bear because you know that's Wall Street doesn't like bears um we like calls but I don't think anybody ever invented a security called a bull um but anyway I digress so\nLet me ask you the question before I described for you whether you should be investing in a strip or investing in a tip a treasury inflation protected security oh tell me what it is you're trying to accomplish\nA I guess what I'm trying to accomplish is that I have quite a few CDs right now which are destroying regular interest\nAnd what I Want to do is take out enough money where I don't go over the limit that up my Medicare\nPayments every year mhm with increases and I know it\nCould go to somewhere around a hundred and eighty thousand dollars in income and I like to do that only by drawing down on my ... between me and the wife and I don't want to have any additional ... All right that I had the you know be\nPaying to stay in other words what I read the areas that they do it if they don't have to report that to the state\nOr hang on hang on hang on I think you might be focusing on the wrong thing here it sounds like you're focusing on trying to avoid additional taxes additional Medicare expenses\nWhat I'm more concerned about is do you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle and we'll you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle over the rest of your combined lifetimes of you and your wife that's much more important issue isn't it\nYes it is so have you done and analysis to determine that\nI had a really done it out but I think I probably have enough money stashed away that it probably going to be you know whether or not you know depending on how long outlive naturally and how long to white but\nSo I think it would make sense to do that calculation uh let me just to real quick back of the neck for what's the total amount of money that you and your wife have between savings accounts investment accounts for retirement accounts IRAs et cetera add it all up what's it worth\nA probably a couple of ...\nAnd how much money do you and your wife spend on a monthly basis\nOh probably three thousand bucks maybe\nTotal all end all expenses\nAre yet probably about three grand aren't\nThen I Would agree with you based on two million dollars in savings and investments and only spending thirty six grand a year and we haven't even talked about Social Security yeah I Would agree with your urine find economic shape which means you don't need to be taking a lot of investment risk and therefore I don't think you need to be getting terribly exotic with your investments drafts\nThe G I mean although it's possible that you might get a higher return from a treasury strip or a a inflation protected bond a relative to a bank CD I don't know if the difference is all that worthwhile relative to the complexity these securities\nAnd the lack of certainty you have about them and understanding of how they work compared to ordinary banks CDs the difference in the yields is not going to be all that significant and I don't think material enough for you to bother doing something different\n[noise] All right I was just wondering if it would have any effect\nI don't think it's going to be material enough that this is based on a thirty second conversation I'm having with you if we delved deeper\nOr I could certainly argue that all of the choices you've mentioned are paying very low rates of interest in today's economy as you know and there are other strategies that are worth considering that can dramatically improve the potential for higher rates of return\nIs it necessary in your case not really not relative to the amount of money you've got and the amount of income you need not really necessary is it perhaps desirable well maybe that's up to you\nUh so I could argue that you should meet with one of my colleagues waving office in Cherry Hill not far from you in Mount Laurel where we could go into all of this detail and show you the alternatives that are available to you\nBut that's entirely up to you if you just kept doing what you're doing financially speaking I think you and your wife would be fun\nTo do in Cherry Hill New Jersey right\nYes it is and if you like I'll put you on hold and get your phone number will connect you with our colleagues in a Cherry Hill and go from there okay that'd be fine\nArent Neal I really appreciate your phone call thank you very much you can do it Neal dead and call triple each plan record it's really important\nThat you put your investment strategy in the proper context why bother adding complexity to your life tax complication dear life getting into securities you not really familiar with are accustomed to when the material differences in results are really not going to be there when\nIn fact you might need to be addressing a totally different question instead which is am I going to be able to sustain my current lifestyle for as long as I in my spouse may live that the more important fundamental question and you want to make sure you have that answer\nNailed down first\nThanks so much for your phone call you know I'm really glad to see folks so intently focused on retirement and engaging in planning will you have enough money that's really the key question isn't it I mean if you were Bill Gates I don't think you care very much\nWarren Buffet I don't think he really needs is Social Security check right so for them it's not

are making their services available only to institutions and endowments and family offices are not yet making this available to the retail investor people like you and me\nBut fidelity has been working on this for the past five years they've been doing it quietly without any fanfare or publicity they have one hundred employees working on this and according to Abby Johnson the c._e._o. of Fidel witty she said this past week quote\nOur goal is to make did\nItaly native assets such as bitcoin more accessible\nTo investors unquote so why are people like David Swenson and huge organizations like fidelity announcing involvement\nIn the block chain and crypto world and why should you care it's because this fundamental technology has the potential according to the bank of England to completely transform the financial services industry\nWe operate right now\nFrom an economic perspective we operate\nOn a trust basis when you engage in a transaction when you buy any goods or services from anybody else you're trusting that they're going to honor their end of the bargain when you buy a house you know it takes three months right from the time you sign the contract of the time you close\nIt takes three months you have to do a search to verify the deed right you go to a title company and you've got to make sure that the seller really does own a house that the dean of the house is legitimate\nAnd that title search exists because well you don't trust the cellar and so you spent months and you spend thousands of dollars in a title search and you buy\nMortgage insurance you you buy insurance on the deed in case something goes wrong it at the time it adds money it doesn't do any real good doesn't increase the value of the house for example\nWell the block chain isn't authentication process it replaces the trust process with authentication under the block chain using this technologically on the Internet\nThe only way the seller can sell you the house is if they do in fact owned the deed and once they do the transaction on the Internet there's no need for title insurance so the transaction can occur much faster and much lower cost and into lemonade the middleman\nAnd there's no way the transaction can be changed altered duplicated or delete it and this authentication process radically\nAnd rapidly makes improvements in the financial services

to make cold calls were promising twenty four percent annual returns and guess what\nThe guy used an alias to hide prior criminal convictions he lied about having a former agent from the DEA on staff and he lied about having a long term record of profitability by investing in cannabis related businesses\nThe guy in fact actually has no track record the company sold investment of four hundred thousand dollars has yet to produce a single nickel in profits and the guy guess what he spent investors money on designer clothing and luxury cars yeah somebody got high\nBut it wasn't the investors in fact the only question you can ask the investors about making the restaurant was already on drugs stay away from high fashion sales pitch is based on getting high with investments\nFor taking telephone calls here on the record Ullman show heading off the valley college New York welcome to the program Greg how are you\nIra thank you for taking my call um my wife and I have a six month old baby girl she is our first one uh she has already accumulated around five thousand dollars in cash\nFrom ... relations first of all on your daughter's arrival and she's already got five grand\nYes yes a very proud of that I'm currently we have the money just sitting in a custodial a savings account so my question would be is should we leave the funds in that same as they ... or ... moving into a five twenty nine plan\nWhich we are already contributing fifty dollars per month or shall we invested in the market\nFor a long way away oh well what we've we've just covered two very different questions here I don't want to make sure that we separate them because that's key the first question is when are we going to use the money\nIn other words are we going to use the money for diapers we're going to use the money for preschool we're going to use the money for try circles are we going to use the money for\nTheir first car we're going to use the money for college or are we going to use the money for them buying a home in their thirties we're going to use the money for their retirement so what would you tell me is the expected use and timing of the use of that money\nI'm the sort of be a more in the long term so we would say a college\nOkay so we've got Eighteen years before we are going to use the money and theoretically it might not even be Eighteen years it might be twenty four years because you don't necessarily have to use the money in their freshman year of the daughter's freshman year of college you might use the money and your daughters senior year\nOf college and the average kid today\nTakes six years to get a college degree so the money might be able to remain invested not just for Eighteen years maybe for twenty four years so good that gives us a a good\nA basis for the conversation because the timeframe is what determines how the money should be invested in other words if you had told me you're going to use the money for diapers or a traceable in three years my answer would be leave the money in cash leave the money in a bank account a CD a money market fund\nA savings account checking accounts something\nA U.S Ninety they treasury bills something very safe very liquid very available something that wouldn't be subject to market gyrations because I'm a short period of time who knows what could happen I mean look at two thousand me write it took years for the markets to recover from the debacle of two thousand me\nSo if you're dealing with a short term ... and you can only choose or something very safe like cash\nOr cash equivalence but if you have a longer term ... something as you suggested Eighteen to twenty four years now we can take a much different point of view since Nineteen twenty six according to but it's an associates and no Fifteen year period or longer has stocks ended lower than when they started\nTo take any period you want since Nineteen twenty six any here as a starting point go Fifteen Years later the market was always higher so if you're telling me that we've got Eighteen years maybe twenty four years to go\nThat gives us a very high degree of confidence of course I have to stress as you well know their past performance is no guarantee of future results in the ... the country as a federal offense right we know that\nBut it's the only thing we have to go on so we can with a pretty high degree of confidence say that if I've got a Fifteen or Eighteen or twenty four year time horizon putting a hundred percent of the money into stocks makes a great deal of sense and so that's what I Would recommend for the account for your daughter\nNow your daughter's not allowed to own an account she's a minor minors can't own assets you as the parent has to create a custodial account on behalf of your daughter it's called a huge T. M. a uniform transfer to minors act\nUT amazing account it simply says you're going to set the money aside for your daughter and uh the problem with it is number one you're going to pay taxes on that camera manual basis and number two when the child reaches the age of majority you have to turn the money over to the child\nHer credit record because your son marrying her will inherit her credit record and that could hurt ability to buy a house as a newly married couple ... this is the truth about money triple a plan wreck\nHere's an amazing statistic from the United nations forty percent four zero forty percent nearly half of all births in the United states\nNow occur outside of wedlock forty percent of all the baby was born in America are born moms who are not married to the dads by the way that number forty percent in Nineteen Seventy it was ten percent\nThis is a massive change in American society and I want to ask you about the implications ... estate planning\nFor the legal rights and responsibilities what are you doing about properly naming airs because when you are married you have certain automatic rights under tax law and other federal statutes but when there is no marriage certificate many of those rights\nDon't exist so you need to make sure if you were giving birth to a child to lose other parent you are not married\nYou need to make sure you're talking within the state attorney\nFor the protection of yourself\nYour partner and most importantly the child\nFor taking telephone calls here on the record on the show had not the Dana Point California Bob you're on the air how you doing\nHi Rick I'm a uh my question uh uh is actually a market neutral funds um my wife and I are retired we're in a her sixties\nOr you know I'm a little I Would say I would say not nervous but\nUh I uh just concerned about preserving by uh uh what I've accumulated and I started researching these so called barking neutral ... for a you know a portion of my portfolio I Would say\nAnd I guess I just wanted to know what your take is on them\nYeah yeah I appreciate the question about the whole name is ... ... of a sales pitch it clearly is titled in a way to appeal to someone\nWho is afraid of losing money in the market and therefore they pronounced themselves as market troll ... one of them or if there's not supposed to mean in the first place\nA market neutral fund is by its sales pitch suggesting that they're going to generate\nA neutrality meaning that if the market goes down they're not going to suffer losses it's going to be neutral\nThat's ... that's a sales pitch no one has ever been able to really deliver on that kind of a promise a and there's no reason to expect that they're going to be able to deliver on it in the future so rather than trying to choose a sales pitch that is so called market neutral what we would simply opt for instead\nIs diversification in other words don't put all of your money into stocks have some of your money there to give you some opportunity to keep\nPace with the cost of living but don't put all of your money there instead have some of your money in bonds and you have some of your money under the mattress having some of your money in cash\nOr does make perfect sense we don't have all of our money in any one place but having a little bit of our money and lots of places makes sense so not just stocks but also bombs and foreign securities and government securities and oil and gas in real estate next potential technologies\nAnd on and on and on so that is what we have found to be the best approach in fact when we phrase in another way it's not the best approach\nIt's the least worst approach\nUm because what we have really found it's kinda like democracy right the worst political system ever devised except for all the others and it's similar to the same thing we don't know what is the best way to invest so we choose the least worst which is not making big bats\nSo you'll simply place a little bit of your money in a large array of investment opportunities you can help insulate yourself\nFrom losing a lot of money at any one time in any one asset class because you don't have all their money in any one after class so\nThat makes sense for ... cents yeah totally makes a and a you know thank you for talking me out of it uh\nBut it didn't make sense\nTo be any time you come upon other similar kinds of questions give us a call happy to help\nThanks so much you're very welcome that's Bob from Dana Point California here on the ... and show you can do what he didn't call us a triple a plan wreck you doing some analysis on Mitchell funds are you looking at investment opportunities we can be a really good sounding board to help you make sure you don't make a big mistake so let's take

securities that the state regulator in New Jersey\nThey've now issued a notice that they're going to release the proposal that will in fact require everybody brokers as well as investment advisors to adhere to a fiduciary standard when providing investment recommendations to clients New Jersey's actually and they said because federal regulators meaning the SEC\nHaven't done enough to raise the standards and so New Jersey's doing it by themselves does this mean we're going to suddenly see fifty states doing this individually with fifty sets of regulations\nI Hope not I hope we have one over all encompassing regulation at the federal level but in the meantime if you're in New Jersey you're ahead of the curve compared to everywhere else\nAs we close up a show this weekend I Want you to

that revenues acts that were predicted to be three point five three trillion were only three point three three trillion which is a two hundred billion dollar shortfall\nAnd guess folks where they're going to collect that shortfall\nYeah they're going to click the shortfall from the people that have worked the hardest to save the hardest\nAre going to get tax the hardest right and the tax that the cost the boomers can avoid that's costing them the most or will cost them the most\nIs taxation and the irony is the area that's causing people to most gets the least amount of attention until tax day rolls around so I Want to give a battle cry a shot across the bow of the importance\nOf thinking about taxes before the end of that present tax year right so what you can do to save tax has to be done and twenty teen if you want to save taxing twenty Eighteen\nAnd here's the reality that tax sale that's on with this new tax reform bill is only going to run through twenty twenty five\nSo to take advantage of each and every year Eighteen being the first year to take advantage of this this tax sale is vital you see a couple of people has learned that over the next years they can completely untaxed their race which means they won't have any require minimum distribution\nWhich means they won't leave a tax burden to their kids but they also leave a tax burden to themselves while they're living because they won't subject\nHaving eighty five percent of their Social Security tax or that the require distribution of their IRAs is so large that forces there Medicare part B indie premiums to be increased by three four hundred dollars per month each\nBooks we see it all the time I see people that are paying more tax in there\nHe's the tax they paid in their highest wage earning years right leading up to the year that they retired when they would have been their highest wage earning year their taxes or hunting years later folks that doesn't need to be that way the question is are you ready for your twenty teens tax\nAnd do you have a plan then the government's tax plan for you right I think of a Marty and Debbie right they use one of our hidden well tax savings strategies that actually enabled them to zero income tax out for twenty team and it's already done\nOr done and Steve sold a highly appreciated asset that was exposing them to a massive capital gains cost\nIn legally eliminated the capital gains\nI think is marking Donna right that they legally untaxed their IRAs in other words the ... the IRS is out of their IRAs\nThere isn't any concern about their you know distribution of their IRAs pushing them into a higher tax bracket or forcing eighty five percent of their Social Security to now be subject to tax [noise]\nAnd I think about Mick a mic is older and it was already retired but his requirement of distribution was just annihilate in his taxes it was pushing him into a higher tax bracket and we completely got rid of his required minimum distribution so whether those of you listening or trying to get to retirement and it's all about how you can reduce\nYour your earned taxable income or you're somebody that's already in retirement and you're drawing money out of your hard earned\nSavings of these tax deferred accounts or some of even listening that have hit the milestone age of Seventeen and a half or the government then forces you to take these

here's why that's so important the windows still save tax is still open but folks his closing very very quickly because what you do in twenty eight team has to be implemented in twenty team\nFor you to save tax in twenty teens and the reality is this the tax sale that we have with this new tax reform bill as great as it is is causing a lot of problems in his ultimately causing people more tax\nWhich I'll teach you but the tax sales only good through twenty twenty five and then it goes away\nSo the time to act as now right like any sale you want to take advantage of sale before the sale expires well every year leading up through the end of twenty twenty five is the opportunity to reduce your taxes the most because what you do this year didn't have a dramatic impact\nOf how much less tax you pay for this year and next year forward fact we've been talking about\nAn article that was out that this rather alarming and I see this again I I Am not just a best selling author or national radio educator I'm somebody that works with clients individually baby boomers and business owners and have now for over Twenty years\nAnd the number one trap for those that have worked hardest that save the hardest and ultimately and accounts that haven't been taxed yet like for one case in IRAs right those be listening to save save two three four five hundred thousand or more in retirement accounts\nYou become what I call them my books is that found through my experience the perfect taxpayer because unfortunately the government has a better tax plan for you then you have for them\nAnd I think a former federal judge by the name of learnt hand said it best you said you know in America there are two tax systems one for the informed and one for the uninformed both are legal\nFolks now's the time right the sale goes without saying but what you ... the ideas what you get done this year is what has to be implemented this year in order for you to save the tax for this year forward\nAnd you can eliminate the government from your taxes or reduce the amount that they take from you and the reality is this right the the [laughter]\nThere was an article out this week that it said the tax cut isn't paying for itself now think about that\nBecause the Treasury Department just released figures this past week showing that the federal budget deficit wind by Seventeen percent\nOr to over seven hundred and eighty billion dollars\nWhich is an unusual jump the article goes on to say out of the New York times in in within a year in which the unemployment hit a five decades low and the economy experienced significant economic expansion right but the increase demonstrates that the tax cuts signed into law last year have reduced federal revenues\nConsiderably even right against the backdrop of a booming economy\nNow think about this before the federal the congressional budget office pass the tax cuts a few months before it passed they predicted the government would take in three point five three trillion in revenue\nThis past Monday the treasury reported that the revenue was actually only three point three three trillion eight two hundred billion dollar shortage folks guess where they're going to get the shortage from\nI think you're probably guessing yourselves and if you're guessing yourself you'd be right especially those of you listening that have worked hard and save hard in tax deferred accounts like four one K. is IRAs for three days et cetera\nFolks that doesn't need to be that way and the question becomes what have you done to have a tax savings solution

greedy when others are fearful but cheerful and others are greedy and I I'm mixed that equation up\nAnd ended up being a victim of the tech boom and bust the last time the tech bubble hit and unfortunately people lost on average eighty percent on the NASDAQ being heavily into tech mutual funds or stocks\nAnd what I learned from that experience all that many years ago was that I always had the proper financial foundation for our family in structures that really only the ultra wealthy had ever really heard about\nBecause I became a student of finding a superior alternative\nThan just following the crowd you see and that's the concern today because if we look at what's happening history is likely repeating itself especially being this far into this next bull or what some people are arguing to be the longest Bull Run in stock market\nHistory in fact the headlines said All right the markets fear index just exploded\nUpwards of stocks around the world plummeted that was Business Insider because volatility is returning to the stock market in a big way back yesterday's a drop in the Dow eight hundred and thirty one point was the fourth largest single day drop in the Dow Jones stock market history\nAnd one of the things that that we track called the VIX or the ... volatility index see it's more than doubled in the past week and it's added another six percent as of just this most recent end of week\nAnd the fears of a major market correction came to the forefront and I hopefully as many of your sharing a I've shared it again not just a best selling author or radio educator or or wealth architect I'm somebody that personally takes on clients and have now for almost a quarter century\nAnd this has been a continual theme right people got hammered in two thousand one or two that got hammered again in two thousand eight and early two thousand nine and many people have shared look we we don't have time to recover so if you're somebody listening that saved at least\nTwo hundred thousand or more towards retirement and typically I'm Talking to those of you that are baby boomers so that could range anywhere from ages you know forty a five per se to Seventy five\nYou can protect yourself and it's not just taking a a simple way to ... you know get inferior results it's actually using a more secure way to get\nSuperior results which I'll teach you you see the volatility index reflects the expectations of the volatility of the S. and P. five hundred that's the gold standard of what all of the wall street money managers aspire to get as close to and performance but long term none of them never have\nThat's what we call investing and there's a distinct difference between investing and indexing and I'm not talking predominantly about in indexing type of an annuity some people confused that these are techniques that the ultra wealthy of used for years\nThat I was fortunate to learn almost Twenty years ago and applied for my own family\nThat has saved our bacon\nIn a safe so many other clients that we felt now for over these period of years and the time is upon us folks are the key is not being too little too late\nEat because many people unfortunately won't have time to recover see or CNBC came out there's more pain to come for stocks according to analysts watching the charts right with the u._s. stock market in the midst of an October sell off some Wall Street top chart watchers are worried the situation could only get worse\nCNBC also had this last week they're warning signs a big market sell off was coming and investors believe there's more to go\nA the a warning for boomers this was out of NASDAQ dot com what will happen to retirement savings and the next market crash and then sadly Fox News reported that both Amazon and Facebook just on this past Wednesday plummeted\nTo the worst day in seven years I could go on and on folks but I think you get the picture\nAnd let's review what we do to solve the stock market loss risk by first looking at some facts right last month\nWe at that actually under the longest Bull Run in history being at about nine and a half years no bull market is ever made it to its tenth birthday I've been preaching this the second longest bull market was the dot com right the tech boom and bust of the nineties which caused investors to lose nearly eighty percent\nAnd while there's no guarantee obviously that the bull market will crash officially right uh [laughter]\nUh fortunately the bang that many people think that this is my next market correction is going to cause will not be a whimper\nAnd as the experts who study behavioral finance note again and again we humans have an enormous capacity for getting you know for for getting per se the lessons that pain of past crashes that's caused\nAs many people are still folks I see this on a weekly basis are woefully unprepared\nFor the next downturn right Peter shift as some of you are familiar with Peter or he says a U.S stock market crashes long overdue but people are oblivious right now to exit its biggest game this past month since the year two thousand right as I said history has a way of repeating itself [noise]\nBack in the two thousand peak though it hit for many people from peak the trough in eighty percent loss right now think about that so the fact that we haven't had a month this strong being the prior month\nSince two thousand should give people pause which we've been preaching day in and day out\nIt's long overdue Peter says it can start at any minute which obviously this last week proved but people are oblivious infect Jim Rogers Susan investment commodities guru with one of the longest positive return track records on Wall street said we're heading towards the worst ... excuse me bear market of his lifetime\nI'm somebody that I'm going to teach you indexing versus investing that anchor down our families ... financial foundation and praise the lord I we had that but at the same time I got greedy as Warren Buffett talks about I did the opposite\nI he says be greedy when others are fearful but be fearful when others are greedy\nAnd I took too much risk and it it prompted all those years ago\nA experiencing the loss of some of our families money into studying what the fluent the ultra wealthy have done for years and this is an interesting statistic that many people that I've had the opportunity to educate I'm not just a best selling author or national radio educator I'm somebody that\nHas written several books a two time best selling author and it all came from the things that I've learned from other people and then by applying these techniques and showing people how these techniques can work in conjunction with one another enables folks to discovered uncover their various areas of hitting the wealth\nThat typically reside in the two biggest threats to boomers which ended up being the two biggest success techniques and that is a limit ... stock market crashes\nAnd eliminating unnecessary taxes\nTo getting rid of the crashes and taxes folks is not that difficult in other words having a stock market protection plan any unnecessary not to pay tax savings plan\nAnd it's all done through using the tax code right judge hands several years ago said there's two types of of of taxes are in this country tax payers I should say that he says there in this country the informed and the uninformed\nRight however both are legal\nFolks this is not deceptive tax evasion this a strategic tax avoidance it's teaching people how to grow money without tax access to money without tax and transfer it without tax that say savings in itself\nBut protecting yourself from this market volatility that I Believe is back right to lose eight hundred and thirty two points in one day this past week being the fourth largest single point drop in our stock markets history\nIs giving people the riding on the wall with many people predicting this happening well before now I myself have been teaching people how to get ... they're serious retirement savings anger down and secured\nTo not not just lot lose but folks it's called lock in and reset so let me spending just a minute on this for you because this may be one of the biggest breakthroughs the boomers have shared\nThat I'll be teaching this coming Tuesday or more specifically that I Want you to be able to learn more about right people don't have is one clients that ... we don't have the time\nTo go through another major market meltdown we we do not have the time to recover\nAnd of course folks that's the big concern dry but many people are caught off guard by these unnecessary taxes [noise]\nLet me teach you just a couple of quick techniques and I'll be teaching more about an in depth and detail this coming Tuesday lock in reset it's a unique provision in the engineering of how to to to structure your savings\nThat you're going to build a structured cash flow of of secure retirement income from so that you don't run out of money before you run out of life\nIn the strategy is very simple as the market goes up your money isn't in the daily ups and downs and all around the stock market right especially with all this volatility but ironically the volatility itself actually makes this strategy better\nNow I Know that sounds kind of odd or counterintuitive so how can volatility helped me Chuck let's let's think about this [noise] when when the market has again our clients lucky in that game never risk of giving net gain back\nWhich is not what anybody else has I can assure you [laughter] I I I personally sit with clients on a weekly basis and and I can't believe nor can they the exposure that they start to realize they have by some of our software analysis one just the other day with would lose fifty five percent of another oh wait market crash hits [noise]\nAnd they can't afford that is no one could it but if the same time when there's again it's locked in huge peace of mind sleeping better no worry right and when the market does lose there's the floor of protection so it's a lock in but here's the key the reset\nSo if the S. and P. today let's say sell a thousand points\nAre clients don't lose they lock in any prior gains not at risk of giving them back\nAnd then they get the advantage of the index that they're tracking only games not losses to Theresa sad at the lowest point to start their next game right so in other words if the S. and P. loses a thousand points\nThe folks have to wait for that thousand points to be made back before they start any new game our clients start their new gained from the lowest level forward\nFolks that is huge that's a way to out Fox Wall Street and how we've been getting that done and helping clients secure they're serious retirement savings\nFor over two decades now here's the things I I Want to teach you this coming Tuesday so for those that have saved at least two hundred thousand or more are typically between the ages of forty five and Seventy five I don't care if you're getting to retirement or you're getting through retirement you can improve\nYou can increase this isn't about playing it safe\nThis is about playing it strategically and this has outperformed the market this has outperformed unnecessary taxes and it's helped people do a few things number one avoid having eighty five percent of their Social Security tax to\nA number to avoiding having their retirement income tax a number three avoiding leaving a unnecessary inheritance tax to your kids or your grandkids\nAnd ultimately giving people the ability to live more and ironically leave more all without\nTax but also without the sleepless nights concerns of when the market did its thing right if you remember back when it did its thing an eight hundred point drop or an eight hundred point gain was that the ... not the exception folks I think it's back\nAnd whether it's back or not can you honestly say you have a stock market protection plan and an unnecessary tax protection plan because you can\nUm here's some of the things I Want to teach you tax free liquidity having access when and how you needed\nMarket volatility protection right the uh the removing the uncertainty of when the next crash or drop or correction takes place\nAnd ultimately with now running a seven hundred and eighty two billion dollar deficit through twenty Eighteen right folks the writings on the wall were taxes have to go so here's the opportunity for those that registering the tin or the first fifty I Want to give you my most recent book the baby boomer retirement break through the unfair advantage to a safe and secure retirement\nAnd what I Want to do is for those either ...

probably cross immunity after awhile you live long enough you fight off all these viruses and you start building up some immune system and there's cross effectiveness of the immune system as you get older\nI remember getting the polio vaccine I remember getting three or four separate shots\nAs a youngster now they put all this stuff together and sort of one big\nAre they are there more what when actually when children of actually the whole controversy about you know where the mercury or aluminum whatever's in some of these vaccines and what it does to our children in terms of autism et cetera et cetera et cetera\nPutting that aside what are the things that are in the normal shots the kids get a whether I'd be proud of what age they're supposed to get these\nOh boy so we just covered as Ilya and things that I'm ... ... there's a sea you want to go over the\nSchedule or wasn't what I mean like\nWhy did you do with a man to your daughter when I came to get vaccines what did she get vaccinated\nEverything that the pediatrician asked me to a recommended that she get the only thing she didn't get was this\nUm ... later on the women are getting the HDTV yeah and and we talked a lot about that and ... and the citizen\nWas made not too although later on in life she did but I'm ... that was the only one that was a a difficult decision for for everybody then but everything else the standard you know the the tea Syria tetanus\nProtest is the muscle is um ... all of this\nI made sure she got and ah\nYou know autism there's a report this week it's ... it's consists of over ... over a hundred genes involved you know I I think that this is more of a genetic issue and\nAnd uh ... and\nYou know there may be other things playing a role but uh you know you see one kid's life taken because they didn't get vaccinated and it just tears your heart out and as a physician I've seen too many kids die because they didn't get vaccinated\nWell what about the other the claims of autism and things that bothers people to have your own or a signing your child to a life of\nA vet the uh the degree of problems that are caused by autism and there seems to be conclusive evidence that it may in fact be caused or might be caused by ah the ingredients that some of these ...\n... you know we had a couple of years ago we had one of the world's experts on the show and if you remember from one of the children's hospitals I Do remember ... and ... in Philadelphia and and you know he addressed that I think rather eloquently and you know he talked about why some of the studies may show it and he\nTalked about you know the quality of science and and you know ...\nI ... you know a guy like that\nPuts his whole life long reputation on the line when he makes a statement like that and and you know I I just uh [noise]\nI see the other side I see kids die needlessly 'cause they don't get vaccinated and then the problem is is that when you put your kid around the other kids you put so many children at risk and in order to get everybody safe there's this collective effort that you need to make\nTo keep everybody safe so if you don't vaccinate your own kids you not only putting your own kids at risk you're putting everyone else's kids at risk so certainly\nHas food for a very controversial a thing and there's a line in the sand some people really believe in and some people really\nDon't ... it's a tough one I Know that you know you get one child who has in in in science is true true unrelated and that's the problem with this the kids are taking all these vaccines and then they suddenly get autism\nAnd you want to so easily associated with whatever's been taken are done are given I mean I deal with this one day at least every day where\nPeople want to ... one of a

like I Do three five to seven three five fourteen hundred okay\nWe can love each other and not agree and so as the cold and flu season is on the way\nI think the best medicine is preventative medicine to bolster your immune system my immune system\nSo let's come up with a foundational approach here you've got your is Ken safeguarding ones immune system I when I talk about fruits and vegetables and all of that stuff and what people get where they don't get a that's a dream but I think I have a strong immune system based on lots of different things\nBut if you don't ah and then you really do need some sort of immune protocol I guess I'm so what are you there there's been a lot of talk about two different kinds of flu vaccines this year is that true\nWell what do I do to prevent the flu and it's just so timely because I only ladies and\nGentlemen when you go to see him he'll do appalling for you to what do I do to prevent the flu [laughter]\nUm so and this time of year it's it's it's really critical because you should try and get this done by the end of October\nSo basically lifestyle is very important to say the things we talked about keeping your heart healthy or the same things that boost your immune system eating a healthy diet getting exercise enough sleep washing the stress getting down inside the body weight all these things keep your immune system optimal\nAnd then on top of that the flu bugs the past years especially last year kills a lot of Americans\nAnd the other thing we know about the recent flu bugs and this is ... this is really a caught my attention is that in the year after you get the flu your risk of a heart attack is dramatically higher so yes and and so by preventing the flu you're not only\nPreventing the immediate death you may have and hospitalization and all that goes along with that you're also dramatically lowering the risk of you having a heart attack and the next year\nSo why do I do I'll tell you what I Do I Do all of those things I talked about to optimize my lifestyle I uh\nAlso get a vaccine a flu vaccine and uh I Will be getting mine in the next week or so\nI Try to get it this year especially before the end of October you know usually we talk about between Halloween and uh Thanksgiving is the best time but but this year I think the bugs going to be a little earlier and and uh\nThe recommendations to try to get it in before the end of October\nUm in terms of the different vaccines I think what you're talking about is once you get over sixty five or if you have any um chronic illnesses any immuno suppressive issues you have to talk to your doctor this is on a case by case basis whether you need the high\nConcentration of ... or a second injection most of us don't but you know it's just good to ask the doctor whether you do and for most of us it's just you know pull down the sleeve get it in the arm once and it's not so bad\nDo you give yourself a shot no no no no no I have one of my assistance give it to me why would you just give it to yourself because that would not be a good idea\nYou know you just ... you might ... ... it's just not a good idea you could\nYou not ... it's hard to get into the right spot you need three ... you would need you need at least two hands to do it right\nAway yeah so I guess I had a third hand I couldn't do it but I wouldn't even think of doing it myself it ... it would not that would not be a wise thing to do you know what I'm seeing any doctors ever given themselves shots oh by\nThe first ... where you put a tube until the body and inject contrast die and looked at the circulation and measure of pressures around the hard that the only way that I could get done was by a cardiologist actually putting the tube and himself so\nI Know that people were inflicted things on themselves that doesn't mean I'm lining up or recommending that that's the best way to do it [laughter]\nI I think there's that many safety issues involved and and ah whether it's done or not and whether it's right or not I don't think it's the same foot\nHigh so here in some of the uh journals that I look at as someone who is interested in me off of the has the right way of putting it but I Am a big believer in supplements is you know\nSo I take garlic ah I'd\nI'd take a ... okay ah I take zinc and echinacea um and that's what I Do for my immune system in addition to\nEating pretty well or not always in my perfect with what I eat a but I Am\nPart of the other thing that we have to discuss in this prevention mode and you don't want to become obsessed about it but his hand washing and just be careful what you touch because at\nThe the way you you get this is by your hands touching your face and you know you'll notice doctors they never touch their face with their hands and you know they're putting their hands are they all wear plastic\nAnd you know trading for income is paramount for somebody who's in the financial markets\nIt's a

and think about this think about if you could have the results of that business without the headaches and I'm not saying that trading and investing as a business without headaches what I'm saying is is\nImagine if you get a business with no employees no overhead are very low overhead no liability insurance because you're not dealing with people's property\nThey don't have to worry about customers 'cause they're online you can literally post something and every time you want to sell something there'll be somebody to buy it every time you need to buy something if somebody wanted to sell it to you imagine if you didn't have to deal with worker's comp or leasing a building or inventory housing was selling products are recruiting people think of that and imagine if you had no limit on the profitability in other words the cap was off\nYou can make as much as possible that's the dream\nThat is trading and investing seats a business and if you understand it as a business you treated like a business you can get business results and I've met lots of people that have built wealth and the financial markets because they treat like a business and the masses don't understand that it could be

and I heard a radio station [noise]\nThey didn't even task Indian DNA because they didn't have any and she goes out and announces there\nSo she is one one thousand twenty fourth Mexican one one thousand twenty fourth Peruvian one one thousand twenty fourth Colombian industry trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of empty and DNA why is there not much Indian DNA out there\nOr was the problem bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only Indian DNA so he felt the need to expand it\nTo include South America when other reason there isn't much in the DNA is because they are very very wary of this the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine the limit injured they use junior logical\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace\nApparatus was in this country in the Mormon church out in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical praise organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing\nAnd that the story I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that had been extended to them as a result of this\nAnd they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA in any of this but ... the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA\nAnd by the way this is not what\nTrump that her anyway Trump about her that she would have to take a test from a little kitten ... wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... hammer take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate a future debate and that's what he\nMeant that she wouldn't do any better that she wouldn't show up as the Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies compass causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and threw out the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about and most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion\nAnd my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about\nThe Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can and this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it to go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that and so the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point that we are going to take the Senate but then if you look\nAt the reality\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all and two thousand ten [noise] do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama go through the two thousand four team in terms\nOf the Democratic party lost over twelve hundred seats\nNationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships are you even go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races\nNationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over a hundred seats\nThey were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dead set lock to weigh in the in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother election where they were going to sweep big never going to wipe out the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had it they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination\nSomebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand six to eight elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties\nNow the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago\nSo from two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nFor rock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party\nNobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen what is it that has stopped the trend\nThe people in this country have been voting against Democrats\nIn ways unprecedented I mean to have with the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people had been voting against you so what is it that's happened that is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democratic party\nWell on the basis of what\nIf you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth there is no reason to vote against it\nIn common sense there's no real Trump hasn't done anything to worsen anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today that you're not going to the widely reported we'll see [laughter]\nProbably put CNBC ... survey soaring economic optimism points to no blue wave in two thousand Eighteen is this the NBC\nPoll or civilian jobs open in America today actual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in America\nFor context the U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen\nNow we have an historic seven point one million jobs open that means employers are looking to hire that many people\nThat equals a roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one with that\nMany job openings it is and employ ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employers can set the terms\nBased on their level of expertise and experience or whatever it is they're applying for none of this in the world of common sense suggests that people would be unhappy by it or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told\nThat the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump very embarrassed by Trump they were barest by their vote\nAnd yet\nIsn't a federal Lincoln bit of evidence that people\n... we've got some delays as well and on for thirty six north found at colonial there is some funds you crash I

and then the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown when you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people\nFind the time so tempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her the Stanford\nUniversity researcher who studied focus on us this DNA did not actually use samples of Native American DNA\nThe Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr\nCarlos ... samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for Native Americans now\nShe's out there counting that it's true issues and ending you got one one thousand twenty fourth\nAnd there wasn't even any Indian or Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to I mean it's laughable it is pathetic\nAnd I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton was making a fool of herself each and every day now they're saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica Lewinsky that was not abuse that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making the answer herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the meet tomorrow but she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out in order to save both herself and her husband or soon to be barking on what\nA stadium shore ... Oh yes [noise]\nBill and Hillary are going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged doesn't like this I mean if Trump didn't do what they can do it if Trump can do and anybody can do what they were going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say\nThere is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say there's just\nThe it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly does and they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent had it\nAnd I'm Talking about this type of charisma or back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly you know for the first term maybe he had a number of the the aura was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\nThe wing of Donald Trump you know what is it like this like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring and Gary Hart man's\nSome ... some of the state treasurer of Texas they gave her radio show Mario the pious they gave a radio show and the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who'd never done it before as the rush killer\nEvery one of them was anointed and inaugurated as the Democrat that was going to steal the limelight away from this program then Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it never\nHas happened every attempt to supplant take over relegate this\nProgram ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds and the one that you may think Russia enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks\nYou may think that what we're going to find out common sense will kill you Hillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book\nSelling party she couldn't draw fly ... campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people in\nThe country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons countries not waiting\nWith bated breath for what they have

I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News Saudi Arabia maintains journalist ... death was not a targeted killing but lawmakers are skeptical at best\nBut it's it's a British network and the title it's six episode one hour per episode miniseries called press and is about two competing newspapers in the current you're\nRight in this modern day and it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era generic explores the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's being one of them a small one of them is very serious take themselves very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focused on celebrities the other one is nothing more than\n... trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees\nThey're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does it's\nOut amazing how honest it is in terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people both of these papers in this in this\nAnd these series end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there\nObviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules that constitutes breaking the rules there has to be something they're mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something\nAnd the purpose of journalists the U.S a call 'em out and and and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago\nWhen I first began to encounter the media\nAs a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalists to these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or or on a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it\nWas all about that and it remains so today\nIt's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Brett Kavanaugh it's all about destroying the but the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars and I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen early on is this is one of the the editor the head honcho of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most despicable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years\nAnd he is totally on affected\nBy life\nTo him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling it it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because\nThe world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode went to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual stuff there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from\nWay back before the series began and the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being a ... I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you want a ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like and live with it\nAnd the private ... I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's
