... patients Fremont or Orlando news radio ... one WFL a and I heard a radio station [noise]\nHours away from the oval office I'm Pam who sells Fox News President Trump is tweeting about the anticipated arrival of an American pastor who's flying home from Germany after nearly two years of tension in Turkey the president saying quote\nThe white vote has only then won twice last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and the swerve into a truth\nExcept for a very exceptional election year of Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you couldn't understand why in Democratic Party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women have been rejecting them\n[noise] this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\n[noise] the left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not does eat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America\nOn a test and they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell Nineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course went to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries but Democrats\nRealized they can only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm a poor of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they have to do\nWas change America\nSo back to Hillary she said what was done last night and the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christie on 'em and pour it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution look to the AP's\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton and the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal\nThe steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture the laws of the reality today is because Democrats activist judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most startling example of this\nBut there are countless others the simple\nAfter the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't wants them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats wouldn't Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ...\nThe ass not by you\nIn fact to do Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christiana for listening to one another working at our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nGet blue in the face\nThat's what Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows\nThat the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of\nThis is that Hillary Clinton says it's if it's a time for instability in is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice cannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urged Democrats to be even more uncivil what an irresponsible statement\nDemocrat shut them down they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encouraging by applauded they support it that is who they are this is the party by the way that has been railing against all this instability\nFor I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know what happens but it's it's a mystery to me and my hope is my faith is that this instability this insanity this on the hinge\nDemocrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh effect pro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that that's real if you want to believe\nPolling data but we're never going to get a poll\nOf people who this approve of Democratic Party tactics techniques that poll is never going to be run and if they did if somebody on the left did run that poll and the results came back then it was quite harmful of Democrats they wouldn't run the results\nThey would get hold of Democrat leaders the media was said look this is not working you guys you better get hold of your people to dial back the problem is Democrats can't die all these people back the Democrats don't control these left wing radicals that's\nWhy you don't see any public statements of disapproval got to take a break we'll get started with ... right after we get\nBack by one vote is listening to talk radio oh ER being

pad\nAnd even now downloadable on a laptop but just to name just held but it was related to being able to download audio content like songs in music on an I ... tense pod cast\n[noise] great thanks for explaining that to me as long as I can hear you that you know that's how I Need\nI say that's awesome I I appreciate it but I just to answer your question are we can't divulge members I wouldn't\nMayor told Elle magazine her recollection of the Thomas hearings and James yeah so having watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge Hannah pattern of similar behaviors since that helps to stab me she was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere wasn't a pattern this is amazing she ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern I\nI'm almost speechless in my attempt to explain this\nThe first story that was run about ... nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad that they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it and so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior when Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from both the Ford or be it for Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is just flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happen just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left will gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it yeah we needed to show a pattern\nHere's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you L. rush but but you are the lead voice of the mainstream media you should have the best stepping on gas\nOr should have the ...\nAnd ... [laughter] hey my point is ah today a with Hillary's comments that are basically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound credit came across years ago and maybe even you set it\nAh but here's the quote a society is either moving towards civility or barbarism and I'd see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society and it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism again just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre so the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a\nSociety harbor is civility were trending one way or not in the middle of the ... eater trending towards the middle of the barbarism\nOff the clocks and the oh it's a constant blocks and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight ah with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh anti a violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democrat Party the Democratic party and ... what was it when that was all good in fine and dandy one morning then\nI think it was a before the Nineteen forties\nAnd none of what they want not when what were they what were they light when the Democrats weren't a Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time their basic uh\nIssue was a labor laws and a win\nFor what purpose\n... my ... the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in an anti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism in big government\nThey've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in honor militant and violent socialism to achieve their means\nMy point they're not that different there just mass getting less today\nHere if you know read about it in the paper tomorrow ... be

down I knew was knocked down in mind that even on line to find out they\nSaid that ... minute I'm saying everything I think the\nPercent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there is there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there and they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThat work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed\nPeople who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional energy drugs or something I practice something called modern actresses and\nAnd that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there that generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel them\nAnd it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them\nWash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and sold to minors spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments and generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra citizen deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has\nTo be removed by somebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit\nOr that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises difference from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest is Adam ... would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest say Sean than priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion wasn't touching anybody anyway this really is not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates\nAnd spirits need to be\nWith you know sometimes they're already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of ...\nThat's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's difficult maybe a professional but have it we were to one and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nAnd also how to maintain the clarity of the living environment so it's kind of like having your carpet cleaner come in first and then you can see if we create our own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion I'm not the only one\nThat are qualified exorcist and just about every religion\nBut the but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know a local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong in the religion but I remember doing this kind of work and has lives um I ... a deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are\nThis universe that said before on on one of my appearances universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you

has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOh a just a few years ago um I did a free night and essentially at a legitimate haunted mansion very famous I won't mention the name but it's something I was\nAgain three years and years and years you all the invitation I finally\nThey talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms are beautiful you know and so\nUh it was actually set up for Gulf countries to go in and uh with are quitting in and take a look around and everybody everybody found something people didn't believe in had you know\nWhat a couple of ... their hair dryer went flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most hunting room of oh they gave me it was actually the nicest room to but\nThe first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get business cards people on it and I was in there you know by myself and there was a very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but very heavy gold she was called the golden rule\nAnd it went up to get my business card and this\nShe started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just would not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention and I said you know\nThis place is really haunted and the third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't\nBite me because of all people home negative spirit's just they will\nJanelle to get your later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and uh oh four feet above me was the misshapen spirit just terrible looking now\nI'm used to know spirits can assume any shape they won so I don't react to the ... you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\n... what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song that I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's grain possible to describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil lullaby\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in my in the bed woke up and the spirit was was singing ... and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song slowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed at ... kind of went right back into the wall immediately 'cause I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long it had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I wanted to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at the at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just learn\nAn extra sisters not safe I don't go into homes and uh in in to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know times\nImmediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clearly not do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world they don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone or you know whatever and so\nPeople say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments\nAnd they need a clearing and and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting I feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling dreamed\nBecause I'm not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always noted subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something\nLike a demonic spirit is around them are on negative spirit and so you know people calling me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's the media but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey really\nReally helps you know\nVery very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last\nAlmost three decades now have not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things than forty five\nMinutes already find different things so remarkable and it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common\nUh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really do in the\nBusiness or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family lore arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove\nThe negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school ... elementary and high school that my parents went to its old very beautiful\nBut I mean think of the moon Leonard she didn't hurt me later and so people will be calling on comfortable they don't know why and the body picks\nUp emotional energy regenerated you don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all the time as I Do both and you know a clear recession or forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nThat's a good law like some costs just for you know most\nAll energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to Jay in Minnesota Welcome to the program I

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream and the voice of elusive tree but afterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that there's only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all that she has and consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream sure she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on the mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ...
