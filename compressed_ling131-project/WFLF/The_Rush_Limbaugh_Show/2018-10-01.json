Kanye West thing is just amazing he says he\nWas bullied behind stage uh by the Saturday Night live crew and staff\nSaying come on man you can't wear the Trump pat and he wore the Trump path and uh and then he gave a you know a a pro Trump speech that was edited out of the uh out of the show but on the way back\nHe tweets on his on his airplane or just him in the Trump had and he tweets something about\nBut uh you know we got to abolish the thirteenth amendment and the left goes crazy and they're just all about how he wants during sleep see that's what Trump people are like they want to bring slavery back\nReally really you don't play that game I can understand that from conservatives but do me a favor I just want you to Google thirteenth amendment Huffington Post see how many stories come up\nThat is not about abolishing slavery that is about saying that we never abolished slavery the thirteenth amendment was just a ruse that we went from the plantation to the prisons\nThat's what that meant he's talking about prison reform and everybody on the left knows it everyone\nWill be because he has a Trump had uh they're gonna act act as if that is that when I was in America guy was labor on slavery which is just so ... and I've always felt that it is interesting that that the Thirteen to ... did not\nOutlaw slavery is an either slavery nor involuntary

that you if you commit a crime and you're in prison then you ... you can\nHave to work under those circumstances um which is something that we all kind of understand is kind of I mean there is only about us I mean you're making a license plates whatever you're doing this stuff it there's nothing bad it shouldn't have been called slavery should have been abolished\nAnd there should be a an amendment that says that you know you have this but this is this is eight and activists are exactly right and where the people who are for prison reform for\nA you know letting people out of prisons are saying that basically your arresting black people to get them to be delayed ... there'll be within ... this is this is post\nModernist nonsense to the nth degree\nAnd in case you're wondering if there's a lot of people are thinking all Kanye West as conservative he's got the guy had on yeah because like some of the stuff Trump is doing but this is not a conservative argument by any means you have an ideological conservative\nNo more but he is I mean that's his language of saying we need prism report ... agree I think we need prison reform to and the generic statement right yeah they're not perfect but he's losing\nThe reason why the left is getting away with a you know making his tweet look races is because\nThey they know this language he's using their language right and again shows that they don't care about the issue as much as they care about political power the fat he's supporting their far left viewpoint yes right this is is echoing a far\nLeft rally in quite a crowd of activists yet and they'd rather traction because of the ...\nRight that shows the depth of this right and this is all about power again it's not about the principal you think you think the left cares about prison reform\nKanye West and his wife have done now more with Donald Trump on prison reform than a lot of presidents have done a lot of celebrities\nThere are more interested in killing his career and reputation and smearing him than actually getting prison reform done\nThat should tell you something about who they are and a little something perhaps about how they're dealing with

American who makes this country work and it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one that thought it was necessary to do\nAnd it's now done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number then that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money\nAt a loss for point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs lost about twenty five percent of our order jobs even more than the\nThroughout the campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe even longer than maybe forty five minutes or\nYou know an extended the statement\nOnly recently started taking questions will tell you what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocated he wasn't just announcing that deal got done he was teaching why it was important including the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nA known to understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works\nAnd how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of American leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take in a new shorts now and then it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back pockets\nPicket there's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy at doesn't mean that may cause we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not have did was on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important and how the United states was getting the shaft but more importantly why\nIt matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers including farmers and a number of other type people about whom Washington thinks not very off\nAnd thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question that Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about any kind of run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement just it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as a noun Singh is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it made the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative\nAnd so when they began to announce this

essentially attacking the entire Republican base we\nShowed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm\nPart of that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last June twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing that if we want to

of two thousand sixteen or in August that doesn't mean anything 'cause it's not when the election is and I said the the the events are going to shape the midterms haven't happened yet\nI said that in July August September a and this is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind but there's going to be something beyond this oh dear this is going to get\nResolved one way or the other depending on how

yet\nIt's being spoken of Christine mostly for his testimony on her inspiration is being spoken of as though it's a stand alone and it's never happened before and that adds to her credibility though

oval office was during a\nAn announcement ceremony for a new trade deal in ... getting rid of it brand new trade deal\nThe drive by eyes were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA started entertaining the are the questions and what we had one through four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin all things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six wants to go as you know there are a lot of repression polls are polls there aren't very accurate [noise] we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's going to be a positive outcome\nBut you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election [noise]\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that ended up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondents said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is that\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what I'd change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's not a bad statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class and yeah he was number one in this law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible so\nI Want the FBI this is now their seventh investigation so it's not like you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer let me ... let me leave soundbites and got to be yeah number thirty coming okay\n[noise] [noise] ...\nThis whole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake demand a week\nFor his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in Lebanon to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flake was not going to vote well I'm a floor vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least a little weight walking into this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI scope because you see there are things to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI that's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out of office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK thank\nYou Mr herself it needs to go two weeks ago two weeks a southern White Houses now claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC's why course they're lying it was a set up\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd so now it's out there but we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news\nAt the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow but then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking to everybody I talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that that they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move\nOn it will just tell you if this ends tomorrow if this was all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on until friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be reading and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was read they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday\nIf we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday it won't be long enough besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on

hell is that so I clicked on the like here's what it is [noise]\nRight here my formerly nicotine saying the fingers in the New York times working in tandem with NBC News headline of White House tells FBI to interview any one necessary for Kevin on inquiry this is because of what they claimed Trump said\nAt his press conference today where he's now I don't want to limit anything I said guys got done with\nThat they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigation central I'm not that's fake nose so then they've got it on record Trump not limiting investigate which means you can go on and on and on and on and now they're broadcasting and everywhere White House tells FBI interview when he wasn't necessarily\nAnd was right on schedule\nCNN reports that the Democrats are submitted a list of twenty four people they want the FBI to talk\nTo this after Fox News had an earlier today that the FBI is about to wrap up tomorrow\n[noise] this is going to have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all this is\nIs delayed delayed delayed delay and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nHas somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides that needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with the woman who doesn't remember where\nOr when what ever happened to her happen and there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promote it\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything I'm like Bob Mueller face stop\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this somebody on the Senate\nJudiciary Committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start voucher thing for the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh somebody needs to speak up for him\nSomebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they haven't been thorough and they haven't found anything or he wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\n\nBut that's not happening somehow were letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the capital has been half baked lukewarm and incompetent because of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute\nWith no evidence no collaboration and nothing yet she's credible Kevin O's not\n\nSomebody look we had a caller earlier how do you stop a bully you smack them in the face somebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up that they've gotten everything they've asked for this thing and there just isn't anything better and to go home\nThe idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been rendered is absolutely bogus another making things up the Trump is going to limit it either no such thing but he sure fell for a debate\nI Am not limited and everything I've told the FBI to take us wherever it takes them promptly Democrats while you're Twenty one people we want you to talk to\n[noise]\nIf you called the FBI say there's there's
