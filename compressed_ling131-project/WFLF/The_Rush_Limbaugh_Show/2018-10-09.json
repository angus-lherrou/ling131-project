president accusers quote should be her and\nLook at what the president had sat in the past few days about Dr blocking for now we don't know why she's resigning I'm just pointing out areas where she

cabinet gets confirmed that she can't handle it anymore now we don't know I'm just pointing out areas where she's publicly disagreed with the president [noise]\nPoppy Harlow had no idea what she was talking about nor did anybody I don't want this is a classic example of they found out Nikki Haley I'm going to be approximate what the time here they found out that Nikki Haley was going to resign at ten o'clock and for an hour\nCable news had nothing much speculation as to why they couldn't just wait they couldn't just wait for the announcement and the video tape from the oval office where she in Trump percent into bright\nYellow chairs by the fireplace courting white nope adding to fill that time was speculation and that's when people really get dumb when all kinds of wild guess speculation

drum she just didn't didn't get it and it was going to run for the Republican nomination in twenty twenty\n\nSo she headed that offered the past before the press even started asking questions is no I'm not running in twenty twenty and the only thing I'm going to be doing is campaigning and supporting this guy and she pointed at Trump\nYou good to hear about when they come out of the sales

and foreign correspondent and here is a nic Robertson this morning on CNN I'm guessing back and forth with the info bay poppy Harlow about Nikki Haley's reason\nOn the issues that allies have one for the the president from being tough on a particular Russia because it's one that he seemed to be sensitive on and not one that he wanted to push us allies in Britain and France and Germany [noise]\nAh the whole thing states wants them to be Nikki Haley has been a source of comfort\nSo if you're one of the United states enemies and Nikki Haley steps out of this position\nThan perhaps your brain a tiny bit easier\nI look [noise] I\nI'm just I'm just a radio talk show guys here and Nick Robert so does this season broadcast journalist but I'm Sorry\nThis is so full of its let's go back to the top of his son ... on the issues that are buys a wonder does the Trump be tough on in particular Russia because that's the one that he seems to be sensitive on and not one of these wanting to push\nUs allies in Britain and France and Germany to booming states have all wanted to be tough\nHas every button it kept you forgotten how Trump reimburse the Angela Merkel for making a deal a side deal that the gene twenty with the Russians\nHave forgotten that it was Donald Trump who was tough on the Russians ended it was Angela Merkel omega psi deal with them for natural\nGas and it was Donald Trump that could not believe in and called her out on it and suggested that she couldn't they have purchased natural gas from any of her allies in the G twenty the G. eight the G Fifteen but the G whatever\nTrump has been tough on Russia to the extent that the people promoting a Trump Trump Russia collusion\nStory had been discredited thoroughly Trump has not been a Russian puppet quite the contrary but you wouldn't be able to convince nic Robertson of that\n... they got these ideas\nIn their head trumping on Russia's got together they stole the election remember Hillary Trump is a Russian storage Trump has money because the Russians sought to what Trump falls Russia because of that Trump therefore soft on Russia\nNow Nikki Haley is leaving and that means nobody's left to be tough on Russia and our allies are scared to death as a total one hundred percent front to back top to bottom crock folks\nGuarantee our allies are probably happiness you Nikki Haley go because she is tough and she is pro America she believes in America first just like Trump\n\nLast night and the ceremonial swearing and Brent Kavanaugh Emma Supreme Court was their living room fuzzy Ginsburg\n[noise] to [noise] well never mind\nYeah she was a way [noise] um [noise] she's admitted that she shows up in states of the union speeches having sort of little blind\nTo get through the night that's why she is seen falling asleep at the court says there's nothing wrong with that uh\nI'm Elena Kagan was there the Harvard law school dean who way back when hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard Elena Kagan who now says I don't think he should be on the court I I'm not\nSure that this is going to do the court any good\nUm Justice Thomas was there a whole bunch of people Anthony Kennedy who is a Kevin O's replacing and here is the president of the United states just started hearing audio soundbites seven he has apologized shouldn't be Kavanaugh on behalf of the nation\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who step forward just serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation [noise] not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nJust calling them out this Trump is right this is not\nDone what normally when you get to the ceremonial swearing in you follow the script and all of that is in the past it's not to be referenced again the fight is over everybody acknowledges that the result is the result we're moving forward except that it's not the way it is anymore the Democrats are not stopping the fights not over to them\nBut Democrats are openly promising to impeach Kevin all their openly promising to continue investigate Kevin on\nThey are openly talking about packing the court if they win the house of representatives to nullify the or the power capital has as the fifth so call conservative justice on the court they're not pulling back at all this isn't anywhere over\nAnd so Trump is calling them out and I'm telling you folks this is crucial we don't I Can't think of any former president what would ever do anything like this in defense\nOf his nominee in defense of his principles I Can't think of one who would do it and it's just as important the Trump do this as it was important when Trump at a rally explained to the American people what the American media has not told them\nWhen he resigned at the essence of her testimony\nThat when the drive by that he was mocking Dr malls before he wasn't mocking he was simply informing the American people what the media was holding from them that she couldn't tell anybody where it happened she couldn't tell them when it happened she wasn't sure where about house was\nShe didn't know how she got home and she didn't know who took her and she didn't know what she said after the event that the only thing she remembered is that she had one beer that the four people she sent word of there in the house all the night at the press and told nobody that\nThe American people that only consume what we call mainstream media had no idea of all of these holes in her testimony until Donald Trump\n\nTold everybody at his rally and he was doing the same thing\nSame principle in this apology last night the White House [noise]\nAnd away from little heads up here I'm going to [noise]\nYeah today my him [noise] and explaining\nLead divide that exists in the country is specific way by explaining just who the left is what they've become what we're up against\nA to me it is the seminal issue that we all face we're talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as we know it I mean America is always going to be here don't misunderstand about this country surviving as sounded we're under a salt it has never been worse\nI made that the civil war but but those were different circumstances a that was a specific argument about cultural things regarding slavery that any and nobody\nOf any\nReason to attitude could ever support we find ourselves here in a multi layered multi faceted all out assault on the entire concept of America has found\nSome people's sense it\nSome people are not aware of it and I I've I've uh just sort of involved here into a\nPosition where I feel compelled to try to explain this sounds some warning bills and it may be present some\nSolutions but I have to I have to be very careful I don't over do this I don't want to I don't want to you know me I'm On the nation's number one natural optimist and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the\nBest way perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real threats that we face are so that's coming up as the program an falls back however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off apologizing to the nation\n\nApologizing the cabin all on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him\nAnd they have an episode caught a size exactly what I think we're up against and it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas the left is not\nInterested in our ideas we're up again we're battling people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments over the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have no limits\nOn how low table go on how the brave didn't perverted they will be in seeking their reality it all I Am convinced started on America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean do you go back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think it was the best way to get people's attention or whether it's because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born or and so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't know it\nSo the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this my thoughts [laughter] but they don't ... folks\nWe are not legitimate in their eyes ideas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate and not even worthy of discussion or acknowledgment\n\nAnd they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as their concert\nAnd it was all on display in the Capitol hearing everything that we are up against the abs and some presumption of innocence cabinet was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had on the evidence Kavanaugh was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring former and a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up\nWith this then that's what we'll do\nHow do you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive dealer network online at rhino safe

[noise] I\nCan't prove anything all I have to go on a experience guided by intelligence and intelligence guided by experience an instinct\nI'd just died out everybody believes is blue wave it doesn't matter where you go every story that drudge for example links\nLinks to on his page is a story of the Democrats with\nA massive landslide retaking the house of representatives and there are stories\n\nWhere Republicans supposedly think the same thing is going to happen certainly you you've talked to swamp dwellers you I mean you do hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast big march you do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell [noise] [noise] what I Know what what what what\n[noise] well yeah I'd like to get an individual polls show nine percent of the Nineteen advantage even after the worst happens all that that's getting into the into the new show I'm I'm just talking about over all the national\nAttitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm On these people are thinking\nRe body agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries if everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at America the way I Do nobody would ever stop us\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with the reality is is is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons have you heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour\nBill and Hillary one again in want to get in on all this Trump action\nNow I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be in until somebody in the Democratic party\nTried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats and the media publicly acted on concerned on interest in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it's not saying it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally\nPrivately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing because\nThere's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies to her book signing ceremonies\nHillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd any weren't good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows\nBut seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by them they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalties that equals jealousy and and we and anger and all things that attached to jealousy\nAnd that'd be they have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believe you an upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidate to see and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed so the Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got\nTo be able to show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention as Trump can draw up till now nobody on the Democrats' side has even given it\nA prayer until the Clintons\nThe daily wire has the story Washington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that they are embarking on a nationwide Davy and toured\nTaking the Clintons stage show to Thirteen cities this fall it's going to be called an evening with President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that's the actual title of the show\nIt will feature the Clintons sharing stories and inspiring anecdotes that shape their historic careers in public service while also discussing issues of\nThat's blinds T. E. R. dot com [noise]\nWe have audio on the Clintons nationwide stadium tour but I Want to get back to the phones before we\nGet into all of that ad here is Shawna in Philadelphia right to habeas are high\nHey Russia I'm a big fan of yours thank you appreciate the I'll ... I'll\nGet right to the point I have one comment one question and comment is it going around this talking point that ah you know since his cabinet victory that the the president is teaching Republicans how to fight I actually think he's teaching that Democrats what it's like a lose\nAnd I don't think anybody's picking up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd and the question I had was what do you think would happen\nIt 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media is instead of a blue wave if there was a red I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival\nUh and safety\nBecause I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like everybody is preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate maybe even expanded their whole there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house\nIn numbers we haven't seen and who knows how long since Nineteen Ninety four and I'm Wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ...\nMedia and and and polling unit manufactured just like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen that got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump is forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by trust shows them jobs even now after the Capitol hearing expanding the blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here on the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\nThe Republican the I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it all but the Republican governor California is closer than is running as Gavin Newsom than anybody would ever have believed possible\nIf the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think\nWashington may be on the inhabitable for a while I think we haven't seen the melt down that is going to happen among many elected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again\nUm anything they can come they are so so certain they're going to win this\nThey've already banked on the when they're all ready planning to impeach capital\nAnd Trump and if that doesn't happen I don't think\nI really think they may lose it all [noise]\nAnd very quickly point one\n[noise]\nHey welcome back Rush Limbaugh half my brain tied behind my back\nAs always made interests\nAnd equality\nSorry last caller Sean from Phil what's gonna happen rush they're all expecting a blue wave what happens if they lose it well let me share with you a headline from\nPolitical [noise] just just today political story ready for this\nPolitical race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ... there are now\nTwo hundred nine seats either family or leaning in the Democratic column only nine\nShy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe this okay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly or leaving Democrat I guess this is according to polling data two hundred and Eighteen is a number of seats you need for\nThe majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority\nSalt\nTo nine seats firmly are leading Democrats I mean this\nIf the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of\nFor this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's for this ... this is [noise] and yet they believe it now folks I don't have an\nInsider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans and I I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people in Washington and live and die by their stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything and if the\nDemocrats are publishing stories to each other that to print nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an ounce of sanity anywhere to be found on the Democratic side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine feet firmly or looming\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing\nThis let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is anything one thing a series of things that have American\nVoters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans\nThat they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat so that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of the nation wide ... with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer the question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nAs a people in this country haven't been poised to send Trump packing ever since the election night to thousands sixteen\nThey can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans All right\nAs I say we're hypothetically pretending this is true what has Trump done to generate that kind\nOf disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started when he said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that it's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what\nWas I watching this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and you're as you'll\nSally Quinn used to be a journalist is the Washington Post CBS the CBS in the morning show [noise] she\nProbably best known for throwing Washington's best dinner parties

is no common traced to our similarities we don't have we have nothing in common at all instead America is a set of values\n\nA set of values and that's all America is a set of values the left defines\nTo build a country around but there's a dark side to that\nRather than culture and society in commonality defining value of the left defines values based on their political perversion and corruption and if that's all the country is a set of values than somebody who does not share those values\nIs not permitted to be a member of the community and that ...\nService we don't share their values their values to find America we're out people [noise]\nOkay back to all this here and not just second because it's\nSo to me it's very important to me but I have to carry it over here to borrow
