fighting alright Bobby's in northeast Iowa a Ohio Bobby and the first time caller and let's welcome because to go in\nOhio not in Iowa so here we go [laughter] good morning to you Richard morning many many years ago\nI Want to say like early two thousand I I I have a lot of things happened to me but this was a thing that I'll never forget the rest of my life\nUm I had a small I had had a smaller car and uh when I bought I bought a new and my husband was like I did it myself when I bought it and I didn't bring them with me I I was just this is what I Want well\nAh it really wasn't feasible for what we needed a four so he's complaining you know we really needed a van blah blah blah so once again I went out myself and did it but I bought some use I never buy used car vehicle anything\nBig mistake but the only mistake I the only thing I did do right was purchased a um [noise] extend a warranty thing so that kind of worked out for me\nAnd ah I ah was having trouble with it and I says oh my God you know what what did I Do here\nBut I kept bringing a bag and I kept fixing it and it was out in the country there's a little mom and pop shop that I had to bring it to I guess they were on that warranty thing so I just it was just too much of it's just like it was I was\n... with this and I kept saying\nI got about a minute and a half Bobby I got about a minute and a half and I want you to get the hell you're ...\nI got to this one intersection and I says only way I'm going to get rid of this thing is if I crashed I'm going to smash it\nOh it gets going to smash I've never had these thought\nWell as I pulled out I turned to this is a huge semi trucks coming I I I knew I was my I put my hand down over the steering wheel and the truck went right back to me I could feel the air I can feel the wind and I just froze\nTearing lord\nYeah I'm I'm telling you I I I got to try to stay calm one don't and what\nCould have possessed you maybe that's the operative word possess but what could have been you to do that\nI never never in my life I had children I never want life had that\nBut I'm going to tell you what truck went through me went up the other end I turned to the right there with my truck my that was never I pulled over I I mean I pulled out after I mean it without that was already I pulled out for a one on the side of the road and I just I broke down\nAnd I got why did I why where did this come from never never never in my life never and I mean I'm an animal lover I Love children of all people I mean I'm I'm I'm a loving person\nA lot of these other identities that you know are not political in nature your\nReligion whether you are religious or non religious heal race they have come into alignment with political identity to a degree that really was not the case you know twenty thirty forty years ago so for instance you know if I told you I'm\nIn the Nineteen nineties that ah\nI'm I Am a non religious white woman that wouldn't really tell you a whole lot about my politics but now it is increasingly the case that non religious people are much more likely to be Democrats religious people are much more likely to be Republicans\nA you know we're seeing a much clearer sort of alignment along racial lines where the Republican Party is much more heavily represented by whites and non whites are much more heavily leaning toward the Democratic party\nA that we see the pillow race along with religion or increasingly starting to get an education to and that you know more educated voters are now starting to lean toward the Democratic party more so you know that's sort of just that you know even if you say that your political\nIdentity is not that important to you all of these other kinds of identity that are important team increasingly kind of tell us about your politics\nWell respected Emily badger writer for upshot at the New York times and she's written a piece titled Americans either politics do to find them but it's complicated use it to people even change their policy preferences depending on which identities they're thinking about what does that mean\nWell too so you had lots of different identity is at any given moment you know you have a radio show you are a man\nA you know you know a friend that particular part of the country is silly it with your home town and whichever one of those that's important to you may sort of changed by the moment depending on what you're doing and what you're thinking about so political scientists have found that you know people policy preferences\nCan change if you get them to think about certain identities or for other identities so for example a\nYou know Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support things like sentencing reform\nA or you know to to say that they want to spend money on social services and that's more important and then worrying about the the federal deficit\nBut political scientists have done experiments where they've shown that if you get Democrats to sort of think about the fact that their parents first and foremost you actually see their\nViews shift to become a little bit more conservative on those kinds of questions so that suggests that you know identity is very kind of fluid thing that shift depending on you know the context that you're in you're thinking about but ah\nThat that your policy preferences night shift as well I think it's a little bit surprising to us because most of us tend to think that our policy preferences are they very sort of well thought out logical conclusion than we reach\n...

C. and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing\nIt's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the states so far\nYou know at the end though that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical a situation there where you have\nYou know more districts spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant in rural districts and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTurnout why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also wanted the benefits and your story and fewer absences that would be a huge one\nYou know they have a very large legal cannabis industry in Canada and you know that industry with pre easily able to you know kind of transition to white or legality in Canada so you know because they already had that kind of foundation for legal cannabis you know it may make things easier and [noise]\nAnd you know if you if you work at the videos and stuff coming in from candidate folks are you know kind of easily able to go in and out of the dispensaries and and and pick up what they want\nSpeaking with chicken ... personal finance reporter at marketwatch he's written a piece titled why Americans pay more for weed then Canadians what's the what's the cost breakdown is it done done by adults I guess\nYeah so in Canada it's about twenty eight dollars per is up and down that but the measurement they use [laughter] whereas here in the U.S it's about forty dollars for an eighth of now so you know for a full out and kill multiply that out to be about like three hundred and twenty dollars\nA year and the U.S I'm various you know from from city to city um and surprisingly where it was most expensive was in San Francisco\nMedical marijuana is legal in California but nevertheless you know that there are you in the U.S where where marijuana is legal you know a lot of states are still having to set up to spend three if they're still having to you know set up a whole you know kind of ecosystem for the industry because you know they have to do it within that state they can't cross state lines\nBecause the legal at the federal level and for that make things harder and drives up the cost\nIf let's say the U.S were to legalize it on the federal level and let's say all fifty states followed suit and legalize marijuana does that change perhaps the pricing structure supply and demand things like that and we we can be more with Canada\nYou know so if if you know if it was made legal at the federal level you know you could expect the cost to go down pretty quickly because it would be much easier to produce in the states that already have legalized it at the state level [noise] um you know they'd be able to ship it across state lines so that would drop prices in other states\nI mean we could we could you know get it from Canada where there is this very robust cannabis industry already in place\nAnd they stick market watch personal finance reporter Jacob ...\nThirty minutes after the hour on this weekend\n\n\n\n\nJanine weather's better this report is Ross who by drew car\nHere's your

explain\nWell thought that's what got me worked up I think a lot of people watched that got confirmation process some kind of realized the process to shop was severely broken I'm I'm a guy with the power in a high as it is it's trained correctly is that it's unbiased\nOr it could do a ... any claim against the candidate age\nBased on publicly available and private information and do so in Buffalo secure and confidential fashion so neither that complain and lord of the candidate was put at risk and so much of the drama\nWe saw on television which\nDamaged both participants significantly\nI could've been done ahead of time and that the decision could be rich\nOr with regard to whether or not the candidate or they complain complain that was Bible about doing so much damage so we pretty much get the same outcome um but but the damage to both parties would be and to the end of the appearance of the court\nWould have been or what have been those tensions reduced and and that's what it is really for it it it helps you get to the meat of a problem provides you with the dice on how to resolve the problem and does show without this massive amount of drama we seem to be in during on pretty much every major decision\nRight so how could it potentially handled accusations from the Nineteen eighties\nWell I I I think that that that what it would do it we'd go against ... and it certainly would take the evidence that was presented and would determine whether that evidence reached the threshold of\nUm of a decision so in other words if if there was a it looks like his ticket or case we had to complain that ... there was an assault attempted rape but no rape kit no location no\nTime no all the things that would fill out a case even on the next day had had

there's no point in proceeding because there's no there's nothing there's no substance here and so it would allow they went dead at Senator Feinstein got the initial no way back in July it would say okay\nIt just doesn't meet the threshold you're going to need these five things you're going to need to go out and get these five things before this has to pursue their horses we saw none of those things\nHad been achieved by the time it finally went on to television and so you're either meet the threshold or it does it ... it was a detail what you needed to do to get there and then if you
