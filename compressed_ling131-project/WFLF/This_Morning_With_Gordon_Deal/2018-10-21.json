I Believe in his seventies or\nThomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point it obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be um the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts in time and um you know I spent ten years researching all this stuff\nAnd you know FDR not quite that much for sure but um there's this new information in the book is is pretty compelling I Would check it out\n[noise] uh Easter the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi

Days ran that down nice guy that I never have no idea how the relatives out well and they\nHave a clue as to how they made their money ranching right\n[noise] well I Know that I I\nYeah I Do actually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when he came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the stock market was not as big as it is today\nAnd they were only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influence things they create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly\nAnd Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the you actually see the security Exchange Commission and FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote fix the courage to crush across\n[laughter]\nReally interesting stuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I Love to hear it but their their their money came from summer\n[noise] um and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family uh probably it's old money so you know just kind of a ... to me elation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those nice to call them the Boston brain in those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be that as well [noise]\nYeah I heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging these guys are never written a book\nOr let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour I'd be lucky [laughter]\nBy the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach names who wants to be as best they can you know for them as far as like the I I still get fascinated by stuff somebody will call in and say that you know the ... and because it wasn't that long ago really this Seventy plus years ago you know one girl got a hold of me and\nHer her mother or her aunt was the cook from Warm Springs Georgia amazing it's\nJust absolutely blew my mind I mean there's so we're not is not that long ago I mean the greater scope

suspiciously I Would say I was wondering if ... has a\nMention him has a looked into it\nAnd the ... most Americans don't live in brief politics the way Washington news beans who\nRight right we have to remind ourselves as constantly uh you know those of us who write about these things that are living that most people out in America or not is obsessed with them as we are\nSo what what other changes I guess from the ... the last time survey versus the this time survey\nOne thing that hasn't really changed and and it's an accelerating over the last several decades is that\nA lot of these other identities that you know are not political in nature your\nReligion whether you are religious or non religious he always they have come into alignment with political identity to a degree that really was not the case you know twenty thirty forty years ago so for instance you know if I told you I'm\nIn the Nineteen nineties that ah\nI'm I Am a non religious white woman that wouldn't really tell you a whole lot about my politics that now it is increasingly the case that non religious people are much more likely to be Democrats religious people I'm much more likely to be Republicans a you know we're seeing a much clearer\nSort of alignment along racial lines where the Republican Party is much more heavily represented whites and non whites are much more heavily owning toward the Democratic party\nA so we see the pillow race along with religion or increasingly is trying to get an education to and that you know more educated voters are now starting to lean toward the Democratic party more so you know that there is to test that you know even if you say that your political\nIdentity is not that important to you all of these other kinds of identity that are important team increasingly kind of tell us about your politics\nWell respected Emily badger writer for up shot at the New York times and she's written a piece and settled Americans either politics do to find them but it's complicated use it to people even change their policy preferences depending on which identities they're thinking about what does that mean\n[laughter] well so you have lots of different identity is at any given them and you know you have a radio show you are and then\nUh you know you know a friend that particular part of the country is silly it with your home town and whichever one of those as important to you may sort of changed by the moment depending on what you're doing and what you're thinking about so political scientists have found that you know\nPeople policy preferences can change if you get them to think about certain identity is for other identities so for example a\nYou know Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support things like sentencing reform\nA or you know to to say that they want to spend money on social services and at one point and then worrying about that\nThe federal deficit but political scientists have done experiments where they've shown that if you get Democrats to sort of think about the fact that their parents first and foremost you actually see their views shifted to become a little bit more conservative on those kinds of questions so that suggests that you know identity is a very kind of fluid thing\nThat shift depending on you know the context that you're in while you're thinking about but ah\nThat that your policy preferences night shift as well I think it's a little bit surprising to us because most of us tend to think that our policy preferences are they very sort of well thought out logical conclusion than

more schools are adopting a four day schedule to save money and attract teachers here's this weekend's Jennifer ...\nIt saves money and it retains teachers for days school schedules are starting to spread across the country turnout hubs or the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend how widespread is this for day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we uh I actually reached out to every state all shifty states in D. C. and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts and it's still very dominant role districts and um\nThere's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTo now why did the rural districts decide to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district ... you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as fewer absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it now they're unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or say wow you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know dirt notice and fewer teacher absences\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs of the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing they're at and hours and you know at some of these districts they had already met the minimum uh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere\nFederal level and let's say all fifty states followed suit and legalize marijuana does that change perhaps the pricing structure supply and demand things like that and we we could be more with Canada\nYou know so if if you know if it was made legal at the federal level you know you could expect the costs to go down pretty quickly because it'd be much easier to produce in the states that already have legalized it at the state level [noise] um you know they'd be able to ship it across state lines so that would drop prices and other states\nUm and we could we could you know get it from Canada where there is a very robust candidates industry already in place\nWhich Jacob marketwatch personal finance reporter Jacob ... thirty minutes after the hour on this weekend\n\n\n\n[noise] yeah I counsel so\nYou're listening to America's first knew this weekend\nDeal with Jennifer ... coming up this half hour some new thinking about retirements also for Halloween\nScary fickle toddler when it comes to costumes\nAnd in sports the NFL team offering the best return on your investment dollars all of that story in about twenty minutes\nIf you watch the confirmation runs and reduce Supreme Court justice Brett\nKavanaugh you may have been concerned that each political party might have a hand in corrupting the highest court in the land if that happens you effectively destroy the constitution and by doing so the country check on the list Rob Enderle a principal and founder of the ... group\nHas a look at how artificial intelligence could help the process since it has a goal of fixing problems Rob explain\nWell thought that's what got me worked up I think a lot of people watched that a confirmation process some kind of ... the process to shop was severely broken I'm I'm a guy with the power in a high as it is it's trained correctly is that it's unbiased\nOr it could do a ... any claim against the candidate age\nBased on publicly available and private information and do so and securing confidential fashion so neither that complain and lord of the candidate was put at risk and so much of the drama we saw on television which\nDamaged both participants significantly\nI could have been done at a time and and the decision could be reach\nA with regard to whether or not the candidate or they complain complain that was Bible about doing so much damage show we pretty much get the same outcome but up but the damage to both parties would be at the end of the appearance of the court\nWould have been or what have been through a stage they reduce them and that's what an A.
