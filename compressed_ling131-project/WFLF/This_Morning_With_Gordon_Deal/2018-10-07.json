obviously that digital ... ballots dated all those can be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have their ... need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets scanned at the machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters

it was the paper ballots that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed and get rid of those uh assistance and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any papers at all and that's how we got the more we have today\nAre about like in the coming years you get the sense that we won't have as many issues as we have now\nI think the problem is is that we have we have had this um ah for a bill a bill has come in Congress since um let's say four or five times a

national debate about sexual misconduct has cast a spotlight on victims reluctance to report assault here with more on their complex reasons as Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth what the numbers tell us first about how many people actually report attacks to law enforcement\n[noise] some of them have been pretty steady for many years decades they're showing that about five to twenty percent of victims do report to law enforcement so that's a very small amount I even smaller on college campuses about Ninety percent of victims do not report on college campuses\nAll right Elizabeth let's talk about some of the specifics what are some of the factors you found in your research about why people are not coming forward\nVery complex so many many reasons why somebody might not report or an assault or rape\nOr it can be re traumatizing to revisit that to help people and go over the details again a and once you once you tell somebody wants to law enforcement system\nTakes over you lose control and this is a primary issue of why the rape or the assault itself was so traumatized and you've lost control of your body right now you you send it out there on your telling people justice system has taken over you've lost control of that again and that that also can be reached traumatizing\nWhy do so many victims blame themselves\n[noise] well we we're in this longstanding culture of sort of blaming the victim and unfortunately victims noted that since so there's a deep amount of shame often you know people were in a position I'm not often that sometimes either somewhere or they feel\nThat they they did something wrong I went to that party I had too many drinks I walked down that street that with dark or they should be things that anybody can do and still be safe you should be safe in this world right in a perfect world but we're not and so there's that self\nBlame like how did I not protect myself\nWe're speaking with Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth your article I thought it was interesting that people are more willing to come forward if there is some evidence of physical harm why is that\nBecause then they face feels like they will be but weeks at a huge fear is that I Am going to put myself out there I'm going to relive trauma and no one's going to do it publicly people now nobody shameful\nBefore it's dry
