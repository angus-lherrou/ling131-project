I'm sure you're familiar with that area and there's this past would I Would go up called ... uh\nAnd it was you know mining you're wearing\nA ... wind right now on me oh yeah they\nI got out of the land I'm Sorry\nIt's OK you hold just one of those two because I Want to hear your story\nOkay so [laughter] so we're not Britain I pass we had a child in the Warm Springs show which transmits a pastor was humans between she mountainous and fair play to go up to the mind cell\nPhones and when I got up there are so\nA different feeling you know I Know it's just they're not told to say you're not you're not seeing a surge time just pretend that I was by myself and I've been a surge of words before but I felt like something was watching and I walked up to this old\nLike a band and mining I'm like a it was almost like they're ... I'm Sorry I was in the military for years but um that's the way I kind of saw how this whole building was\nHad a chance for English ... crashing currently in the woods and stripped spreadsheet and I don't work out and and your words or the fear [noise] yeah so I wore\nAnd the building and you know there was no reform anymore but something told me to go out and around back when I when I stopped\nI caught a glimpse of an Indian just banning ...\nBut\nI didn't think anything of it and it's just part of like ... older ways yeah water yeah we're much more on an interest in what am\nPlace for these discussions anymore that there is home and there's work where we spend a lot of our time so of course these conversations are going to come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I I've done it was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in a like New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of free counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is this the company is called the ... offices in New York and San Francisco and partner at the company sent out a memo early last week just outlining the resources and benefits the company had to deal with this uh and and what I thought was interesting that that particular company is that they set up a slacker him they'd had had to set up for the past year\nThe flack room was called ... resistance\nAnd it was a police for workers there\nTo really engage in these conversations without talking out loud so if people want to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room\nAnd if they didn't want engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees were active last week talking kind of providing real time updates and what was happening and this was a good form for them to do it about\nThat while we're speaking with just cut her Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the workplace I can imagine to some managers uno may not be versed in having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\nThat's right I think some manager said that they felt that\nThere was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of wealth management company near Philadelphia and he said that he had to tell his his small team\nThat there really is just no place for political bickering network so he's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he's take care of him he's the one who pays your salary enough talk about politics here some have taken kind of hard line approach like that\nUm I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see\nWhat happens this week to determine how they respond to want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door just try and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have\nAn open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there if they did have concerns or want it to talk about politics and then we go from there\nHow much of this boils down to gender battles\n[noise] well I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are ... these are gender issues that but I think that we we heard on on all sides of this that they were men could have come into twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you\nAnd and so I think we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they\nDid not feel that are just kept an eye was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really cross gender lines across guy economic lines it was something that this was a very personal debate for a lot of people and and it of course played out at work where we spend so much more time\nNext year but Wall Street journal reporter ship

you heard the story of the state of limbo crash that killed\nTwenty people in upstate New York last weekend just seeing the headline breaks your heart but for some people even though they may not know anyone involved they find themselves grieving even feeling sick inside maybe even helpless why does this happened and how can we manage we're joined now by Dr do this or loss\nPsychiatrists and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's going on here\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly tactic and what they do their heart goes out for other people but they also take on that sadness at into their own body and a lot of their past traumas or trigger\nAnd so I wrote a book called the ... survival guide about these people who are sensitive and loving but they take on too much and that's what happens and it's kind of\nAccidents and horrific situation if they take too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted are anxious or depressed and so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and senator yourself and realize\nThat you are not that your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anguish\nWhat is the nature that they take on this stress\nWell it's interesting it finance and done some research on that and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror neurons are the\nCompassion neurons in the brain for I'm In the past two that's why it's such an interesting character and an impact and thought that it mirror neurons that compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on the tea scan and in that you love and they're getting ... with a needle urine mirror neurons get activated but much more so in hiring path at people\nSo how do you begin to set boundaries than if you realize that when you see something or ... something tragic in the news you know what's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how to begin to set those boundaries\nWay back ... a long time before like you know ... came in so I think even now usually that the retailers ... fight tooth and nail scans come forward and say hey we want to start adding these products or\nThis kind of thing there's a lot of nostalgia and sit in a lot of action so I think the city will probably do it it can to keep them going\nUm another reason is that the new

comfortable\nLast weekend brought the smash success of a star is born the movie directed by Bradley Cooper a remake of the classic tale but in many ways\nThe film defied conventional wisdom in some cases going against that wisdom actively seem to help the film flourish in others did simply didn't hurt the way one might have expected Steve ... at the Washington Post who covers the business of entertainment says either way rival producers should be paying attention Steve how do you see it\nI mean this is the case of you know a movie star war which uh you know in retrospect seems like a membrane of a big hit of course Bradley Cooper directing it directly himself as well as Lady Gaga did a job out of business over the weekend I think we'll continue to do that\nAnd that will probably have a lot of success of the ... and he offers and and the road shows\nOn the line but you're saying about the film and and about the project is that uh there's really not a lot of ... with English would work I mean for one from studio ... he's got to the movies in the war movies for grown ups movies that are in about franchising superheroes for another they yell movie that's been made three times before\nAdmittedly last time back in the seventies but with a lot of success before your rules here but we make a movie with will do well in the past because it's just going to get compared unfavorably to that earlier version and again they bump that little two or three oh sort of convention liberate\nThe side and um you know ended up working I prefer to prevent you\nKnow that was interesting an interesting point about I'm not really making a movie that's already done well in debt that high bar right you didn't think you should be pick a movie that didn't do well because there's only room to grow or do it better\nWell that's the thing that was the last ... feel cliff here years maybe more than a decade now that that\nIt was just got out of the remake band when we're seeing about course on television as well is that you know and I feel this way all of us have a lot of people do you think that would come back but if if you bring them back to class or if you don't look like less than ... maybe ... beats been kind of\nA ... we're going to sort of a lesser versions of those earlier I mainly just do one had that offer for one thing you know again it was back in the mid seventies so a lot of people are seeing a movie route with Barbara Streisand and Christmas of course obviously in\nA you know it was a long time ago and it was the world is changing the music world\nThat uh misspelling documents he was very much about a sort of a Mario cruise character with our country rocker but when I was going to the bottom of a sort of pop superstar or on the way to becoming that that's a very different sort of set of musical circumstances in the seventies show you know what it is a civil remake it was a remake I think\nI had a lot to say about and informed\nTo a great extent by what's happening right now\nWe're speaking with Stephen ... at the Washington Post ... the business of entertainment he's got a piece\nTitled the seven ways a star is born bucked Hollywood's conventional wisdom and succeeded anyway or we were talking off air I told you I just don't see many movies so I sort of ... near when I saw the over the weekend box number of of uh like forty two million I don't know okay whatever too bad I voted to\nEntertainers I like Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga oh well but put that number perspective because that's not really\nYou know they weren't after like a two hundred million dollar opening weekend\nThat's exactly right and you know I think the numbers are always funny where we get get gotta get inundated every weekend now we're on Monday rather with these box office numbers one weekend where that is terrible and that's not really it was sort of a state of who should be like anything else or any other financial benchmark\nWe kind of have to go kill lecture you know a very new to if you may you know a hundred grand in the stock market\nOr if you're shares I worth that much but but we spend on your fifty thousand or to buy them as far as if you made ten grand of course and I had always been a thousand that's a pretty good return similar scenario I mean it's mid budget\nMovie aimed at grown ups are not meant to be this kind of global assault on the box office are ... might be for you after so uh you know the fact that he made forty two point six million when you look at\nYou know how how ...
