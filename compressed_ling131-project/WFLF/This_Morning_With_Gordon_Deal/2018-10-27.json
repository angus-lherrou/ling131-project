{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "I'm doing essentially a word study right and so I'm looking at the at the Hebrew and looking at the Greek and I'm looking at the Arabic for the word murder or kill ... which is what\nIs implied in some in some stories but they don't actually use the word murder the only reason I brought it up as I thought it was significant that the the ... murder is a very very very big deal in Islam\nIt's not it's you know people often talk about Islam and there was you know they make all these characterizations about Muslims and it's it's really unfair because murder any kind of death anytime you're killing something that's a big deal in this month\nAnd so the fact really the elevation is really my point was that they were elevating the death of Jesus by using the word murder or they weren't pulling a punch and I think that's cool\nUm as for um as for other things yeah no I think you're you know that's an interesting thought I Can't get in the mind of the\nOf the Bible writers who felt like that was but I I Know that sometimes murder is sold softly and the Bible the word murder exists they exist there Hebrew words for murder but they don't use it all the time instead they use kill\nA which is more neutral and sounds almost in some cases justifiable oh let me go to Alex who's in New Hampshire\nOn coast to coast to him and I'm afraid I started something Alex that uh probably probably I don't know how he got his start in I'm Sorry I'm dragging everybody into this but I Hope ah opens conversation you're enjoying anyway Alex and\nI Am I Am enjoying it and I'm taking my call 'em I spoke with a few years ago about a book or I'm interested in that whenever I hear you I'm ... I'm always thinking along spiritual line or when the decline [laughter]\nUm [noise] I I caught it very seriously I'm interested in my book called the ... [laughter] I'm\nFrom the from the turn of the last century right yeah\nYeah I think are published and or like you know eight um apparently with great according to the introduction of ... it was kind of transcribe are written transcribed by Levi Dowling would transcribe it from a classic record\nOr no off of not have gone for a book of member of the way of putting it [laughter]\nI'm headed with this book because it it parallels in any way for for gospel um\nAnd describing like geezer and also covered like that so called missing here is a divide\nA highly ... law in years or so [laughter] um but it does talk about the different ages and that that they're full of full title of the book is very current gospel of Jesus calmer the price of the highest in age\nAnd somewhere and I'm a I'm not an expert on this book but I'm fascinated with the idea of the return of the Christ that I'm not in a lot of conservative Christian I'm ... I'm more in line with like the Quakers at I'm fascinated with the idea of um\nThe beginning of an age where they've got to be occurring age began disagreement about\nThat oh yeah ours is that I'm going to determine I'll go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're bringing I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes I think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in or\nIs this just this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism and neo Marxism and you know all we could ever do is the arise because we can't there's no there's no met a\nData somewhere that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... [noise] so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make ten ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what something that just otherwise it'd be completely ... he's a way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I mean I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I've looked it up several times and and it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it is sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time they'll missing so called years\nI'm big because there's a lot of different books that address that I don't want that they all tell the same story though do you\n[noise] I don't know I'm not familiar with all the ... the only one I'm familiar with the coverage for ... years I'm ... I didn't want to a wrap it up quickly on there's a lot I could go into a bucket for a wonderful story\nUm I I agree with what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier three different color your um\nYeah ... ... it it ... your crochet creatively how\nAre we we all worship or something you know whether it's money or her metro is in or whatever God him or her so\nThat we really appreciate that great and you're you're ... you're working your way I I I appreciate that but I also think is it is a downside to that for sure but I did it because you know we have this freedom but we don't always use ...\nOh yeah we have a buddy not correct so individually or can we collectively\nCouldn't agree more to have some kind of shared values\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political here I I think what holds us together as a country is a I I I don't fixate on borders I understand the importance or security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut what people talk about each the border that makes as a country that's just not true you know it's not the border that makes me in Arizona in right or soon to be a a a cans and isn't a like didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd you're saying that uh there were a couple of dozen accounts roughly at the same time tweeting the exact same the same exact thing right\nYeah so there clearly is operated by a small groups of people who made up\nFake identities the whole point is that they want to be the count look like they were real Americans tweeting about these things and you can that was true also uh when they were treating up political issues and so these people would be you'd see a clean four counts to the exact same thing at the exact\nSame time or within minutes of each other and they'd be very politically charged statements saying things like how can the NFL disrespect fly we saw that the majority of the tweets that had apart are feeling or from what\nThe researchers called ... which means that they were a conservative and they were and those people were typically very much against the player protests are on the other hand you saw some people who are said\nThings that could be seen as inflammatory from the other side and very much strongly in favor of the players\nWere speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Andrew beaten his piece is called how Russian trolls inflamed the NFL's anthem controversy or this is still going on I presume has been no attempt to shut this down to be a violation of free speech perhaps but I don't know is there anything like that happening behind the scenes\nOh all the accounts that reference happen shut down um but the\nThe the whole thing is though that when these accounts or shut down the new ones are made and new ones that are made so what so there's definitely still what the researchers told us that there is definitely count still being monitored that are that way then more recently on various topics whether that was\nThe Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick that will also drew a lot of charge reactions or the U.S open final between we'll Williams and and I only have soccer that also\nReally drew a lot of attention so it's clear that they the sport as a way into the conversation about American culture in a way to sort of discord\nSo they're obviously sowing discord if some kind of does that mean that the tweets are influential\nIt definitely varies I mean some of these cats didn't have many followers and probably didn't reach that many people on the other hand there were in each of these accounts that grew to have\nA tens of thousands of dollars and could have tens of thousands of ... so it\nSo it definitely varies across a broad range of structure I mean of course it also needs to be\nPut in the context that that there's probably this is just a portion of the giants the of tweets that are sent on the subject that the obviously huge compensation for anybody but it's fascinating can see that these became a ... something that they saw as a wedge issue\nWith Andrew Wall Street journal reporter Andrew beaten it's twelve minutes now

and there's nothing wrong with dreaming as one expert says as we shift our thoughts away from what's wrong in our lives to the possibilities of something better we attract good things for ourselves\nVisionary coach Laurie Dixon is here to discuss turning big lotto dreams into everyday wins or you when you recommend\nThat is thinking that that's real and starting to believe and possibility\nAnd so what it does it allows us to start to dream and drain in a big way we know that the jak pots are so high right now that it allows us to stretch really far so that's part of that process\nAnd with everything going on right now in the news and the economics and political science we start to look at our lives sometimes and how it affects us negatively\nAnd there's a lot of fear going on around community even national way and so people me things that give them hope\nAnd Langley dream and Langley wonder and we think either by that took a gamble that it opens up the door to allow us to accept that and upgrade or way Mm\nSo to that point then how do you say okay I didn't win it's however I see a new door to walk through like what do you have an a ha moment for example\nAnd so you think about turnout not letting that go and so it's not a self defeating moment when you look at that ticket and the number is ... years and you have to go back to work that

they are but as they make the walk back off the property and kind of transition back into normal life they're so excited they were geared again they're telling me that these memories are going to last them a lifetime\nFor the actors I guess there are some rules of these extreme haunts\nYeah they're not allowed to actually hurt the people one of the guys\nWere kind of funny and he told me that his only rules are basically don't kill then don't permanently scarred them but you know they actually got physical which is funny I mean you go to places like universal studios Hans and you know they pop out and I think are a lot of them\nHaving no touching rural and these guys can pick them up they can turn them around that can put their hands around their neck\nBut they're not allowed to actually physically hurt them and some of the participants they leave with bruises they leave with surface scratches but they all said that they kind of expect that going in and\nYou know they all wanted to make it known that they're not into just being tortured for the sake of being torture but the beauty is that they're basically living their own horror films and as long as it moves with the story or
