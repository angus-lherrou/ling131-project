technologies with them they clearly taught humankind how to use various tools and and other implements but along the way they also\nAnd this was a big beef that the church has with the watchers they taught the secrets of heaven\nAnd the secrets of heaven are how humans can transform into angels ride the cosmic conduit and dwell it God's throne\nAnd that's the really big question right there George why would any why would the church have a problem with this why does the establishment church have a problem with a group of beings coming to earth and teaching humans to become angels\nYou would think they would welcome that\nYou would think they would welcome at the problem is is that you cut out the church in the scenario you have no need for the pope's in the ... and the whole church establishment because in fact the church doesn't teach you\nCan do it on your own right\nYou can do it on your own and that is the big question can humans\nTake it upon themselves to perfect themselves as the term to become more whole to become more holy to become more complete if you answer no then chase them as demons chase them is giants if you answer yes\nAnd you've really you're now you're you're getting into the innermost esoteric secrets of the most closely guarded secrets of all human kind the secrets that day whatever government or new world order type authority you subscribe to these are the secrets they do not want you to know about these are the secrets of the aluminum ... ultimately\nWell you mentioned something to is there any evil it all connected with the watchers\nWill there isn't in perception I mean the the the the scenes were absolutely clear in their writings that there are two currents or forces of the watchers one was represented by the arc angel Michael is also sometimes referred to as ...\nWho is who established the priesthood of which she says was a member of the other current or force is led by ... who was referred to later as the anti Christ and they were they were all of the belief that these two forces are currents are active in our consciousness at all times this is kind of the Christian concept of\nThe devil on your ... on one shoulder and the angel on the other\nAnd it was all about harmonizing these forces and recognizing that through our the power of our own consciousness and our own thoughts we can actually become angels\nIs an amazing possibility a how did you uncovered this\nI've actually been on the trail of the watchers for some time I mean I've been of course on the on a knock you trail for Fifteen Years or so and then I started researching the Sarah from several years ago these are the highest order of angels and\nThey watch or guard God's throne and in fact during the ... it was a belief was developed that the Sarah from were actually humans\nWho would transform themselves into angels or perfected themselves that the book of papers describes the the heavenly thrown a God referred to as ... on and they tell us that it's inhabited it's an inhabited by joyful angels and the angels are the lord the watchers and just humans made perfect\nAnd I'm reading this and go why are these people ... and ... what did they know how did they perfect themselves how did they get to turn into angels and go and do well in God's throne and can I how can I and that's what started me on this real path of of trying to uncover the secrets of the watchers\n[noise]\nI never knew in my garden and I never knew there were only in my old man in my feeling\nDown by ... and you know I have things that need

these conversations are going to come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I thought it was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in a like New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of free counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is this the company is called the Bateman group and offices in New York and San Francisco and partner at the company sent out a memo early last week just outlining the resources and benefit to the company had to deal with this uh and and what I thought was interesting that that particular company is that they set up a slacker him they had had had to set up for the past year\nBut the flack room was called hash tag resistance and it was a police for workers there\nTo really engage in these conversations without talking out loud so if people wanted to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room and if they didn't want to engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees were active last week talking kind of providing real time updates and what was happening and this was a good form for them to do it\nOut that while we're speaking with just cut her Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the work place I can imagine to some managers I don't know may not be versed in having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\nThat's right I think some manager said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia and he said that he had to tell his his small team that there really is just no place for political bakery network\nSo he's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he could take care of him he's the one who pays for salary enough talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that um I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see\nWhat happens this week to determine how they respond to want to see how their employees feel before they determined the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door just try and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have\nAn open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there if they did have concerns or wanted to talk about politics and then we'll go from there\nHow much of this uh boils down to gender battles\n[noise] well I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are ... these are gender issues that but I think that we we heard on\nOn all sides of this that they were men kind of come into twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you and and so I think and then we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they did not feel that uh just kept an eye was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really\nIt cross gender lines across guy economic lines that was something that this was a very personal debate for a lot of people and and it of course played out at work where we spend so much more time\nNext year but Wall Street journal reporter ship cutter is twelve minutes now after the hour on this

York last weekend just seeing the headline breaks your heart but for some people even though they may not know anyone involved they find themselves grieving even feeling sick inside maybe even helpless why does this happen\nAnd how can we manage we're joined now by Dr Judas or law psychiatrists and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's going on here\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly empathic and what they do is our heart goes out for other people but they also take on that sadness and into their own bodies and a lot of their past traumas or trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... survival guide about these people who\nAre so sensitive and so loving but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of\nAccidents and horrific situations as they take too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted or anxious or depressed\nAnd so it it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and the center yourself and realize that you're not them but your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anguish\nWhat is the nature that they take on this stress\nWell it's interesting it's sunny and I've done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror\nNeurons are the compassion neurons and the brain for I'm I'm past too that's why it's such a an interest in it on the coyote trust and an impact and thought that the mirror neurons the compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on a state to scan and in that you love and they're getting ... with a needle your mirror neurons get activated but much more showing highly empathic people\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries than if you realize that when you see something or ... something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all

said he told me they send out people to force that last but it's a very vague law says they have to sell newspapers magazines or periodicals and from what I've seen some new standards will\nYou know

I have a lot you know a much higher Americans\nWe're speaking with and get out of the wall Street Journal and you mentioned all those other products not competing with stories I Would think some of the stories in the area would not be too thrilled about some of the things that the new stance or selling\nThat you're right but this has been kind of an old tradition some of these fans have been there for\nYou know going way back ... a long time before like you know ... came in so I think even though\nUsually that the retailers outlets fight tooth and nail and then in the stands come forward and say hey we want to start adding these products or this kind of thing there's kind of a lot of nostalgia and the city and a lot of action so I think the city will probably do it it can to keep them going\nUm another reason is that the newsstands officer to um [noise]\nIt was kind of billboards for advertising sales in the city makes about fifty five million a year from the company that um rents out the sides and backs of the standard for\nFor um selling advertising for the city wants to make sure that that new stands can keep going it has an interest in making sure that they all start folding they want to keep us alive to keep that ad revenue coming in\nWith this weekend's Jennifer ... with Wall Street journal columnist into debt operators by the way they stand say the oranges five cents on a one dollar tabloid newspaper with eighty cents on a one dollar bottle of Poland Spring operators typically are in about thirty grand a year it's thirty minutes now after the hour long this weekend\n\n\n\nFor the rest of the life I mean it's so much easier to do these are real people give him a ... year old that I have literally changed your life you don't catch you walk outside your front door and cures cancer really what you do as a little bit\nThe entire interview on the I heard radiolab download it now for free from your story and search quiet spotlight Orlando\nWhen your company has a benefit to experience that spins out who you renaissance provides a smarter way to offer employees mental vision life and disability insurance\n... it'll be clear Saturday Night moves in the sixties or lose Seventy five along the coast Sunday sunshine a few clouds quite woman ...
