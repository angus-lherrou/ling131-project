a that is a very fair point that is a very fair point let me offer you a thing for this show and then I'm going to build on that thing left is ruin lives conservatives elevate them let me say that again I Want to make sure you catch that\nLeft this ruin lives conservatives elevates them\nSo when I was saying is that what the last does is they project what they do on to us so they are afraid of Brett Kavanaugh listen\nI don't even expect Brett Kavanaugh to be some major I don't expect him to be Scalia or anything like that I expect Brett Kavanaugh to just be a a\nAn originalist if you will he's not going to be an activist this other guy that reads law interprets law he doesn't make waves but he reads the laws that is that's fine with me that's good uh you know uh I don't think like I said I don't think he'll be a Scully or I\nDon't even think he'll be a Clarence Thomas if you will\nBut I think that he'll be a decent judge I think he'll be more in the bane of John Roberts and uh so we'll have to wait and see but what the laughter so scared about is they they really don't care look at look at what they're doing they\nThey don't understand many of them that are out there protesting I kid you not they don't understand that what they need to do or their best protests is is is that the ballot box\nThey don't understand that they need to vote there are the people are the people in and their their their their house districts or their senators and that's the way they make the biggest change now obviously a lot of they've just painting them what's that stop educating\nNo kidding uh but see so a lot of them they just don't get this they they don't understand that they think this protest is effective and what it's done for all intents and purposes is in bold and uh the base of the G O P\nThank God uh apparently we needed to wake up call I didn't realize how badly we need it the wakeup call\nUntil we got to wake up call but going back to the thing left this ruin lives conservative elevate them let me prove this to you quickly as I go on to mind\nA friend was former FBI agent Monica McLean ... so that's what she was staying with during that period of time\nThat wasn't the same woman that administer the um ... it take to\nOh man All right so you brought up another you brought up another point that point three and then we'll go ahead and take a break\nI mean but you don't ever administer that test when a person is in shock\nBecause it's throws out waiting yeah and her friend knew she'd been to a funeral that day I mean the day before yeah so ... yeah that's the test now because then we can prove that yeah you were telling the truth\nWell beyond that what does it say her boyfriend claimed her boyfriend claims not only was she not ... a claustrophobic not only did she not have a fear of flying but he claims in his letter that the left won't talk about or that the um oh man I just\nLast month she ... she bought another woman and all

A. R. I. D. O. P. O. L. U. S. Mike Herod ... um and a great guy and obviously knows this stuff when it comes to politics a former president of the U.S Senate or the state of Florida\nAnd uh obviously he knows this stuff so he knows or the way the ground game is set up in the state of Florida so Rick Scott it sounds like to me that the\nUh run dissent is can ride Rick Scott's coat tails and we we have to hope that he does he hasn't been a great campaigner in my opinion he's relied way too heavily on President Trump on Fox News national Fox News\nBut right now it doesn't matter it's like Mike said we have a I mean this is it doesn't get any\nEast and west if you look forward to the east and west of the left or the right then that's when we have a person that's a democratic socialist running against a conservative and a run to Santa was a great\nCongressman in my opinion but obviously stepping into a state wide race is a much different beast\nA and I'm not sure that he understood all the complexities of that but it sounds like he has the right people on staff right now or at the right time to get it done so I'm hoping and praying that that does take effect but you guys remember\nJust a couple of things when it comes to Obamacare when it came to Obamacare remember President Obama said if you like your healthcare plan you'll be able to keep a you'll be able to keep your health care plan the reality was that millions of America's\nLoss and uh and lost their coverage you know Obamacare and quite frankly I was one of those people see what they tried to do is fixed they try to fix 'em it was just backwards so temperate temper sending people and the individual market a bit uh bought their own insurance or didn't have insurance I was\nAnd those people as a self employed individual and at the time I was buying my own PPO insurance literally a sky rocketed four hundred percent\n... under the Affordable CARE Act\nSo ... what Obamacare did and what it was essentially created to do was make middle class people like me dependent on the government because and then a because if you make middle class people depending on the government as well the Democrats will always in forever when a win elections\nAnd that's simply what they did just another promise remember President Obama said um will lower uh uh Obamacare will lower premiums\nBy up to twenty five hundred of average on average four hundred on average of about ten or twenty five hundred a hundred\nOr typical family of four and it was the exact opposite wow\nWhat did you expect yet premiums when or if you like a doctor and even more now\nInitially they went up about that are about twenty five hundred and they went up even further um\nA later\nSo getting rid of this individual mandate was was heaven sent for the ten percent of people that could no we're basically priced out of the market\nYou know most people get their insurance from their jobs\nYou know but if you're a self employed individual like me then hey it's you know it's or or or if you're poor and you can get medicate\nBut if you're in the middle class you're self employed you have a hard time getting insurance and most people don't know that so he tried to fix the market for people like me and he made it totally unaffordable\nUp for people like me quite frankly so it was a it was the exact opposite we only have a short period of time here so let me get back to um\nMiss Christine Blasey Ford and we'll just run through these quickly or the last one that we discussed was a I'm Sorry I'm pulling this up on\nMy computer right now but so she pretended she had a ... a a fear of flying we found out from her ex boyfriend that wasn't right they they traveled all over other Asian and Pacific if you will in a small ... planes uh we also found out that uh\nUh she had coach her friend a former FBI agent\nOn in the skills of passing a polygraph test she lied under oath she said she had never\nUh taken a ball polygraph tests are never coach anyone and taking a polygraph\nTest when I was a nice thing about ... you know anything about it okay so we got to take a break we'll finish this up on the other side and then we'll move on to the big bombshell on Russia collusion this is a crowd Jackson show you listen to news radio Ninety three one [laughter]\n\n\n\n\n\nWas hardest audience and talk radio news radio not even going one\nPicking at selling your home but want it so fast and for top dollar Hi this is ...

Fox News shows comments from Supreme Court justice by cabin on the White House ceremony today boxers de France has more lives\nThat came out do you guys remember the story about the double door on the front of her house she said the devil door look really weird but she did it as a result of the attack because she was claustrophobic and all of this kind of nonsense\nAnd uh you know it sounded really believable incredible at the time and the way she was talking it made it sound like that was something she did right near a the time but she got the counseling in two thousand twelve\nComing to find out she got the double doors or the additional front door added in two thousand eight because she was using the space for rental space in office space\nTotally lie total totally lie under oath\nYou know she was asked if she was going to pursue anything further any further charges were Brett Kavanaugh now she's chilling of course not she was she doesn't want to follow false police were\nA report or not to mention a the original letter to the Washington Post they claim the attack happened in the early eighties and and switched to the mid eighties\nOr wind or from the mid eighties to the early eighties out to make it where she could blame a Brett Kavanaugh another life she told what her husband said that she mentioned Brett Kavanaugh inside of the counseling sessions and then she testified under oath that she never mentioned his name so her husband life for so\nUpon all of these lies afterlives afterlives it's time for Christine Blasey Ford in my opinion to be investigated alright enough of that let's move on this is a real cool thing is you want to\nSomething ... you don't take a look at her political affiliation\nAbortion pill researcher that is one else of\nMe to move me too movement wearing the hats with the female genitalia on her head right\nVery very far left wing\nSo it was not a case of well\nLet's bring out the truth it's was let's get this guy yeah that and and I miss it if she were\nTo give the with\nThe ... the Democrat Party to try and bring down judge Kavanaugh yeah she has been ...\nBy the rest of the Democratic party I I don't believe that I don't believe that and therefore guy is not just her\nThat should be investigated okay I see this every body okay that is linked to it I I totally agree with that I Do believe that she had on there for yeah I Do believe that cast the cat's law firm\nUh should be investigated Dianne Feinstein herself above Christine Blasey Ford needs to be a part of it I think she's complicit\nYou know I Know it's I I'm not trying to be hyperbolic here I'm not trying to and this is just the sense that I got\nFrom the beginning and then when you start seeing the inconsistencies in their statement when you find out that she's a researcher for an abortion pill company things start becoming pretty clear pretty quickly All right so ah let's go ahead and move on because honestly Trump has been having a lot of success\nAnd we haven't got a gotten a talk about it\nThere was a jobs numbers report I don't have the numbers right in front of me\nUh but from what I recall\nThere were about a hundred and thirty seven thousand jobs in the month of uh September produce which is a bit of a slow down how ever it was still\nA forty nine year historic low unemployment rate down a three point seven I think an order I if I recall correctly in order to maintain a job growth we have to there has to be a hundred and twenty thousand jobs per month\nCreated so there were still a hundred and thirty seven thousand not as many as expected but still more than the number and you think about three point seven unemployment\nThat is virtually full employment so basically when you see people leaving work it's a lot of people shifting around and the numbers don't catch up with them until later so people may quit jobs in order to find another job or a different job and you'll see that reflected in the numbers\nThey also ramped up the jobs numbers for the month of July and August so they were actually eighty thousand more jobs reduce than previously reported and those months and this is all unemployment number of people there's a I\nI Want the G ... no it is they use ... they do they know that it's not the youth three now you're three number yeah and the right so this also takes into account people re entering the market place exactly okay so\nTheoretically with people coming off welfare and re entering the market place the unemployment numbers should go up\nYeah but it isn't yeah because\nJobs being created and of course President Obama's claiming it was because of his policies places darling\nHeads [laughter] I mean the guy [laughter] big guys\nA reputation that guy's legacy is being a ... month after month and uh\nYeah but why does he have to make themselves look like such a fool\nWell until the left he isn't I mean they they want to believe that their policies they want to believe that not only are there are policies emotionally hailing but they're profitable in some way or some foreign but no one runs their household like that I mean you don't give away a all your money it it\nIt is it's it's just utterly ridiculous but anyway I wanted to point out those jobs numbers you don't hear a bottom much that is going to be important\nI don't think do you think let me ask you guys do you think what what has to happen\nIn order for the Republicans to win in November do you think they can continue on with this bomb this Kavanaugh bumper the Kavanaugh effect for thirty days do you think that'll that'll work I don't I I think after two weeks\nA stepping stone yeah that I agree with the capitalize on that they need to start pushing the unemployment numbers the economy\nJobs um how\nThey want to fix border security or they want to cut down on the legal immigration and that will take them over the ...\nI think what they have to do this piggybacking on what a Mike Herod uplift share it with us earlier concerning uh run to Santas and Andrew Gillum I think also what they have to do is\nThink they have to go back to the Obama era I think they have to mention the numbers then compare to now uh you know what's working now what wasn't working men\nAnd constantly\nTrumpet or what we're going to get more of\nAn eye and honestly I think they need a I think they need a Newt\nGingrich down a list hey this is what we want to accomplish\nThe next time around if you reelect is I you know give people something to look forward to give people something uh you know to to hope for\nHey you know what we're going for even bigger tax cuts more money or more money in your pocket we're going to continue fighting a we're going to oh\nYeah we're going to continue fighting I'm I'm I just for you know for more jobs fighting against\nBut who's going to be the new head of the house or either\nKevin it looks like it's Kevin ... are going to be Kevin McCarthy are right now\nDoes he have the backbone to stand up and get the stuff done like Newt Gingrich did\nSee okay so here's here's the deal this is what I'm convinced of as of now there is a admittedly a Trump effect\nGoing on in Congress so I think people that were a little weaker are going to grow a sideline Kevin McCarthy wouldn't be my I Would prefer even these police over McCarthy I Would prefer Jim Jordan over all of them quite frankly\nBut um I I think that I think that\nWith Trump these guys will grow a bit of a back well anyway we got to take a break when we get back our uh when we come back\nI'll take your calls as the crowds accidents on news radio Ninety three one [laughter]\n\nAs the road to the historic two thousand Eighteen midterms heats up MSNBC has you covered from now through election day with

that find Kate real tea and her team may already has a buyer for you yet you heard me correctly Laurie team currently has buyers and they're exclusive buyers and waiting program the fact is they have more buyers which means more money at a faster sale for Yale\nLewis timeframe for selling homes is thirty five percent faster than the average age and\nAnd at the same time they also get their clients eight percent more money for example just ask Adriana who sell her house and eight days at one hundred one percent of asking price\nIs so confident that you're homeless out that they will guarantee it

even bigger\nOr that that makes me that makes me happy I'm not exactly sure how they would enforce this and obviously I have to look into this more this was just a quick a few paragraphs I saw this and I was like oh no way are we gotta talk about this uh but basically illegals happened is Emily\nWe have to figure out a way to have illegals assimilate\n... with the United states no let me make\nThis phone let me make this point if illegals don't have to end a to assimilate to vote they're gonna feel empowered to vote for their country's values rather than to accept ours\nLike doing that already I don't need to assimilate they need to be the ports it\nHere's the thing ... listen I'm telling you right now the state of California the state of it it is not going to happen in the state of California\nWell then kind of all government federal funding to them and watch it change\nI think you do cut off federal funding to them I think that you I think you have to impose e verify I

tie cabin on Russia collusion I knew the left would find a way to tie these together but in a sense but it's backfired\nAnd I really believe that part of the reason why Trump\nFought so hard for Kavanaugh is because he was able to feel completely empathetic to what was going on a this false allegations about Russia collusion\nOr when someone else did it you know Brett Kavanaugh the same thing maybe something happened where bloggers before which I don't believe you know I'm looking at care on Facebook Live she doesn't\nBelieve it either smart woman I'm and women now I mean women women no other women I mean they just they they they just do is just it's just pretty uncanny quite frankly but the latest news\nOn this Russia collusion nonsense and this from the hill a John Solomon here's a summary congressional investigators have come from the top FBI official met with Democratic Party lawyers now a lot of this stuff we knew\nBut this stuff is starting to be confirmed with names attached which is pretty cool um\nWhich I I Hope President Trump declassified this stuff but I mean he started to and then brought it back but nonetheless it will go on a show they\nConfirmed that are invested congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met with Democratic Party lawyers\nAre to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion weeks before the two thousand sixteen election and before the bureau secured a a search warrant targeting Trump campaign\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the two thousands sixteen season with at least one attorney from Perkins coy if you're not familiar with Perkins coy ah that was a D and seize private private law firms so you have an FBI\nGeneral counsel James Baker former FBI general counsel

will come out and take everything\nNow is like the typical lifespan of a ...\nYeah so that I get that question all the time I'm Glad I did I ... I Am so glad you asked that question um so that's a that's a tough question because it just you know there's so many things involved you know like we talked about earlier you know where does your house it you know how much sun hits it do you have\nA trees and uh what kind of shingle was use you installed it you know in some relation can often be um unfortunately when you don't use a reputable company could potentially get a bad install\nUm there's all these things that come into play but I Will say generally speaking so hypothetically say we'd never have a right right we don't have hurricanes any more\nOrder yeah if we didn't have any hurricanes you know most roofs and Florida just with the sun and the humidity and the wind and rain that we get\nYou're probably looking at you know if you can get I tell my customers if you can get Twenty years out of a roof in Florida you've done really well yes that's a solid like we rarely run into people that say hey I've had my ... thirty seven years now it just doesn't happen you know it's it's tough to have a roof that long and then you throw the hurricane in there and [laughter] well you know not\nJust hurricanes as well I mean have yeah hell does a ton of damage and we get plenty of\nThat ... we definitely get lots of hail hail is hail is um an interesting thing you know you would you'd be amazed at a a small pebble a vice how much damage it can do to your roof\nWhy don't you can see what it does to a car right and that's just thinking one storm ... where's my car but I can hear it coming down you don't think about what it's doing to your ...\nRight right yeah hail hail is an interesting thing because those small ... vice that hitting that hit your shingle what's happening is those little granular as we were talking about earlier that you sometimes see washed away and your letters\nUm when the hail hits those ... beds into the shingle\nAnd impressive the granular down into the shingle and what it does is it\nIt it it a kind of a deal it damages the laminate that's behind the shingle there okay so now at that point barrier between the ... yeah so now that shingles damage meaning that you could potentially get water damage and all these things can happen\nUm it'd be like you know if you took a hammer and started wailing on your roof or something it's not a good thing to do damage so [laughter] hail when hail hits your roof it's kind of that same effect depending on the size of the hill rain\nIf it's tiny dog yeah you know but we've we've recently had some hail damage in the land of central Florida area and\nUm you know if you think you had summer maybe you know you saw it and it was at home and um I've seen some pictures of\n'em some houses out um I think it's a winter springs area a novel and park that area\nWhere gutters were full of hail it's a lot of hail I'd be freaking yeah a lot of hail so ... yeah it's wild and it it it will damage your roof so we can come out and look and um we can see if it's damaged or see if the hill actually hit it\nLot of times it's only going to hit like one part of the roof because it kinda comes at an ... so we got to figure out you know did it hit where to hit all that kind of stuff and then at that point we would sort of recommended or say to you here's what we think may be going on or what we see\nOkay I mean you don't normally think about yeah hurricanes have which got regular son started my mess around my house and I mean if you see a lot of this\nSquirrels so yeah yeah ... ... they will to everything I have a neighbor that eats them [noise] yeah that's not [laughter] maybe your neighbors throwing feet up on your roof\nMade while you're not a not shells that I find him I got her as I Know where they're going with the peanuts but I was in my office and they said that I had my river placed\nAbout three years ago and it was at my home office and during one of our big thunderstorms and all of the night I hear\nIt so ... so interestingly enough we uh got piles those type event does that come out of your roof vats of the way that we like you know I Know your story I Know everybody's story [laughter]\nOr if you look at your roof and you see that it's wrapped and metal it's led um for some reason I don't know why why squirrels or why are this way but they will chew on that mental and that led they cut their teeth on it and I don't really understand the you know\nBehind like locks off my fence they will eat anything that metal\nThey love the metal and so if you look at your roof and you see one pipe is maybe like you know eight inches high and the other one's only two inches I and it's all non down you've got animals chewing on your pipes now the scary thing about that is\nIf they chew enough they're going to chew a hole in your roof yeah yeah and then now you got leaking and all that so we actually don't put lead pipes on anymore um when we put we called rubber bullet boot\nAnd saw bullet ... is a really hard rubber a piece that goes right over that pipe it's got a ... on the top of it so that way the air gets in and out\nAnd that way nothing gets done in it but more importantly the squirrels don't like to chew on the rubber\nSo looks nicer cars you know this metal that's wrapped around hypes it kind of looked like ...\nIt's like somebody just squeeze it around it mhm these look way more professional they look very clean aesthetically they're very pleasing to the world and it's our rules don't eat them it's great though that's our answer to taking care of that and uh it's it's really the right way to do a roof especially in Florida squirrels\nWell and and now there's oh yeah yeah little critter is that like to come into your home plenty of those funny though if you're seeing\nSigns just kind of kind of ... if you're going to see a paddling in like in your pool or in your driveway after storms if you're noticing any movement on your shingles it all I Would yeah those are two like big red flag signs of you probably need somebody out here to look at\nThe end it and quite honestly if nobody's looked at your roof and the last year to you just haven't had a roof or come out and your roof has some age to it um you really probably should have an inspection done um you know we do for inspections there's no cost to come out and look at your roof\nAre very easy and painless um you know our folks in the ... and the communication center just gonna ask you if your questions I'm trying to understand what's going on and then we're going to send one of our um one of our estimate is out to look at it assess what's going on and then give you feedback based upon what we see or don't see on the roof\nAnd that was really good now as a free inspections and if you think you are ready for something even more than that by mentioning this show and that you were the the the Patrick you got that little aha moment with their new home show you can get priority service by calling in at four zero seven eight zero nine\nFive one five six and that free inspection thing that's so I'm sure there are people hadn't even thought about there it was like well we didn't get any damage there and I just have just gone on where they could just be happening up there oh yeah and just creating more and more and more damage\nAnd if you've had a roofer maybe maybe just maybe purchased a home in the last year or two and you know the home inspection that you had done they said hey you need to think about replacing your roof and the next few years or something like this might be the time to go ahead start getting serious about it now the thing I'll say too is\nA roofing cos I'm are not getting any cheaper fast Hurricane Irma prices have continually increasing on them up um you know sign demand a lot of people had a hurricane or um had roofs done during after hurricane\nOr which is all the blue roofs you saw when you um and so a lot of people don't realize how expensive it is to do a roof or even right now and so it's a good time to go ahead and start getting prepared I mean none of the thing that I Do with my customers is often I'll go out and say hey\nYou might not need a new new roof this moment but it's time to get really serious about it right so let's think about what is it looked like maybe in the next couple of months or six months or this year to go ahead and plan on getting a roof put on this house 'cause you don't want to wait so long\nThat you've got water intrusion and lose a lot of people want to say you know it's like it's not like a car right so like I always joke I've got a I've got a big car 'cause I have\nFive kids and my wife [laughter] I always joke I'm going to drive the car till it blows up do you do not want to drive them if you really blows up okay take advantage of the free inspection absolutely\nSo I reach out to Patrick with universal roof and contracting and their entire team and they're eager to help and if you mentioned this show real home show you will get priority service when you call for zero eight zero nine five one five six that's four\nZero seven eight zero nine five one five

Eric cutter president of lighthouse financial solution\nAn asset and retirement protection company right here in the treasure and Space Coast\nThere's a question I'd like to ask you\nHow much of your money is currently in the market and all of it [noise]\nTo have that particular percentage exposed to market risk or did it sort of just happened why am I asking as I've said before the market goes up and the markets go down how much of your life savings that is exposed to market risk is a very important consideration\nThat is why I strongly encourage everyone to think of their money in terms of red money and green money\nThose turns may sound funny but I Believe they will help us understand a very important concept let me explain red money is money that we're willing to exposed to market risk in hopes of a higher return\nWe accept the possibility of losses even significant losses and hopes of greater gains\nRed money has exposed the upside and downside market risk green money is about safety and security with green money we're not willing to accept the risk of losses so we're willing to accept a lower return in exchange\nGreen money does not have downside market risk\nSo of red money is exposed upside down side market risk and green money has only upside market potential which one is better well that's probably the wrong question to be asking because neither one is inherently good or bad it all depends\nThe very important questions we should ask ourselves or these\nWhat percentage of my money should be in red money what percentage of my money should be an green money if you're at or near retirement you should ask yourself if any of your money should be in red money can you afford to lose any of your retirement funds\nWould you rather take two steps forward and three steps back or just take one step at a time and never take a step back\nIf you'd like to learn how to step forward and never backward call for our safe money book and save money information kit that could change your financial life for the better again our number is eight four four three one two safe\nThat's eight four four three one two seven to three three there is no cost her obligation let me tell you what red money is good for the young and the rich the young of time on their side and can't afford to lose money in the hopes that they will make it back in the future\nThe rich can afford to at least lose some of their money and still live comfortably by rich I mean those people have adequate green money to guarantee they will always have the income they need and never outlive it and still have money left over for red money\nIf you're at or near retirement you should definitely be in the green which is money that cannot be lost to market declines\nMany people believe that all retirement money should be green money personally I think that makes a lotta sense\nMany people I work with regardless of age won a hundred percent green money because they know they can have upside market participation with out accepting any downside market risk isn't it time for you to go green with your retirement\nGive me a call at eight four four three one two safe who will show you how that is done not only can you have some upside growth linked to the markets without any downside market risk but you can get a first year bonus of up to ten percent on all of your money just for opening the account\nYou can lock in guaranteed growth of up to seven percent on the lifetime income account how about that no downside market risk a bonus and guaranteed growth on the lifetime income account of up to seven percent\nCalled eight four four three one two safe that's eight four four three one two seven to three three and we'll arrange to show you how it works\nOver the years what we've learned is that having green money provides an enormous benefit a tremendous sense of comfort and relief for the person making the decision think about it the worry goes away just think if you have read money losses and get upset probably the money should not have been in red money\nSo this makes it easy to decide you ask yourself this question if I were to lose some most or all of your money would you be upset if the answer is yes then your money should be in a green money account\nYou maybe ask yourself what green money options are there other than cash a check or savings account and bank certificates of deposit that's right\nCall me at eight four four three one two safe\nAnd asked specifically for our free safe money information kit and we'll show you some exciting options you learn about a green money option that as upside market potential is not exposed to market risk\nThat comes with a front bonuses of ten percent or more and has a minimum guaranteed income account growth of up to seven percent for up to Twenty years\nCalled eight four four three one two seven to three three right now and ask for our free safe money book with all this information\nI strongly believe that we face some very difficult bark at times in the future more politics national debt tremendous volatility corruption global economies\nAnd many more things for us to worry about the more time I spend with clients focusing on green money options the more my clients get to sleep at night without worrying stress hindsight is twenty twenty looking ahead and make
