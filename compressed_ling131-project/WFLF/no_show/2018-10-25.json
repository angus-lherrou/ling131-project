D act\nAnd that greatly increase the threshold proof that you must have to obtain your driver's license or your order order state ID card Florida was the first big states to adopt that real ID act I'm\nAnd basically when a state adopted the the race the identification documents the DMV of all constituents in that state and they must read prove who they are wow and how you do that is what they burst does it get Social Security card to produce of where you live\n... um which isn't a real big barrier for most of us I'm not you've had a name change through marriage or adoption you've got to have those legal documents as well\nAnd if any of those names don't match and he got a real problem you've got legal problems at that time or if those documents got burning fire flood or or never knew and created um people born and midwives 'em and things like uh uh\nThat's that's where it can get really complex ... we have a lot of ... that we get that will say baby boy or a baby girl ... and that's your legal name at that when even though you've used a different name your entire life or\nYour birth certificate has a different name than you've had on your school records your medical records or social Social Security card your driver's license now you have a big problem let me let me\nJust ask you know let me just remember where you were here [laughter] where are you were going but I'm so curious as to me about how your staff\nCan go back into\nDoing a record surge to come up with with proof for these documents if the standard is that high right um I Know so many people who have no idea where the first is no idea about um you know the changes and and and and what they um and so how did you have to do that\nIt's not just south it's volunteers we have more volunteers working then we have ... every every year hours combined over stuff um a lot of it goes credited with Jackie Dallas she's our lead attorney\nShe's dedicated her life to this if you wanted to someone who knows more about identification than me that would be hurt 'em\nAnd you toss and mental illness one to that mix as well where you don't you have no idea where you were born um and it can get into some very very heavy investigation that can take years to unravel these cases um we've had one and it wasn't that long ago where I really had no idea that he remembered his church\nHe just wasn't quite sure where was he thought he knew the city ... ... and so we got on Google Maps and then we started walking down the streets\nAnd he'd go Oh yes right around that corner and you go around that corner yes that red brick ... that's the truth that's where I was baptized ah all of a sudden you've got Baptists and records that that doesn't records that can lead the census records of census records you can find out who the parents are now a lot of this going to take an attorney to get these kind of documents um\nIt's it's an amazing case the CSI it really has a\nAnd and it's important uh we we have to have these thresholds approve\nOf it and really the primary mission of identity is to ... protect the\nIntegrity of identity ... the the secondary mission is to help us citizens and naturalized citizens who don't want to forget about them and even individuals that have a valid decent a valid green card they're here in this country legally mhm that document gets lost her stolen or or whatever uh will help them be obtained those documents and ...\nSo or is it just uh you're kind of talking about the ... the scope of of people that they need help um I ah I recently had to get a new driver's license\nUh and I did not I didn't have I\nI found the little card that was on my bass a net\nOr where they just said this is Joel and he's he's a handsome little boy a and but uh it didn't say that I I wrote that about two weeks ago but uh [laughter] but it's a but I could\nNot find that I actually had to go to get it you know male to me and all that stuff or what I wouldn't have given for some help and navigating that 'cause they took it took hours to figure out how to realize that do you do stuff uh for poor people just across the spectrum like anyone that need help with that stuff do you help with that we do we we\nWere designed to help the homeless we pivoted and more now to help the all the disadvantaged uh once again those with mental illness physical disability um Ninety nine percent of our clients are suffering from significant poverty in the primary reason for that is\nYou can't work not one of the biggest barriers of identification as a U.S this and you will never work another day in your life legally\nWhat does it keep you from being able to do I mean I I imagine you can't get a job yeah is that right ... employed can be legally employed and then I Can't get into bars\nAre those are the ones that are that are there other\n... um yeah I mean the primary one is employment I'm right behind that is education you might be able to get through K. through twelve is you know about the ... most don't\nYou will not go to college when I go to a trade school I'm going to have a real hard time with housing certainly can't run an apartment or buy a house um Cancun into most hotel rooms or in the most shelters um\nAccess a proper healthcare thank God we still have emergency rooms that's not proper healthcare you need to access to primary care doctor any access to insurance\nUm enter into a financial institution to get your own money out of your bank or to get that check deposit or cash\nOr there's this numerous often he's I mean there's there's crazy ones like you can't recycle cans and Orange County can't access the dump\nWe found a client that came down to three months ago she came to get her ID so she could claim her dead has been from the morgue wow I bet you understand why you need id yeah body never think about um it's just a it's a it's a problem that doesn't resonate until it's your problem\n... you know something occurs to me also Michael as we're talking about this is not only frustrating I'm On a practical level it's it's also frustrating on a personal level a because not having\nAny kind of recognition that you are a legitimate person that you have rights that you have a an identity that is publicly um um confirmed or affirmed\nUm I I imagine leads to a terrible sense of of isolation discouragement or maybe even depression certainly it because you start to feel insignificant\nThat and the problem is you wake up every day knowing that this is your reality and it will never change for the rest of your life not none of our clients have not tried to get their own identification crisis salt on their own\nAnd they just wake up for years um and they think it will never end and so they find this waste is called a dignity [noise]\nUm I think for the listeners out there the ... to get a better understanding and just the typical catch twenty two and once again these systems have to be in place um but to become real ID compliance renew your driver's license in idea it does require that ... ... ... valid\nDriver's license or id um and so now you're stuck between two different government agencies that are both require and our government agencies identification document\nAnd now it's you actually need as an advocate yeah um 'cause you're the one person that can't help yourself out of the situation 'cause you're the one person that has the identity crisis and it really helps with that ad because an attorney and knows what they're doing and and that's where I didn't see steps in Costa Rica once\nHe told me a story one time about a guy who was on the street who wanted his um want to get an ability because he didn't want to die anonymously on the street could you tell a story\nYeah Tony Bill bill Inslee um this is about a year into doing it in a thought by then you know is ... ... and clients um potted heard all the stories by now and it's still ask what you what you need this and\nUh it really threw me back um he just told me he needs he needs a good idea because he fears dying on the streets of Orlando as a John Doe\nAnd it just struck me as just hell foundational that is but also how it's reality none of us even think about ... and that's what's troubling him why he woke up first in the morning and got in line and stood in line for eight hours to get get his id wow um and we\nWe actually capture our very first video there and and he was in the video and uses such a happy happy man dealing with this kind of drama the very very thankful and he's really the highlight of the video and I'm In about a month later I tried to tried to contact them and hunt 'em down to just tell them thank you um 'cause it just resonate with so many people\nTo find that he he actually had died on the street or to um his body was thankfully identified with this idea that he got an identity and his body was flown to Chicago so he could be buried with the rest of the family ... ... it's just that it plays such a significant role in\nI don't know if you will have a couple of minutes left but uh but I Want to alert the our audience to something that's very moving and that is something that you'll instituted and that is a memorial service every December", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "25"}
