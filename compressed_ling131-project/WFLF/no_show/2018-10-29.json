recall anyway this is a ... of this has got to be I mean where do you know what the ruling around the table is subdue thousand so it was a Celtic fork out something thousand that's what we're going with it was I was it was caught by the X ray machine listen I don't care if it's still nothing but polymer plastic and you've made something even if it's a\nGhost gun that you make on your three D printer it's still shows up on the X ray machine\nBecause the X ray machine is not just looking for metal when you put things through an x-ray machine have you ever seen an x-ray machine when you know like when you come back and it's like well as my arm broken I don't know there's no metal and I can't see it\nStill shows you that he's ... of everything else and and you know being as we're going with it it's a ... there's metal in it yes yes I mean they are part you actually hold your hand or right you know the outside of it is is a polymer a criteria shell right but there's metal in there\nA real quick yeah I'm In a bill listens as well as your bill now I sorry I've got an inheritance dissent attacks I still got him got him as an enemy I have had you know his mom packed it because the rifles next next to the PGA with the crust off [laughter]\nYeah there you go there you go [laughter] there was it the or\nWas it the peanut butter with the with the nuts and it is that's the view\nOf the ... the only country like smooth with a country ah TSA subsidies contacted Maryland transportation authority police confiscated the gun interest of the man he told authorities he was aware of the fire was that his bag because his mother had packed a forum or listen if somebody says to you here's your bag\nGo to the airport or here's your bag you're okay I don't care so we said here's your bag and you're going to you spend the night across town at a you know you'd have whatever reason I'm checking my bag I Want to know that my toothbrushes in there or you know I don't have a butler\nI'm a bare minimum I'm going to at least ask the person did you pack this practice yeah you know I'm going to go over a list of things I may not you know the ... well depending on who it is I may not actually you know visually verified but I'm always going to question them with a few things run down the list yeah\nI Want to know where was he going\nHis mom thinks thought she needed to pack his rifle Chicago maybe means you can go to defend themselves [laughter] was if you leave in Baltimore and feel like you have the arm to go somewhere else it's not a good place 'cause Baltimore's like number two and number three up there on a murder hit capitals you know a city of laundry well may maybe mom is being very protective\nHe's leaving the house he needs to take his rifle well you don't want true and last\nWeekend was gun buyback weekend maybe he thought you know you can pick up a few extra bucks doing gun buyback where are you going you're going to New Jersey this weekend would they do gun buybacks for two hundred dollars for assault weapons so maybe he thought he was maybe she thought\nShe was helping them so this guy um\nThis guy is ah he's got more grown up to do and uh hopefully he gets another relative to pack his bags you know 'cause it's not it's not going to work it's not going to work so much it's not gonna work so much\nThe uh I guess he faces you know what is it it's it's up to ten years in federal ... two hundred thousand dollar fine\nI'm not sure if he was charged under a state or the or the the federal that she'd be the state or the other federal guidelines up there or it could give us some interesting numbers last week though the gun is be twenty of officers have caught at the Baltimore\nInternational airport there this year\nWhich is more than two dozen more than two dozen farms detective the airport a year ago so the you know they're doing doing aren't there but they're about on track for where they normally are\nStill be pales in comparison to Jacksonville she uh Atlanta hartfield at Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta international airport where stunning stunning I guess that means they're really pretty guns studying two hundred and forty five guns were detected last year\nA record setting three thousand nine hundred fifty seven firearms are discovering carry on bags and us airport checkpoints in two thousand Seventeen up nearly Seventeen percent from the previous year\nOf those nearly four thousand confiscated last year to standing eighty four percent were loaded as they should be right right but only thirty four point eight percent had around the chamber that oh that means there's fifty percent of the people that they're carrying guns that are loaded with out of a round and the chamber yeah\nYeah yeah how's it going to work out for folks let me let me let me tell you about that how we got an a ... fight with the post office this week you know what I give that to your next segment because it has to do with their airlines to get that at the top of the top of the next hour there\nJust I mean on one hand I'm kinda glad that three thousand nine hundred and fifty seven people\nWell I got a this week I actually was mailing something to Oh yes that's right your your your argument with the post office reminded me because it was it when both directions and went to the post office and the airlines okay a v\nI went to the post office so you were sending something err male I I was actually sent it in the priority ... okay because if you want it to you and it's just it's where I was barely paperwork and it's\nIt's cheaper to mail the paperwork at the post office than it is to send it certified return 'cause all that's included in the in the three day thing okay so it was it was a buck or two ... and they actually recommended it they said cheaper to do it this way\nOkay sure no problem and maps or mailing it's an eight and a half by eleven you know their their ... their priority shipping and ... with like three or four piece of paper mhm and she gets to her questions and she says is there anything in there\nUh your explosive lovers or anything in their liquid I'm no no no anything in their

Twenty one piece of minimum Twenty one piece of metal bats that the amount of time it's going to take from\nHolding your gun down by your side not even in your holster holding your gun down by your side of somebody with an edge weapon decides I'm going to put this edge into you and you just stand still they're going to put that hedge blade into you before you could bring your got up that's even when you're holding your gun down at your side knowing there's a guy with an idea\nBecause remember the guy with a knife all he has to decide as I'm doing this\nYou with the gun you have to decide you have to realize what he's doing first you have to react to what he's doing yeah and then you have to act on your reaction adhesion all was beach react you have two things you have to do and they have one and guess what Twenty one feed is about how long that takes to happen for one of those things to happen\nSo from what I see here is\nIs not cut and dry by any means I've heard the this guy shot him in cold blood I've heard yeah listen he had the right to shoot him but he shouldn't have\nA I've also heard this was this clean she or he was not arrested by the police department he was not arrested by the sheriff's office he was indicted bank later or you've heard the term I can indict a ham sandwich\nThe way an indictment works is reviewed go in front of a grand jury the state attorney the district attorney goes in front of the grand jury and they tell their one side of the story\nTo jurors that just you know just having a coming off the street they become the jury you're just like it'd be a jury pool for a trial just becomes a jury pool for a grand jury so this is very one sided they tell the judge they don't there's no judgment sorry they told the jury\nThat he should be indicted he should be charged with this and if you can convince ten years you mean nine or twelve laypeople jurors that they think it's wrong then you're indicted that's the that's the the body that decides to charge\nIf the jury grand jury says yes recharge than the state attorney has the authority to file the chargers\nSo an indictment is this is questionable enough yes that that law enforcement charge him the court has to decide correct is their warrant for a legal charge direct and remember these are not legal people this is why this is a lawyer\nPetitioning civilians and and giving them one sided story listen you don't get there that that actually it's clearly not a threat clearly on threat he's holding it down and his Simon guy by had done right there is no defense argument here of Twenty one feet there's no defense argument of this guy tense up\nWas I have no way I have no idea which way this is going to go I go to the point that we want to make when I talk about all of this is just because you think you were legally\nAllowed to shoot somebody doesn't mean you should shoot somebody and we've had this conversation before right if all it takes for you is to take your hands off the guy and take five or ten steps back\nAnd let that guy go I understand that your livelihood that's that's your property that's food out of your kids mouth and all of that uh but you want to have to be with us and you want to lose fifty bucks yeah or fifty thousand yeah yeah yeah yeah and and five years\nRight exactly right so you're will follow this slip all of this I

strategies you could potentially getting more money than if you wait until Seventy without waiting till seven rights\nAnd wouldn't you say this is true most of the time people think they have to wait till seven to ... with the ... just hell or most of the time they take it a lot sooner than Seventy and get more and ... how much more we're talking anywhere between a hundred\nTwo hundred three hundred thousand dollars more over their retirement lifetime just by using the strategies that is free money how would you like to have a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand dollars more than just

powerful right there on our ass power powerful right they're\nAll right what we look at it as we seek to educate and empower you every single Saturday right here okay that's what we're trying to do that is what we do we bring clarity and misinformation you know where some more misinformation is Chris where's that most people don't realize your Social Security is going to be taxed potentially\nA Yeah Yup just talk with somebody ah yesterday about that\nSo whenever you go to get it back out mhm they're actually potentially if you're in the rye thresholds on income they're going to tax yacht\nAnd it the racial Joe low so most people the majority of people I Would say are are going to have their Social Security tax\nNot only are all your other tax deferred accounts can be taxed as ordinary income but your Social Security can be tax to that is just keep comment that just doesn't seem right to me right it but there is a solution if you have enough tax free income make a drop you blow a threshold and boom your Social Security is not taxed anymore\nI said at one more time helped me understand what you're saying\nIf you had tax free sources of income and your retirement tax free source of income tax free right they're going to look at that and they're going to see you don't maybe hit the threshold to get your Social Security taxes also you can potentially drop your Social Security down for being attacks\nAre Sawyer says five enough tax free income coming in its gonna therefore lower my tax bracket and reportable income to the IRS and they're going to look and I said hey he's not here she's not meeting the threshold we're not going to tax or Social Security is that what you're saying\nBoom you can potentially drop the tax on that and not only going to get tax free from another source which is nice right yeah tax free from there but you're so security's irony tax now what would normal people do right now hey they don't have tax Rena parole and most people don't right now Chris what should I Do about that\nWell if you don't have ... one of the most powerful streams of income tax returns to pay taxes you need is you need to implement that right away\nAnd we hear about the national debt all the time I hear it probably every single day was it actually mean for us it means tax is potentially are going to have to cooperate ... absolutely right that's what that's what everybody's talking about we know that right so are all your accounts can be taxed when that goes up\nA lot act suffered yeah I mean a lot of people's their retirement accounts are going to be taxed most likely at a higher rate than they ever and\nThey're they're just not thinking about it it's going to happen\nDown the road so a lot of people are what are called rolling the dice ride the roller dies in the future on this tax deferred accounts when they go to use them in retirement uh-huh the taxes are going to be lower right yeah that was that thinking that I was a logical\nThat's basically it but what can they do what can they do a you know what can they do about the Social Security being decks\nWhat can they do about taxes going up on them in the future and having to pay that actual higher tax burden kicking the can down the road rolling the dice that hey maybe hopefully taxes won't go up but we know they are what can what can the everyday American do\nWell you can not reinvent the wheel or you could do something that you're older well you've been doing for decades right\nYou can use the same strategies that they've been doing\nApply them and do your retirement craze some tax free and can we do it every single weaker\nYep we see two thousand people here that we see about eight eight ten well shoot I see about eight people you see a bit about eight people or other partners she's about eight people a day were jammed packed we do this every day\nI think one of the things that people in the right this one is tragedies that got us featured in Forbes magazine was the tax free that we love to put into people's retirement right absolutely right that's\nWhat you can create ... it's never too late most who was like oh it's too late I'm I'm I'm a down the river

Fox News forty six year old Robert Bauer it's brought into court and Pittsburgh in a wheelchair the truck driver could face the death penalty\nIt's two components put together to make one much stronger\nAnd that was the idea behind fiber acts along with a few other things a longevity or being able to withstand the things we talked about earlier such as the water leaking into rotting fading all of these terrible things that the the insulation value all of these are protected and\nA vibrant allows or eliminates all of these processes from\nHappening and it also it sounds as though you can also put it into any shape that you need that gets custom orders and things like that all that's easily done\nAbsolutely ... can be custom fit it you're just about any opening a in your home\nSo when you do you order with renewable energies and you're not just getting something off the showroom floor\nNo you are not a what we do is we actually come out with a design consultant we look at your opening a lot of folks\nIn the industry think when they get ready to do windows there's really only one way to do it and that's what they have existing in their home so many options out there are so many ways to save money\nFrankly a lot of ways even spend more money to pay how beautiful you want to make your house I'm really good at that most people want to most people in the end of the day won't accomplish to things they want a product that's going to last forever and they want a house that looks like a brand new house at the same or address\nOkay All right yeah I I don't know where I think I Would like improving the aesthetic of my house well\nOne of the things that I've found in many folks that I talked to a in the window industry when I approached folks I asked him hey what is it that you're trying to achieve and when they talk about the aesthetics of the home and how it looks they go Dan I had some ... some folks that look I've\nSeen these windows in the house I've seen these big white clunky thick bones looking last week when I was I don't want that look and it really show our mission and on one of our goals uh ever knew why Anderson is we want the window and we designed the window to look like it actually came with a home\nMhm so it doesn't seem like it's out of place exactly if you're curious and if you're thinking about and this is something you might learn a little bit more about if you're in the same kind of mindset that I can get some information but also take advantage of the office going on right now to a if you are listening to the show renewal by ... and you can\nBut the first seven colors get twenty percent off windows doors and installation that's twenty percent off of everything so shut down the number\nEight eight eight for eight or nine for eight zero that has eight eight eight for eight four\nNine four eight zero eight eight eight or eight or nine for eight zero to get the information and hopefully get in on that special offer as well um now I Am looking at replacing\nIt all at once that the doors and windows I'm Kendra no banners and also do sliding glass doors I mean is there any ... like is there anything that in your typical home is there anything that you can tell\nMe the short answer is no way to answer right um\nWe want to we don't want you you want to be really careful when you are changing opening sizes are sometimes you can begin to get into structural members of the home so we can and larger make openings smaller if it's the right\nSituation okay but\nTo answer your question we can do just we can yes we can do just about anything you want with the custom or be a window\nOkay when they enter the kind of want me to the process let's say I give you a comic Dan\nI think I'm ready not exactly sure like what's the best way to get a quote to get your design team out luckily through the process All right\nSo the first step is you when to pick up the phone and you would call our national call center or our local call center within working\nHours and you would set up a free and home design consultant estimate right so that individual would then come out to your home they would take a look at and your name your dreams or whatever you were trying to create\nA most importantly provide you a solution so we would go we would measure the windows we would go or some design options with you mhm uh and then we would uh we have a a design a software that we carry with us in the home so you can actually see what the window looks like that you're having designed\nOh fantastic and so once we got a mystery yeah [laughter] makes a little bit of time in the home so uh be prepared been this way you can get exactly what you want you know it's what you want because you can see what it looks like and once we knew that uh we simply price it up for you right there in the home so okay\nSo now waiting no waning that's nice I mean you can get an idea of what you can be getting into\nYou often get excited about the process of you know possibly getting these new windows and new doors now let's say I you know I I Love the constitution I Love the estimate I Love the way everything looks and I say okay and let's go and do they understand let's make this happen in my home what is the next that\nWell the next step is how we're going to pay for it right [laughter] can't call mom anymore right [laughter] well my daughter would kill me but she uh she's still calls that so uh yeah so the\nNext set with me we have many different ways to to help fund the job or to provide them on the job\nSo you can do financing through us you can pay cash or credit card any of that is all done on the spot instant financing we have great promotions are going on uh at this time ... and I'm\nSo is there is quite easy or you don't have to have any money down in um [noise]\nAnd the process can keep going in the process can game going well tell me about the uh the teams tell me about your crew what what can we expect when it's time for renewal by Anderson to come into my home and actually put in these new windows\nAnd doors and sliding glass doors and everything else yes so the process a is\nReally smooth the we have a concierge service so what that means is once you place the order human\nContact him ... job is to hold your hand through every step of the process so once you place that order with us\nYou will then be contacted and they'll let you know the very next that\nAnd that next step would be a tech mission or any tech measure would come out and measure of behind the design consultant measure three times ... that's right [laughter] measure thirty times cut launch right\nSo we do that and I'm a lunch we are getting the confirmed measure much the windows are ordered they come in your installers show up so we don't use quote just installers are folks are a Anderson certified master installers\nAnd what that means is we have a scope or national pie and guidelines and then these windows have to be installed by okay I often tell people that windows there's two home improvement projects they're really scare me\nWhen I Am a roofing those too that if they're done incorrectly oh yeah they will rot your house to the ground\nGame yeah do we need to make sure that it's being done properly um obviously we have great building inspectors and codes in Florida that help us with that uh but believe it or not folks can still kind of a lotta corners and so if we make sure we do it right\nSo what would happen say if you know real renewable energy and it is in the home that insulation process has begun and you're taking out the windows and you do find some things structurally wrong\nWhen we hope that that doesn't happen we trying to spot it but you're you're exactly right it can happen in ... in this great state of Florida there's a lot of there's a lot of humidity and there's a lot of ways for water to get in these walls that we can't see\nI'm hoping that's where this concierge service comes at an animal have the answers for me\nTo show what would happen in that case um uh when we designed a window we priced out just the window in the cosmetic area within a couple of inches of the window but if we find out when we remove this window we've gotten mon infestation and all types of things going on in rotten all the things you\nJust pray that wouldn't be there yes um what we have to do then is we have to bring in a we have to uh refer you to a an al ... Khan tractor that would the specialized in structural damage\nAnd get that are taking care of some on it or to some degree we can handle a just depends on how severe it is\nAnd you've got people that you trust and you're ready and that you can pick up that phone and ...\nWe wouldn't we wouldn't put anybody anybody's home we didn't trust\nThat's comforting yes um let's say to go smoothly no bombs at all which we all hope of course with renewable Anderson about how long are you looking for this to be happening in your home and let's say if you're doing\nTen windows attention to swap out I mean is that you know a week's worth of open holes in your house or is it something that hopefully a lot smoother than what\nGen if it was our first job in Texas about eight months but uh since since we do ah you know two billion dollars a year we're pretty fast or this but we are good too yeah go\n... normally it would take a you can usually say about a day for every four windows and that's being conservative but we'd rather you know we'd rather a over promise a I mean a under promise rather than over promise\nYeah I I've been through a window I'm I've been through a window reinstall at a at a at a former house and I I Would say in that situation I it it it was like house was\nOpen there for a while and it's it's really company here that with her no by ... percent that's not really the case you guys got down to a science then you can get those windows in and out of doors in and out and feeling like safe in your home with your new energy efficient windows and all that good stuff\nBy call

so much for spending part of your day here with us if you or anything like me the eye why home improvements I'm all for it I just need to know more about it before I started diving and I'm here with Patrick\nMore from University of roof and contracting and one of the first memories I had when I moved to Florida in two thousand and four was flying in and seeing blue\nTarps everywhere\nAlmost every home and that's not a decorative thing\nIt's not a decorative bang and I had owned one home prior to that and it was new construction and never in my life that I ever thought\nAbout a roof over placing\nA root for why you need to replace a real for how do you know when it's time to replace a roof and to this day I still see everywhere is it\nBecause of where we live or is it because that's just a homeowner thing\nWell I mean Florida's twilight zone right I mean they were like our own little country down here but I mean all seriousness yeah I mean it's actually not uncommon I mean we are over a year now from a Hurricane Irma which uh you know cause a lot of damage I still\nHave a lot of neighbors getting nervous repair and replace from that\nOh yeah yeah and so a lot of people have for whatever reason have been putting off of replacing the roof or maybe they don't even know that their roof is leaking or you know there's all these different things but uh yeah it is not uncommon even still\nA year later or over a year later does is he a tarp on houses all over central Florida I mean they're everywhere I mean I live or Winter Park and I've got a couple of houses near me or the half tarps on them still you know\nAnd that's where the homes and realize that there is a problem for many there can be a slow leak there can be stuff going on and the rules that\nYou wouldn't know that there is a problem going on and I'm sure you see that a lot when you finally get into a home you're like you know at this has been happening for a really long time so what are some of the initial finds that your roof may need repairs and distress or needs complete replacing\nSure yeah that's a great that's a great question because\nA lot of people saw the obvious signs right so there's a big wet spot over their kitchen or they noticed in the bathroom you know the drywall is starting to bubble up or or may have been as extreme as actually we've been in homes where there's holes in the ceiling because so much water was coming into the house which is\nYou know a terrible terrible place to be and so those are the ones where people were very quickly I Need to get somebody here need to find out what's going on and that's the people that we've been\nHelping predominantly over the last you know year or so since Hurricane Irma a but what we're still finding even now a year and a year or so later after Irma is people are now just noticing they have water spots right you know or they just now notice the ceiling is bubbling up um\nMaybe they just looked in a corner of the room at their house they just never look at and they see yellow on the white drywall um and so we're going into homes now and there's often what happens is there's a leak in your roofing system and it might be so small and so slow\nThat for that water to penetrate through the roofing system and get to the actual visible places when your house can literally take this long\nShared a roof last night right yeah it had to take a long time for you to figure out hey something's wrong here right\nYeah and so there's so many people that are dealing with this with their roofs that they're calling us going to have a leak\nIn really what to do and really what's been happening is it's been leaking for a year or because they have shingles missing that they don't know about their torn shingles they have shingles that have lifted um where the water is driving up under the shingles which it's not so\nSo do wrong and that is really the greatest opportunity for water to get in your roofing system is underneath the shingles\nAfter that bond breaks where the shingle kinda tax down south yeah wants to win pops up it's really difficult for that to lay back down and stick back the way it was I always say it's kind of like a sticker right like if you take a um Hi my name is Patrick and you put that sticker on your shirt right if you take the sticker off\nThen you put it back on your shirt ill stick but not the same right by the fibers and things aren't\nIn the more you do it at some point it just doesn't stick at all and you're saying a shingle it's like that yeah so what happens is a shingles will lift during the storm er during the win whatever it is as a lift that tacky underneath the shingle it gets debris underneath it gets grass again you water it gets\nA leaves it gets a little debris underneath there and it's not gonna stick back so I was just that house not long ago in\nA house with totally normal and I got up on the roof in literally the whole back in the house I just went around with one finger at every single shingle lifted up\nSomeone looks fine it looked normal but when you actually got up there you could see that they're even compromise\nExactly and we find that a lot of universal refund contracting where people call us and they'll say\nI'm not missing anything goes I think my roof is fine it's just I Want to make sure and we go out and sure enough\nShingles are lifted there might be shingles torn in so don't just assume because it visually looks good that it's in good shape I mean there's a very good chance that\nThere could be something going on and especially if you noticed any yellow ing and your ceiling anything that looks like a water spot whether it looks like it to dry up or it looks like it's fresh give us a call and we'll come out and inspected and find out what's going on\nOh that's great okay so if you got to an inkling some of them are going on or you know it's been like so many years like how long can you expect a decent roof collapsed in Florida you know storms was standing\nIf I don't know the company I just say hey you know when you're asking talking to another company just ask them how long have they been in business [laughter] you know or have they been in business for since Hurricane Irma\nThat may say a little bit about what their intentions are and it doesn't mean that every roofing company that did is bad but you know just junior due diligence so that way if you do have an issue with the roof down the work down the road and the company stand behind the work and I can say without a doubt universal refund contracting can within twenty five years and we're not going anywhere\nAnd you have the warranty is to back it up exactly and you actually have like a next level kind of warrants yeah I'm a little more about that\nSo we are a platinum contractor I'm ... with Owens courting or which is a great company uh we install Owens Corning and certainty singles but specifically to Owens Corning where one of the few platinum contractors\nA preferred contractors in the ... area and um we are really proud of that because it means that we have been a certified and know how to specifically installed their roofing system\nAlong with that a certification huh hum and recognition violence Corning we can also offer warranties\nThat other companies can't offer their extended more real bust warranties homeowners can\nUm can take with their roofing system that other Owens courting of contractors can't offer they just can't is that comes with the platinum prefer exactly yup ... and there's only I'm a really a little bit more than a handful of those even in Orlando and the central Florida in Orlando area so it's a pretty big\nYeah that sounds like a big deal I like I like it better warranty pretty proud of it I think I'm gonna look\nYou know my a person in the eye and say you giving me the best possible risk to protect my home and my family and and everything and it I mean that's that's hugely important\n'cause every system comes with a standard warranty from Owens Corning um but this is kind of a step up so if you want added protection an added value for your roofing system we can offer that whereas other companies can't so you know that's a big value to a lot of people out there and uh it's something that we can offer that other people can't\nAs fantastic Patrick I'm sitting here at Patrick more from universal refund contracting and if you're thinking about\nNow it's time to get that roof looked at a time to get that work done uh right now the first seven colors during the show right now\nFifteen Percent off new roof installations and by calling you can also get priority placement on the list as well\nSo if you're thinking about it just going to make the call and get on the list now at four zero seven eight zero nine five one five six that's four zero seven\nEight zero nine fifty one if the sex again for zero seven eight zero nine five one five six so the process of replacing a river not been through it before it's like they just come and take the whole rip off [laughter] and\nBut you know everything's open air and you gotta wait through the it it's it's done in a very deliberate process that you kind of walking through that thirty thousand foot view shatter\nYeah so we are very process driven in terms of making sure that we're very efficient and very effective when we install your roof and we do not while your roof exposed anymore than it has to be with the ...\nHow about that like you have your plan is singles off and it's just the would share usually at the data pull everything off and then a day to put everything back on but it's Florida that evening thunderstorms going to come up with\nWhat's happening there we so we're really so I Will say this about our crews are cruiser like amateur meteorologist like little chemicals in their head or antennas and they just know when like a storm is going to come and they're really great about\nCovering the roof and typing in and we really never have any issues with that that violent but at the same time you know we're so efficient and effective that quite often most shingle roofs\nAn average shingle roof we can do in a day to day and a half\nAnd the main thing is that tear off process when we get down to the ... as soon as we get that would\nExposed and we re nail it if we need to buy code or um we get that under lame it down and that's really what protects the house so if you was to be a little sprinkler rush hour we are putting coverage but our guys are very efficient they're effective we're not running back and forth to the to the supply store going oh we forgot this forgot that everything's there\nThat we pull into dumped trailer or to the house you know it is loud noisy and dirty I mean it is what it is it true you want it to be right but it's going to happen quickly and efficiently and effectively for you and when we leave you're going to have a great roof and you're not even gonna know we were there\nAnd you have a great we want you to go along that actually that as well so if you're thinking about\nUh it's finally time I know there's that you've seen a lot of your neighbors having this done and you just want to have them come out and take a look I highly recommend contacting universal roofing contracting um when I had my roof re down a few years ago it was a beautiful process but\nI I Know so much more about it now like I Wish I Would have asked the question is if I Would have paid attention to you know what were they using and how were they applying it how long did it take like I've gotten such a great education on roofing from Patrick thank you so much but\nAside from the warranties and and and that you guys can want people to like an insurance bumps along the way what are like you're taught to take away is about what sets universal recent contracting apart from other rivers here in Florida\nI think what you just said is a perfect example mhm we think of ourselves as a consultant our job is to teach you what it takes to put the best roof on your home and not every roof is the same ... there are different shingles there's different systems there's different crews there's there's all these things involved in the process we're not a hard sale organization", "show_name": "no_show", "year":
