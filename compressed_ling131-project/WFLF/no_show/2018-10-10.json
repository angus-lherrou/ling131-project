New Guinea Monica Paul is she's a wonderful lady and I've been trying to get her on the program but it's very difficult for her to get a signal to get into our station here alive but we're going to find a solution somehow\nBut she uh over a pop a New Guinea you know she was falsely accused of practicing sorcery a and she was accused of doing witchcraft in her village and ... they said that was the cause of a man who died in her village now we on the outside we look at that and we ...\nWell there's no way you know sorcery is not what killed that man and so of course she's innocent\nBut to the people inside of monitors culture they've been having sorcery as something they believe in for tens of thousands of years and they still have that it's very unanimous that sorcery is what makes life or death happened sorcery is what creates calamity in a community and so\nTo the people who are trying to kill my friend Monica polish and papa New Guinea they believed was all surety that she was guilty of the murder\nOf a man by sorcery\nJust as strongly as half of the country believes that Brett Kavanaugh truly did assault that woman\nEven though we really don't have any cooperation for that we don't know but but they believe that in the heart he is truly guilty just as much as Monica polices accusers in ... New Guinea they are sure\nThey know I'm telling you they know that witchcraft is the thing that's what they believe in all their hearts they're all consensus their unanimously agree on that and they believe that when someone dies in the village of of illness they think it's caused because of some kind of which spell or something and so they look around for women if you cough wrong\nIf you look at them wrong and they'll just say hey you're which you did it\nAnd she's not a which he didn't do anything and she luckily he was able to flee her village and popping guinea and have safety there\nBut guess what is the integrity that makes the west what it is is that we have presumption of innocence if if Monica policy was not lucky to be able to skate that village they were not going to presume her innocence\nThey did not have a mechanism in culture to protect her innocence\nThey did not have a fair trial process they had you're guilty and the more people start pointing fingers for away the more it becomes even stronger conviction that she truly did kill this man when she did not\nSo from us on the outside we sit there and high and mighty and say\nHow primitive it is that they are so convinced she could do this\nBut what about in our country we're half the country has come fenced that because the man was confirmed was nominated by Trump and he's a Republican and he went to adjust to a school and he's a you know rich white conservative are all these other things that half the country thinks makes you look guilty\nTherefore he fits the profile of the which or the sexual assault her and therefore they make a ton of the nation\nAnd we cannot have that in our society because that's what we're what makes us any different from the society that that Monica Paul is\nAlmost died being accused of being a witch and many women like her are being burned alive in her home country\nBurned alive tortured because these people truly they're not just playing a game she tells me this she says they really truly believe that which spells of what caused the death of a child when it's really just an illness they haven't moved past that and there are cultural history\nAnd we aren't either if we don't protect the sacred miss of innocent until proven guilty and the protection of the individual against the mob passions of the collective\nWe are no different from that we may not do it as flagrantly as burning a which but will certainly throw you into a cage or ruin your life or make your social pariah and in some sense that's a living hell and its own way\nAnd we have to treasure what made the west great we because of two thousand years of Jesus influence on our legal structures on our story telling on the way we tell movies the way we share lessons and morals and values through the ages we protected\nThe sacredness of an interest in an innocent man accused\nBy a collective that's what Jesus was they said he's guilty and there was no presumption of innocence\nThey just were whipped up into passions of anger\nAnd aggression and they did not know what they were doing as a persecuted Jesus but because of his stories power that he was vindicated in that story wherever we share that story through history it undermines this idea that you can burn which is\nAnd that you can kill people without any kind of due process or anything of that sort so folks that what's that the state that is at the heart of what we're dealing with here this is everything\nAbout what our society is about if we don't get this right we're not going to get any of the

toys radio\nTime your host your neighbors have in the mouth another jam packed show it flies by so fast we pack in\nMore content and more heart in one hour than these shows that go three hours five days a week I think we really just we just are jam packed\nBecause there's so much going on folks and it's not on the headlines it's in our neighborhoods\nAnd I'm so glad ... is here with us in Studio ... she is an advocate on behalf of the woman we just heard from ... who is in prison for life in Tallahassee for a non violent crime folks I Want you to think about something as we wrap up\nIf you're ever called the jury and you see a person for a non violent behavior you have is you're right\nAs a jury member to render a moral judgment on the law and say not guilty so the next time you think about if you ever called the jury just look at the police report if there is no victim named in the police report that means you have a phony law means you have a law which is\nUnconstitutional which is immoral and his on\nChristian to continue to enforce in the founders created the jury system as a way for us to have the final say over the moral character of our government\nAnd that means when you each of you you're saying what can I Do well you can get involved by\nLooking up Evelyn ... was a case where they can do clemency dot com look up her name on Google stay in touch they're going to have a petition on change dot org so put that in your book mark changed that Oregon look for evidence name\nIt'll be popping up here shortly but when you are in the jury box you don't get to check out your moral a\nCharacter your moral character goes in there with the founders created the jury system as a means to check parental unjust laws\nAnd if it's I Can't think of more tyrannical\nLaw than putting somewhat mother away from her child and a mother away from her mother a for a life for a non violent crime we all have committed vices and addictions or we've all done things are hung out with a wrong group or sided with the wrong character but\nIn the end we have no right to use violence to solve that which only Arkansas through a conviction of a heart\nThat is the way of the world the way the world uses violence to solve problems that's what's Satan does Satan accuses you he condemns you and he throws you into the darkness of the belly of of a dungeon or a prison cell and treat you as an animal and says you're not worth it but Jesus Says you are worth\nAnd Jesus Says that you love your neighbor as yourself and that you show mercy\nNot sacrifice Jeter says go and learn what it means when God says I desire mercy not sacrifice that's what you take into your jury duty when you go to the jury duty you think about that\nThat God and Jesus are telling you mercy not sacrifice so when you look at that person I don't\nCare what the non violent offenses whether it's raw milk or possession of marijuana or some kind of conspiracy charge because someone is a ... girlfriend to somebody who was running drugs whatever it is if there is no victim leave 'em alone let them go and work with they measured as their neighbor ... get support\nYou help you if there is a drug addiction get help but don't use violence to solve something the only guy can solve\nThe moms thank you for being in the program any final thoughts\nThank you for inviting me and piece on everyone who I've been listening to us remember Evelyn ... um we I advocating for her for another chance\nGo till can do justice through clemency Amy Paul VI will be posting information about ... ... you can find information on Facebook as well\nAmy Kendall thank you very much\nTomorrow so I appreciate you just wonderful story and thank you for being a good neighbor and loving your neighbor and and never leaving people behind that's very very honorable view to do their thinking and some of these last couple of minutes doctor you I just want to ask you you know you're a physicist and you always joined us here for this final science segment it's been a heavy show but I Want to kind of give people\nIs there a physics component to why people are so stuck on these frequencies negativity how can we break free and create a positive residents of\nLove and joy eat any any insights\nBecause in general life is now the easy\nEspecially in the fall of the memories so you you know two great surveys the help the people who are the weak weeks there and I have no voice and also so the sauce to owner to create the service to\nUm to society and to humanity so I I'm ... so we need this kind of positive attitude\nRight you always talk about how our thoughts have their own frequency and I think if we get more people having a thought frequency of love and joy is going to create its own resident vibrations throughout the world right\nRight through positive I saw in the region the vibration creed you know a quarter a resonance I Do believe the voice and that's a salt from true from heart or move with the world wow\nThere's a there's a physicist and there's a physical component to what we're talking about it's not just it's not just face it science too that's at work here that we have our own if we speak was true conviction and we give a voice to the victim of people who of unjust laws and mob rule we can really resonate our way to a new world right\nYes and the things some shocking me the most use the human toll for the family of the victims\nThey basically spend spend is what is a since the eleven years old spent the Chinese hold and most of thousands of you know about toad for

hurricane Michael a dangerous category three storm it's now two hundred and fifty five miles south of Panama City Florida\nThe trick is I don't want you to settle for something [noise] um you know making sixty thousand bucks when you've made to sixty I'm this or\nBecause you've proven you're worth that over more than a fluke or you did it over a long period of time so we know that you have to\n...\nUnbelievable world class skills one is you have an in depth knowledge of luxury motor homes and uh how they work and what makes them tick and how you can help somebody in a situation and so on there okay that is a very narrow set of skills\nIt really has only one application in your city and you lost that job\nOkay the second thing we know is is that you know how to sell large ticket items to wealthy people\nAnd you're very good at it\nAnd so were you for instance to sell 'em Ashton Martin ...\nOr ...\nYou would be in a similar market\n... the downside is you don't know much about how they work you've never worked on them\nOr so the curve would be but you know how to communicate serve closed the sale handle the service after the sale how a high end luxury buyer wants to be treated and needs to be treated in order to create repeat business you are in ...\nBut in the end I think that's set of skills can be applied in other places would you agree\nOr I don't care if you're selling a hundred thousand dollar watches if you want to do that that's fine I put ... I just came I went to something we're wheels on it because you had somewhat wheels or the motor before slow your mechanically inclined as well so maybe that's it but you know I talked to a guy that was I saw in the crowd out of high on cars\nAnd he used to be in the um recruiting business she used to show a you know recruit people for jobs\nAnd it's a similar skill set because we were dealing with high on the executive placement and then he's dealing with a executive placement into cars and it it's the same set of people you're dealing with this thing they think the same way you know how to keep that kind of person moving unhappy\n[noise] and I think if you think if you broaden that out that why do people back off your pan out with your camera angle you'll see that and I think you're going to be fine so I wouldn't panic I'm\nThe only thing I could think of as if you can kind of some kind of brokerage situation where you're brokering high end luxury RVs um for two hundred and fifty grand you can fly in and out of a city every so often and make a deal happened\nAnd so I mean you could go straight to manufacture or to a dealer of the same Brenda fired you but it's been a much larger metropolitan area and sell to people\nAll over the nation and hand hold their hands in the process with a broker process or some gun I'm not sure where the leads come from not sure how that deal happens but when you're doing which sometimes two or three hundred thousand dollars airplane tickets are cheap\nAnd that makes the all happened you can't do that when you make and thirty five thousand but in your situation you there's a lot of stuff you can do um I mean you could be gone one night a week and jump around and really close some big deals you could sell a jets private jets\nThat's another thing that would fit perfectly in your scenario um and the job market's pretty hot right now because the economy is booming\nCouldn't give a jet away two years ago and now you

another car\n[laughter] she's gone well done well done so what happened to ... months ago they put you guys on this journey\nWell day that goes a little bit farther back then that emptied out of an eight hour we went through financial pave our foggy and we actually had about eighty thousand dollars and that at that time uh we never added to the debt and then we never really got intense about getting rid of it\nSo you know while I'm Sorry we took the clash ten years ago and flunked it we\nDidn't know okay we heard it during the last probably ... we had an and we paid off every maintaining very I thought\nOkay she knew what to do but you're just reached a point you got okay we got to knock this out now exactly sure what what caused that final conversation twelve months ago\nWe were making too much to be in a situation that we are in\nOkay so whose idea was this show who should we are going to turn up the heat you or tell\nMine [laughter]\nOK so temp she walks in and goes hey whereabouts all of a sudden get serious what'd you say\nI did that and like a great idea how to do and I think it just kinda clicked to that point I think one of the ... bring it up and she brought it up and they went at it\nCool what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is\nA thing you do get I think commitment focusing on the go and act they could just do whatever it takes to get rid of that\nGood for you guys wild Don how I feel\nVery\nFinely there don't you wish you'd done at five years ago\nLike Zach way that the hardest part of the whole thing is we kind of down a long time

debt free scream\nVery\n\nWell done and that is absolutely fabulous [noise]\nCases on Twitter says my home for two hundred thousand or a hundred and Fifteen or banks offering an opportunity to refinance and take cash out to pay off all our dead it'd be great to be out of debt or don't want to run this by your first well you wouldn't be out of that\nYou would have just move the debt over onto your house\nDumb idea\nEighty eight percent of the term that people take\nDebt con showered Asian loans out but don't change their habits and they're on their debts back up the only time I tell people to move that into a debt consolidation is to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure and you're not asking me about either one of those so I think your bank wants to see you deeply in debt does that's what banks do\nSo well is when a bank says\nHey I had a great idea what they're really saying is hey I can make some money off of you\nI mean really it's like playing with a skunk and wondering why you got sprayed seriously it's not it's not a pet it's a skunk so don't pet it\nOkay do you own a home now no okay I'm the first thing I Would do is I Would not buy a home until I was debt free and had my merchants who phoned in place\nSo that means you need to write a check today and pay off your car and your credit card and cut up your stupid credit card [laughter] okay okay now your debt free right okay yeah okay and that was foreign to\nGet so six thousand so I'm Down to twenty four thousand right yeah okay and your land is paid off and it's worth sixty about fifty\nAbout fifty and uh we need sixty so you need ten thousand that's where you're getting your twenty percent I see what you're doing okay uh well we're going to put fourteen thousand in the emergency fund\nComplicate it so now you have an emergency fund you put ten thousand with the land\nYou get a construction alone with the take out one one apartment to take out in your budget cannot exceed or a three hundred thousand dollar value that does not mean a house\nThat you spend three hundred thousand on the house okay the value of the total package can't be more than three hundred\nDoes that make sense I don't so that means you're building a two hundred and forty thousand dollar house maximum\nOkay\nBecause the packages were three hundred and that gives you the twenty percent down maybe if you spend three hundred on the house now you're at three sixty\nAnd you don't have twenty percent down anymore huh OK you see how that works\nSo you're getting trucks and loan that is tied to your new mortgage that is your final mortgage good called your permanent mortgage that's the mortgage that takes out your construction loan and so you're construction lender will require a take out letter\nWhere you're for or your permanent mortgages already approved sometimes you can just package all that together and with increasing interest rates are probably would package it altogether checked Churchill mortgage they can probably help you with that and you go in lock in your interest rate on your permanent mortgage\nBecause he's a mortgage ... picking up and a good idea to lock 'em in when you can by the way if you haven't ... and you got a higher interest rate loans folks this would be the time to college or Joe mortgage or it is taking up\nAnd I would lock in rates if you're in the middle of a deal right now walk your rights in\nAnd I probably would lock 'em in like twenty minutes ago like four days ago probably would lock them improve but we are in a rising interest rate environment\nNothing to panic about but it is going up and so you might as well take advantage of the lowest possible ray you can get your hands on for refinanced were for buying or in her case for building and um\nThat's by walking in current rage 'cause I don't think you're going to see rage come back down dramatically um you know in in in the foreseeable future in the next say six to twelve much they're probably going to go up\nAnd so given that environment um you don't have to be an economist to figure this out it's fairly easy to look at the trends um then then I'm going to walk everything in as fast as I can get in touch with Churchill mortgage the day and get this done Barbara is weather's barbers in Salt Lake City Hi Barbara how are you\nHey babe during gray area doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo we are a month and a half away from being and gotten a baby step too good and um yeah you know I don't want to live that momentum that we've had it\nGoing toward that mhm and and going into baby step three there's like a few curve ball they pay 'em that are happening so we want to get the three ... my husband is also wanting to go back into school can get a bachelor's they get a better paying job that would\nBe a baby step three\nOkay but that's my question is you know we also want to start a family but we have competitors like baby find because we want to cash flow that\nWhen you have a baby on the way you will build up a baby fund\nNo need to do it but when it\nOkay to build up the emergency fund for\nMerges you find that you first for you do anything and then you start doing other life goals I wouldn't worry about saving for a baby you don't really need to save a bunch of money for a baby\nUm if you got ... got health insurance you know and you should have health insurance and um you know you've got your emergency found in place and you know you'll be able to budget the diapers and believe me you'll work it out um but yeah you don't really need an extra baby savings account unless you just want to save up enough to cover whatever normal labor and delivery is out of pocket\nYeah that would be it would be around a I think we pay like Fifteen hundred dollars toward yeah labor and delivery\nNo matter how that's easy enough to do during that's easy enough to do during the non much okay\nYeah so you can just do that whenever that happens and whenever babies on the way you can just say well we're now we're saving for that and and and you know anything you want to do that to an upgrade them move on whatever comes after the emergency fund 'cause it's not an emergency I'm going back to goes on emergency\nThis Fifteen hundred for the baby not even an emergency you can cover it it's a luxury to have that as extra savings of baby came on the way writes\nBaby got here before you had to say you'll be All right\nOkay yeah you know and they're not curve balls are things that happened after baby step three All right\nThanks for the call appreciate you joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five cliff is with us in Chapel Hill North Carolina Hi cliff our you\nDay and I can't complain hair you'd make it out but they're better than I deserve\nAnd I hope well first off I Want to thank you for what you help me and my wife to help pay off five thousand dollars for the debt cool\nYeah are you sir and a question for you in a way to find out and play 'em right now we have about thirty thousand dollar down and own a house we got to land\nWe um we get land to build our own and also we're in an area that we really want to live and there are a lot of family around here great\nYes sir I can hear how much help and we're on with our income ... contract that we've been talking the recommended that you are you a loan and you're not a fan of\nAbsolutely not no I Would never do your do you know\nIt's a it's a subsidized loan and if you ever sold the house or go to refinance the loan at any point you're going to pay back all the subsidy and in some\nYou can get really trapped in these things and they're nasty bad no I never would do a USDA long I have had more problems with that loan working with people that are in trouble than any other loan I've dealt with\nWow so wow now stay away flat as far as how much how you can afford and we always say I'm you know put your down payment whatever that is the end of the formula right and then the loan amount on a Fifteen year\nFixed rate loan which today is about five percent interest\nLoan amount on a Fifteen year fixed rate loan\nIs\nNo more the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay and that put you right where you want to be shown like you've done some really good stuff open\nNow I mean you can really do it I mean you you've you've gotten out of debt you build your emergency fund you're doing really smart things so yeah I just get you a ...\nThe least expensive alone between F.

of learning about this stuff\nOr for the first time I'm I'm more over the last year or two\nUh I I always thought windmills or just solar in general those giant wind farms are we're kind of gimmicky uh and then you start reading about these giant giant wind turbines that can power six thousand homes just from one giant fans now um and you realize that it's that it's uh there's there's a future to it and then you know you find out like you said last\nSegment that China's building two a day yeah because they've got a bunch of a bunch of wind over there uh and uh and then you're like well maybe we gotta get get the word out on\nThe ... the one you're referring to um was built by Siemens ... that's a that's a that's a local hey that's you know as hometown right right that's right\nThey built the first ever commercial offshore wind turbine Thirty years ago or so they were they were\nWay out I'm I'm way out in front of everybody else um and the and the one you said a talked about the latest model um has Seventy five meter wage I'm I'm producing six megawatts I have no idea what that is\nBut it's enough to empower to power six thousand homes which is yeah I mean that's a that's not one ... one when term I I mean it's just amazing\nYeah it really is also that's the first time I ever put it together that a ... a megawatt must be how much it takes to power one thousand homes that's interesting\nOh there you go it's a ... that's why you're the site has had the right yeah um\nAh I have a bumper sticker on my car that I'm trying to get the word out and she says I break for wind [laughter]\nAnd uh I've gotten some looks [laughter] so I think people are really really paying attention to that so uh so that's so that's when a and\nAnd really the only two the two main gripes I've seen against that is a is is one you know is it is a a cost benefit ratio and I and I believe\nA that's being played out to show that yeah there is that these people are are trying to get renewable energy but they're they're they are for profit companies that that nobody is just going to just throw their money down a well um\nAnd uh and and uh and so there's there's a way to make money doing this um and then really the only gripes I saw a besides that were that are they're allowed a but most of them are out in ... off you know the coastline uh and then also the birds fly in\n... the misguided when you when we get to objectors to this ... this whole development of renewable energy\n[noise] there are there are fundamentalist\nEven a even ... [laughter] so [laughter] so you use that term [laughter] and my brother in\nLaw who or he would only go see I don't have legs out but there are fundamentalists environmentalists who say we shouldn't ever use a wind turbines because they ...\nYeah and I and I feel like it's a it's just kind of it's kind of a a zoom out and uh and force for the trees type of thing\nNow if someone said I Want you to kill this bird right now in front of me I'd be like no end um whenever hanging out again I Know this year you're sick but ah when you're talking about a saving\nI'm saving a lot of a long term savings saving a lot of teachers that would otherwise just destroy birds homes anyways yeah it's it's different\nI guess well as for and producing energy in a way that does not increase the chances\nOf as a uh does not increase the cost and therefore uh make those who are the poorest\nA not a be able to and not for be able to afford energy or there's all kinds of humane benefits that if a if a if a few birds have to have to be the sacrificial lambs yeah or or for um\nThose are vulnerable and the human population that might be not a bad trade\nYeah and I I'm trying to figure out is there something that a specific draw of or birds or if you just build a really tall building out in the middle of nowhere with a bird flying to that I mean I don't think show there was was there they are like I I'm Out in the country I'm going to close my eyes for a minute watch this Brent and then they fly like\nHow do they I mean I don't it's still it's still a thing they have to fly into so I'm not I'm not sure why they're especially dangerous to\n... I think there are any birds or just a they don't notice there's\nYou know they fly into playing for crying out loud yeah yeah I just ask solely sell them and I know I'm just saying that's a that's the path exactly\nRight that's that was that was just a a jet jet fuel powered turbines and that that that flew into smaller\nAnd there's another a bit of information at our research department are cooked up for us here the largest wind turbine in the world is located in Hawaii and it stands twenty story\nThese tall and has blades the length of a football field wow so ... if you if you you know we're a bird in your fly and Tony stories and didn't notice something like that you know maybe this is ...\nYeah and I know I guess I guess that is I guess that's true or on the other hand if you're that high and there's one poll sticking out [laughter]\nIt's like ... ... really bad luck Bert famously bad luck or um uh so that's most of the uh most of the deal with with wind power um\nHydroelectric a electric that's where there's an hour and there are hydro electric I did not realize and maybe I should have known this because there's a bunch of famous dams the Hoover Dam or other dams or whose names I I'm just going to I Know but I'm going to choose not to say a good thing about twenty damage right now [laughter] beaver dam\nOr their their their damn Yankees [laughter] straight for the most famous than the\nUh the the deal with a hydro electric energy is is it powers a lot more than I realized that I read this dad that that the mom the research department at the G ... ten percent of of a U.S energy electricity comes from I drew a lecture power a which is which is\nA lot and I I I'm surprised by that purely because you would think just from a from a energy efficiency standpoint you I Would not have guessed you could generate", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "10"}
