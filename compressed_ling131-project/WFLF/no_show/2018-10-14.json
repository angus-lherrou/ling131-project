having watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps establish who's telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere wasn't a pattern this is amazing\nShe ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless in my attempt to explain this the\nFirst story that was Ron about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it and so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from both the Ford or be from Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nWas her name sweat Nick\nI mean this is a flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people something happen just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it\nYou know we needed to show a pattern

civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quoted came across years ago and maybe even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility for Barbara ... and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal after some grudging barbarism again just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre so the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society is always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a society\nHarm originally ... were trending one where we're not in the middle of it are turning towards the middle ear barbarism off the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working\nUh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you know there was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all good and fine and dandy one more day then\nI think it was before the

Democrats at at that time their basic uh issue was a labor laws and a win\nFor what purpose but my point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in the anti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government\nThey've

except your apology for being wrong welcome to the program Sally and then we do have done it will get to him in a minute but tell us what on your mind today\nWell I thank you so much for having me on the show I really appreciate the chance to talk to people about these amendments you know changing a state constitution isn't something she take lightly this this is important and we should respect the process and we should not let something like a what's called the constitution relation commission I'm to the ...\nThe two corrupt the process and ... if you have not taken the time to read these amendments don't vote for them to just say no to everything had senator\nTold me that the other day don't vote no on all of them\nVote no on all of them and you know I'm not totally against all of them know that the language is very tricky they go out there and put all this stuff out there at once and with the intention to confuse the language that they put on the balance is very misleading you're only depending on what they put on the ballot you're in trouble and I'd rather you just don't know all of them if if you're not going to take some time\nI'm In the other part you know we've got ... they started out was Thirteen amendments amendment eight was removed and there's three other ones being challenged still today now out of these um Thirteen amendments\nOne through five were true citizen initiatives or legislative initiatives and that's where they could only put one item on the amendment which is what it should be that's right but then you go six through the Thirteen were all come up ... were designed by the constitution religion commission\nAnd they can put multiple issues on\nLate but multiple in almost every one of those sounds multiple\nThere I think twelve is the only one that doesn't have multiple or what have you on a call about the greyhound racing\nAnd you also can see you when you go through the various things with the um [noise]\nUh see are the ones you say OK somebody on this board the people who are on this commission obviously had certain issues like the victims rights was probably somebody there who really had an issue something happened to them\nAnd you can just kind of see how they go into this stuff and it's like it wasn't really a um I'm an issue for everybody in the state of what is it something specific to somebody on that commission one it's just like greyhound racing grant dog racing really an issue until the majority of people in Florida\nAnd I have to say that some people think I'm funny or whatever\nThe Florida State constitutions starts with we the people of the state of Florida it does not say we've had dogs all the state of Florida animals do not belong on the state constitution do not insult and trash our constitution voting for the rights of dogs which is what she was Thirteen is all about is strictly to protect ...\nI'm surprised they didn't put in there we the hall with all the fat these politicians in Port put into our laws I said that the ... but I Hope that there are those of you out there that have questions about this and I hope you'll call him\nAnd I had people say John I tried to call but it couldn't get him out Sherry who is more faithful listener got angry at me the other day\nBut my producers to a plate glass window that I can barely see and he can see me and he's telling me\nOn my

usual um go quote from the forty five ... to go for a while back um Erica\nUh forgot what the official title that is that good share pressured across and Hillary has really sure but\nAh she she's acting like a well handle communist walks again\nOh in the area of a ... a goal number forty two of the forty five goals which is create the impression that by a little chat insurrection or a legitimate voter aspects of the American tradition FedEx renewed\nAnd ... and special interest groups you could use\nA United for quote unquote to show economic political or social problems or wants to get him or his proven herself\nOr not to be sure promoter now sophisticated everybody's favorite of all of the twenty first century shoes ... responding to the old old the instruction\nOf ... structured is probably the two years old\nCreate the impression that violence and ensure a ... ... aspects of American tradition now would that off my chair I quite agree with your gift uh there are every attempt to change the law as we know what\nAre you should have one topic per day up\nTo the backside of church and that includes over ... the legislation on the first time a that include show should or should have been ... that are clued ballot revision commission of the worst ... everybody in the absence of\nOh well we'll we'll go to your calls and pick your back here all my calls\nA ... everybody we get a better idea for our legislators are\nSo if they are voting for one topic legislation at a time\nYou know something a Donny and Sally\nOf people have a tendency to be food and deceived by the sweet smelling perfume platitudes that fall from the lips of a\nProfessional politicians\nAnd down deep inside and beyond the facade oftentimes what you have is a fake and a fraud and a phoney\nAnd whatever they do ultimately is something that will benefit number one and that's why they go in there with a moderate income and when they leave their multimillionaires Republicans and Democrats and we cannot afford any longer to be deceived\nBy these politicians that are really a fake somebody says well how do you know John look at what they've done in the past Charlie Rhys and noted newspaper columnist said that one time and one of his editorial pages\nLook at what they've done in the past to get a better idea of what they will do in the future and you know they also said the communist rules revolution and that is to relax the borders and bring people in here from foreign countries for the purpose of them taking away the guns and those are law abiding citizens and um\nThat's where we live today Sally would you like to respond to in the number to call the other ways for oh seven nine one six five four zero zero ... Jones of North Carolina\nJust to follow up in the U.S are citizen initiatives and the ones the the state legislature they can only have one item on these amendments it's the CRC the constitution releasing commission\nThat's allowed to go out there and putting multiple things together and they've done that all over the place I mean amendment sevens outrageous because they talk about trying to help first responders\nAnd this and everybody would think oh yeah well I Want to help the first responders but then they have all these changes are making the education to the state college taking taking over the community colleges at the state level\nAll this other garbage that's in there that has nothing to do with first responders that the only thing with a first responder is that they were going to waive education fees and that type of thing so um\nSo that the it's it's a totally misleading it's we can't most of the ones with the constitution revision committed hum mission has multiple items Amish should all be I'm I'm taking a um voted no\nAnd then the same on that is um I got a stress ... amendment twelve is the only one from the constitution revision commission that I think has any merit and I will probably vote for that one\nBecause it's limiting the rights of the lobbying and everything else people who are in office when they leave office right now there's a two year ban that they cannot become a lobbyist however um uh if you do amendment twelve it'll make it six years instead and it does a lot to clean up the corruption of that side of it\nUm and I listen to quite a bit on that one so twelve is the only one sixth through Thirteen twelve is the only one I Would consider voting for number eight was removed to lead the court removed it because they had too many misleading things on it\nThe um\nWhat you're going to vote for what you have to learn to live with it and I would say that it's if you vote for Democratic Party they've got a platform like this don't believe in the things that we can believe in take away your freedom\nIs ... ... foot Democrat Party and they did and I only hear nobody mouthful about it if you vote for who learn to live with it that's my comment is John\n... and as always Joe I appreciate it God Bless you and give all of those in the Tar Heel state that love the lord my regards\n... John God Bless you got about ... to ...\nThank God Bless you anything you want to say before I go to my next\n... yeah well you know unfortunately some ... liberals on both sides I mean the Democrats have been much more successful and running as Republicans say you really gotta be careful what you're looking for out there and I find it so interesting that the liberals that say they're all against war and you know make love not beef whatever\nUh they're the ones that are out there causing all the violence is just the hypocrisy is unbelievable and yet you know you can talk to them and they just seen as they act like it's nothing I don't know\nI'm Wondering I'm actually an audience how many of you've ever heard of salt on Lenski now calling in and tell me if you've heard of him what his plan is and if you haven't call in because I Need to tell you because this is the playbook which is being used to deceive Andrew divide this country and if we only knew the plan we wouldn't be so easily misled Robert in Orlando\nYou're on the John but we're both show the number to call this ... seven nine one's six five four zero zero if you want to know about the amendments that\nYou're going to have an opportunity to vote on and you want to know the truth behind these amendments you need to call in because some are good summer questionable some may not be good at all Robert welcome to the program\nWriter John I'm doing All right how about you and I do so in a while since you are home made\nA ... a day\nOr get my question is is that the department of education all rise of that\nWell he's on math and and then we have the department of education at the faint lemme lemme with the federal level I\nGot ... percent [laughter] now the\nPresident appoints the person who's in charge of the nuns was Mrs devotes and she said she was very much opposed to uh\nUh this new program a out called um Common Core which I Am and grateful for but the truth is in the federal government has by edict as a result of states that take federal aid\nThey have literally taking control even at the local schools and that's one reason the Bible has been removed because they took the federal aid and they said with the federal aid comes federal control\nAnd their past that there's no way that we can get rid of that department\nYes there is the the the right to amend the constitution which was\nPut in as a safeguard and it's not easy to do and the founders did that on purpose it takes a ah what is it Seventy five or eighty percent of the Congress to vote for that and then it goes to the people the states have to vote for it then it comes back the president has to uh except that he has nothing to do with it\nFrom beginning to end but you want to broaden that all the\nYeah well I mean education is really an interesting thing there's nothing in the constitution that says you have to have a department of education that's been the way the system's been manipulated and it's like widely governmental agency that's not elected by the people and they shouldn't even exist now the federal level it's really in my own opinions it's unconstitutional\nBecause it's not deemed as part of the constitution it should\nBe this this is how it begins in\nThe\nPhrase allergy which is in the constitution and especially in the preamble a listen carefully we the people in the United states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice ensure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense in here it is it's called the elastic pause\nAnd promote the general welfare to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the United states of America\nThomas Jefferson ... alluded to this when he said this clause is strictly concerning what the constitution allows the federal government to deal with\nAnd those were enumerated in the constitution everything else is left up to the states there's nothing in the constitution that allows the federal government under the elastic calls to get one dime to education or one dime to Social Security\nAnd in fact Roosevelt was wild with his socialistic programs and he tried to introduce and he was the first president to start stocking the Supreme Court this is why there was so much opposition to cover and all\nHe said he was a strict constitutional is he believed in original intent and they were scared to death a lot of their liberal philosophy would be reversed and he would be all and therefore light\nAnd I hope he is as strong in that position as he said he is whether or not that is true only time will tell but you're right the federal government has no authority in the constitution to get involved in anything like education or any kind of welfare program is simply not there\nAnd the other part of it too is to understand education that that would education really means and in the society you want that local control because you want to have true competition in it too it makes the the whole education system stronger when different areas will do things differently and and promote education\nBut when you have a federal government keeps ... you know leaving the carrot in front of the states to do this and we'll give you money that's not the role of the federal government should not they should have nothing absolutely nothing to do with education you know ... ...\n... oh you can say as much as you want Robert okay Rebecca for getting out during the care the problem with America right now is the education is that a dry ...\nCredited as our our power says are looking at that I understand it need to look at the border of fall for that very quickly remain to get a a socialistic ... out of the education system they ought to walk ... I guess our country\nYou know some things are probably nice\nIt's been going on for years Robert and we have been so do do do double cross mother twisting of the constitution that our young people today know absolutely nothing about it civics of course has been removed on purpose\nIn fact the one of the goals of the communist was to put into the educational system something that would promote communism and never exposed for what it is\nYou ... I asked my ...\nAs the other day and I have mostly blacks in my school Ninety five percent\nOr blacks and this wouldn't be any different if they were white\nI said how many have you ever heard of Adolf Hitler now here is the number one racist in our day in time that ever live and most of them never heard of who this man was\nNow why because they're not it's not taught in our schools history are biblical relationship with why they came to America to begin with is gone\nI teach my first graders Robert\nThe questions that are asked for everyone who comes into this country as a person who's not legalized citizen\nI give them the test so that they know I told him I said if you're a citizen you need to know what others who want to become citizens most know yourself otherwise you have no appreciation for this country\nAnd that's because they've never been taught\nWhat America is all about and what wonderful freedoms gone has granted to us in the right of the people we the people not we've the king but I got to tell you you are one out of a hundred that would ever say before we build the wall we know we need to remove the government's control of both our colleges\nAnd our school because that's why young people today are turning against America\nWhich goes to the question about solving ski\n[laughter] yes Robert are you still there\nI I I just had a A R K but guys that are now look back if we don't get granted their primary education I mean in this country back\nWell you know the the really ground grew in strength with a fellow by the name of Jimmy Carter Baptist Bible school teacher who they said was that was a misnomer\nAnd Jimmy Carter gave to them the department of education I think it was ten billion a year to begin with never educated the first child\nThen Jane Ronald Reagan and said he was going to do away with the department of education if elected and he was elected but he didn't get hit in the department of education it needs to go it needs to be dismantled Twenty years ago\n... absolutely right ... ... when the communist said you're never destroy America found out that this is just what they were talking about\nKhrushchev said you're all in my hands like an override grapefruit\nYou turn the generation that gets their own country you know so we're not we got to get around she's gone already\nRobert I got to ask you a question when you go to come by and let me introduce you to my students\nA two day\nYou got it now let me ask you what branch you were in the services that right\nYes sir what branch\nMarine Corps I Want to thank you for your service in the United States Marine corps and let me hasten to say that I was in the United States Navy my captain was a I was on the USS Constitution\nThe art of communication I'll tell you Robert I'm going to do a program on how to get involved and what to do because that's a good question and I wish I had more time but I don't but I think you Robert don't be a stranger\nI have a good night\nGod Bless you ought to know coy than John and winter spring drawn to John but we're both show there are two lines that are open forum so I've been on one sick or zero zero and Sally is my guest and since they put the camera on her only have one camera I tried to put it on I don't know if it worked or not but Scott welcome to the program\nAs they didn't put the camera and eat this or not I can't do that [laughter] yeah thanks for taking my call there's something that I picked up a book or tone it FAU because I went to five out of the\nConstitutional revisiting commission hearings are Panama City to book where it's um in twenty Seventeen a spring and summer plus semi own cost representing only myself\nBut I ran into these two characters Mr Platt and Mr docks well and they were at the hearing it's an open form out here and you can see what you want for two minutes [laughter] yeah\nThey propose this proposed amendment to the constitution in life options for terminally ill Florida adult patients amendment\nBallot language this amendment establishes blah blah blah blah blah for terminally ill patients with Florida whereas residency having the capacity to make their own voluntary decisions to be\nPrescribed an aid and dying medication by their physicians if certain conditions are met\nThis fortunately was sandbag but CRC so they did something right I mean that's the way it used to read in California this is the former California penal code or every person who deliberately aids or advisor encourages another to commit suicide\nIs guilty of a felony that section for one however Jerry Brown find something in the long twenty Fifteen now instituted aid and dying and their state\nThan our Congress last year the house passed a resolution eighty which I think it's a very wise little piece of uh the proclamation not really a law per se but they expressed a sense of the Congress that assisted suicide sometimes referred to his death with dignity\nPuts everyone including those ... most vulnerable at risk of deadly harm\nYou know so we stopped a physician's assistant suicide this time around good for you well I helped\nA little tiny bit I I I challenged these two fellows later after the hearing to debate anywhere they want it in the whole state of Florida from Pensacola to Key West and they declined\nTo tell you something Scott the reason Jerry Brown changed that law on suicide he knows when they pay their taxes and go through the legal loopholes in California a good number of those people feel the only escape is to kill themselves or find a way to move out\nYes frivolous for well he he pulled it off it on a midnight midnight oil special session back then it was couched in some other legislation and slip through the California voters but clearly what's happening in Oregon\nWhich has had physicians assisted suicide since Nineteen Ninety six with the help of the hemlock society of people that I consider bloodthirsty vampires [laughter] so\n[laughter] you got to do\nThat I'm Sorry it I mean that's just that's at some things are wrong well emotional a disfigurement so some of those folks and they ended up working it out well for them in Oregon and Ninety six but since Oregon's physicians assistants", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "14"}
