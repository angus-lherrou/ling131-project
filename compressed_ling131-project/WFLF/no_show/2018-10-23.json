{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "Patrick thank you so much but aside from the warranties and and and you guys can want people to like an insurance bumps along the way what are like you're taught to takeaways about what sets universal recent contracting apart from other rivers here in Florida\nI think what you just said is a perfect example mhm we think of ourselves as a consultant our job is to teach you what it takes to put the best route on your home that not every roof is the same ... there are different shingles there's different systems there's different crews there's there's all these things involved in the process\nWe're not a hard sale organization and we're not going to beat you up over the head rock and make you sign a piece of paper the second I Walk up to your door when I'm walking through the process we're going to explain to you why we're better and why the system in the products we use are better than other companies\nAnd so at the end of the day we want you to want us because we definitely want your business as well and we're going to earn it so um that's the biggest thing is ask questions and the other thing too I took a toll customers out their potential homeowners customers\nIs when you're looking at your roof find out if you're comparing apples to apples to apples to oranges\nThere's a lot of people think that a roof the roof and so you know there are certain cars if you if you buy one car versus another car\nAnd you know one car you know ... there's a difference in a car to truck right they're not\nApples apples there's different parts to it and so they do kind of the same thing but they performed differently mhm and so it's the same thing with roofing there is a big difference in materials\nThere is a big difference in labor or there's a big difference and experience and especially warranty after you know what you're buying and don't just assume it's the same and if anything give us a chance to come out and explain the differences so you can make an informed decision\nOkay All right I like all of that um but when it comes to roof damage which does more damage storms or squirrels\n[laughter] it's funny you know the girls can do some damage I Know it was girls can do the damage real damage Iowa or pesky situation where I I was in my office at home not too long ago and I heard\nLike a water dripping into the roof and I was like okay my ... not that old oh what's going on here\nAnd I called my my company back out there like a squirrel is eating the yourself ... ... it happens all the time I mean you must see some pretty incredible\nThings aren't as crazy I just went to the house had a a whole family of um of raccoons living in their ... and um I we see squirrels chew stuff all the time\nUh it's crazy I mean it you know and unfortunately you know sometimes there's nothing you can do about it but um you know that's another perfect example of things that we do differently other companies install what they call led booth they just wrap ... led around those pipes that come out of your roof I think they ... they do to them they actually cut their teeth on them that's how they cut their teeth like maybe my kids we should do that with\nTheir right but it also corals\nSquirrels do that they cut their teeth so we we as a company made a decision we don't put lead on those pipes anymore we put we called Bola boot the kind of a hard rubber a material that goes right over the top of that pipe and make sure that things are going to leak more importantly the squirrels don't chew on them\nOh my gosh yeah even if you've thought about everything\nOh yeah we don't we don't we don't skimp we don't cut corners we do it the right way because quite honestly I don't want to come back out to your roof and fix things I Want to be putting roofs on other people's houses so we do it right the first time and then you know on the one off that we get something wrong we come out and fix it because we've been around for twenty five years\nYou're not going to call the office and get a dead signal and hope somebody shows up right we have people there and we will take care of everything\nBut I Love everything about that and if you're thinking about it is time for you to take the next step I highly recommend calling a the crew at universal river and contracting a ... for all of those reasons or they they definitely stand behind their work we've got the warranties and the platinum preferred status yes for the congratulations on that is awesome\nFifty percent of new roof installations of the first seven colors during the show can enjoy it that offer special to the show ... percent up new roof installations\nAnd calling for zero seven eight zero nine of five one five six\nFour zero seven eight zero nine five one five six and four zero seven eight zero nine five one five six Patrick ... you certainly seemed to know a whole\nLot about the right way to do roofing if there's one piece of advice you can leave everybody with today when it comes to knowing when it's time to make that call what can you even with\nDoing when it's time to things if you see people around you getting getting roofs and you know it's a great view would I Would go ahead and call that is probably a good chance or maybe some Hail Mary or wind damage okay the second thing is obviously if you just hear leaking or you see any kind of water spot in there or you just got an old roof\nGive us a call will come out and look at it and will advise you maybe a little more time maybe you don't maybe it's time to call your insurance company or just replace out of pocket\nPerfect patchy thank you so much for coming by you guys don't hesitate universal Ruth and contracting I Know they can help you out thank you so much for your time and hope you enjoy today's edition of their new home show\nWFL I find ... once you get paid for your door Orlando news radio Ninety three point one WFL a and I heard a radio\nStation [noise]\nTo the midterm design lease Sarah Fox news or rally in Houston is ours Republican Senator Ted Cruz faces a tough reelection bed\nUh the cameras if you if you will so there was a bunch of shady stuff are going on the shoes were different by the way ah okay I didn't pay attention to ah the shoes or didn't read that far one ah so thank you for that information or Tom\nBut okay so\nI Believe this whole cause showy thing is to undermine\nPresident Trump and his foreign policy it's what the left is using to try to undermine them Kavanaugh didn't work showed me they want to make a big deal of is with the left wants to pretend as though uh uh they've not been in bed with the Saudis listen guys we've been in bed with the Saudis I hate to tell you\n... ... what is it been Seventy or so years since Nineteen thirty two okay or even longer All right so a ridiculous period of time alright ... sixty eight what is it eighty something years\nUh we've been in bed with the Saudis and\nWe've known who they are we know\nWho they are a lot of people are are you I'm hearing a lot of conservative talk and it left his talk even like how could the Saudis be so stupid I see this is this is a problem we protect our world view again on to the middle east it's not about being stupid it's about being who they are\nSaying we we've we overlooked eat and you don't think dissidents in Saudi Arabia you don't think dissident in Turkey or you don't think dissidents in Iran you don't think this happens all the time the mistake that the Saudis made was this guy could show geek\nWas a radical himself by the way we'll get into that because this guy was no angel and I want to make an emphatically clear I Am not saying whatsoever that what happened to this guy was right it was not it was murder it was heinous it was disgusting I hate even thinking about it I don't want to hear the audio I\nDon't want to see the video but let's stop acting like we're surprise this is what Islamic nations often do\nThey arrive say it but my state bit NBS made is\nThis guy to show he came to the United states get the meal you're with a bunch of left is wrote columns for the Washington Post return to the consulate uh in in any symbol and was dismembered there the mistake that NBS made was okay this guy was known to Americans\nHad become a relatively popular figure I guess if you will speaking out against reform speaking out against reform\nOf NBS wanted a in Saudi Arabia or by the way women driving this guy to show he was a radical affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood believed in everything bad about a is a um Islam is okay\nHe wanted the old the old school to remain he didn't want reform\nSo all of you liberals out there oh my God oh my God oh my God this guy this guy if you didn't live by the dictates history a law would have won a huge chopped up like he was trumped up so let let's stop pretending like we're dealing with an angel\nAgain that does not justify what's happened to him but I think there's some things that we need to get straight and that we need to put into perspective\nSaudi Arabia are our allies doesn't mean they're our friends and I do believe there's a ... a a a difference I Do believe the the they're not friends in the sense that they don't share our world view\nWe don't believe the same things we don't necessarily want all of the same things when it comes to our individual countries but we have a strategic alliance to help each other out\nAnd that's what this is so should one journalist\nAnd and I hate even than that 'cause I don't want to\nMinimize that whatsoever I don't want to minimize it whatsoever but should one German at a journalist affect our strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia I understand there's a proxy war I mean we're selling arms I understand how it could affect I mean\nA lot of money involved in this situation you know I\nI I get there's pros and cons to that I get the dirty things that Saudi Arabia is doing\nBut what I'm saying is we know and we've known all along who were dealing with so a lot of you that are asking the question how could NBS be so crazy how could he be so stupid I heard the smartest\nPeople on television and radio asking is I I ... well I'm a genius but I mean but I've heard some of the smartest people talking about this and they're constantly asking this question but what they leave out is who got\nIs and who they're God is\nAnd there's a big difference so we try to project our world view on to them when we have to understand it just doesn't\nWork that way in those countries that's what they do cause show he was not a U.S citizen he was a U.S resident he bounced because he was speaking out against NBS is reforms\nSo the guy I knew that he went back to Saudi Arabia he had a comment to them not that he deserved it that's just the way they roll\nSo it wasn't that NBS was being stupid it was it NBS was being normal\nHe was doing what Islam is authoritarians do they kill\nDissidents that's why we shouldn't be so thankful\nThat we're in we're in the United states that's why we should not take for granted our freedoms whatsoever what happened took a show he was bad\nBut let's tell the truth about what's going on\nThis isn't about his show he could show here's another Kavanaugh cause show he is another caravan it is horrible what happened to the guy\nThere should be some type of sanctions on Saudi Arabia but let's not get it twisted let's stop pretending like allies that we have in the middle east with the exception of Israel share our values it just isn't the case\nThis is about ...\nNothing more than that\nThat's a they're an ally they are not a friend were going to go ahead and\nTake a break when we

for house district twenty eight which is a uh east Seminole county or you can find me or to elect Smith twenty eight dot com or David Smith Republican or on Facebook\nAnd I'm Mike Miller and I'm running for congressional districts seven which is all Seminole county in the eastern side of Orange County my website is Miller for Florida dot com all spelled out Miller F. O. R. Florida dot com\nAnd I have a I've been in the Florida House for two terms now and I look forward to seeing David in the Florida House I think you'll do wonderful job balancing our budget and cutting taxes and keeping what's going on in Florida hopefully going on in the in the next a term and then I'm hoping to do the same thing in Congress which Carlin are going to talk about because Stephanie Murphy does not believe and what I Believe in All right let's let's let's start\nWith that and then colonel I'm going to kind of Bob and weaving in and go back and forth because the way that I see this now is I live in district seven um so I got to a yard sign I'm quitting I'm putting it out tonight I Need to get one from Ukraine all stick stick it in Milan so I can make even more people in the neighborhood upset um\nBut but here's the thing\nI look at that debate last night colonel and I started thinking about you and I was like oh my goodness I think I I think I texted ... van and almost like can you come on because I'm like this makes your seat all the more crucial and we need to win it\nAnd then I look at I look at you Mike and I'm just sitting here thinking we have to retain the house let's start with you might Stephanie Miller what are what are her biggest issues and why she wrong because I feel like one of the things that Republicans what we do is we go back and forth\nOn right they're wrong but why what's the human story\nIf I can tell you and and Stephanie Murphy has a fundamental belief that the answer to any question we've had two debates now and and and the first debate I was shocked\nEvery answer was more government more government for education more government for transportation more government for health care more government for pretty much anything you she never looked at the private sector for innovation or or uh you know or you know clarity on how to do things better it was always know we we will have a government solution will have a government solution and not\nYou know she runs a TV ad and says I'm holding washing accountable but then she votes against a balanced budget and then she says you know I'm I'm for the you know middle class and I I'm for fighting for small business and yet she she voted against the most that you know\nA instrumental tax reform you've had in Thirty years and she says I'm I'm against that and then\nAll of her answers and I again I Can't emphasize this enough it's it begins with more and I think honestly and this is what I learned from my very first boss when I ... my first job out of college is for senator Connie Mack\nAnd ... said it best girl he said and less taxes less spending less government means more freedom and that and I think about that I thought about that the last two or four or four years I've been in the Florida House and\nI Begin with that less is actually more like Stephanie believes the opposite more government is the answer\nIs wrong so she voted against the tax cuts this is what this is what frustrates me in and I really think that we need to start speaking on that's about this stuff just on a more personal level I don't even like using the word tax but I don't know what else to use so maybe you guys and help me out but basically\nThey're taking our money I ... it frustrates me that people don't understand that government only has what they take from us right and people like Stephanie Murphy feels as though it's like a moral obligation or something to just gaffe or people people work hard they work their butts off and she says\nGive me this and then I'll give you some crimes yeah and that's basically what it comes down to and it frustrates me um I don't understand why people don't get it but I Do believe Republicans I think we need to messages that just make it more simple Everytime they say tax they're talking about your pocketbook\nThat's what I heard David Smith say soon to be healthy represented Smith is politics is is two things it's edition right and it's also momentum and and if you talk about why 'cause I see it in my race I went from eleven to six to one\nAnd my ... you know and I'm right there I mean\nYou and you and you look at you look at what David has been doing he's been creating a team and and uh you know all throughout eastern Seminole county he's got tremendous presence with with the\nWith signage and he goes to all the farmers markets it's and and what he's doing his he's banking votes and then and then and then you talk about them I met him and we we watch coming out of that Kavanaugh hearing especially on the federal level we've seen Republican say you know what\nThe the insanity on the left can not that's not governing that's not ... that's ... that's that's that's scary and now I I've seen it in my race right now when I when I go to do meet and greets her I you know I I Do a\nYou know and I walked in neighborhoods and I talked to people they say man what is going on up there in DC what these people are you know they they put that that ah that low amount thank God associate justice Kevin\nThrough heck and and I and I'm and I'm so glad to see that the the rule of law and the presumption of innocence it\nIt it it it it got us there\nWhat makes our country exceptional he just talked about uh the uh the the rule of law the presumption of innocence this is what makes our country except

you know or have they been in business for since Hurricane Irma\nThat may say a little bit about what their intentions are and it doesn't mean that every roofing company that did is bad but you know just junior due diligence so that way if you do have an issue with the roof down the work down the road and the company's stand behind the work and I can say without a doubt the universal refund contracting can within twenty five years and we're not going anywhere\nAnd you have the warranty is to back it up exactly and you actually have like a next level kind of warrants yeah I'm a little more about that\nSo we are a platinum contractor I'm ... with Owens courting a which is a great company or we install Owens Corning in certain teach singles but specifically Owens Corning where one of the few platinum contractors\nA preferred contractors in the Atlanta area and um we are really proud of that because it means that we have been a certified to know\nHow to specifically installed their roofing system\nAlong with that a certification huh hum and recognition violence Corning we can also offer warranties\nThat other companies can't offer their extended more real bust warranties homeowners can\nUm can take with their roofing system that other Owens courting of contractors can't offer they just can't that comes with the platinum prefer exactly yup ... and there is only I'm a really a little bit more than a handful of those even in Orlando and the central Florida in Orlando area so it's a\nPretty big yeah that sounds like a big deal I like I like a better warranty for pretty proud of it I think I'm gonna look you know\nMy a person in the eye and say you giving me the best possible risk to protect my home and my family and and everything and it I mean that's that's hugely important\nBecause every system comes with a standard warranty from Owens Corning um but this is kind of a step up so if you want added protection an added value for your roofing system we can offer that whereas other companies can't so you know that's a big value to a lot of people out there and uh it's something that we can offer that other people can't\nAs fantastic Patrick I'm sitting here at Patrick more from universal refund contracting and if you're thinking about\nNow it's time to get that roof looked at it time to get that work done uh right now the first seven colors during the show right now\nIf ... percent off new roof installations and by calling you can also get priority placement on the list as well so if you're thinking about it just going to make the call and get

replacing a Republican not been through it before and they just come and take the whole rip off\nAnd you know everything open air and you gotta wait through the ... it's it's done in a very deliberate process yeah kind of wanting to that but he doesn't put viewer shatter\nYeah so we are very process driven in terms of making sure that we're very efficient and very effective when we install your roof and we did not while your roof exposed anymore than it has to be with the ...\nOut that like if you have your punishing goes off and it's just the wood chair usually at the data pull everything off and then a day to put everything back on but it's Florida that evening thunderstorms going to come up with\nWhat's happening there we\nSo we're really is I Will say this about our crews are cruiser like amateur meteorologist like the little chemicals in their head or antennas and they just know when a storm is going to come and they're really great about\nCovering the roof and typing in and we really never have any issues with that that blood but at the same time you know we're so efficient and effective that quite often most shingle roofs an average shingle roof\nWe can do in a day to day and a half\nAnd the main thing is that tear off process when we get down to the decade as soon as we get that would\nExposed and we re nail it if we need to buy code or um we get that under lame it down and that's really what protects the house so if you was to be a little sprinkler a shower we harp uncover it but our guys are very efficient they're effective we're not running back and forth to the to the supply store going oh we forgot this forgot that everything's there\nThat we pull into dumped trailer or to the house you know it is loud noisy and dirty I mean it is what it is it's really you want it to be right but it's going to happen quickly and efficiently and effectively for you and when we leave you're going to have a great roof and you're not even gonna know we were there\nAnd you have a great warranted to go along with that actually that as well so if you're thinking about\nI it's finally time I know there's that you've seen a lot of your neighbors having this done and you just want to have him come out and take a look highly recommend contacting universal roof and contracting um when I had my roof re down a few years ago it was a beautiful process but\nI ... I Know so much more about it now like I Wish I Would have asked the question is if I Would have paid attention to\nYou know what were they using and how were they applying it and how long did it take like\nI've gotten such a great education on roofing from you Patrick thank you so much but\nAside from the warranties and and and that you guys can want people to like an insurance bumps along the way what are like you're taught to takeaways about what sets universal recent contracting apart from other rivers here in Florida\nI think what you just said is a perfect example mhm we think of ourselves as a consultant our job is to teach you what it takes to put the best roof on your home that not every roof is the same ... there are different shingles there's different systems there's different crews there's there's all these things involved in the process\nWe're not a hard sale organization and we're not going to beat you up over the head we're not gonna make you sign a piece of paper the second I Walk up to your door\nWe're going to walk you through the process we're going to explain to you why we're better and why the system and the products we use are better than other companies and so at the end of the day we want you to want us because we definitely want your business as well and we're going to earn it so um that's the biggest thing is ask questions and the other thing too I took a toll customers out their potential homeowners customers\nIs when you're looking at your roof find out if you're comparing apples to apples to apples to oranges\nThere's a lot of people think that a roof the roof and so\nYou know there are certain cars if you if you buy one car versus another car and you know one car you know ... there's a difference in a car to truck right they're not\nApples apples there's different parts to it and so they do kind of the same thing but they perform differently and so it's the same thing with roofing there is a big difference and materials there's a big difference in labor there is a big difference and experience and especially warranty ... know what you're buying and don't just assume it's the same\nAnd if anything give us a chance to come out and explain the differences so you can make an informed decision\nOkay All right I like all of that um but when it comes to roof damage which does more damage storms or squirrels [laughter] it's funny you know the girls can do some damage I Know it was girls can do the damage real damage I er or pesky situation where I I was in my office at home not too long ago and I heard\nLike a water dripping into the roof and I was like okay my ... not that old oh what's going on here and I called my my company back out there like a squirrel is eating the yourself ... ... it happens all the time I mean you must see some pretty incredible things\nAre it's crazy I just went to a house that had a a whole family of um of raccoons living in their ... and um I we see squirrels choose stuff all the time\nUh it's crazy I mean it ... and unfortunately you know sometimes there's nothing you can do about it but um you know that's another example of things that we do differently other companies install what they call led booth they just wrap ... led around those pipes that come out of your roof I think they ... they do to them they actually cut their teeth on them that's how they cut their teeth like\nMaybe my kids we should do that with their right\nBut in oral squirrels do that they cut their teeth so we we as a company made a decision we don't put lead on those pipes anymore we put we called Bola boot the kind of a hard rubber a material that goes right over the top of that pipe and make sure that things are going to leak more importantly the squirrels don't chew on them\nOh my gosh I Can't even really thought about everything oh yeah\nWe don't we don't we don't skimp we don't cut corners we do it the right way because quite honestly I don't want to come back out to your roof and fix things I Want to be putting roofs on other people's houses so we do it right the first time and then you know on the one off that we get something wrong we come out and fix it 'cause we've been around for twenty five years\nYou're not going to call the office and get a dead signal and hope somebody shows up right we have people there and we will take care of everything\nBut I Love everything about that and if you're thinking about it's time for you to take the next step I highly recommend calling us the crew at universal river and contracting a for all of those reasons that they they definitely stand behind their work and they've got the warranties and the platinum preferred status\nYes congratulations on that is awesome Fifteen Percent up new roof installations of the

advice you can leave everybody with today when it comes to knowing when it's time to make that call what can you even with\nKnowing when it's time to things if you see people around you getting
