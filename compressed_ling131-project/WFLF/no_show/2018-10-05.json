down in palm coast or what you do it do out or\nYeah or yeah here we go how does our defense communicate with the gators or at home and the swamp as loud with noise against her opponent do they have sound communications your hand signals yes\nYou know one of the things we do we we have music and all that plan to practice every week and it just changes from the bench and feel that the defense of sales\nLast week all the crowd noise was on the offensive field this week all the crowd noises music's on the defensive fields so they get used to have in the music playing and Blair and\nUh they get used to having all that and but I mean our guys everyone's looking to get the signals they gotta communicate they have their hand signals to to talk to each other very much like would you want off and swim or on the road the other way\nUm you know the only thing that they don't have to worry about a snap count and stopping football you\nA couple of false starts early and in stark robot I yeah I think those guys that\nYour job or how did you feel noise\nYeah ... ... in the sense that the is the problem I have a false starts we're I don't know if they're about the noise there really are jumping the you know I mean are are centered\nWouldn't even started the cadence yet I mean I used to like if you look their fall star center still got his head between his legs I mean I like and like he like until even picks us that we can't stop the ball is that between his legs I don't know I was so jumpy right there but\nUm you know so they settled down and got ... and uh and it got pretty good later on\nIn for fully pay to reduce your every week we talk you talk about the communication that you guys have seemed like he is getting better and doing different\nI mean he's growing I mean he's a young quarterback and uh\nYou know you look I mean he's he's he's Blake different games and continues to improve and you know in the last two weeks you know when you're young quarterback you're going into hostile wrote environments I thought he's handled uh those situations both fairly well and you know let's be handled in at home this week or even better\nWe'll see how he can handle a or a rabid fan I'm ready to go All right\nI'm here with Lindsay and she's got a question or another question about the students actually\nReleased a statement earlier this week in the morning that seems to be out there and ready for the game at three thirty yeah think of an impact on students actually had on the players as well as the result of the game in\nGeneral I think the one the students are the most critical part of the fan base um you know because that's the rest of the stadium feeds off the student body in the energy the student body brings to the game you know if the students are all standing up and jumping up and down and going crazy\nThe rest of the stadium well as the students aren't really that into it\nThe rest of the stadium in our belts will be more like you know like ... you know like golf clap nice by but they they kind of feed off the student body you know one of the things you see you know I I think anybody that went to last week's game\nThat the ... you know something that\nI created at the other school and and that was that the administration of gray and and you know you probably saw an hour an hour before kickoff the students section was completely sold out you know you couldn't get a seat in our before kickoff so when you come out for warm ups\nThe students are going crazy with their with cow bells and um and it's like whoa you know if you're in it now and you know so I mean I don't know you know as far as I trust me first and so there are now before kickoff going crazy I I'll be I'll be really excited but as long as they're there for four\nYou can get them at Cracker Barrel Walmart target Sears and the Kmart jumped Cardozo gambling here with you live from a celebration point where we could go back out to a Eddie\nDon't hear a brand and he he's got more of a statement\nCoach uh I'm actually from Cincinnati yeah I'm a book our country already you know a lot of fans on [laughter] so I just I jumped on the bandwagon with these very are back in

when you got hired I thought of it are you should have been hard before [laughter]\nBut I also want to say if you can bring stark Vegas the number one you can bring the gators background that's going to\nBe the goal right isn't it ah [noise] so yeah I I Want to get us up there and and trying to keep us up number one that's going to be the big goal for us right there right at it is hard to\nGet another one go ahead and I'm I'm here with Karen and she's got a question about the uh\nTook place last week yeah\nI don't know that you call it a trick play semi college player types and play I'm just thinking about pat in the past I mean under ... miles LSU has had many many unexpected call our past two coaches had a very had had a very managed off\nI wanted to ask you how comfortable you are with Ireland talents in our campaign in hoping that that whole playbook and calling what you think would be a good next play\nI'm I'm I'm comfortable with what we have in the game plan you know I Would say we only use about probably sixty percent of our our fence but in a given year you're probably only use that much you know because uh the offensive play book is pretty big and a lot of it doesn't fit the personnel that we have right now and\nSo and what fits this personnel might not fit next year or the year after that and so you have\nHave a lot of flexibility within what you do\nUm you know we we we carry a bunch of plays into each week and you know ... we'll get together and on and you don't want to hit Thursday if you're not comfortable with that play we take it out before we before we even go into the game um so we're pretty comfortable with everything that we are carrying into the game plan this week good\nThank you very much in that trick play ... so yeah\nYou know I learned what to do I learn\nThe one of the things was you know if you you you you come up when you're running instead of\nA lotta times trick pleasure kinda doing a lot of different things so if you call it like as a play golf I mean it could be like all of this super long word age to get exactly what you want done on that trip play\nAnd that sounds confusing\nBut if you give it one word\nThat the guys can bike understand and pick up\nThey can get now we have other one word plays and the often set a bass player\nRight but like if you're going to like get like a trick question we're ... we're going to get it and its formation emotion this and move this and run this play and then throw a screen and double throwback back to the this guy right\nThat that's a lot of ... like signal the guys over there like you know what I mean you're like holy cow it's like you know I mean it's like the the signals going on for two minutes she just there say just bang there it is\nAnd it's easy for the guys remember that one word kind of means everything just like our summer ... one word just means everything to go and it's easy but if you do that for there's some some of the regular place you've run a lot and then you do it for ... play or the guys pick it up and they know what to do what they do break\nThat is what we have to do to get our last one and come back then wrap things up

sleep predicts hallucinations Mandalay hotel rooms yeah your sleep deprivation does kick in and all those the energy just running through the system will you know a stay at all for bit\nYou know instead of taking three or four days for it to take effect emitted five six or seven but the body can be so depleted the all the neurotransmitters and become depleted\nAnd that's why you see people crash having evidence or cocaine trash loud and thing the the ... all the ah ... it gets depleted in body has to have to shut down to ... when they wake up they may only sleep for three or four hours they're still in the media doesn't cause a shift into the depressive area\nSay it's not like a conflict light switch on and off\nOkay not ... it's odd because I think Rachel mentioned something about her son Gary is that his name to or possibly Randy something like that but that her son also I'm not the way it can be no notice just to get what you went off\nThat's true but what I was saying was if they go to sleep it doesn't mean they're gonna switch to a depressive mode they could still wake up three or four hours later with the same energy from five to seven\nOh my gosh now when the uh the depression comes on yeah now that's the deepest darkest others\nIt's depression or whatever it can be yes and it doesn't ... again it's going to cycle you are going to get there but it may get there fast you make it they're slow it could be a down angle that severe more can be a nice sloping angle\nAnd I'm I'm a little confused on okay how how do you\nHow do you make it to make the difference between what is I guess bipolar and depression I guess other than the mania and then I guess my follow up question and that would be you know with the mania at least you have some ups were in depression you're all down\nCorrect it to have to be coincide you have to have a mania and a depressive cycle in order to qualify for the diagnosis of being bipolar those do have to go together okay why would that be worse than depression can seeing that you ... you know with the mania you have good feelings okay\nTake the highest high you've ever had oh stopping da\nNa na na na talking on the soccer you chemically induced or anything like that but the ... the best you've ever felt\nAnd then compare that with the worst you've ever felt and go there in do three seconds it sounds like cocaine exactly that's what I'm trying to say but when you drop you missed that high so much this is one of the reasons why it's so difficult to get to keep people that are bipolar on their medication\nIf they're medicated it cuts out the highs and it cuts off the lows so the highest earners silos aren't as low as they see the the people that are bipolar missed that high\nGang yeah wow and so therefore it's like well ... life isn't fun without that\nMania they're ... they're chasing the mania ... they\nReally are there are it's just like again I liken it to cocaine because of the symptoms are the same at all\nWe can learn a lot more about bipolar disorder what causes it when it's diagnosed most likely Mm treatment options as well after Kennedy had in the studio with us and asked means Lizzie

Security tax not only\nAre all your other tax deferred accounts can be taxed as ordinary income but your Social Security can be tax too they just keep comment that just doesn't seem right to me right but there is a solution if you have enough tax free income make a drop you blow a threshold and boom your Social Security is not tax anymore\nI set up one more time helped me understand what you're

one WFL a and I heard a radio\nStation [noise]\nWell I remember calling you guys that first a night saying saying and meaning it I was like\nThis isn't the impossible there's no possible way I'm not exaggerating there's no way I said I I got more uh two today to learn uh that I have to know by tomorrow then I had in any whole semester of college and he got\nAnd ah and I was like everyone sheets that's the only possible I don't I don't know how anyone would do this or that and then you know over over time what I what I found out what one you you just\nUse your brain starts to ... retain more information you know there's a there's a certain sort of a ... learning to learn type of thing but no one made it through that for years without heavily relying on everybody else and um because\nAnd there was one guy in our class whose name uh I I won't say 'cause it's not a flattering story but he was a one of the only isolationist and the class and he would in in gross anatomy like he would just be just over with his own cadaver not talk to anybody and who are in the heat\n[laughter] so yeah he was over with his own kid there was a murder [laughter]\nThat wasn't even one of the get out

this will be better done by by a team of people that you know I should I should seek help and seek to do this with other people yeah well I think\nPart of the reluctance um at least in my generation was um that you\nYou didn't have what you need it but nobody had what they need and and so it was like\nOkay I'm going to ask somebody who also doesn't have what they need and so um but the the point that I think scripture and common sense and a communal living is that somehow if we can help each other out\nThen all of us will have more of what we need 'em and I think I think the the bottom line is that we were made to need each other and we were made for relationships based upon um\nUm elevating our capabilities because someone else helped us out in uh in in ... in an area where we were weak\nUm so that we can help them out in an area where they were weak\nSomebody once said people respect people strength but they can act or ... I'm Sorry people respect strengths but they connected weaknesses and that is to say if you can help somebody out that makes you\nFeel better about your life and and and and while you were put here or it helps them out and and then they will be more likely to help\nSomebody else so that ... yeah and that explains a lot that that idea of of we you know we were made for relationships made for community because\nI'm the experience that people have pretty much invariably when when helping each other's uh each other's uh\nThat sounded like ... ... each other's up when they help each other is a you know there there is there's a joy in that and that connection you know ... and ends on both sides of the equation um well we have to go to a break but when we come back\nWe're going to talk

going on in the uh he's he should be famous for that and he\n... he caught a lot of flak when a [laughter]\nApple automatically put the new you two albums on everyone's iPhone or it may be a little so not really yeah it was just automatically on there like you you didn't I didn't know that yeah and it really\nAh I always felt bad for him because I feel like that wasn't even his idea and uh he was like oh no [laughter] still doing good work if you look at what what\nBonds doing 'em and then the other one I didn't know I mean I just didn't know she was a a did charity stuff maybe everyone did but me Oprah Winfrey yes ah\nOh she she huge into charity especially with the um girls' education in Africa huh hum he has a ... she created at school over there it's really great school um and uh I've seen films of it are films showing my age now [laughter] videos\nHum of these of these girls and they're all dressed in uniforms that's that's how\nI'm ever going to go to school they they buy uniform to have to buy uniform\nThat is true I remember that on on on missions trip so yeah he would be in villages where there's just extreme poverty but every kid coming home from school is dressed in their school uniform absolutely yeah she created the angel network and a spends millions in a dirty work do you think it's just an inherent I mean when we're talking\nAbout Audrey are bono a or a fine or a Oprah Winfrey do you think that there's something that's a\nInherently different about people like that who use their influence and wealth in order to turn out you know they they don't turn inward and and and wall themselves off you think that's in there just inherently better people or or do you think that there there there's some sort of triggering event for them that that does that\nI don't know that's a that's a really good question I think that\nThey're probably not all that different than the rest of us are some were just brought up with a a sense of\nEspecially ... you know it's it's the it's the obligation of the ... ... ah in order to help those who don't have\n'em but I imagine for some of them um they came into contact you know we when you guys were growing up we want you to get out of the country so that you could understand where you live in the living in the U. S. is not a normal experience for the rest of the world and\nUm and so anytime you have exposure to people who don't even have clean water or don't you know in their travels I expect they they took a look at the some of the extreme poverty around the world um and and they thought I can do something\nThat's really interesting I mean that's a point I Would not have thought of without you're saying it but there there's a probably a very\nHigh correlation to awareness of the world outside your own walls of your house uh and and wanting to do something about ... I Can't imagine there's tons of people that are just like\nI hate the poor you know like I mean they exist but mostly in movies mostly in film [laughter] but uh you know but his courage it's it's an awareness of it because when you were talking about that no ... no bliss so bleach\nThat right know blizzard bleach yeah no release it over the age\nOf ... where the ... the actor and I can't say it's a French say [laughter] no I Can't do it\n[laughter] I get very jak their values have talked [laughter] but it it it strikes me as the opposite", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "05"}
