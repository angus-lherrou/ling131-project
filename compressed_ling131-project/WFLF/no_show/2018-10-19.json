reason you know world but it's beyond reason fees factor [noise] so do you think Elizabeth Warren for Gratz\nDoing my DNA test yet do you think she regrets it I mean I don't know she says she doesn't regret it and she's still putting stuff out there and of course the media is backing her up in a lot of this\nShe she's not going to admitted in public that she regrets doing yeah\nAlthough she put on a campaign video when she did all this for those who don't know if you don't know I don't know how you could not now but she Trump forever ago said you know have been going well and still doing it calling her Pocahontas\nBecause she claims that she has a Native American ancestry in her blood\nExactly and she had to use that in the past mhm uh jobs in certain things ... and ... that's where he called them Pocahontas not to mock Native Americans but to mock her because he figured she was lying because there seem to be a lot of evidence that she was\n... was not you know even with ignorant about it or something\nBut so earlier this week she came out with a DNA test and she thought she won because it showed she was part Native American\nAnd it showed that she is either but the one point five percent Native American\nTo point zero nine percent also showed that she's Ninety eight point five percent or Ninety nine point one percent white which of course there's a problem for the Democrat Party\nCourses a problem but let's stick with a Elizabeth Warren because she's still put on a video and at the end of the video she still kinda tries to do use this to attack Trump this is what she said\nSome people question my heritage and my family history\nMaybe they do it too and so\nPolitics was for\nLump shares the struggles than\nSo when she puts on in this video there will always be attached to my heart when she puts out this video she makes it seem like that this was just a story she her\nAnd she happened to mention that a couple of times that knows she never said she was a part of a tribe or anything and didn't use is that this was just kind of a family story and that's it\nExcept that doesn't seem to be the case in fact a Cornell law professor who has been studying this for a while his name's bill Jacobson\nHe was on Tucker Carlson show earlier this week and he\nPointed out that this is much more than just oh we'll just the family story I shared and maybe I didn't know the whole truth that just you know assumed it was correct and that's\nIt not according to what Bill said this is what Bill thing\nViewers me to understand how deceptive Elizabeth Warren was in claiming Native American heritage Native American ancestry\nShe did not claim it when she was a child she didn't claim it for college she didn't claim it for law school she only claimed it when she was in her late thirties and beginning to climb the law school ladder the law professor ladder from the University of Texas to Harvard\nThat's the only time she's ever claimed it she never affiliated with Native American she never helped Native Americans she was never a faculty advisor for Native Americans she got herself lifted as Native American so she can be declared a minority law professor and\nShe did that when she was climbing the ladder and we know why she did that she can say whatever she wants but everybody understand this is a woman who built her political narrative claiming that other people are regain this just dumped she tried to rig her career by claiming a status to which is not entitled\nWell so here's my question them now working at the big picture as I always do why why was she so determined to do this why\nWas this so important to her why it's so important to anyone\nThat she might have some Native American heritage why\nWas soon as the story came out and it started to become known that this was really backfiring on a wizard with foreign I mean when you have when you have editorials in CNN dot com for Native Americans blasting her for this you know she has a problem but I tweeted out in response right after this I said\nWhen you live by identity politics you also die by identity politics and that's what's happening here the laughter and the Democrat Party and I'm not the only one thing that's obviously but they've become so obsessed\nWith identity politics that she had to have something you can't just be a white woman it used to be enough to be a woman and be part of identity politics that's not good anymore\nBecause now women you know white women are part of the patriarchy now Tom after this whole Kavanaugh thing not white women are being asked why either because it's not just white men anymore white women are the problem\nAnd so she has an issue because she wants to run for president and she wants to be known in the Democratic party we can't run for president the Democrat Party anymore and just be white no you have to have something you have to be a victim of something\nAnd you have to be a different race somehow because that's more important than who you are as an individual\nSo that's what ... that's why this happened that's why this is so important to her\nBut I was thinking about this too I was like you know\nAre we ever going to come to a place not only in this country but in mankind where we focus on the individual\nAnd the character of the individual more than our race no or our tribe and no [laughter] I don't think we can as men\nBecause they want to cater to devote people who had sympathy and would vote for them\nYeah but I mean this is the problem even beyond the America you're right politics that's what it's all about divide and conquer you go to one group commits our group there are a victim of another group to get that first groups votes that's what it is it's a divide and conquer strategy it's been going on forever\nBut I feel like it's a problem in the world and throughout history\nThat we just cannot come to a place where we identify herself as an individual based on our own individual character on ideas we have to I ... and this is why there's so much polarization\nIn the world and in this country today too because we have identified ourselves based on the group or a part of and seven ... as the or individual it really shouldn't matter what her ancestry is or whatever\nAnd she gets the old Trump brought it up no she started this as bill Jacobson pointed out in that sounds good she's the one who started this whole controversy she's the one who pushed this why and she did it for political reasons and for power\nBut I just wish this is why one reason why

lot now it's about a thousand in mind I mean it's definitely not and all that that's you know at our ... know that your\nGross that's before you count like and see and major repairs that come up so that's the gross cash flow the difference no rent the payment so twelve thousand dollars a year minus vacancy mine is a an occasional heating and air system or a roof occasionally you're you're making a little bit of money\nBut you know you yeah fire five ... five grand for around something like that um ... a year from like that over our air raid I mean some years will be better than others and that kind of like on a bunch of rental property shark and kind of do these things in my Dutch\nUm the uh uh ... and what's your household income\n[noise] um so we bring about a hundred and ten grand to tell you what do you own your home our primary uh we get her to stay on ten months ago and we\nOwe to eighty ... worth about three hundred\nAnd ... and so he's saying um you've got a hundred and thirty and uh fifty or so so you got a hundred and eighty if you saw both of these give or take 'em expenses that you could throw at your two eighty\nThen that's right he's saying to do your saying we're making a little money um I like rental property these are good rent or should I think I Want to keep it and that's the discussion I'm All right\n[noise] yeah 'cause my thought is on break down and we have about ten thousand dollars in and got that and you're saying you lay out and said that um we have a combined probably twelve thousand 'cause they took a we had a lot but we took a bite out of ... and you add to that so\nMany helping out there now is like baby steps are very clearly defined that you do write one before you do the other you can't shore to\nThem or you can have your plan but you can't call them baby steps I won't let you guys are going to do your plan okay if you're going to be my plan you'd write a check today and be done for it\n[noise] yeah the\nOnly reason I I

playing poker or any of the\nUh uh you know ... ...\nYou're not making a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them so they could slip on your pretty quick if a ... at a minimum you know a good compromise between the two every I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love real estate [noise]\nAnd I want to try and keep 'em if you want to keep them in the big one that got more margin in it and more equity in it is the most appealing to me\nThe three the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five on and so a migraine one and dumped the other one\nThe fifty thousand doesn't move the needle much but the one that only got a fifty thousand more equity you know making anything on that and that you're in gash bread on that at all and which means that it could turn upside down on ya meaning if it went vacant for three months you can be writing checks\nBy the end of year lose money on that house if you go to three months vacancy if the market's awful so you just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is is it is an asset in your situation even though technically the charm probably dumping the little one as a compromise\nBetween the two of your head and um and if you're going to hold the other one then you guys just got a you know we'll start working these baby steps the right way\nAnd following on through in getting the

but you kind of living hand to mouth anyway\nAnd that that's that's the cycle you're trying to break so good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Mike is with us in San Francisco Hi Mike how are ya\nHi Dave how ya doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I just started in October here um and I got my that's what I got my starter set so I have um with the money make over um I got an eight hundred my emergency fund film among baby step on um the first time I'm doing a budget and it's a mess it just seems like I just can't dial it in\n... and you're on every dollar um every dollar okay I Am and they're all going in a\nWhile it just seems like I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cough and then I just either it seems like it it goes over and then there's things that I think we're gonna have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just a doormat\nYou been doing it a whole two weeks yeah yeah\nWell that you're you're just takes a little while to get things are just in the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're wrong but more in there\nBut you're always people are always spend more on food and they think they are I mean people go I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going to hold just no way you know I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more\nReally quick I wanted to ask what should I invested in the financial peace university um I should I get that now are kind of get it after I'm done with my thousand just put everything in their first then\nThat's up to you I mean you you can decide what you wanted to I don't want to just give it to you and then when you know to worry about it\nOh [laughter] okay All right\nBut that way you can get signed up and get the every dollar plus going and that's a one year membership for that thing and then you get in the class you know you go to the non non lessons and you've got the online experience and that's going to answer a bunch of these questions as well but basically if you just visualize a yellow payout forget every dollar forget\nA budgeting and all that and just go okay here's what I make\nAt the top of the page mhm and then every dollar\nOf my ... not every one of those dollars needs an assignment going down the page or most been Exxon food and why on utilities and Z own rent and so on down the page until every single dollar has an assignment you don't have any leftover money in your budget\nCould integrate out by made it it definitely the easiest one I've I've done other one horn path than this one is definitely the easiest as far as\nThe Harlem the problem is is you're facing your reality it's not the app and it's not the system even it's just the first time you do a budget you suck at it\nYou know and it just takes a month and then the next months you'll get better really about the third month you're doing it it'll be accurate\nIt'll take about the rhythm of about Ninety Days about three times through it and you'll go oh I'm not forgetting all soccer pictures and then there's one down you know and we know what the food really cost and we know what the utilities really are and\nGot a few things that are fixed that are predictable and you'll rent or your mortgage payment that's fix thing we know what that is nice but some of these other things you're just you're taking your best guess and and it just takes a little while to get the trial and error get the course\nOf course corrections done and get adjusting so you'll get it on I'll have to like pick up will get you signed up for central\nBanks to drive ... or ... or ... or associate producer ... your host and\nWill be [noise]\nHey production off the show and\nGo download our revamp Dave Ramsey show apple app store\nWe listening to your feedback and adding new features to make it even better check it out [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents in a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to ... and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities\nFood and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to sand or insurance dot com recall eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and see how inexpensive\nIt really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible\nIt really does make you the hero of your story and it puts you on course for better things ahead\nWFL I find hills ... Orlando news radio Ninety three point one WFL a and I heard a radio station\nYeah and and that's that's the ... there's a there's a as part of art in general and our for our community is that there are those that can create\nArt where the rest of us couldn't even hope to approximate ... with a lifetime of training there's just some natural gifting and then uh and and then you can train into that uh and then there are people that uh would look at that as like that's the only version of it but like I Would just venture to guess Frank ... not a great tap dancer [laughter]\nI Know I could teach us [laughter] and I still remember much less than [laughter] that doesn't leave you get really\nSmall ... to ... just a therapy for my tapped into or to meet people where they are [laughter] ... yeah and and another thing\nAh on this list we're we're just the practical aspects\nUh you know studies have shown that students that um practice the art become better at learning a better learning they're less it in operation or or it activates different parts of the brain than they were using and the ... just become to better student\nThat makes sense I mean scientifically that that makes sense I mean there's there's a it is a very very hard\nWere your brain to focus will in chaos and I mean I think a lot of art is to is to draw some kind of beauty out of the chaos in into and have something that orderly and beautiful it it it creates a different way for you to learn things and it expands your mind and that's not just a like ... stuff and that's actually science\nWell and and another thing that the research department lifted was it gives us a sense of resilience\nProbably indirectly because you see things in different forms and therefore you infer that things can have begun were different ways you can look at things differently if this doesn't work there's probably something else yeah and so that gives you a sense of resilient yeah uh well I mean\nUh and if you're just tuning and you're listening to the bright side and today we're talking about a topic that we we don't talk about it enough really the arts and or just in this first segment I'm realizing there's I was worried we wouldn't have enough to say until we brought our guest on because he knows everything and I didn't know and it but uh but that what you just said about resilience and the art\nAnyone who's ever watched\nAny of the excellent should've all one Academy Award rocky films can can attest to the vet and you play the right musical score over the right\n... and you feel like I can run into a ritual you down or you know hard times I ... it is a it's a near like I Need to get to Russia have the [laughter] there wasn't so bad right he had a bad\nOne more there's one more um because I Know we're going to a break here but um this the the other one of the other positive or was the a sense of community develop and and and revitalization you know when your mom and I went to room I was surprised\nTo see how much graffiti was hitting room I'm a ... and and it was just kind of an odd paradox that is the city of great art would have all of this graffiti everywhere but then it reminded me of many of the beautiful murals that are that are\nUm painted in some of uh the most\nChallenged neighborhoods in our nation are and what that does\nAh for those who normally live in those neighborhoods but drive through I mean just the sense in in ... much further than murals will go to actual community programs pretty soon but but ah\nBut what it can do for a community a that felt disregarded a disengaged and disparage preachers always have to\nCome up with a look we're so sorry this fact agreed [laughter] have you made about [laughter] [laughter]\nBut that's what else are good [laughter] you know we can we\nCan finally stopped giving our amateurish opinions are are actually what you said there are speaks to the spirit which ... which he really has been your whole life and

right side or if you are sticking around from our previous segment I Want to say I\nRe hydrate in my brain is fully functional [laughter] apologies for anyone who is worried [laughter] every now and then the Little Miss fire happens um so uh we're talking today to Joshua ... who runs the central Florida community arts uh and\nAnd we're talking at the end you were saying that the the the mission is to build and serve the community through the arts at or close to them and um\nUh we we mentioned how there's you know for a lot of people they can sing at their church or that's pretty much it and there's not really a there is not really another outlet what what populations have you identify that are just ... particularly deprived of opportunity to ah to to learn about this or to express themselves as way\nYeah a lot of times you know we think of arts as a luxury right we think of it when you're talking about the basic needs of people in a community arts isn't always at the top right of course housing and and and food and shelter and all these different things\nBut the arts are part of the holistic approach to building a great community and for us we have seen that in a variety of ways by connecting with populations that normally may not have access to the arts and to see the difference that that makes and uh we partner with UCF do all sorts of research and different things\nBut we look at two areas and kind of breaking down the barriers and that's accessibility making sure the arts can get to that person and then affordability making sure at something either they can afford or that we can pay for it for them\nYeah that makes sense because I mean I I mean as someone who uh I I took voice lessons a long time I mean they're they're jeep or it's it's really something how do you how you combat that I mean to to get it to to the point that it's affordable for people\nYeah so we do that in a variety of ways a lot of it as do fundraising efforts are writing grants I'm working with corporate sponsors\nI'm being able to cast a vision to individual givers a an NFL anthem you know for ... so a lot of times when we go out and take programs to under served or marginalized populations\nIt's completely underwritten by the community why and that's an ... and it's in a variety of ways because a lot of even our government our local government and our our mayor just gave an extra two hundred fifty thousand dollars out of the regular budget\nAs a one time gift because states state arts funding was cut this year even our our mayor and in our commissioners and our leaders know the value of the arts in our community and so\nUm this is a place that's really that really gets it\nI Wonder if this oh I'm Sorry I just keep up so fast and they don't they don't have is that a theme that you've noticed that the people that are in leadership or and governmental authority or that the closer they are the further tear down there towards the community the more they recognize the importance of it and once you get up in the state and federal levels it it starts to lose some of that I mean\nYou 'cause you're saying is getting cut of the state budget but then local government comes as no no we actually we this is important\nYeah I think part of is that they see there in the trenches they're on the ground they know how it's impacting the local community but I also think it has a lot to do with personal experience I mean you said that kind of your tap dancer right\nSorority also [laughter] I never should have had it I found out I Know but you know mayor\nDire is a you know he interviewed or multiple times and he always a test\nAnd have his experience of leadership back to his high school drama class you know and so I think some of it has to do with when there are people in leadership roles\nWho truly have personally experienced what the arts meant to them they want to make sure that nobody's left behind act so\nWe see that throughout the leadership mayor Jacob says well and and different mayors the mayor McDonald of ... when we see a lot of leaders in our community who said hey it personally affected me or my family and I want to make sure that everybody has access to them\nYou know the our crack research department I'm a listed some of the um some of the folks that are benefiting from your outreach programs\nUm and preschoolers are in the ... neighborhood middle schoolers in Osceola county homeless youth affiliated with the covenant house children in this low in east orange and and the goals brew neighborhood in Sanford\nBut what kinds of programs you have for these folks who well it's it's a beautiful because what we do is we work with these different organizations in right now we have about Seventy partners that we integrate the arts and to these different average unit has incredible yeah it's really it's really amazing and what we do is we sit with that organization or that partner\nAnd we talked about their population we say what is it that you think that we can bring to you when it comes to the art that will benefit this population right so every single program looks different it might be a music and movement class it might be some type of improv that can work on social skills are connecting with others um it could be some type of percussion\nA drum circle because we're working with a population has Parkinson's and that is something that helps them you know so it really does depend on the population and we look at you know those points of intersection of how can we bring in the arts to them\nAnd it also not just be something fun and something new to experience but can also help them in in some capacity\nYou talked about music and and and the brain yeah we have a choir called the musical mine's choir and it's acquired for people with early stages of dementia\nAnd every week we have between fifty and sixty people with dementia and their care partners who come to a choir rehearsal wow and it is the most beautiful thing to watch because we know that music unlocks the part of the brain that goes last in dementia\nAnd so we see people who walk into her so completely non
