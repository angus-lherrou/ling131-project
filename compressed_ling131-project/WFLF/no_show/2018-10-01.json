that ability review either black ... please call professional\nWFL I find ... ... Orlando news radio Ninety three point one WFL a and I heard a radio station [noise]\nA wood frame or block or block with stucco or a brick and they developed all the product around that so uh so they started from the opening and worked to what product is going to be best so now you have the best product in ... you also have the best application because they have\nFormulated it from the position of replacement and not from New construction trying to make something work for a replacement so in that case specialty windows that have\nYou know because you build an opening and yeah sure the window was square when they put it in but what the drywall guys do is that right is that or their struggles returns square and are they are are they perfectly\nSquare 'cause it just doesn't happen or if it's a you know nicer would return with with casing around it or those would casings um you know are they ...\nYou know for windows that you'll have to look out of that when it comes to a replacement time you're like oh boy\nRight exactly and so yeah you have um you know so yeah absolutely specialty windows costs more than than regular windows and Anderson is the ... there were no by Anderson is a really the premium a window on the market but also you know it has been developed and designed for the purpose of replacement and so in Florida you know we have a lot of existing homes that have aluminum\nSingle pain glass windows so they're\nThey're horribly inefficient um you know your your energy use air Eunice yang all of that\nIs absolutely you know and of course the summer's been super hot super rainy [laughter] and uh and so you know where we are\nAre faced with the challenge is how do we make sure we install these highly energy efficient windows making sure that all the water proofing has done correctly and uh and that the customer home is beautify as well as really improve their energy efficiency\nNow I just had a situation at my house where we had a window is the original window to the house it leaked it created a mold situation and everything had to come out and describe the whole thing and\nYou start to really think about what's happening in my other windows at what point should you really start considering replacing your window\n[noise] well I think you know for that it does vary for for people you know I mean I think um you know if you look at your how home it was an older home bill\nYou know prayed two thousand five you're going to have aluminum single pain windows mhm so you're going to have an efficient windows so that's something if if energy efficiency is is really important to you and reducing um\nYou know our carbon footprint or however you want to get a you know that that is a great reason to to get your windows replace you know because again in Florida I don't know why I'm builders always just thought hey this is for the we don't need a fish and windows and doesn't make sense because it's all\nI mean that's single paying windows um and it's you know and it's just doesn't make any sense\nUm and then another time would just be the function do you do your windows operate do they do they operate well um do they uh you can you slide 'em up on on on the nice days and when winter in in in the spring can you open your windows and and have a nice a air flow through your home\nAnd you know a lot of times of the way some of the order windows ... and walks systems and even the screen systems don't work I I had in my house I had a single pain aluminum windows and\nI couldn't open I'm not because they didn't work but because of the screen system was so seems silly that hey I Can't have my windows because of the screen will actually keep anything out\nSee I don't know if some of my windows in the house now because I'm afraid the windows are going to come down like that the springs systems and um they they aren't super trustworthy as I'm sure as they once were and with a little one in the house my fear is that she's going to go to open a window or go play by the window and it's going to come down and so that's a red flag for me right there\nAbsolutely that is that is a concern and then um you know and so you do have to be careful with those things I also have a young kids and you know they get into everything absolutely very inquisitive they want they want to figure it out and then um\nYou know and then in another reason and it's a very valid reason is they just don't look nice yeah the the grills or falling if they do have to pay and there's a ... a seal failure in between so in between your glass logging enough\nAnd and ah yeah doesn't doesn't look nice and you know so I mean my front windows right [laughter] yeah [laughter] I mean I understand\nAnd uh uh we'd love to put some new ones in there for you but I you know so in our home is obviously our our biggest investment we want to uh and I wanted to look\nBeautiful yeah and functional and also to help out with bills and whatnot and if\nYou are intrigued a by what Jim and I are talking about here with my aunts and they do have a limited offer going on right now at least for the first seven colors\nThat if you want to get the information go ahead and call now because twenty percent off all windows and doors plus twenty percent off installation and just doing a quick math in my head that's a lot of money that you can save right now so you want to call\nA date for eight or nine for eight zero that's eight for eight for nine for eight\nZero if you want to take advantage of this which is happening right now for the first set in color to the new by ... percent off all windows and doors plus twenty percent off your installation\nAt eight eight eight for eight or nine for eight\nZero so like I've been talking with Jim about here I've been really considering changing out my windows and doors for a long time now\nWith the storms last year I really thought that was going to be the final push but now that I'm thinking about it with the I got the leaking into one window I've got sliding glass doors that my daughter can barely open\nAnd I get down there and Greece him up as often as I can but they're just big and heavy and that's also something else as a mom you know\nThe stores are there is so heavy what is the product light with what the fiber acts as it is it light is it I mean you say it's dirty and strong but is it too is it at stake heavy kind of product\nIt is not it is a sick or looking products or the the goal again was to have a window that looked like a painted wood windows ... but um but it is it's still a ... an extra rooted products so it is hollow core but with the absolute perfect engineering to ensure that it's a strong as it needs to be\nBut it's not so much the size of the window or the door but it is in the hardware the operation are the are the balance is working correct patient windows or the cranks are they good and solid are they are resistant to corrosion so they don't rushed\nSo they don't rushed in may and cause problems are the doors are the rollers a solid and well may roller with proper bearing system so they\nThey roll properly across there so yeah you what you actually want a big heavy door panel with multiple pains of glass and an Oregon insulation in between those ... glass and a beefy frame so it doesn't work for twist or any of those things but you also must have the proper hardware so those stores operate the way that they should\nI Want to blow up and my doors to my patio like Mary Poppins on spring day but it's like you know I get a hold door open\nRight now so yeah I think that's another reason it might be time\nYeah that that is absolutely true so we definitely want to have you know I'm you know the bigger the door obviously the more they're going to weigh but they've got her operate correctly they've got to be light they should be easily opened with just a delight\nYeah what my seven year old or by someone an owner like ourselves yes I [laughter] ... especially you know later on in these parts that we do get\nThe great weather all year long and and you want to be able to open your house up and what I've learned through my mold remediation situation earlier this year is that we need to open up our doors and our windows more often in our homes because of the the moisture retention and signed the homes and if\nYou're not using the humidifier all the stuff I had no idea that I I've learned a lot this summer yeah I'm sure I'm and you've already said that with the fiber acts that it it it's because it is a high rate of the wood as well as you know the other technologies is it reasonable product I mean are you feeling like\nThat's something that can enhance that in my home\nWe'll see what you really want as you want to be able to see a little bit tight when you want to during storms during the summer like this when it's like this I don't want any of this weather coming in I don't want any of this heat moving into what any of my air conditioning going out so you really want it sealed up tight with the best product as well as the best I mean things you really don't think about is is the weather stripping is and what type of\nWhat type of or engineering or materials are they using and the weather stripping no cars so you want to seal it tight and then you want to release that when it is when it's the weather is right\nIn our in our winter yet our our ... winter it's right around here say favorite time of year and I love to open up the windows and doors\nThere was a big thing about just quickly uh obviously Anderson's based in Minnesota so they do know what cold is like oh yeah I Know I mean you know above all maybe the importance is really ceiling that into a reduced the amount of outside air coming in and say opposite\nOf here and they want to keep their heat in and keep it cold out we want to keep our cold and keep the heat out\nExactly and and the engineering of course does work going both ways\nThat's awesome that's especially you know in the summertime around here when you see those air conditioning bills jumped by like a hundred dollars\nYou're like oh wait a minute I could put that in a piggy bank into my window financially [laughter]\nActually and now they're all the time if you are thinking about it I Want to take advantage of what's happening now with new by ... percentage twenty percent off all windows and doors plus twenty percent off installation for the first seven callers right now during this show so if you even curious it's worth making the call and getting on that list it's eight\nEight eight for eight or nine for eight zero again that's eight eight for\nEight or nine for eight\nZero now in your mind do you have like a unless it's like a

that we bring in the experts here I have got Patrick sitting with me I'm universal Ruth in contracting thank you so much but yet again by the beer\nWhen I moved here and two thousand and four I remember flying in from my interview and seeing a blue tarp on every single\nRoof [laughter] oh yeah yeah that was about the right time is Florida say yeah that's a that's what we call hurricane\nHurricane aftermath I'm at a time it's hard yeah in oddly enough we're kind of back or we're almost back to that same place or the last year or so with herb or after Hurricane Irma\nAbsolutely I I tell you still um every day and my ... I hear the seven thirty alarmed about ... and he goes here roof\nGoing out of their guns those guys just work for working hard yeah\nAmazing I I'm not going to pretend to know much about you know\nRoofing and when you need a roof and how do you know when you need a roof and that's what you hear you I mean when I bought my last house they were like you're going to need a new and I'm like okay right so we had a great experience and you know we so we we went to the store pretty well\nBut let's say you don't know how long you've had the roof up there or previous owner or\nWhat are some of the signs that may be time you need to be thinking about a new\nSure that's a great question um and I think there's a lot of people out there in the same situation they're not sure now\nIt's pretty obvious when you have water coming in your house and you see water spots on the ceiling water might be literally running into your house or the ceiling ... that's an obvious sign that you got you know some issues going on with your roof\nUm but you know a majority of people aren't necessarily in that situation where they've got a hole in the roof or a water pouring in although it does happen and we still have a lot of customers in that situation but\nUh you know one of the things that you need to be looking for is you know just uh just the shape of the shingles you know if you have um a pool deck or you have a ... a um maybe up front front driveway and you notice every time it rains that there's a little granular on your point\nThat you know talking about yeah maybe\nIn your pool alive we'll see them washed into the pool or the number one way to fight\nThat is just in carefully do so um grab a ladder jump up and look in your gutters if you have gutters and if you see not just gunk like dirt but you actually see what looked like a tiny little bubbles yeah I Know that is the ah that is the shingles that are eventually you know washing I'll see\nA lot of people have the idea that um shingles and should should last thirty forty fifty years which in theory they should but in Florida it's own other right so you know it's it's a whole different beast here we have\nHumidity we have rain we have constant sunshine\nSo the shingles are just taking a beating day after day after day and so I mean it's the same thing is like the paint on your car or other things that you put out in the sun it's gonna fade it's going to wear and tear same thing happens with the roof you know the rain that we have the when the we have hurricane and whatnot so\nUm to know a the time exactly those are some of the ... the signs I'm In the main thing I Would say is if you're not sure ... call universal ... roofing contracting and have come out and look and give you an idea a lot of times I'm On the sales manager and so I have a great sales team of guys that come out\nThey assess what's going on they see hey this is happening or this isn't happening and you know the thing about us as we are going to be honest and up front and say hey you might have some life left in this roofer hey you're in a situation where you either have damage or if you don't do something soon you will have damage\nI'm so that that's kind of that's kind of what we're looking for when we go and look at a roof obviously of shingles are laying in the yard or you know yeah that kinda stuff like that yeah you need to call us\nEver walking out after the storm and and seeing singles in the yard and going okay those aren't mine right that was not my right\nYet I had one of my guys was at a at a at a measure call we call it when we come out and look at your house the other day and he actually found shingles on a roof but the roof was perfectly fine he looked next door and it was the neighbors shingles that were to have alone across and had landed on the other neighbors roof\nThey've been up there since Hurricane Irma they've been up there for what you know we're almost a year now or whatever it is so um yeah so have you got shingles in your yard you know at the white\nUm obviously you know hurricanes something we do have to think of around here and and I think a lot of people if you weren't around for ... for\nLearned a lot last year and it is there a way like okay we're we're already and hurricanes he's in Alberta is there a way it kind of on this prepare yourself\nNuts that that's a good question um the answer is no [laughter] I mean a roof is a roof right and so um you know obviously you know there's hurricane preparation obviously to get ready but you know that's just the unfortunate thing when we get into a situation where it's an act of God right it's it's something that we can't control I mean\nAh when you have a hundred plus mile an hour when\nYou're literally just gone OK please you know don't do you know don't blow that tree over don't blow my shingles off um you know unfortunately there's um there's no way to know for sure so one of the things that we see often as we've seen groups that have been done in the last ten years that have lost shingles\nA with some amazing employees in there and they will take care of all of your information they'll\nThey'll ask you some questions will receive all that information and the ... they're going to really that to our sales team so it's not like you're just calling some random person leaving a message in hiding
