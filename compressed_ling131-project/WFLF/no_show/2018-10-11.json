this is money talks powered by your hometown bank trust go bank al surprise off tonight so I'm going solo so\nBear with me a little bit here because I Am not a radio personality I talked about bi weekly mortgages before the break actually before both breaks and I wanted to finally get into what they are and why they're special bi weekly mortgages nothing gimmicky about bi weekly mortgage it's purely the math\nAnd tropical banks we don't sell mortgages we can offer these bi weekly mortgages and we're proud to do so and I have had one I just actually paid it off a proud to say but I had one for\nYears and it's really I Can't encourage anyone\n... enough to when you get a mortgage to get a bi weekly mortgage\nAnd this is what it is basically if you take a normal monthly payment\nOn a normal monthly loan\nYou'll make a ... a monthly payment as everyone knows I'm for a thirty year alone it's three hundred and sixty payments on a fairly typical loan amount these days of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars say that works out to at current interest rates of eight hundred and little under eight hundred and Seventeen dollars\nAre at a current interest rate of five and an eighth so that's what everyone offers as a normal monthly payment and a hundred and fifty thousand is about eight hundred and sixty dollars\nNow if you do a bi weekly payment what happens is you split that half and make it twice you make it every two weeks you make half that payment four hundred and eight dollars so you're still paying the same amount but you're doing it half every two weeks\nNow most of us get paid every two weeks so and I'll finish off with that at the end 'cause it's another side benefit my opinion\nBut what happens is because you're making that payment quicker or every two weeks instead of waiting a whole month\nYou're paying the interest that builds up down quicker even though you're making the same amount of payments and what it means is you're going to save a heck of a lot of interest over the life of the loan for instance normal monthly payment at today's rate of five and ...\nYou're going to pay one hundred forty four thousand dollars in interest over that thirty year period\nIf you have a bi weekly payment\nThe same five and an eighth same Thirty years same hundred and fifty thousand dollars you're gonna pay one hundred and Seventeen thousand eight hundred and Ninety One dollars of interest over Thirty years in other words uh twenty six thousand dollar savings\nIn interest that you can do with whatever you want to put it in your IRA by something for the house save\nA Christmas club whatever you want to do\nSo and that's just the math of paying it a little bit quicker\n[noise] now let's compare this in a rising rate environment um say you found a competitor to us that offered a thirty year alone at four point seven five [noise] if you'll be hard pressed to do that now especially without points let's just say for argument's sake you did\nSo their monthly payment on a normal monthly payment will be seven hundred and eighty two dollars versus eight hundred and sixteen for our normal monthly payment well that's easy I'm going to go with the competitor because their payments last right now maybe\nIf you get a bi weekly with us\nAs I said earlier over the life of the loan you're going to pay a hundred and Seventeen thousand dollars in interest [noise]\nIf you go with a competitor at a lower interest rate but make the normal monthly payment\nYou are going to pay them one hundred thirty one thousand dollars in interest so even though their interest rates less because with our bi weekly you're paying every two weeks half the payment you're not paying any more money just splitting it to you pay the interest down quicker\nBut since you have the same payment you pay a little bit extra principle with a bi weekly you don't with a normal monthly and over time that builds up that's almost a fourteen thousand dollar savings in interest even though their interest rate is less\nSo I Know that is probably not the easiest thing to illustrate on the radio but it just shows you that a bi weekly payment just by the fact that you're paying a little bit quicker uh makes a big difference now the other way to look at it\nIs it short term it alone a obviously a thirty year alone is Thirty years three hundred and sixty monthly payments but\nOn a bi weekly payment it's six hundred and fifty six payments every two weeks it sounds like a lot yeah but divide six hundred and fifty six by twenty six payments a year you're going to pay the loan often twenty five point two years\nSo in other words you essentially get five years free I'm Alone if you want to look at it that way\nSo bi weekly payment pays loan off quicker and you pay a heck of a lot less interest that can't stress enough the value of getting a pie bi weekly payment if you're in the market and again not many banks do them in the few that do will charge you for the servicing on than we do them\nWe do not charge you for the surveys servicing of those so I really consider you're looking for a mortgage try to get a bi weekly especially if you get a pretty consistent pay check 'em as most of us do every two weeks [noise] excuse me\nThen of course you can reach us a trust Quebec dot com you can reach us at four O. seven six five nine five seven zero

mayor of Orange County yeah and it is it's there's not a lot of the where the county has a kind of municipal form of government\nI've known that for over eleven minutes now I have you know we're getting so wouldn't a kid I Love very very educated now or tried to say it like it was just like common knowledge on my ... now there was a ... and the very first of those mayors was\nLinda cheap and and so um uh we uh we just kind of talked through the whole break to which was which is really fun so to continue that conversation I'm\nYou know fourteen schools and twelve years and so you kind of you you've never had you know roots anywhere specifically and then you said we're gonna we're moving to Orlando who knows what it's named after but we're going to move there and we're gonna we're gonna put down deep roots and then you got involved um\nWhat was it that made you I Know you've got involved with the league of women voters and and uh and then several a lot of other things um but what was it the kind of turned her attention towards specific things was there any specific um\nCause you were interested in any any reason for that or was it just kind of like hey I just want to see where I can help and and just kind of drawn name that have had\nYou know that's a question that one could think about for a long time and you've just given me thirty seconds yeah [laughter] um\nI think that everyone has a background that influences the choices they make in life I've been particularly interested just this last few days and listening to John McCain story and yeah\nYou know so well that it was his father and his grandfather and their military careers and so much influence is\nWho you become and of course my parents did as well\nUh my my mother was a social worker during the depression wow in in Detroit Michigan and care deeply about people's troubles my dad was someone who was passionate about fairness and really taught me to value\nThe idea that people ought to all have an equal shot yeah and uh that led me to my college years when the sixties were beginning to happen and there was a lot of talk\nAbout many things particularly influencing me I Believe as a southerner\nGoing north to school I was in school in Michigan was the whole issue of civil rights and all the things I had grown up with\nThe fact that the Orlando train station and a water fountain Mark White people and a water fountain marked colored people and\nThings that I might not have even been conscious of in terms of their injustice suddenly became very very important to me and that led me to uh the march on Washington with Dr mindless account I Can't believe I Can't\nYou know unit are basically contemporaries and I was involved in the civil rights movement as well but just a little bit later and I missed the march and what was that like you got to tell us a story about what that was like\nYou know I thought about that a a good deal on the fiftieth anniversary of the march and what I what I must tell you is that\nWhen you are living something that becomes history\nYou don't know it you don't know that you're going through something that fifty years later people will be celebrating an anniversary and talking about the meaning of it you know it was it was something that brought a lot of young people together and it was an event that I Will always cherish\nBut it was not some great historic thing that we all felt we had to be part of the\nAnd it was going to be historic I don't know how to explain it All right well no you did yeah that well that makes sense I mean it's it's when\nYou're living through something that's truly of historical impact or the moment itself is is so involving so capturing you know that it's about that moment it's not about its own it's almost the opposite of the cell the\n... generation of of of I'm going to I'm going to enshrine this moment that I was in the McDonald's drive through by taking my picture six times it's you're you're you're so involved\nIn your ... up and yeah you know if you don't think about yourself and I don't think about where you are and what it is you're doing you're just an air yeah living that moment\nYeah was it uh I mean it must have been relatively uncommon or maybe this this might be just historical ignorance speaking here uh but you're you're saying how your father really did talk a lot about fairness and and everybody have an equal equal shot\nUm when I put together the timeline on that that must have been a relatively uncommon message to have growing up I mean did that did you feel like you had a different take on that then the people know as as you were in for six months at a time\nNot not at all I think I think probably most people had that kind of a father in those times um he was he was a businessman he was he had flown a fighter plane in World War two\nUm he was a very devoted family man and\nHad come from a very small family himself and so cherished his own ... and ... don't you think that we all had fathers we looked up to respected it wasn't that he preached to me about anything it wasn't that he talked about civil rights even he he just talked about how people ought to have a fair deal\nYou know I I I Do think that I think that that was kind of thankfully very common in the U. S. it's curious to me though that we avoided applying that to racial inequalities for so long\nAre you asking me questions that one could talk about for you it's All right\nAh it it was a fascinating experience for me because I had been very committed to some of those earlier social costs is certainly I'm which talked about civil rights have been equally committed to the women's movement of all the civil rights really remains the passion of my adult life\nUh and and suddenly we were in the met stuff another social movement and another changing moving target\nAnd I must tell you when I taught that course I had not come all the way around to marriage equality um and it was my students who challenged me they were there mhm uh they had\nHad experiences and I think I'm a big part let me ask for your reaction a big part of the of the\nWhat seemed almost like the overnight achieving of the goals of the game of ... ... was the fact that suddenly you realized well\nMy dentist is gay ... uncle John Kerry is dean of students sure\nAnd suddenly when people were able or felt brave enough to make that declaration about who they were who they are yeah they were our friends they were our neighbors they were our relatives so the kids were there before I ... yeah\nExactly and that's that's I think that's the greatest motivation for social change is the greatest motivation for any kind of of behavior\nOr in that you want for those you love\nThe best life you know it was the reason that people went off to war they didn't go off to war just a ... for an ideal of the United states but because they want to protect their families their children and their grandchildren uh to have a good a safe country\nUm and you know all those soldiers you know my dad was in World War two also they all had you know pictures of their sweethearts from home and their kids and all of the ...\nAnd so that is probably the greatest motivation of social change is that is not what you think or what your opinion is is the people you love and the people you know um and and so\nI I but I Do want to ask you a question before we get ... our time is growing short um\nWhat what issues for land do do you see in the future that we need to address\nWhat are some of the major challenges that we have they don't have to be you know deep and morose uh but but just as a as a city\nOr your heart's been in this city for for very long time um and and either as it is a city or state what do we need to address in the near future\nI'll tell you I for traffic [laughter] were you were talking to her well [laughter] yeah well no I figure it's one of hers also\nAnd it goes beyond die for it and we understand that I for is under construction and you know we hope we live long enough to see it late at night but but transportation and congestion are clearly\nVery big issues in any city like ours and it's in part because of our history\nOr if you lived in Pittsburgh or Boston you grew slowly ... you had trolley cars I'm you grew like an oak tree in circles you didn't grow all of a sudden and way out in the country and suddenly\nEverybody had a car fascinated yeah that is true Adam\nAnd about in the south I remember our gross because of way back because of the civil war and our growth came much more slowly and after World War two when people came back from that war they could have a car\nThey could have a house in the suburbs they wanted that quarter acre lot with a picket fence and and so suddenly gross became a very different thing and we were both the\nBeneficiaries and inherited many of the problems we didn't have a transit system that had turned from trolleys into subways yeah oh yeah we had cars and highlights and look at Atlanta that's a perfect example\nThat's really yeah I mean the way you describe that it's almost like a northern cities they kinda got to start with a skeleton and then put muscle and bone and we we just kind of started with this this fully formed there's organs and and and every time\nBut there's not there's not a structure built\nWell imagine harsher Disney happened to us and that had an enormous benefits and also brought challenges you know and so yes a short answer to your question we have to figure out a way to deal with traffic transportation and congestion\nAnywhere in Florida we have to care deeply about protecting our environment yes it is so threatened it is so much responsibility of every public servant we have in this state tonight", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "11"}
