[laughter]\nI'd say that's a pretty easy call\nA we're speaking with Lawrence ... he's the president of foundation for economic education as fee dot org I wanted to ask you are you a long term optimist uh for the state of liberty and human flourishing\nI Am because I don't see the point of this pessimism I don't know the future but I Do know that there have been many times in the past when things look awfully dark for people who believed and things like liberty and\nAnd they prevailed ah and so I think the moment you become pessimistic a couple of bad things happen one is you don't work as hard as you should or could for what you know to be right and the second thing that happens is\nUh other good people will not be attracted to your cause if if they get the impression from you that it's a lost one of ... you know from the very start so I think it's important to be optimistic because uh that encourages the good people to work for the right things\nWhat success look like to you you've had a a luxurious career in advancing liberty and one that I Would like to look to as a role model what is success look like to you as you look back at your career\n[laughter] well no one ... of course could ever say because we're all humans that we dealt with every situation properly or that we didn't fail on occasion but it would be nice to look back and say I'm successful or have been because I tried my best to return to the extent I could have to do what I felt was right\nI I spoke truth to power I tried to be the best example I could be for my children for my friends for my co workers and and the other's a society\nBut once I knew what the right thing was I was it quick to abandon that I worked for it in my mind that's success it's not to find so much in terms of a material things as it is I'm a kind of a spiritual accomplishment uh\nUh I'd like to be able to say that the most successful life is one that it which character was put first and foremost and you've you've shown as an example\nUh or shined which whatever the word is as a a great exemplar of character for other people to emulate\nThat reminds me of a T shirt that we saw one times they collect moments not things in the end of our lives when we're gone\nIt's we exist as stories that people tell of each other and I would like that people would a desire to have a story told about them that they did everything they could within their talents set to advance human being and wellness in a way that doesn't use\nSacrifice like well if I had vans most people but I did have to sacrifice that one guy you know [laughter] yeah\nThat would be a pretty big black mark on one is a a career if they if you had to say that\nI think that's what Jesus offers people that want to imitate his life and say hey look\nWe can advance in history we can move forward we can be bound together we can unite together over mercy not sacrifice that's the choice we all have to make every day we make that in our workplace if we're treat people less than us we make that in the ballot box and we say you know\nLet's stick it to these guys let's take from them let's put him in a cage you know and younger them among the violent ones you know we had that choice in everything we do and I think what's your example\nIllustrates for us and they were writing and what you do and you're speaking is\nThat it's not appropriate to you ever sacrifice even one person\nYeah you're absolutely right and I would encourage your listeners to visit our website and type in the was Jesus a socialist that so that say I've written which takes a look at is perspectives on what we would today regard as economic matters and\nI find them to be a great defender of things like uh honesty and truth and our dealings are the marketplace and he's a great defender of a private property and the the creation of wealth is they're good things that are to offer denigrate it today but I think our savior would ah give us a very

things underneath the big headlines on the cable channels and that's people just like\nYou struggling to fight for the liberty and to love their neighbor using their talents as they can to make their life and their family and their friends better\nThe problems we have they're not that difficult to solve but the the key ingredient is to have courage to rethink the founding\nKind of a parameters that the establishment wants us to keep us keep us locked into this kind of negative frequency we can create a new frequency of thought were all resonating on a whole new plane a far and that involves positive thinking together\nThe problems and finding solutions that don't require violence right that's the problem we have today you have violence these shootings is horrific shootings people blaming other people because they're a part of a race give me a break this is atrocious this is ... this was a joke\nAnybody that wants to shoot people because they belong to another race or a tribe radiology that someone who's given up their mind to group thinks so bad they become a shrunken saw a sick person who wants to harm people because they look like another human that don't like or something\nThis is a weak victim mentality that his plaguing many people and we cannot succumb to it we have to have a winter's energy because life is not a zero sum game wife is not oh I win in order for me to when you've got to lose I got to take something from you got to steal\nSome money from you know raise your taxes regulate your business you know a villain eyes you run you off of social media somehow I got to make\nI got to take some flash from you in order for me to feel good that's not the way life has to be that's not how adults actually make things work\nWe have a win win mentality that's ... ... west heroes that's what people that love their families they have a win win mentality\nWhen you're making a family happy everybody wins it's not oh well dad wins therefore the kid loses no no no no that's not how normal functioning healthy life is about so that's the key principles that we need to take into this election season no matter what happens\nDon't rely on these politicians as your idols to solve the problems for you\nYou can get passionate about it you can get into it\nAnd there's some real things at stake that they can have some influence over for sure but the moment we rely our hopes and dreams and cast them into these characters\nOr we're going to lose sight of what really matters so I wrote a few principals down that I Want you to take away these are the things that these are the issues that if we solve these problems those of us who love free markets we love freedom\nWe love virtue and self responsibility if we take these principles and we say I'm going to solve these posts\nIt was a guy that I'm gonna look on line I'm going to go to alternative sources and find people who are creating these solutions for these issues\nAnd back then either through promoting their work on your social media or telling your friends about it or whether you can do it yourself all anybody can be involved if we if we figure creative way so here's a few things the average person will keep going along with big government until those of us who believe in the power of the market\nTo solve the biggest anxieties\nThe state presumes to confront these are the issues that we have to solve we have to solve health\nThan the damaging pollution that is caused by\nA ... that we have to solve a rare earth minerals having access reliable access to rare earth minerals another issue the stakes says that they can solve the only they can solve his illnesses and medicine\nHealth care and the other one is transportation you know so we can solve health right let's look at how for say for example\nWe have this belief that only Washington can manage our medicine for us\nThat only we got to pick and choose you know who's going to manage a big giant FDA we don't need that what we need to do is actually saw\nA these chronic illnesses ourselves and so that's why we have people like Dr ... come on the program where he is a cancer researcher who's using a you know Peter Jennings diet instead of big expensive government paid for medicine right and if we want to solve\nThings like ah you know our pollution right we can solve pollution by looking into clean energy things that the market people there's there's some kind of and venture out there right now who's working on a clean energy technology that won't rely on a dime of government subsidy\nWe need to support people like those guys look I'm up\nThere on YouTube and online I Know some of these people working on alternative energies that don't rely on a Saudi Arabian oil or some big government scheme this kind of taxes to death and regulators today\nSo there's all kinds of solutions whether it's and health whether it's in pollution energy whether it's in transportation which is related to energy or or even rare earth minerals okay there are ways to create rare earth minerals from common mental there's ways to do that I've seen evidence of it\nThere are people out there doing things that the science says you can't do because they don't rely on the status quo to solve them they solve these problems themselves I Want you all think of that as we go into this election season to the final week\nLook for those real heroes those real heroes on the front lines because those are the things that we can have hope and that we can actually advance real change in the world for\nIf you want to email me David Adam

Noreen by asked that but that's that's my view on it um and of course my opinion is always worth what you pay for it but uh it just seems to me if you had a\nBusiness reason for being that was different than your personal reasons for being\nOr was not somehow connected it would be income grew it really is that makes sense absolutely I mean it would be at cross purposes with each other if they weren't somehow running can ruin or parallel or subset or something but ... the way I visualize what the easiest for me a subset\nThat make sense it does thank you very much thanks for stopping

uh well\nUh two years ago my family was there and you're lobby and we did a debt free scream and a and then I feel like we've really been able to you know a clear outfit opened up for our income has doubled and while a lot of really positive spiritual or you know direction sort of opened up to us\nUm and those are you know that those things but we really thought it was sort of a recovery they'll bring things up because we are starting to do things right and really what I see now is that he was preparing to throw it was what was about to come which is that we have a we have three boys the youngest is ten months [noise]\nAnd uh our youngest has Down syndrome\nAnd so uh right now we're actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church and we're just getting to the part where we're ah we're working on it will go in and so because we have this special needs a issue we we get involved or attorney and getting our will together good and through that conversation we uh you\nKnow I'm a we've been discussing a special needs ... well that has to play in planning for our baby's future\nYeah your animal ... sure uh originally a kind of had that chopped up\nIn my mind is that that special needs ... kind of function the way that the other boys have a college fund and baby step five\nUm the uh and that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special condition special rules because of course\nYeah and then go by the houses in the cars and all that good stuff and you still have plenty left over after I've course you know take care of your parents mom and dad that kind of stuff\nYeah so what would you do though in that situation if you want a billion dollars what would you do with what was going through your mind when Mike I Would still do the show with you is that measures such a liar I Will do this and you're working\nAnd I wish I would just be my own largest client you know that's all and I would uh just sort of thing where the look at it than ours yet but there would be a there would definitely be a a home in Breckenridge it's probably something in northern Georgia maybe ... or something like that to come over you of course you can't we're going to do the show from there sometimes\n[laughter] are you really did think through\nDid do you know how many hours it is the drive it seven and a half hours or Orlando it like to Atlanta and then Atlanta to Asheville maybe was a\nThree and then I had no idea how far east Williamsburg was from Asheville um and that's like that was that was five hours wow\nSo I had to do well on the road and sent it to the ... show and what I always what I Would do if I Won the lottery a lot of\nA mega mega millions billboards that you probably passed away\nThere were there were and ah yeah a minute I heard it was South Carolina I you know I realized after all those tickets away I realized it wasn't me now I didn't throw them away but I knew I wasn't going to say you can still maybe you've got just a couple of the numbers don't you still when something\nI think so I I handed it over to the uh auditor and uh she informed me that I think we want a dollar\nOr so you could buy another ticket so there's that [laughter]\nNow than it's not as fun [laughter] a billion dollars or nothing [laughter] so\nSpeaking of millionaires or the number of account holders with the balance of at least a million dollars in their four one K. rose by forty nine thousand to a hundred and sixty eight thousand people from the second quarter of twenty Seventeen oh cute too of twenty eight team\nIs that just because the stock market went up a lot and people are you know investing in their four one K. just like you you're investing in your four one K. right my bike by\nMy uh actually I I I'm actually going to make a profit okay how's that working for him to set it up okay All right I'm not going to I'm not going to stop by and you're stuck on whatever ... yeah I actually do have a question okay I actually do have a question by four one K.\n... when you get started I mean is there like a minimum that you should put it in like ... I Know this I had four excellent\nQuestion no there's not a minimum there is not a minimum but I think sometimes what helps is if you think about the end goal so for instance I've got numbers big surprise um if you were twenty five\nAnd you wanted a million dollars at age sixty five at assuming I'd you know average right of return to seven percent conservative or no real estate you your monthly contribution would be four hundred and five dollars a month\nOkay you can't afford not to do that right now if you wait until your age thirty five it more than double it's eight hundred and fifty five dollars a month to get to that million dollars at age sixty five and seven\nPercent or not and like you said I mean most people don't have a million dollars for one day when they retire do they know but it's a goal\nYou know it's it but it's predicated on um what that number needs to be in order to produce enough income for you to live your life for the rest of you know ... to to take on all the money that you need to annually to live the rest of your life Dodger so you're kind of trying to solve for what bucket of money\nOr will generate you know of four or five percent um withdrawal rate that'll last me to say Ninety two or a hundred and Fifteen which is probably what you'll live to write\nBy already knows so here's here's the scary thing if you wait until age fifty\nTo get that million dollars at age sixty five what do you have to invest per month my two thousand dollars\nThirty two hundred dollars a month to I was even low yeah wow thirty two hundred dollars a month if the uh we'll get you to that million dollars at seven percent a annual average return now here's the other factor so thirty two hundred a month is what per year Mike\n... thirty eight thousand four hundred dollars [laughter] so if you're on your four one K. was going to blow up a ... that's a guy\nOr if you were putting in thirty eight thousand four hundred dollars a year is what you need to put in what would you say you're maximizing the four one K. what would that be at age fifty\nAnd I and I'll help you it'd be the Eighteen thousand plus a eighty thousand five hundred per year plus the your age fifty and my example catch up of\nFive I'm of another ah um six thousand dollars a year at twenty four thousand five hundred dollars you'd still need to do an additional call at fourteen grand we could do in a\nA ... your spouse is this starting with zero like or do you have to put it like\nWhen you when you start if you put it like a thousand to begin with another bus every bought out of that one yes this is assuming we're we're assuming and my example starting at zero\nOkay so you're at zero then you put four hundred dollars in every month ... four hundred and five a month into your age sixty five you can do it I'm actually why can't do that much but I'm thinking about it I'm actually glad we did this because that does make me feel a little more comfortable okay good\nSo may be on the I don't know too doesn't time that I bring\nIt on our show that will actually have any but I hold at it\nWe find open enrollment for other things that are companies so it's made me think about it and so I've had to look at it\nOkay All right well I'm not going to give up I've gotten more on that will have to talk about next time but I'm I'm I'm not going to let this go my you should bring in your information and we'll\nGo through it okay All right so I don't want people to know how much I make its first\nTell them that their mutual fund option [laughter] I Know of that stuff so [noise] All right well\nThis is a hairy over ten of the smart money show with HBO and I appreciate you listening happy Halloween out there go out there trick or treat with your kids have fun and to quote the great Benjamin Franklin an investment and knowledge pays the best interest there'll be smart with your money have a good night [noise]\nOne of the things that I see the most as a boy a financial advisor or people who think it's too late to continue saving for retirement some don't even realize that it's wise to get a second opinion\nJust to make sure that they are on track to reaching those retirement goals my office is aware that each client is different\nAnd we work towards what will help the individual the most one tool that we use as the financial plan which gives you better insight to saying what it will take to reaching those goals called a schedule your appointment at four O. seven eight nine five twenty four thirty a feminist represented the rights of insecurity in investment advice resources of devoid financial advisor ...

is\nWhat God wants you know um but I realized that I'm human and I could miss here this and but I'm doing the best I can and I'll always followed him the best I can but there are people who say no I heard from God\nAnd and I'm certain and you're wrong and this is what he told me and and you know while I while I respect their right to be that certain\nUm um I look at\nMany of the biblical figures or the great heroes in the Bible and face didn't mean certainty invade meant that you follow got as much as you knew and hoping\nThat he would intercede for you and depending on him not depending on

I lay down and play dead\n[laughter] one I Am in Iowa [laughter]\nWell that's ... that's a that's a survival tactic [laughter] um but ... but but the other point of this is that when we\nUm when we're around people who are different than we are and think differently and they have different cultural norms and different backgrounds and different understand into different perspectives [noise]\nUm if we can see them as a way to um grow as a way to understand more than those become a strength and not a weakness\nThere's part of a show that are built to\nUh want to agree with the people who have a different opinion uh and so it's not just do you agree with me is if I listen to you a long enough I Want to agree with you I Want to understand you\nAre and and therefore part of me at least we'll understand you and feel closer to you I think that's part of our nature also\nYeah I agree I mean and and part of what makes us humans I mean what part of what you know put sapiens or after after that you know homo sapiens and instead of just being ... it's it's this idea of\nOf communication shared knowledge building on knowledge over generations because you're not losing knowledge each time and words can you know informing let you think more abstract thoughts that let us work together better um and then it's almost like got built up to a certain point where like now we can communicate really well\nUh let's cut off the ability to to learn from people that don't think the same way as us I'm\nOne of the things that I feel like would be helpful to point out uh and and get your thoughts on is\nThe idea of very very very different opinions on very important issues that's not new I mean that that's something that's been around a I mean even if you just go back even if you just stay within America you can go back to before we had the names in the United states of America you can go back to you know Continental Congress isn't\nA and and even people that were first you know the meaning sons of liberty and all that you know when the idea was a these are still rebels they even had different idea about what what it meant to be a rebel and they had different ideas on how to form the government and that and they were real I mean ... shooting each other\nAll time Hamilton and ... I mean yeah yeah do olean that that difference was that they were as vehemently opposed to each other and yeah sometimes it lead to violence\nUh but I don't think back then you'd doubted the owner of the other person or you doubted at least they had um um somehow the right to be a worthy opponent ... uh I think the difference is these days\nUm that we doubt people's integrity we demean them in our minds we think they're somehow less\nI I don't think a Alexander Hamilton ever thought Aaron Burr was an idiot or ... or or an intelligent yeah we tend to think other people are idiots um and and they just don't\nUm they don't measure up to the full human standard and when we do that I was just thinking of\nYou know both of us I've read these uh twelve lessons for life ... a burden be Jordan Jordan Peterson\n... Peterson [laughter] Peterson yeah finished and uh and he talked to in that in that book about our primal instinct\n'em to literally chair somebody who is weaker than we are remembered that the Jane Goodall was it ... it was was observing chimpanzees yeah and for years she didn't want to admit to herself\nHow brutal they could be within their own tribe ... and how they could literally tear each other apart and eat each other's flash or because that was part of the primal instinct and so we still have that primal instinct the differences we can decide to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "31"}
