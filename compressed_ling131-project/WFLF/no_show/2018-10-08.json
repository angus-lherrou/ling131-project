E. C. usa dot com\n[noise]\nRecords or where you're from you're from a shelter here's this is the gun tech usa segment of the program\nI talked to our good friends on a contract usa was last night over over the bar beer there were a little grilling while armed or feel gave me a call out there and a great new guys yeah some new products coming our way I should have the next week or two so we can we can test evaluate and talk about them on the air here he's got some new stuff coming out before it hits the\nThe ... the open market in January ... shots show where he he makes all his big is big ah you know a presentations and we were in ... so we're we're gonna be able to present it to you folks are you know send you some uh\nSome pictures in ah listen when we're done with it [noise] we usually give that stuff away so you know that's good for you good for you out there\nI I Want to talk to about a bump stocks were going to talk about some bumps stocks\nThe president this week said we're close to knocking out bump stocks what's going above ... do you want to\nTalk bump stocks are described bump stocks are the folks out there you know how bumps are kind of works and\nBump stock is basically a a spring or a recall initiated a device that attaches rural farm so that it replaces the standard show her stock\nThe kinetic energy of the round being fired drives the mechanism into compression\nAnd therefore by driving the mechanism forward the the actual receiver bright forward so that you're you pull the trigger in your hands stays in the same place the gun recalls away from your finger\nAnd then ... back into your finger so without you moving the trigger reset itself and slams the trigger back into your finger\nMakes the gun a period of fire in a photo mode although the triggers been pulled twice it was pulled twice\nFaster theoretically then you could pull it without that mechanical advantage right or harnesses the recall energy\nOf the round being fired to move the entire farm inside of them just stock assembly\nSo that it simulates full auto fire because the theory is the human being can't pull the trigger that fast clearly they have never watched Jerry Maguire village everybody remembers ruined because uh he can run almost as fast as many\nVia the bump stocks as a suffered plenty of people are in in our industry and you know the gun rights industry and ... say that uh well you know they're trying to defend them saying there's a reason to knock him out because it all worked out well listen if if you've got a a bump stock and uh you can't give it to work that well it's because you're you're doing something wrong\nYou can tune it to them as if it's a it's like\nIt's like a high performance vehicle you you know how to tune it the way it needs to be tuned Gary we have the skills\nYou you took a you know at three hundred and fifty horse power three fifty and now you're pushing seven ... yeah it doesn't make any legal right it's not what it does it's how you use it and therein lies the rub I'm going to ban everything that has more than a five hundred horsepower engine\nSimply because if you want to have five one horsepower engine we know you're going to use it wrong right um and that's not really the way this works\nOr it's not supposed to be what it is capable of doing it supposed to be\nWhat you're going to do with it now the way that the uh the Trump Administration is working this out this is great is this was knew this was a piece of news I didn't know that this is the heat they're going to change the definition a machine gun under the national firearms act ... many states out\nThere have just on bump stocks are illegal writers talked about Maryland we know Florida as many states out their California just did it said bump stocks are illegal they're doing it a different way\nYeah if if they change the definition of a machine gun in the national firearms act\nAnd they actually change the national firearms act they they don't do it by letter which the ATF often does they'll just right they'll make a ruling by letter um which is what happens with the act to accelerate your stock they did it by letter\nOr works on very much the similar mechanism and the reason that the ATF said it's not a machine gun when ... came out is because they couldn't make it work [laughter] they didn't they didn't ask him to come to show us how that works right now and so it and they didn't confiscate the stock\nThey confiscated this spring that made the stock work right which by the way it was a forty five officers model\n[laughter] just just because you were wondering ... just ... just for reference this it's for ... or ... the way they're going to try to handle this is they're going to change the term machine gun to include bump stocks devices\nI devices allow a semi automatic fire you shoot more than one around with the single pull the trigger by harnessing the recall energy of the semi automatic farm\nToo which is a fix so that the trigger reset and continues to fire with out additional physical manipulation\nOf the trigger by the shooter okay I can say something the guy that wrote that he's a gun guy and a lawyer and it wasn't me where a guy that I've written the right way yeah it doesn't include everything else\nThat may ex\nAccelerate the speed at which you can fire a firearm like\nA fountain in that thing as far as you can go and you know what they're going to stop what they're doing and drag your broken and bleeding body out of there and they're probably not going to reconvene for for two or three minutes somebody's got to know that they're gonna be Seventy and they go on to traumatic it's too dramatic I'm\nI'm too distraught over what happened and they're gonna they're gonna stop it in the back or you know it's it's it's\nGoing to stop you know after ... absolutely\nHave to restore order and the gallery [noise] he must have\nSaid that it's vice president and they're not just creating a tie there because he said he wanted to be there for a historic vote it continued\nMarkey or they're just trying to get through the world like cat feel [noise]\nMcConnell has sort of ...\nGoing to be out there about halfway through so you can hear there like if you started arms who he is a senator you know there's this one on one but I got you know he's got a couple of them he's got a couple of guys yeah yeah yeah yeah so what the white zip ties you so you know they're they're they're pulling them out there I I think like like you said Kevin ...\nPerhaps uh let them jump if that doesn't work um you know the the you know you've got the taser give them a taser Ricky you know throwing up\nHis taser face it\nI saw that guy [laughter] name strikes fear and those that here it not really um ... look that's not the process that you you you were supposed to have voted for the people you wanted to have be your representatives\nYou they know what they're supposed to do for their constituencies\nAnd they're not supposed to vote their conscience they're supposed to vote their constituent concept no senator should have been listening to what their ... relatives states are saying about this process they're not supposed to go up there we know what\nI Know that everyone from my home state wants this to happen but I'm not going to do it because I just don't think they're smart enough right right that's not the way this is supposed to work you're a representative of your state\nNot the conscience of your state correct you're supposed to vote the way they want you to and believe me when I tell you I'm pretty sure they all got the message\nYeah you know I think that's what you're going to see from if he keeps his word or you center a mansion they're out of West Virginia now he's a Democrat and a red state\nAnd the people of West Virginia made it clear yeah you're voting for us not for California I Try uh and so he has ... going to be crossing party lines and voting for camera because that's what the people his state those that are reelected him now it doesn't hurt that he's a\nRe election year right now so he wants them to remember that he did exactly what they wanted him to do it and you know and then I got to\nTell you them folks from West Virginia or you make a mad enough they'll remember and they'll vote as you out yeah and then two years later they'll come by your house you better move to California to do is they'll pull you out in the parking lot and they will kill you or nothing but they might give you a boat well then you know\nThey may they may hum job are you guys ever been hung up in Pennsylvania ... and ... century how 'bout that will calculate it will give it to a confined or did you know that it's illegal to hunt in some on

going to like boundary ... just to be like I Do like America yeah this is real boundary old\nDistillery is nestled in the knobs of central Kentucky with beautiful woods waterfall and natural limestone spring the land was clearly made to be home of one of Kentucky's grade bourbon distilleries and it is\nOkay so it it does look like a space age toy drawn by a fifth grader goofy origins and cartoon

to fire the project al\n... the energy source isn't the problem you can come up with enough weight to beat it enough batteries it's hey keep pumping the project I was in ... keep it running and you do

powerful right there on our ass power powerful right they're\nAll right what we look at it as we seek to educate and empower you every single Saturday right here okay that's what we're trying to do that is what we do we bring clarity and misinformation you know where some more misinformation is Chris where's that most people don't realize your Social Security is going to be taxed potentially\nA Yeah Yup just talk with somebody ah yesterday about that\nSo whenever you go to get it back out mhm they're actually potentially if you're on the rise thresholds on income they're going to tax you on it\nAnd it thresholds are low so most people the majority of people out say are are going to have their Social Security tax\nNot only are all your other tax deferred accounts tax as ordinary income but your Social Security can be tax too that it's just keep coming that just doesn't seem right to me right but there is a solution if you have enough tax free income make a drop you blow a threshold\nAnd boom you're Social Security is not a tax anymore\nI set up one more time help me understand what you're saying\nIf you had tax free sources of income and your retirement tax free source of income tax free right they're going to look at that and they're going to see you don't maybe hit the threshold to get your Social Security taxes also you can potentially drop\nYour Social Security down for being attacks\nAre Sawyer says five enough tax free income coming in as good therefore lower my tax bracket and reportable and come to the IRS and they're going to look and I said hey he's not here she's not meeting the threshold we're not going to tax or Social Security is that what you're saying\nBoom you can potentially dropped attacks on that not only going to give tax free from another source which is nice right yeah tax free from there but you're so security's tax now what would normal people do right now hey they don't have ... and most people don't right now Chris what what should I Do about that\nWell if you don't have tax income one of the most powerful streams of income tax returns to pay taxes you need is you need to implement that right away\nAnd we hear about the national debt all the time I hear it probably every single day was it actually mean for us it means tax is potentially going to have to do a bright bright absolutely right that's what that's what everybody's talking about we know that right so are all your account is going to be taxed when that goes up\nA lot acts suffered yeah I mean a lot of people's their retirement accounts are going to be taxed most likely at a higher rate than they ever anticipated ... there's not thinking about it it's going to happen down the road\nSo a lot of people are what are called rolling the dice ride the roller dies in the future on this tax deferred accounts when I go to use them into retirement\nThe taxes are going to be lower right yeah 'cause that was that thank you\nAnd I was a logical that's basically it but what can they do what can they do a you know what can they develop Social Security being decks\nWhat can they do about taxes going up on them in the future and having to pay that actual higher tax burden kicking the can down the road rolling the dice that hey maybe hopefully taxes won't go up but we know they are what can what can the everyday American do well\nYou can not reinvent the wheel or you could do something that you're older well you've been doing for decades right you can use the same strategies that they've been doing\nApply them into your retirement creates some tax free and can we do it every single week here\nYeah we see two thousand people here that we see about eight eight ten well shoot I see about eight people you see a bit about eight people or other partners she's about eight people a day were jammed packed we do this every day\nI think one of the things that people to read this one is tragedies that got us featured in Forbes magazine was the tax free that we love to put into people's retirement right absolutely right that's what you can create ... ... it's never too late must be was like oh it's too late I'm I'm I'm a\nDown the river there is no fixing a now will know you can create tax free and your portfolio almost at any tax\nAll right well let's let's show them how to do it that we're going to do is we're we're going to have

expected to make landfall on the Gulf Coast in the middle of the week Florida governor Rick Scott I'm and\nSquare because it just doesn't happen or if if it's a you know nicer would return with with casing around it are those would casings um you know are they ...\nYou know for windows that you love to look out of that when it comes to replacement time you're like oh boy\nRight exactly and so yeah you have um\nYou know so yeah absolutely specialty windows costs more than than regular windows and Anderson is the the ... by Anderson is\nA really the premium a window on the market but also you know it has been developed and designed for the purpose of replacement and so in Florida you know we have a lot of existing homes that have aluminum single pain and glass windows so they're\nThey're horribly inefficient um you know your your energy in this area is yang all of that is absolutely you know and of course this summer's been super hot super rainy and uh and so you know where we are\nAre faced with the challenge is how do we make sure we install these highly energy efficient windows ... making sure that all the water proofing has done correctly and uh and that the customer home is beautify as well as really improve their energy efficiency\nNow I just had a situation in my house where we had a window that was the original winner to the house it leaked it created a mold situation and everything had to come out and describe the whole thing and you start\nTo really think about what's happening in my other windows at what point should you really start considering replacing your window at\nWell I think you know for that it does vary for for people you know I mean I think um you know if you look at your how home it was an older home bill\nYou know pray two thousand five you're going to have aluminum single pain windows mhm so you're going to have an efficient windows so that's something if if energy efficiency is is really important to you and reducing um\nKnow our carbon footprint or however you want to get a you know that that is a great reason to to get your windows replace you know because again in Florida I don't know why I'm builders always just thought hey this is Florida we don't need efficient windows and doesn't make sense because it's all\nA limit on that single paying windows um and it's you know and it's just doesn't make any sense [noise]\nUm and then another time would just be the function the deer windows operate do they do they operate well um do they uh you can you slide 'em up on on on the nice days when winter in in in the spring can you open your windows and and have a nice ah air flows through your home\nAnd you know a lot of times or the way some of the older windows when Alan ... systems and even the screen systems don't work\nI I had in my house I had a single pain aluminum windows and I couldn't open them not because they didn't work with because of the screen system was so seems silly that hey I Can't if my windows because of the screen won't actually keeping it\nIn out see I don't open some of my windows and the house now because I'm afraid the windows are going to come down like the the springs systems and um they they aren't super trustworthy as I'm sure as they once were and with a little one in the house my fear is that she's going to go to open a window or go play by the window and it's going to come down and so that's a red flag for me right there\nAbsolutely that is that is a concern and then um you know and so you do have to be careful with those things I also have a young kids and you know they get into everything absolutely or they're inquisitive they want they want to figure it out and then um\nYou know and then another reason it it's a very valid reason is they just don't look nice you know the the grills or falling if they do have to pay and there's a ... a seal failure in between so in between your glasses logging enough\nAnd and ah yeah doesn't doesn't look nice and you know so I'm actually in my front windows right [laughter] yeah or I'm [laughter] I mean I understand\nAnd uh uh we'd love to put some new ones in there for you but I you know so in our homes obviously our our biggest investment and we want to uh and I wanted to look beautiful\nYeah and functional and house it to help out with bills and whatnot and if you are intrigued a by what Jim and I are talking about here with no by ... and they do have unlimited offer going on right now at least it's for the first seven colors\nThat if you want to get the information go ahead and call now because ... percent off all windows and doors plus twenty percent off installation and just doing the quick math in my head that's a lot of money that you can save right now so you want to call\nA date for eight or nine for eight zero that's eight for eight for nine for eight\nZero if you want to take advantage of this which is happening right now for the first seven colors of the ... by ... percent off all windows and doors plus twenty percent off your installation\nAt eight eight eight for eight or nine for eight\nZero so like I've been talking with him about here I've been really considering changing out my windows and doors for a long time now\nWith the storms last year I really thought that was going to be the final push but now that I'm thinking about it with the I got the leaking into one window I've got sliding glass doors that my daughter can barely open\nAnd I get down there and Greece them up as often as I can but they're just big and heavy and that's also something else as a mom\nYou know the stores\nThere is so heavy what is the product like with what the fiber acts as it is it light is it I mean you say it's dirty and strong but is it too is it at stake heavy kind of product it is\nNot it is a sick or looking products are there the goal again was to have a window that looked like a painted wood windows ... but um but it is it's still a ... an extra rooted products so it is hollow core but with the absolute perfect engineering to ensure that it's a strong as it needs to be\nBut it's not so much the size of the window or the door but it is in the hardware the operation are the\nAre the balance is working correct basement windows of the cranks\nAre they good and solid are they are resistant to corrosion so they don't rushed\nSo they don't Russian and cause problems are the doors are the rollers a solid and well may roller with proper bearing systems so they\nThey roll properly across there so yeah you want you actually want a big heavy door panel with multiple pains of glass and and Oregon insulation in between those ... glass and a beefy frame so it doesn't work for twister those things but you also must have the proper hardware so those stores operate the way that they should\nI Want to blow up and my doors to my patio like Mary Poppins on spring day but it's like\nYou know I get a hold door open right now so yeah I think that's another reason it might be time\nYeah that that is absolutely true so we definitely want to have you know I'm you know the bigger the door obviously the more they're going to weigh but they've got her operate correctly they've got to be like they should be easily opened with just a delight\nPiano what my seven year old or by someone of an owner like ourselves yes like [laughter] it's especially you know later on in these parts that we do get the\nGreat weather all year long and and you want to be able to open your house up and what I've learned through my mold remediation situation earlier this year is that we need to open up our doors and our windows more often in our homes because of the the moisture retention inside the homes and if you're not using the humidifier\nAll this stuff I had no idea about I I've learned a lot this summer yeah I'm\nSure I'm and you've already said that with the fiber acts that it it's it's because it is a high read of the wood as well as you know the other technologies is it a reasonable product I mean are you feeling like that's something that can enhance that in my home\nWe'll see what you really want is you want to be able to see a little uptight when you want to during storms during the summer like this one it's like this I don't want any of this weather coming in I don't want any of this heat\nMoving into what any of my air conditioning going out so you really want it sealed up tight with the best product as well as the best I mean things you really don't think about is is the weather stripping is and what type of what type of or engineering or materials are they using on the weather stripping no cars so you want to seal it tight and then you want to release that when it is when it's the weather is right\nIn our in our winter yet our our ... winter it's right around here favorite time of year and I love to open up the windows and doors\nWas speaking of that just quickly uh obviously Anderson's based in Minnesota so they do know what cold is like oh yeah I Know I mean you know above all maybe the importance is really ceiling that into a reduced the amount of outside air coming in and say opposite\nOf here and they want to keep their heat and keep it cold out we want to keep our cold and keep the heat out exactly\nAnd and the engineering of course does work going both ways\nThat's awesome that's especially you know in the summertime around here when you see this air conditioning bills jump by like a hundred dollars you're like oh wait a minute I can put that in a piggy\nBank into my window financially [laughter] actually [laughter] and now they're really good time if you are thinking about it I Want to take advantage of what's happening now with the new old by ... percentage twenty percent off all windows and doors plus twenty percent off installation for the first\nSeven callers right now during this show so if you even curious it's worth making the call and getting on that list it's eight\nEight eight for eight for nine for eight zero again that's eight eighty four eight or nine for eight zero\nNow in your mind do you have like a unless there's like a baseball to a window or something like that what is your time frame is a good time to replace your windows and doors in a home within five years ten years Twenty years\nYou know I think in general most people are looking at ten to Fifteen earmark because we're older windows they do really start to to not just work properly and you really do start to see some of those fish but we have replaced um windows that had seal failure just after a couple of years even ... new home yes wow how'd that made me mad\nI had survive I was lucky with so many of our clients or not this one\nCar accidents

into their new home so I Am not the expert I Am to someone who has a lot of questions when it comes to a lot of things around my house and we bring in the expert here I have got Patrick sitting with me\nI'm universal Ruth and contracting thank you so much again by the beer when I moved here and two thousand and four I remember flying in from my interview and seeing\nA blue tarp I Am free thing\nGo Ruth oh yeah yeah that was about the right time is of Florida saying yeah that's a that's what we call hurricane\nHurricane aftermath net a tarp tired and oddly enough we're kind of back or we're almost back to that same place or the last year or so with her uh after Hurricane Irma\nAbsolutely I I tell you still and every day in my neighborhood I hear the seven thirty alarm that and he gets here roof\nGoing out of their air guns those guys just weren't working hard yeah\nAmazing I'm and I'm not going to pretend to know much about you know\n... when you need a roof and how do you know when you need a roof and that's what you hear ... I mean when I bought my last house they were like you're going to need a new and I'm like okay I had a great experience and you know we said we we did this storm pretty well\nBut let's say you don't know how long you've had the roof up there or previous owner or what are some of the signs that it may be time you need to be thinking about a new\nSure that's a great question um and I think there's a lot of people out there in the same situation they're not sure now\nIt's pretty obvious when you have water coming in your house and you see water spots on the ceiling water might be literally running into your house or the ceiling ... that's an obvious sign that you got you know some issues going on with your roof\nUm but you know a majority of people aren't necessarily in that situation where they've got a hole in their roof for a water pouring in although it does happen and we'll have a lot of customers in that situation but\nUh you know one of the things that you need to be looking for is you know just uh just the shape of the shingles you know if you have a pool deck or you have a ... a um maybe up from front driveway and you notice every time it rains that there's a little granular on your\nOwn way deck talking around yeah maybe\nIn your pool alive we'll see them wash it ended up ... or the number one way to find out is\nJust in carefully do so um grab a ladder jump up and look in your gutters if you have gutters and if you see not just gunk like dirt but you actually see what looked like a tiny little bubbles yeah that is the uh that is the shingles that are eventually you know washing I'll see\nA lot of people have the idea that um shingles and should should last thirty forty fifty years which in theory they should but in Florida it's own other right so you know it's it's a whole different beast here we have humidity we have rain we have constant sunshine\nSo the shingles are just taking a beating day after day after day and so I mean it's the same thing is like the paint on your car or other things that you put out in the sun it's gonna fade it's going to wear and tear same thing happens with the roof you know the rain that we have the wind that we have hurricane and whatnot so\nUm to know or the time exactly those are some of the ... the signs I'm In the main thing I Would say is if you're not sure call us call universal ... roofing contracting and have come out and look and give you an idea a lot of times I'm On the sales manager and so I have a great sales team of guys that come out\nThey assess what's going on and they see hey this is happening or this isn't happening and you know the thing about us as we are going to be honest and up front and say hey you might have some life left in this roof for hey you're in a situation where you either have damage or if you don't do something soon\nWe'll have damage I'm so that that's kind of that's kind of what we're looking for when we go and look at a roof obviously of shingles are\nLaying in the yard or you know that kind of stuff like that yeah you need to call us ever walking out after the storm and and seeing singles in the yard and going he does aren't mine right that was not mine I\nYeah I had one of my guys was at a at a at a measure call we call it when we come out look at your house the other day and he actually found shingles on a roof the roof was perfectly fine he looked at next door and it was the neighbors shingles that were to have alone across and had landed on the other neighbors roof\nThey've been up there since Hurricane Irma they've been up there for what is you know we're almost a year now or whatever it is so um yeah so if you got shingles in your yard you know at the white\nUm obviously you know hurricanes something we do have to think of around here and and I think a lot of people if you weren't around for ... for you learned a lot last year and it is there a way like okay we're already and hurricane season now the is there a way to kind of almost prepare yourself\n[noise] now ... that's a good question um the answer is no [laughter] I mean a roof is a roof right and so um you know obviously you know there's hurricane preparation obviously to get ready but you know that's just the unfortunate thing when we get into a situation where it's an act of God right it's it's something that we can't control I mean\nWhen you have a hundred plus mile an hour when\nYou're literally just gone OK please you know don't do have and you know don't blow that tree over don't blow my shingles off um you know unfortunately there's um there's no way to know for sure so one of the things that we see often as we've seen groups that have been done in the last ten years that have lost shingles\nA with some amazing employees in there and they will take care of all of your information they'll\nThey'll ask you some questions will receive all that information and the ... they're going to really that to our sales team so it's not like you're just calling some random person leaving a message and somebody calls you bath um there is somebody there or you can even go on to our website universal roof dot com\nUm you can do a chat lead and talked to one of our a customer service representative being yeah it's a person is and so you're you have that option too so if you um if you're like me and you don't necessarily like talking on the phone and you want to do by text or you know do it online go to universal roof dot com and um\nAnd do the little chat function in the bottom right here in ... and um they'll take your information down and then the call our call center or communications center will call you back and set up the appointment of will come out and take everything\nNow is like the typical lifespan of a ...\nYeah so that I get that question all the time I'm Glad I did I point I Am so glad you asked that question um so that's a that's a tough question because it just you know there's so many things involved you know\nLike we talked about earlier you know where does your house it you know how much sun hits it do you have a trees and uh what kind of shingle was used to installed it you know in some insulation can often be um unfortunately when you don't use a reputable company could potentially get a bad install\nUm there's all these things that come into play but I Will say generally speaking so hypothetically say we'd never have a right right we don't have hurricanes any more\nOrder yeah if we didn't have any hurricanes you know most roofs and Florida just with the sun and the humidity and the wind and rain and we get\nYou're probably looking at you know if you can get I told my customers if you can get Twenty years out of a roof in Florida you've done really well that's a solid like we rarely run into people that say hey I've had my route for thirty seven years now it just doesn't happen you know it's it's tough to have a roof that long and then you throw the hurricane in there and\nHow you do not just hurricanes as well I mean hell yeah hell does a ton of damage and we get plenty of Idaho\nAren't we definitely get lots of hail hail is hail is um an interesting thing you know you would you'd be amazed at a a small Pamela vice how much damage it can do to your\nRoof why don't you can see what it does to a car right and that's just one storm like ... or a car but I can hear it coming down you don't think about what it's doing to your ...\nRight right yeah hail hail is an interesting thing because those small pebbles vice that hitting that hit your single what's happening is those little granular as we were talking about earlier that you sometimes see washed away and your letters\nUm when the hail hits those ... beds ended the shingle and impressive the granular down into the shingle and what it does is it it\n... it a kind of a deal it damages the laminate that's behind the shingle there okay so now that plant barrier between\nShia Iran yeah so now that shingles damage meaning that you could potentially get water damage and all these things can happen um it'd be like you know if you took a hammer and started wailing on your roof or something it's not a good thing to do damage so [laughter] hail when hail hits your roof it's kind of that same effect depending on the size of the hill rain\nIf it's tiny resolved yeah you know but we've we've recently had some hail damage in the window central Florida area and\nUm you know if you think you had summer maybe you know you saw it and you're at home and um I've seen some pictures of\n'em some houses out um I think it's a winter springs area an album park that area\nWhere gutters were full of hail it's a lot of hail I'd be freaking yeah a lot of hail so ... yeah it's wild and it it it will damage your roof so we can come out and look and um we can see if it's damaged or see if the hill actually hit it\nA lot of times it's only going to hit like one part of the roof because it kinda comes at an ... so we got to figure out you know did it hit where did it hit all that kind of stuff and then at that point we would sort of recommended or say to you here's what we think may be going on or what we see\nOK something you don't normally think about yeah hurricanes have which got regular son started my men as around my house and I mean if you see a lot of this\nSquirrels so yeah yeah ... ... they will chew everything up I have a neighbor that eats them [noise] yeah that's not [laughter] maybe your neighbors throwing feet up on your roof\nMade him out of the not shells that I find him I got her as I Know where they're going with the peanuts but I was in my office and they said that I had my river placed a about three years ago and I was at my home office and during one of our big thunderstorms and all of the night I hear\nIt so ... so interestingly enough we are filed those type event does that come out of your roof that uh the way that we like you know I Know your story I Know everybody's story [laughter] or if you look at your roof and you see that it's wrapped and metal it's led\nUm for some reason I don't know why they're why squirrels or why are this way but they will chew on that metal on that led they cut their teeth on it and I don't really understand the you know whatever\nThey have a high now like locks off my fence they will eat anything that metal they\nThe metal and so if you look at your roof and you see one pipe is maybe like you know eight inches high and the other one's only two inches I and it's all non down you've got animals chewing on your pipes now the ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "08"}
