done that travels or whatever she does from other NFL work as well so some of the other teams of cold and you across all going to both been available to them and and helping them when you're meeting with those guys I'm ... and they're asking you money questions what's coming up\nYou know day this is the main thing that's coming up hey I'm young I'm twenty two years old I was only making maybe five thousand dollars a year my first check with Fifteen thousand\nAnd let me get another one next week it\nWhat do I do ... how ... how do you keep from being overwhelmed overwhelm money with the pressure with family how do I tell my mom no should I tell my parents know how do I tell my friends know um\nShould I go by this car almost any names but there are some um rookies out there that I've had the opportunity to to to mentor\nAnd they're you know they they they are going out there and buy some big things and other rookies are seeing that are saying well wait should I Do that and I'm like no no no do not do that to save your money live on a plan live on a budget\nAnd with the coolest thing was with the ravens I could say this was all of them sign up for every dollar a couple of weeks ago um and all of them get every dollar play and so there was like ... how do we do this and it was surprising to see that a lot of kids did not know how to budget\nEither twenty two year old Twenty one euros making nearly um on average stuck in the low has about Fifteen thousand dollars a game so it's about sixty thousand dollars a month to about two hundred thousand dollars a month and they didn't know how to budget that so I'm just excited because I'm seeing them saying hey I Want to help\nYou know these guys are tech to me they're they're calling me Kate how do I do this how do I invest what is Dave say about this you know it's just real cool to see these young players want to be good on the field but they also want to make the right decision is off the field as well\n[noise] I was telling a leadership team this week that I was talking to the river passers we were with yesterday that ... you can't attribute\nA life skills both to someone just because we're successful in one area\nAnd so if you get a twenty six year old music star yeah\nUm well they're good at music but what happens is we see them being very successful there even me I'm fifty eight I Know better I've worked with NFL players for Twenty years off and on\nAnd um I Know this is a a a world class\nOne half of one percent athlete um but they are twenty two guests there and the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills are developed they are the size of a key uh yeah but that doesn't mean that their life skills have developed at the same level and you know so\nIt it's it's kinda weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps as like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um because he still is football skills are are the best on the planet you\nI'm In his physical acumen his physical uh IQ the things you can do this body in mid error or it's just circus like it's amazing what those guys can do it but what happens is when you watch that skill level especially if you're just watching on TV\nImportant I ... a more businesses had back in that\nDirection but I think I think the biggest telltale sign as if when you call one of our branches during business hours somebody immediately makes up the caller customer service actual people pick up the phone and it's very rare to get you know hold music on our customer service or hit\nNine hit one than than his zero than the other three\nAnd it's so funny I get calls you know I'm I'm In the back office but we give out our phone number I have listeners call in to the front desk and got transferred back to me\nAnd they're so shocked that I've picked up the phone [laughter] that's the national reaction is just\nI did actually think you're going to pick up did they say that I I have ... we had people say that to be which is it's kind of ... but that is you know when we talk about the difference between us a lot of other lenders that's that's a big part of it is\nActually speaking to a human being who wants to have a conversation with you that's a huge and I'd much rather talk to you then listen to hold music so\n[laughter] oh yeah oh I don't like talking to people obviously got a big mouth I'm a\nTalk show host um so ... buyer seminars homebuyers seminars she wanted to hit this one more time\nYeah so we're doing our our great first time homebuyer seminaries are going to be at five five of our branches here in central Florida all the way down to Stuart in Sarasota up to orange city or east colonial off at us and our Leesburg office so great spread around\nBut one of the great things that I Want to talk about with trust ... when you're looking at first time homebuyer is how we look at a credit and qualifications\nSo you know a lot of lenders might have a minimum credit scores and things like that what we're looking at is what's actually on your credit report and this is so much more important as\nA young person as a lot of times the first time homebuyers are is that we're looking at your actual history and we're waiting that over the score that you had so we accept on alternative credit sources or what we call them so let's say you've been you know face fully paying rent\nFor the last three to five years you can provide us with a letter from your landlord saying your rent on time and we will use that to kind of bolster you know a credit history so you might only have a few sources of credit your score it might not be that high due to\nJust the lack of history if you haven't been building credit for a long time it can be difficult to get that really good score that you would need with another lender in order to qualify\nAnd will accept these alternative credit sources to kind of you know give it a little bit more weight to allow people to qualify that might not otherwise qualify\nNot to mention that we give everybody the same interest rate walking through the door so if you walk in and get qualified with a six hundred and eighty credit score you get the exact same interest rate is somebody with an eight hundred credit score\nSo we're not charging you for having less credit experience which I think is so important that you're not being penalize just because you haven't been around as long as that ... percent of the eight hundred credit score\n[noise] yeah that's a good point as well um it it really is and it's good to it's good I like education stuff anyway uh so it's it's good when you can educate new homebuyers especially can tell them that not to spend their closing money\nTo go to the important I you know and that's kind of thing that you would hope that people would think about is well\nHow am I going to bring that money to the table when it comes to the closing yeah apparently al has not had that experience [laughter] the eye less so for me I I don't think I've had to borrow where I've had I've had people come close to not quite making it the closing\nBut it's you know it's been that they always were kind of on the line verses going out and spending the money\nAnd yeah I think I mean they they they paid off the debts but does that after you have to get the house just makes more sense a true today Ralph spry realtor\nWell and and to you know don't start buying things until it's a done deal he'll you sign in the paper and that's more things happen you know title search has come up with issues you don't want you know your clothing to be delayed and the truck with your new furniture showing up the day before you've actually sign documents or\nYou know or something happening a seller pulling out of a deal due to some sort of emergency\nAh we had one I guess about six months ago where the seller actually unfortunately passed away right before the closing ... it's not closing unfortunately so if you've made a bunch of big purchases\n... things like that probably don't happen very often but it could happen so you want to make sure that you kind of hold off on any big deliveries or things like that until you sign on the dotted line so to speak and it's it's ready to go just because you really never now in today's day and age what can happen to\nLive through it is so true I have to say though I had I had a couple of buyers\nWonderful folks are but they were so sure there were going to close on that day that they ordered some stuff to be delivered that afternoon their clothes and it worked out but it was like oh boy I better do this thing closed [laughter] as though is that those are ... gonna ... nobody there\nWeren't laugh about those type of things every once in a while to get a role to they'll call and say I have never had a deal not close on the day that was selected as like have you only done one deal\nYeah [laughter] yeah because more often than not you're going to have to extend that sucker now you know it just it's happened with me I've closed Eighteen deals this year and a you know more often than not we've had to adjust that closing day\nI Would say you know running are closing department on a traditional purchase I\nWould say eighty five percent of the time if not more we make that closing date by guys are really good I mean we're ... and I keep ahead of you know I look at files before they even been approved to make sure that we're in line for closing

I have a a goal I Want to accomplish that ... you know have that this mission that I Want to do\nA and that's where you started and you didn't start with this is how we've always done yeah I mean the the idea of a of a of a church that's a distributed into a lot of places the idea of the church not just being inside the walls but outside of all these micro churches you know I mean that that was that's all stuff that's\nThat's thinking outside the box you think you\nThink that there is something that that um makes that is their uniting a feature to that like of of of thinking outside of ... that you have to focus more on the\nPeople than the goal or more on an initial goal or yeah anytime anytime your main um objective is to keep\nAn organization running it will necessarily stumped\nYou're thinking you would think in terms of of mechanics and tactics instead of in terms of the original vision on and on and the organization was created for so people create organizations to accomplish the mission\nBut then they get overtaken by the running of that organization and they loose on his mission\nThat's really interesting and you know why that's I mean it's that's so proven or in\nIn the corporations that really dominated and grew largest ... um when when apple was you know having it in the middle of its meteoric rise which which kind of to this day is is it moving but um uh it it was it was typified by that what's what's the idea behind what we're trying to do and then it\nComing out with something that people were like ... you know the iPhone was the very first thing where there's just you know at least anyone noticed where there's you know there's no buttons or type on your screen or Amazon you know just basis and Amazon I mean\nA ... if if his goal was I Want to have this place to be the best online shopping experience and have this company run\n'em he wouldn't have gotten into I mean nine out of the things that they do now you know it just kind of kind of grew on mosque there is another example I mean his his whole thing is he wants to save the earth or and so what that had him doing a batteries in solar energy\nRocket programs and electrical cars you know what I mean they they ... it's that the idea behind what he wants to do is driving it rather than I Need to keep these specific\nOr do and you're talking about a risk factor you know to to leave the safety of his ... really pay pal yeah and the end to invest it all in\nThe these these new ideas these new ...

one WFL Larry\nWelcome back to the bright side today and we are talking about a risk taking a ... and we're talking about it in a way or the ... the virtues of risk taking\nA ... if you if you ever going to really be of help the people you're probably going to have to break out of the routine that you've manufactured just kind of serve and keep your your own life stable and actually take a risk in or doing something unusual or helping someone when that's not\nVery popular yeah are you you're a good example of this and that you uh were at at north one church for the thirty thirty two years um and then\nUh you really you kind of re framed a ... you know what's my goal overall like what what do I want to do with my life\nAnd you realize that you were going to be able to accomplish\nMore of that come with a comment that more directly by being kind of outside the church was out in the community and then continuing to ah stay on there as the senior pastor\nUm and uh and it it was a new one does that you know and no one steps out of a I've been at this place for thirty two years and I'm I'm running the show I'm going to go out into the stuff that I'm I'm only kind of a million and and figure it out as I go along um\nBut you have a you said since then um and I can corroborate this just in knowing you in our in our personal life uh I've ... I don't think I've ever seen you more happy and energetic they have over the last year or two\nYeah well it was one of those cases where the institution was getting in the way of the mission ... I'm In the church has created to include those who weren't being included to serve those who weren't a inside their own group\nUm but as as any other institution they quickly turned to the inside group and that's that's what makes most of the decisions and and where most of the resources go um and and there's there's nothing wrong with helping people\nI'm inside your own circle obviously um but I was not [noise] I was I was still had this desire to love and serve people who would never step foot inside of church yeah then started church building\nAnd go and just to clarify or I'm Joel Hunter and and this person we are talking to his also Joel Hunter who was who who ah who just went had that story um the uh uh this show\nIs that exact thing it's helping to help others that's that's the whole idea so um what uh um what what was the next thing we're talking about with uh with with risk taking we're gonna we're going to go over a some\nThings that keep you from taking yeah you have to lead a risk in order to accomplish a an unusual mission I'm In one of those things is and this this kind of affects us both how we're wired perfectionism ... you know we've we we need you know in our minds we need to make things\nPerfect I'm a or at least aimed for perfection before we are willing to take risks um and that's just never going to happen you know things things well by definition\nWith anything new they're going to be sloppy and inefficient and ineffective um um because that's what it takes to create\nUm something that is a bench surely really helpful\nUm and so you know you know ideas are like babies and you know they basically just at first eating Boop [laughter] you know and and they do know that number constructed [laughter] um and so it's hard for a perfectionist who likes everything in order who likes to everything to make sense in order to lunch with a new idea\nThat's at yeah it would it and that's such a great comparison 'cause you know it's it's uh you you nurture it into something that uh that then uh becomes you know really really helpful in its own in its own right um I I mean I remember that are just with the beginning a hunter vision there's a when you're when you're starting this new place there's there's so many\nAre things that you you realize ah oh this idea is not going to work this way of of a different business model things ... things pretty established on how to do that but uh but the the different ways to to run things and and how have people go through that and have the best experience um uncle Jan or who is\nYour sister's husband uh and I'm One of the greatest men to ever live a he said to us or to me it just seems like you said boys one thing you need to know is you're going to have a business plan and then you're going to have a different business\nAbout Fifteen different times really will [laughter] and uh and it was and he said that before we had opened it was a year before and we're like no one's pretty solid and it turns out that oil is he right [laughter] right he'd been down that road yeah exactly so it's it's a it's important\nTo not go into into something a where the\nPicture being exactly what you wanted it to be for for this for this thing that you're trying to accomplish\nThe picture of the way to accomplish that if if that's the highest school if the if the if just making that thing or look the way that you think it should look uh it's it's hard to do that is what perfectionism is if if the if it's much more about how do I\nAccomplish this overall during a then then it lets you kind of change your change the uh the what's the word it reframe stinks it lets you unless you think outside the ... yeah yeah yeah\nHere's another one um that kind of ... or ... or from being a creative\nUm and that is over thinking or exaggerating the consequences now all of us should do second level thinking as to you know if I Do this\nWhat are going to be the consequences how much unintended harm will there be I'm I'm you know ... in other words a ... with some of the collateral damage that could that could happen\n[laughter] it doesn't sell [laughter] I Know when I bought [laughter]\nAnd he said you know what [laughter] I'm going to sit down at the typewriter [laughter]\nAnd he came up with a vast [laughter] savings uh [laughter] um so ah some some of the people that are that\nSome of the some of the ways that we can ah um look at how it's worthwhile to actually take risk is is it's always fun to talk about the successes you know there are people that that actually uh that actually a pretty big risks and then we're a successful 'cause not everybody's just born on\nThird base and says they hit a home run it it's a some people really come from situations where you you can't believe how much risk they took to get where they are yeah what what are what are the examples that you had well one of those is a semester Stallone I'm\nWith a baby underway and too little money to pay the rent a on his Hollywood apartment\nI'm sat down and wrote the screenplay screenplay for rocky in less than four days really yeah but not only that wants to this ah producers loved it when they when they read it and they offered him a big bucks to bring the story to life\nUh but Stallone or as down and out as he was refused to take any offer if he wasn't allowed to play the lead role in the film about he was totally dead broke couldn't pay his own and\nAnd uh and and but rather than take the big bucks it took us a ... a a far smaller paycheck\nUm than what he could have burned up front um uh but of course the series a ended up pulling millions and millions of dollars in the sky rocketed him in the fame you've ... stinks\n[laughter] yeah my own stinks [laughter]\nMade your good that has a very good you know to the surprise of the good rocky and ... is Kevin James ... Doug Heffernan oily yeah he he gets there's an episode where he gets stuck halfway in his addict like it's just around his belly and wearing my house is a failed\nOr and or exit narratives really bored and he's a ... foot [laughter] you know it's so good in President um the or the or the one that uh that uh is uh I I feel like it's helpful\nTo to make sure we cover is is the bill gates one that that ... yeah um because I I feel like it's a very good very inspiring one to go over a partially I mean 'cause I even continually now he's he's doing stuff that people haven't really done before they're ... billionaires which is like the\nThe the very meticulous well thought out well researched application of wealth to solve problems that are plaguing mankind on a scale that people haven't really seen before um but the\nOriginal thing was you know he he's a famously college dropout yeah and and as you were saying earlier he tells people to stay in school now I feel like that one gets misunderstood [laughter] and they say they want to know like just in the in an effort to explain good risk taking versus bad\nI'm ... his background there was a he was so smart like so smart that the college courses he was taking at Harvard or were holding him\nBack from the housing bigger things and he's like he's like I just got my time is precious and I've had it and then they invented Microsoft [laughter] it's a it's\nA win or I mean it's it's I the value of college is different for different careers or somewhere you just can't get into it without college and there's others where you'll be better off not going\nBut if there is something that that seems like it college will get you to a final goal or using the a bill\nGates dropped out of it yeah you don't want to you don't want to add that at risk based on bad in for me I said neither neither his intellect\nOr nor his chances of success really describe any of us yeah yeah he\nHe's one of those one in a billion type of fellows are but the point is um it's it's taking whatever set of talent and resources you have Jack and then applying risk in a way that that makes sense you know in in in your in your ... or ... I mean with all that you've done\nA and now you accomplished at north ... through north of you to say that I'm stepping down to start a software company yeah\n[laughter] what about battery [laughter]\nI haven't been like I don't really I mean I'm conflict [laughter] he's so much wiser than me but [laughter] I've been here so yeah you got to know your gift yeah you really do I mean that's that's that's part of it um it's uh I I feel like in\nAll these things that it's helpful to look at the the big ... inspirational things um but the place that all this stuff starts is is incremental every everything is steps towards um and probably the easiest one where it's just\nStepping you know so slightly outside your comfort zone that you can't even tell if it's if it's outside your comfort zone would be something like simple help yeah what's what's the idea behind a simple dot help what will people will get well just exactly that and that you know\nWe don't we're not trying to fix the world we're just trying to make it better um and and we're trying we're we're doing things together um that is we get to an email from you are on Sunday evening\nWith things that each of us can do in our own world um you every day and so we're doing all of these together a Monday has one thing too there's nothing there for five days a week\nUm and the world is getting better or an R.
