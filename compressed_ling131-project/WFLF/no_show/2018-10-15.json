so we'll we'll we'll get we'll get them back it's All right well this is a little heart yep yep and we left off I had a message comes through we left off the last segment talking about or Jamie Lee Curtis and her\nHypocritical views on gun control let's say that she's a she's an advocate for gun control um where we know that uh it but she says things like where we make sure because this kind of support their cut off and make sure we are\nWe sound like we're not we're talking about which would be something new for me anyway the second amendment she she's a Second Amendment bud is what we call it she says I support the second amendment but I Want people to be trained but they have to license but I Want a background check to be conducted but I Want there to be your bill a waiting period you know she she's a second remembered but\nAnd when I hear somebody say I'm a second remembered but are here\nAnd listen I support the first amendment but you know not for not for the poor or I support the Fourth Amendment not but not for ...\nDoesn't agree with me correct around it it doesn't it doesn't matter what their their motive for why they don't agree with you if they don't agree with you you don't think they should be allowed to speak correct which is very much what I see from some of the very liberal press\nIf you start to be interviewed by a reporter who sets up the reason for the interview and clearly is asking you questions\nThat are designed to embarrass\nOr humiliate or degrade the position you're taking\nYou know how do you respond to that how do you how do you deal with the fact that\nThey want you to give them some soundbites but they're going to edit what you said to the point where you you sound like a complete blistering idiot right and I've had that experience I've I've been interviewed by people who did not agree with my position and they asked me to do things stand in certain ways or a whole thing's\nA you know about firearms environmental and I want to ask me I had a German TV crew doing a documentary asked me questions\nThey asked me to manipulate farms us so that I didn't you asked to come here and talk about the establishment of the second amendment right why do you think the second amendment necessary\nWhile I think you would probably want to read the federalist papers yeah exactly and and they were like what are those yeah OK you understand that a country that is has his populist disarmed\nCan have their government abused the power that the government then hold over the disarmed populace right and they went well that won't happen anymore if you have any more\nBecause they hadn't been a couple of World War started airing your dream to have her arm be any more six million people weren't killed because they were\n... arms it's happening now happens all over Africa yeah it happens all over South America it's it doesn't happen in the United states because the United states government isn't as well armed as the United states populists right that was the idea that's what the federalist papers\nI think it was forty three or forty seven suggested most vehemently worried that the populist the standing army could not mobilize enough force\nTo to the country correct I'm ... and I I Will tell you though with a guard in the reserves\nAnd the standing military if they all ended up on different sides that would be a really ugly fight it'd be a everyone one hell of a battle of all it was that was that was a that would be it would be really messy\nBut quite honestly I don't think they're going to find a lot of people\nIn the active military\nThe reserve or the guard they're going to be able to be convinced that turned the muzzles of their tools on their citizenry\nOne of the reasons the reserve and the guard especially with the guard it won't it is highly unlikely is because in the guard you're asking them to turn it on their on their neighbors right liberty looks at um at Fort Drum you told me to go outside the gate and do this are you all this I'm from Southern California I don't care what\nBut that the whole point of some of the the conspiracy theorists right they'll activate the guard units they'll take a Florida guard unit and they'll go to Washington state and watch and think arguing it'll come to Florida\nWith that then then move 'em all around the beauty of the guard as the governor gets to say no no they don't do that ... billion in my state and you can and but the reserves that can happen but it's much much less likely at least from um from my experience of you know from my knowledge of the military and they and the reserve components of\nWith a new law in place in Vermont that bans bump stocks\nVermont state police barracks across the state will begin collecting the devices from gun owners no questions asked me I I'm a little alarmed where they start collecting the devices as opposed to they will start accepting the devices collecting sounds very door to door at ...\nVery please turn them over at ... anyway act Ninety four\nYou've seen their uniforms oh yeah they do look like they like park rangers or or you know ...\n... if it's an act of Ninety four amended state law to prohibit the possession of bump fire stocks which allow a gun owner to increase a semi automatic fires rate or fire to that of a fully automatic firearm\nSidebar according to this author obviously when right when we we know that ah the what the case actually is\nUnder the new law possession of a bump fire stock is punishable by up to a one year in prison and a thousand thousand dollars and five so we're looking at their probably their their lowest class felony or whatever it happens to be in their state well last year up to ... to a year so it's been doing a meter asked yeah you're right right\nBelow eleven months that thirty nine twenty nine days grabbing a the law allows police to collect a bump stocks from gun owners who want to voluntarily and anonymously turn them in\nPolice will collect the bump stocks at all ten Vermont police state barracks Monday to friday for\nPolice must removed the devices shooting people must remove the devices from their weapons before entering the barracks yeah OK tip tip one don't walk into the police barracks with a rifle yeah that that makes it makes everybody in the room ... or lose a little bit a little bit what's that ... you know\nA place you because they shot you repeatedly and\nPolice say staff will take no information about the identity of the person surrounding the bump stock unless you asked for a receipt gr you're going to win a receipt yeah the devices will be held in a secure area in the barracks pending destruction you know because otherwise they might want her out and and do bad things no I don't think that's what they're worried about I think they're worried about\nEvery Vermont state trooper great having a bump stock on his on his car car being right yeah yeah well you know we could have a full auto but this is a whole lot easier\nYeah All right fast forward I had to give you the story to give you the story well here's this or to October third Vermont's voluntary bump stock return was a bust\nVermont gun owners turned in just gotten just so many Kissimmee I read the story so it's hard to you too yeah you're right because of that could yes they turned in just to bump stocks edited October first date when possession of the rapid fire devices became illegal in the state let me give you a couple of clarifications here\nUh first off are they are not rapid fire devices for rapid fire device would be a machine gun\nThis is a necessity that allows you to at some points get up to a a a higher rate of fire you know almost a equivalent to a full automatic ready to fire but this is by no means a rapid fire device they did however become illegal in the state on October first\nState police began collecting devices two weeks ago under provision law that allows owners of devices to a ... drop them off for disposal\nNone of us who dropped offers so they won't take any pictures of you know very much for car ... well your license plate well\n... you know I'm not I'm not worried about that because\nQuite honestly you know I'm I'm a one is none into is one kind of guy right right\nAnd bump stocks were not expensive back before the the the whole yeah this is what I think that when you you could pick one of those up for you know Seventy bucks yeah yeah or they were not they're not particularly a elaborate or a ransom demand right right right\nUh yeah I think you can probably still get them on like wish her yeah I mean you can\nYou buy all kinds of stuff on from China very um\nIf you had two of them just suggesting you know for months brown they're clever folks up there you know the resourceful they're resilient there is yes they're uh they're capable of self sustaining them right so\nUh so you got you got a couple of these bumps out she bought and you'd like to make sure you're off the radar\nRight so you take one of 'em down to the police barracks in China then you make and give me a receipt right and then you have that receipt laminated yeah yeah and every time somebody says I saw you with a bump stock and you take that none of our money and you know we saw with it yet but I turned it in right yeah it's sad I turned it in\nA I got some clarification here on our friends the other Vermont troopers that we know it's a this was kind of thorny for Mac rabbit foster and of course Kevin Bacon so\nThey're ... and and they tax did you just now did they didn't they didn't they did so we can all be familiar with them a state police spokesman Adam Silverman said that as of Tuesday only to the device has been turned in across the state\nBump stocks will be taken to the state police headquarters in Waterbury pending destruction do you think they have the room you think they're going to have the room for him if you'd be able to stick to find a place to store the two of these before they decide to\nRent a bulldozer and crush them or put them under a flame thrower\nOh no no they won't get rid of him like that they'll they'll put them in the inventory said that they can compare them yeah to future devices so somebody says well that's a bump stock well how do you know well that's what it looks like All right we'll show me what a bump stock looks All right well we destroyed them we don't know what they look like\nAnd we don't have any more and recycled them so I put these in a couple of plastic bottles and and I got a five dollars back at the recycling plant\nYeah it's not to you have to take it apart though 'cause they they don't want assembled with metal in the plastic part's true true and are you do have the\nThe the locking spring I think is is there a metal ... middle portion of it or they give a locking shrimp um so it's it's yeah it's Ninety nine percent plastic I guess you'd call it yeah but I'm a ... it's ridiculous this is the banning of um\n[noise] of assess or is this is this is what is ... this is what it's come to you know there's there's I'd have to stay out in front of me there's there's many states now that have done this weird we Kevin I happened to be sitting in one sitting in the in Florida I Know we have a good friends up in Georgia they're still safe\nUm Washington state's looking at this now this is one of the parts of ice sixteen thirty nine or you know to to ban bump stocks they're obviously everybody throughout the northeast and\nThis was the deal that\nThe inner ear to pretty much gave these up they said okay you don't work with this on concealed carry and we'll give you bump stocks is what they told and however an Arizona house represents aren't going to\nDo that they they don't want national reciprocity they there then you're never going to see that that's going to be a huge fight is going to require grass roots to make it happen but\nI I was never ... you know I don't I've ... but it's expensive yeah and it's time consuming and you know and expensive and yeah I guess you know I just\nCannot ... you got her bucks ion yeah why 'cause I'm going to have to pick up all the brass and you're done and it you know you want to go through a belt okay well she goes to about but you know you got to pick up the brass\nJust that there's plenty of machine gun shoot around the country where you're going up to you know non creek and that's going on right now Kentucky yeah happening right now and uh you know what it wherever it happens to be you uh\nIt it's great fun it's great fun to go up there you know spend three four hundred dollars in a minute like Kevin said you know pull the trigger on a half a belt or in a couple of magazines and say you did it it's not effective fire [laughter] you know by any means\nI saw the buddy fire a full belt through um three white mini gun and I thought to myself that is a great way to spend Eighteen seconds spending a thousand dollars yeah\nYeah [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah you're exactly\nRight so I suppose that first out for him stick around and have another hour coming back for you until we see you next hour though these exercise your Second Amendment rights especially if you are ready to get ready if you're already say ready [noise] and the girls [laughter]\n\nI'm not based on race or direct or age or it was just I'm not\nVery much just now just a general run of the mill generic stupidity yeah jury convicted this retired firefighter of assault on friday for firing a shotgun at a teen who knocked on his door to ask for directions okay well that maybe that's a Little Haiti\nWhat it was on his way to school already missed the bus so we've got this narrow down to\nWe're going to call this a seven to nine AM somewhere in a band member who or what you might get us make it you know the ... in high school yeah they they tend to make them go to federal or you know so high school kids maybe go to school earlier ... and I don't know permission fourteen yeah he could he could be a meeting or not you're not either ninth grade young adults who are high school yeah so you know middle school\nUsually is the one that really take it in the short because they they get yeah you know the kitchen the best for forty five o'clock in the morning I'm and because they depending on how far away they got a ride right you missed the bus and I now I think I I got to assume he's fairly close to where his school is because he's asking for directions I guess he's assuming he's going to have\nTo walk yeah and that's what this this sounds like he missed the bus and and he started to walk towards school\nOr you want to make sure you knew which way you know it was on point along the way he must have been like a you know because that's the first question goes well if you missed the bus rather just just go home\nFor the kid didn't want to go home we wanted to get to school so he starts walk to school at least where we are you have to live over two miles from school to take the bus so we know this kid is probably walking at least a mile two miles at a minimum to get to school at most fourteen year old can do to them All right we're and remember he's fourteen he's about driving so he doesn't know the streets\nLike somebody that drive so he's disoriented and well maybe ... and that's one of the things that's\nThe problem with a fourteen year old is they don't pay attention to what's going on around them do but I can tell you what's on their phone oh yeah oh yeah ... yeah I can definitely tell you my God you see what they just read it and that is you know they know about that but it's so he goes up to this house ... and and apparently he stepped back\nNobody answered he stepped up knocked again stepped back somebody comes to the door why are you trying to bring them out yeah not trying to bring in your house I would just wanted to see if you could tell me how to get to you know read my high on right now right\nAnd and uh and then it goes sideways\nUm the the ... the male\nOccupant of the home appears with the shotgun a lays chase to the young man who fleas and ah he ... the the firefighter retired firefighter claims he tripped and the gun discharged ... he has a home security system\nAnd it's got a video that shows him shoulder aim and fire\nUp but apparently this young man is got a got some legs only\nBecause he our ... year old shot yeah Rana shot wouldn't which you know your when somebody's shooting at your or there's a lion chasing you your form is perfect you know wasted narration very he's very you're out of the ... and I don't care how big yard or elderly are your form is perfect right um and he he didn't get hit\nBut he got the ... scared out I mean right up they charged him with a with a more serious crime correct the jury convicted him of at the less serious a lesser included if you will but he's still looking at at least two years behind bars\nOr before he can uh you can serve the assault weapons right uh so it's it's up it's up for the for the fire is worth a gun charge alone as men minimum mandatory two years behind bars so that's a it's a pretty serious right conviction\nAnd um it was completely unnecessary\nNow if the young men have been knocking on the door at say one thirty two o'clock in the morning Ryan can you tell me how to get to my school right now it looks like it's a pretext to get you open the door right right um you know I and I've I've had cases have cases right or like that right now where somebody knocks on the door in the middle of the night and\nSays one thing but you're not sure why they're saying that\nFolks are due to the point here is [noise] do you know what you're doing shows do you do

single Saturday right here okay\nThat's what we're trying to do that's what we do bring clarity and misinformation you know where some more misinformation is Chris where's that most people don't realize your Social Security is going to be taxed\nPotentially a Yeah Yup just talk with somebody yesterday about that\nSo whenever you go to get it back out mhm they're actually potentially if you're on the rise thresholds on income they're going to tax you on it\nAnd it thresholds are low so most people the majority of people out say are are going to have their Social Security tax\nNot only are all your other tax deferred accounts can be taxed as ordinary income but your Social Security can be tax too that it's just keep comment that just doesn't seem right to me right it but there is a solution if you have enough tax free income make a drop you blow a threshold and boom your Social Security is not a tax anymore\nI said at one more time help me understand what you're saying\nIf you had tax free sources of income and your retirement tax free source of income tax free right they're going to look at that and they're going to see you don't maybe hit the threshold to get your Social Security taxes oh so you can potentially drop your Social Security down for being attacks\nAre Sawyer says five enough tax free income coming in is going to therefore lower my tax bracket and real portable and come to the IRS and they're going to look and I said hey he's not here she's not meeting the threshold we're not going to tax or Social Security is that what you're saying\nBoom you can potentially dropped attacks on that not only going to get tax free from another source which is nice right yeah tax free from there but you're so security's irony tax now what would normal people do right now hey they don't have tax Rena parole and most people don't right now Chris what what should I Do about that\nWell if you don't have ... one of the most powerful streams of income tax free to pay taxes you need is you need to implement that\nRight away hey we hear about the national debt all the time I hear it probably every single day was it actually mean for us it means tax is potentially are going to have to go a bright bright absolutely right that's what that's what everybody's talking about we know that right so are all your accounts can be taxed when that goes up\nA lot acts suffered yeah I mean a lot of people's their retirement accounts are going to be taxed most likely at a higher rate than they ever anticipated ... there's not thinking about it it's going to happen down the road\nSo a lot of people are what are called rolling the dice ride the roller dies in the future on this tax deferred accounts when I go to use them into retirement uh-huh the taxes are going to be lower right\nYeah 'cause I was thinking that I was a logical that's basically it but what can they do what can they do a you know what can they develop Social Security being tax\nWhat can they do about taxes going up on them in the future and having to pay that actual higher tax burden kicking the can down the road rolling the dice that hey maybe hopefully taxes won't go up but we know they are what can what can the everyday American do\nWell you can not reinvent the wheel or you can do something that your author wealth you been doing for decades right you can use the\nSame strategies that they'd been doing apply them and do your retirement craze some factory and can we do it every single weaker\nYep we see two thousand people here that we see about eight eight did well shoot I see about eight people use the ability to people or other partners she's about eight people a day were jammed packed we use every day\nI think one of the things that people to read this one is tragedies that got us features of forest magazine was the tax free that we love to put into people's retirement right absolutely right\nThat's what you can create it's never too late must be was like

either black ... we used to call professional\nWFL I find ... ... patients every door Orlando news radio nutty free by one WFL a and I heard radio station [noise]\nGetting a firsthand look guy Lisa ... Fox News President Trump and the first lady touring Aires to Florida and Georgia torn apart by hurricane Michael\nSeem it or [laughter] or I Need a concrete and you take a water and sand and you mix it together and you get a or I mean you take seem it and you mix water and sand together and you get concrete so\nIt's two components put together to make one much stronger\nAnd that was the idea behind five ... along with a few other things a longevity of being able to withstand the things we talked about earlier such as the water leaking into rotting fading all of these terrible things that the the insulation value\nAll of these are protected and a vibrant allows a or eliminates all of these processes from happening\nAnd it also it sounds as though you can also put it in any shape that you need that gets custom orders and things like that all that's\nEasily done absolutely vibrant you can be custom fit it to just about any opening a in your home so when you do you order with renewable energies and you're not just getting something off the showroom floor\nNo you are not a what we do is we actually come out when they designed consultant we look at your opening\nA lot of folks in the industry think when they get ready to do windows is really only one way to do it and that's what they have existing in their home so many options out there so many ways to save money\nFrankly a lot of ways even spend more money to bail out beautiful you want to make your house I'm really good at that most people want to most people in the end of the day won't accomplish do things they want to ... there's going to last forever and they want a house that looks like a brand new house at the same or address\nOkay All right yeah I I don't know what I mean I think I Would proving the aesthetic of my house\nWell one of the things that I've found in many folks that I talked to a in the window industry when I approached folks I asked him hey what is it that you're trying to achieve and when they talk about the aesthetics of the home and how it looks\nThey go Dan I had some quotes I've talked to some folks but look I've seen these windows in the house I've seen these big white clunky thick\nBones looking last week when I was I don't want that look and it really show our mission and on one of our goals are ever knew why Anderson is we want the window and we designed a window to look like it actually came with the home\nMhm so it doesn't seem like it's out of place exactly if you're curious and if you're thinking about and this is something you might want to do a little bit more about if you're in the same kind of mindset that I can get some information but also take advantage of the office going on right now to a if you are listening to the show or nearby enters and you can\nBut the first seven callers get ... percent off windows doors and installation that's twenty percent off of everything so shut down the number\nEight eight eight for eight or nine for eight zero that is eight eight eight for eight for nine for eight zero eight eight eight or eight or nine for eight zero to\nGet the information and hopefully get in on that special offer as well um now I Am looking at replacing it all at once\nThat the doors and windows I'm Kendra nobody enters and also do sliding glass doors I mean is there any ... like is there anything that\nYour typical home is there anything that you can tell\nMe the short answer is no way to answer right and\nWe want to we don't want you you want to be really careful when you are changing opening sizes are sometimes you can begin to get into structural members of the home so we can and larger make openings smaller if it's the right\nSituation okay but to answer your question we can do just we can yes we can do just about anything you want with the custom or be a window\nOkay when they enter some kind of want me to the process let's say I give you a comic Dan I think I'm ready not exactly sure like what's the best way to get a quote to get your design team out luckily through the process All right\nSo the first step is you when to pick up the phone and you would call our national call center or our local call center within a working hours and you would set up a free and home designed\nConsultant estimate right so that individual would then come out to your home they would take a look at and\nYour name your dreams or whatever you're trying to create a most importantly provide us illusion show we would go we would measure the windows we would go or some design options with you mhm uh and then we would uh we have a a design\nA software that we carry with us in the home so you can actually see what the window looks like that you're having designed oh fantastic and so once we got a mystery yeah [laughter] makes a little bit of time in the home so uh be prepared but this way you can get exactly what you want you know it's what you want to see what it looks like\nAnd once we knew that uh we simply price it up for you right there in the home so okay so now waiting no waning\nThat's nice I mean you can get an idea of\nWhat you can be getting into you have to get excited about the process of you know possibly getting these new windows and doors now let's say I you know I I Love the station I Love the smell of the way everything looks and I say okay and let's go and do they understand let's make this happen in my home what is the next that\nWell the next step is ... how we going to pay for it right you can't call mom anymore right [laughter] well my daughter would kill me but she uh she's still calls that so uh yeah so the\nNext set with me we have many different ways uh to help fund the job or to provide on the job so you can do financing through us you can pay cash or credit card any of that and it's all done on the spot instant financing we have great promotions are\nGoing on uh at this time ... and I'm\nSo is there is quite easy or you don't have to have any money down in um\nIn the process can keep going in the process can game going well tell me about the uh the teams tell me about your crew what what can we expect when it's time for renewal by Anderson to come into my home and actually put in these new windows\nAnd doors and sliding glass doors and everything else yes so the process a is\nReally smooth the we have a concierge service so what that means is once you place the order you'll be contacted ... job is to hold your hand through every step of the process so once you place that order with us\nYou will then be contacted and they'll let you know the very next that\nAnd that next step would be a tech mission or any tech measure would come out and measure of behind the design consultant measure three times ... [laughter] measure three times cut launch right\nSo we do that and I'm a lunch we are getting the confirmed measure much the windows or order they come in your installers show up so we don't use quote just installers are folks are\nA Anderson certified master installers\nAnd what that means is we have a scope ... pie and guidelines in these windows have to be installed by okay I often tell people that windows ... there's two home improvement projects they're really scare me\nWhen I Am a roofing those too that if they're done incorrectly oh yeah they will rot your house to the ground\nOkay yeah I Do we need to make sure that it's being done properly um obviously we have great building inspectors and codes in Florida that help us with that uh but I Believe it or not folks can still cut a lot of corners and so we make sure we do it right\nSo what would happen say if you know real real they understand it and then the home that insulation process has to be gone and you're taking out the window than you do find some things structurally wrong\nWell we hope that that doesn't happen we trying to spot it but you're you're exactly right it can happen in ... in this great state of Florida there's a lot of there's a lot of humidity and there's a lot of ways for water to get in these walls that we can't see I'm hoping\nThat's where this concierge service comes and [laughter] and again and we'll have the answers for me\nTo show what would happen in that case um uh when we designed a window we priced out just the window in the cosmetic area within a couple of inches of the window but if we find out when we remove this window we've gotten mode infestation and all types of things going on in rotten all the things you\nJust pray that wouldn't be there yes um what we have to do then is we have to bring in a we have to uh refer you to a an al ... Khan tractor that wouldn't the specialize in structural damage\nAnd get that are taking care of some on it or to some degree we can handle a just depends on how severe it is\nAnd you've got people that you trust and you're ready and they can pick up that phone and ...\nWe wouldn't we wouldn't put anybody anybody's home we didn't trust\nThat's comforting yes um let's say to go smoothly no bombs at all which we all hope of course with renewable Anderson about how long are you looking for this to be happening in your home and let's say if you're doing\nTen windows attend went to swap out I mean is that you know a week's worth of open holes in your house or is it something that hopefully a lot smoother than what\nGen if it was our first job involving takes us about a much but a census since we do ah you know two billion dollars a year we pretty fast or this but we are good too yeah go ... normally it would take a you can usually say about a day for every four windows and that's being conservative but we'd rather\nYou know we'd rather a over promise a I mean a under promise rather than over promise\nFive times the most iconic brand or the booming cannabis industry just went public joined me I peeled now by time investor dot com dome as your chance to be part of it for you know making busy at high time investor dot com five times investor\nDot com huts I'm sold the corps offering will be made only by means of offering circular which has been filed with unqualified by the U.S securities Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investments years of ...

[noise]\n\nWelcome to the renewal home show\nBringing you expert advice for home improvement and energy efficiency\nAnd now here's your host Ghana [noise]\nLuckily to them I knew how much I think you sound like you're spending part of your day here with as if you or anything like me the eye why home improvements I'm all for it I just need to know more about it before I started diving and I'm here with Patrick more from University of roofs and contracting and one of these\nAnd when I moved to Florida in two thousand and four was flying in and seeing blue tarps everywhere almost every home\nAnd that's not a decorative thing it's not a decorative bang and I owned one home prior to that and it was new construction and never in my life than I\nEver thought about a roof over placing a root for when you need to replace a real for how do you know when it's time to replace a roof and to this day I still see dark everywhere is it because of where we live or is it because that's just a homeowner thing\nWell I mean Florida's twilight zone right I mean they were like our own little country down here but I mean all seriousness yeah I mean it's actually not uncommon I mean we are over a year now from a Hurricane Irma which uh you know cause a lot of damage I still\nHave a lot of neighbors getting nervous repaired and replace from that\nOh yeah yeah and so a lot of people have for whatever reason have been putting off of replacing the roof or maybe they don't even know that the roof is leaking or you know there's all these different things but uh yeah it is not uncommon even\nStill a year later or over a year later does is he a tarp sewing houses all over central Florida I mean they're everywhere I mean I live in winter park and I've got a couple of houses near me or the ... I'm Still you know\nAnd that's where the homes and realize that there is a problem for many there can be a slow leak there can be stuff going on in the rules that\nYou wouldn't know that there is a problem going on and I'm sure you see that a lot when you finally get into a home you're like you know this has been happening for a really long time so what are some of the initial finds that your roof\nMay need repairs and distress or needs complete replacing\nSure yeah that's a great that's a great question because\nA lot of people saw the obvious signs right so there's a big wet spot over their kitchen or they noticed in the bathroom you know the drywall is starting to bubble up or or may have been as extreme as actually we've been in homes where there's holes in the ceiling because so much water was coming into the house which is\nYou know a terrible terrible place to be and so those are the ones where people were very quickly I Need to get somebody here I Need to find out what's going on and that's the people that we've been\nHelping predominantly over the last you know year or so since Hurricane Irma [laughter] ah but what we're still finding even now a year and a year or so later after Irma is people are now just noticing they have water spots right you know or they just now noticed the the ceiling is bubbling up um\nMaybe they just looked in a corner of the room in their house they just never look at and they see yellow on the white drywall um and so we're going into homes now and there's often what happens is there's a leak in your roofing system and it might be so small and so slow\nThat for that water to penetrate through the roofing system and get to the actual visible places when your house can literally take this long\nShared a roof ... right yeah you got to take a long time for you to figure out hey something's wrong here right\nYeah and so there's so many people that are dealing with this with their roofs that they're calling us going to have a leak\nIn really what to do and really what's been happening is it's been leaking for a year\nOr because they have shingles missing that they don't know about the torn shingles have singles that have lifted um where the water is driving up under the shingles which it's not supposed to do right and that is really the greatest opportunity for water to get into your roofing system is underneath the shingles\nAfter that bond breaks where the shingle kinda tax down south yeah once the when pops up it's really difficult for that to lay back down and stick back the way it was I always say it's kind of like a sticker right like if you take a um Hi my name is Patrick and you put that sticker on your shirt right if you take the sticker off\nThen you put it back on your shirt ill stick but not the same right by the fibers and things aren't in the more you do it at some point it just doesn't stick at all and you're saying a single is like that yeah so what happens is a shingles will lift during the storm er during the win whatever it is ... as a lift\nTacky underneath the shingle it gets debris underneath it gets ... your water it gets a leaves it gets a little debris underneath there and it's not gonna stick back so I was just that house not long ago in\nA house like totally normal and I got up on the roof and literally the whole back of the house I just went around with one finger in every single shingle lifted up\nSomeone looks fine it looked normal but when you actually got up there you can see it at the start even compromise\nExactly and we find that a lot of universal refund contracting where people call us and they'll say\nI'm not missing anything goes I think my roof is fine it's just I Want to make sure and we go out and sure enough\nShingles are lifted there might be shingles torn in so don't just assume because it visually looks good that it's in good shape I mean there's a very good chance that\nThere could be something going on and especially if you notice any yellow ing and your ceiling mhm anything that looks like a water spot whether it looks like it's dried up or it looks like it's fresh give us a call and we'll come out and inspected and find out what's going on\nBut I Will also say there's a lotta roofing companies that are fly by night you know I encourage my customers when they're trying to compare us versus others\nIf I don't know the company I just say hey you know when you're asking talking to another company just ask them how long have they been in business you know or have they been in business for since Hurricane Irma\nThat may say a little bit about what their intentions are and it doesn't mean that every roofing company that did is bad but you know just junior due diligence so that way if you do have an issue with the roof down the work down the road and the company's stand behind the work and I can say without a doubt universal roofing contracting can within twenty five years and we're not going anywhere\nAnd you have the warranties to back it up exactly and you actually have like a next level kind of warrants yeah I'm a little more about that\nSo we are a platinum contractor I'm with Owens Corning a which is a great company uh we install Owens Corning in certain teaching those but specifically Owens corny where one of the few platinum contractors\nA preferred contractors in the ... area and um we are really proud of that because it means that we have been a certified and know how to specifically installed their roofing system\nAlong with that a certification huh hum and recognition ... Corning we can also offer warranties\nThat other companies can't offer their extended more real bust warranties homeowners can um can take with the roofing system that other Owens courting of contractors can offer they just can't that comes with the platinum prefer exactly\n... and there is only I'm a really a little bit more than a handful of those even in Orlando and the central Florida in Orlando area so it's a\nPretty big yeah that sounds like a big deal I like I like a better warranty pretty proud of it I think I'm gonna look you know\nMy a person in the eye and say you've given me the best possible risk that protect my home and my family and and everything and it I mean that's that's hugely important\nBecause every system comes with a standard warranty from Owens Corning um but this is kind of step up so if you want added protection an added value for your roofing system\nWe can offer that whereas other companies can't so you know that's a big value to a lot of people out there and uh it's something that we can offer that other people can't\nThat's fantastic Patrick I'm sitting here at Patrick more from universal refund contracting and if you're thinking about\nNow it's time to get that roof looked at it's time to get that work done uh right now the first seven colors during the show right now\nFifteen Percent off new roof installation and by calling you can also get priority placement on the list as well\nSo if you're thinking about it just going to make the call and get on the list now at four zero seven eight zero nine five one five six that's four zero seven eight zero nine fifty one sex again for zero seven eight zero nine five one five six so the process of replacing or if you've not been through it before and they just come and take the whole rip off\nAnd you know everything's open air and you gotta wait through the ... it's it's done in a very deliberate process yeah kind of wanting to that but he doesn't put fewer shatter\nYeah so we are very process driven in terms of making sure that we're very efficient and very effective when we install your roof we do not want your roof exposed anymore than it has to be with the wood ducking open air\nLike that like you have your plan is shingles off and it's just the would share usually at the data pull everything off and then a day to put everything back on but it's Florida that evening thunderstorms going to come up with\nWhat's happening there are we\nSo we're really so I Will say this about our crews are cruiser like amateur meteorologist like the little chemicals in their head or antennas and they just know when a storm is going to come and they're really great about\nCovering the roof and typing in and we really never have any issues with that that blood but at the same time you know we're so efficient and effective that quite often most shingle roofs an average shingle roof we can do in a day to day and a half\nAnd the main thing is that tear off process when we get down to the ... as soon as we get that would\nExposed and we re nail it if we need to buy code or um we get that under lame it down and that's really what protects the house so if you was to be a little sprinkler rush hour we are putting cover it but our guys are very efficient they're effective we're not running back and forth to the to the supply store going oh we forgot this forgot that everything's there\nThat we pull into dumped trailer or to the house you know it is loud noisy and dirty I mean it is what it is it's really you want it to be right but it's going to happen quickly and efficiently and effectively for you and when we leave you're going to have a great roof and you're not even get to know we were there\nAnd you have a great we want you to go a long way that actually that as well so if you're thinking about\nUh it's finally time I know there's that you've seen a lot of your neighbors having this done and you just want to have him come out and take a look highly recommend contacting universal roof and contracting um when I had my roof re down a few years ago it was you know a beautiful process but\nI I Know so much more about it now like I Wish I Would have asked the question is if I Would have paid attention to you know what were they using and how were they applying it how long did it take like\nI've gotten such a great education on roofing from you Patrick thank you so much but\nAside from the warranties and and and that you guys can walk people through like an insurance bumps along the way what are like you're taught to take away is about what sets universal recent contracting apart from other rivers here in Florida\nI think what you just said is a perfect example mhm we think of ourselves as a consultant our job is to teach you what it takes to put the best roof on your home that not every Rufus the same ... there are different shingles there's different systems there's different crews there's there's all these things involved in the process\nWe're not a hard sale organization and we're not going to beat you up over the head are not gonna make you sign a piece of paper the second I Walk up to your door when I'm walking through the process we're going to explain to you why we're better and why the system and the products for use are better than other companies\nAnd so at the end of the day we want you to want us because we definitely want your business as well and we're going to earn it so um that's the biggest thing is ask questions and the other thing too I took a toll customers out their potential homeowners customers\nIs when you're looking at your roof find out if you're comparing apples to apples to apples to oranges\nThere is a lot of people think that a roof is a roof and so you know there's certain cars if you if you buy one car versus another car and you know one car you know ... there's a difference in a car and a truck right they're not apples apples there's different parts to it and so they do kind of the same thing but they perform differently mhm", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "15"}
