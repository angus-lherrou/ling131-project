if you're on the rise thresholds on income they're going to tax you on\nThe racial Joe loved so most people the majority of people I Would say are are going to have their Social Security tax not only\nAre all your other tax deferred accounts can be taxed as ordinary income but your Social Security can be tax too that it's just keep coming that just doesn't seem right to me right it but there is a solution if you have enough tax free income make a drop you blow a threshold and\nBoom your Social Security is not taxed anymore\nI said at one more time help me understand what you're saying\nIf

to happen down the road\nSo a lot of people are what are called rolling the dice ride the roller dies in the future on this tax deferred accounts when I go to use them in retirement uh-huh the taxes are going to be lower\nRight yeah 'cause that was that thinking that I was a logical that's basically it but what can they do what can they do a you know what can they do about the Social Security being tax\nWhat can they do about taxes going up on them in the future and having to pay that actual higher tax burden kicking the can down the road rolling the dice that hey maybe hopefully taxes

the tyranny\nOf the urgent to be specific uh uh oh by the way I'm Joel Hunter and I'm here with Joel\nHunter might yes yes and then here we are Ninety three point one and and one of the things that we're we're trying to figure out return to talk through\nUm is when we're helping you help others or how can we help you um\nTo to keep that from being an overwhelming task where you're just responding to the immediate need in front of you um and take it to a level where it's deeply meaningful um\nAnd and your mission and you're and you're doing your mission in life and therefore you're fulfilled by it instead of totally stressed out and dream by yeah because ultimately\nA win win the human machine when any machine runs the way that it's supposed to uh there is a nothing nothing\n... runs quite as well there's there's a harmony or where everything just kind of seems to sing the way that it's supposed to win the human machine runs well and and and so it built into us is this you know this desire to help\n'em and if if uh if helping seems like I literally I'm already ... red lining it all the time I have no time even for myself uh\nUm I I the last thing to do is add one more thing I'm first off congratulations on on not bowing to the tyranny of the ... ah that's that's today's today's topic\nAh but also um it speaks to or something where you might be able to solve more problems overall because there is there is a balance to what's important and what's urgent um and uh\nUh because there are genuinely urgent things you know like you know I I imagine that if in an E R physician read the tyranny of the urgent and so it was like Dr this patients bleeding and he's like no no no [laughter]\nNot going to get me with that [laughter]\nI'm In a kind of played exist in the un twenty minute or\nSo there are things that are genuinely urging um and and uh but it's not that urgency and importance they're not the same thing at the same thing at all um what what do you think a ... ... when things are when things are urgent\nAnd important I mean because urgency by the very nature is something that's in your face grabs your attention that's what makes it urging right um ... what what do you what's the litmus test to tell if something is just urgent or if it's urgent and also important and if I ... I Can't say or just again or it'll lose all meaning\n[laughter]\nWell that's the question is I mean you you've hit on\nYou know what they're used to be a game show called the sixty four thousand dollar question um and and it's the big question of the of the of the show and so just trying to discern those two is what we're trying to help other people do um and and there's a list of things that you can go through\nUm that that are impending things that is important for you to get to but there should be some sort of order for example I'm changing and exploding diaper that is both urgent and important yeah and so you do need to drop what you're doing whatever that is yeah\nAnd pay attention to the fact that we've been and I knew the author rough situation [laughter]\nUm and and paying the bills by their due date that's a that's a really important thing and and so you need to uh pay attention to the to that I'm watching your neighbors children while while they desperately uh I'm run to the hospital best best of both in your uh\nImportant in ... when it comes to stuff like emails you know for um OCD people like I Am you know I Want to clean air I Want to clean box I Want to clean the inbox um and so I have a habit of whenever I get an email to just take a look at it that is a dumb habit\nA Stephen Covey once said uh he doesn't ever open an email that he's not ready to answer right then huh hum because if you if you open an email and just lay there it just lays there\nAnd the tension mount without a response and so you got to figure out some of these things\nYou know it's important that answered the mail um um or delete it or you know send it on um\nIt's it for some emails is not urgent you know I wrote Stephen Covey an email with the subject\nAfter twenty thirty [laughter] and this explains a lot about why he had gotten act as the as an open us the whole\nThing is that right there that I Know after this right now but that is true I mean when you were talking about the things that are that are urgent and important\nYou know a a a a human need uh that that is time sensitive or that is going to cause a harm the harm to others uh if if it's not if it's not taking care of um the first thing the thing that I thought of right away even even before you brought up email was\nEmails and and uh ... where that is designed to capture your attention and all the algorithms that are designed when you're reading a news article to\nTo capture your attention or a\nYou know at the seven things that you won't believe or might happen yeah and you're ... when you get in your car next a number eight will shock you are and then a stand like that where they know where it doesn't even make sense but there is it's designed to have an urgency to it yeah I'm at because there's\nA all those situations you named\nOf our things that are important to an urgent they involve real live real people you know real situation um and that's in the in the virtual world you're able to tap into that same survival urgency mechanism you know that same limbic system you know get your attention that I'm\nA heightened awareness stuff\nBut because you can tap into it because you know the right color is the right words the right stuff to put together and and how to hit people just drink again people are paid a bunch of money to figure that out um and so that might be the place to start is stuff that\nJust your digital your digital world and people of your generation\nWho are much more uh plugged into various social media a type um Venus I'm have not only um a ton of contacts coming in\nUm but a number of those are your friends and you know old guys like ... like me I like I don't blame it on Facebook ... which saves me a lot of time [laughter]\nUh but uh but I Am on a couple of other of social media platforms\nAnd like when I get a a a message from a friend of mine like a high school classmate or a a hours or somebody who um knows me and\nUm they're not somebody ... I'm going to refer 'em then that adds a um an urgency to respond in a timely fashion so they don't disrespect them uh and so the more\nThe more social media platforms that you're on the more you're going to be I'm prone to a sense of of urgency or I'm a a sense of obligation\nUm and that is in addition to these professional attention getters that want to draw you into these conversations where you really are interested but I'm not sure I have time for\nYeah yeah and and they are I mean they're all part of the same\nA vast left wing conspiracy now they're ... they're all they're all part of the same or is that right wing to the the it's it's not a conspiracy but it is a business and the it's the business of of getting your attention of of of ... of stimulating your senses in a way that you don't want to put it out", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "12"}
