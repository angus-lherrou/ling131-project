walking through the process we're going to explain to you why we're better and why the system and the products we use are better than other companies\nAnd so at the end of the day we want you to want us because we definitely want your business as well and we're going to earn it so um that's the biggest thing is ask questions and the other thing too I'll talk to customers out their potential homeowners customers\nIs when you're looking at your roof find out if you're comparing apples to apples to apples to oranges\nThere's a lot of people think that a roof is a roof and so you know there's certain cars if you if you buy one car versus another car\nAnd you know one car you know ... there's a difference in a car and a truck right they're not\nApples apples there's different parts to it and so they do kind of the same thing but they performed differently mhm and so it's the same thing with roofing there's a big difference in materials there is a big difference in labor there's a big difference inexperienced and especially warranty that's what I Know what you're buying and don't just assume it's the same\nAnd if anything give us a chance to come out and explain the differences so you can make an informed decision\nOkay All right I like all of that um but when it comes to roof damage which does more damage storms or squirrels\n[laughter] it's buddies you know the girls can do some damage I Know it was girls can do the damage real damage I or pesky situation where I\nI was in my office at home not too long ago and I heard like a water dripping into the roof and I was like okay my ... not that old or what's going on here\nAnd I called my my company back out there like a squirrel is eating the yourself ... ... it happens all the time I mean you must see some pretty incredible\nThings are it's crazy I just went to a house that had a\nA whole family of um of raccoons living in or out and um I we see squirrels chew stuff all the time\nUh it's crazy I mean it ... and unfortunately you know sometimes there's nothing you can do about it but um you know that's another perfect example of things that we do differently other companies install what they call led booth they just wrap ... led around those pipes that come out of your roof I think they ... they do to them they actually cut their teeth on them that's how they cut their teeth like maybe my kids we should do that with\nTheir right but it\nOral squirrels do that they cut their teeth so we we as a company made a decision we don't put lead on those pipes anymore we put we called Bola boot kind of a hard rubber a material that goes right over the top of that pipe and make sure that things are not going to leak more importantly the squirrels don't chew on them\nOh my gosh I haven't even really thought about everything\nOh yeah we don't we don't we don't skimp we don't cut corners we do it the right way because quite honestly I don't want to come back out to your roof and fix things I Want to be putting roost on other people's houses so we do it right the first time and then you know on the one off that we get something wrong we come out and fix it 'cause we've been around for twenty five years\nYou're not going to call the office and get a dead signal and hope somebody shows up right we have people there and we will take care of everything\nBut I Love everything about that and if you're thinking about it's time for you to take the next step I highly recommend calling us the crew at interest of the river and contracting a ... for all of those reasons or they they definitely stand behind their work we've got the warranties and the platinum preferred status for that congratulations on that is awesome\nFifteen Percent a new roof installations of the first seven colors

one five six and four zero seven eight zero nine five one five six Patrick ... you certainly seem to know a whole\nLot about the right way to do roofing if there's one piece of advice you can leave everybody with today when it comes to knowing when it's time to make that call what can you even with\nKnowing when it's time to things if you see people around you getting getting roofs you know it's a ... you would I Would go ahead and call that is probably a good chance or maybe some hail an area or wind damage okay the second thing is obviously if you just hear leaking or you see any kind of water spot in there or you just got an old roof\nGive us a call will come out and look at it and will advise you maybe a little more time maybe you don't maybe it's time to call your insurance company

Fox News fifty two hundred troops heading down to eight enforcement as the migrant caravan heads nor as\nAnd I was going to get there this see this is the problem when you lead African Americans and I knew to know um uh but yeah you're absolutely\nRight with with the Democratic party is they are\nFormed today as they present themselves today I mean literally what was it ... I don't recall how many years ago another platform I think that was in two thousand fourteen two thousand six you know I'm not sure\nBut they basically are denied God I mean they\nThey don't want it didn't basically they did they did they disavowed\nGod they wanted nothing to do with him uh and and then the mayor of Los Angeles at the time I forget his name uh played it off as if they didn't but that's what we're\nGoing through so we look at this this rural hill murder\nWe look at say ... or ... and the the missing\nFactor is got all of this all their stuff is just we were just dealing with symptoms of the lack of civility and the culture all this stuff we're we're dealing with symptoms and I know we can't talk about it's amazing to me I don't even hear conservative talk about it um Hartley but notice who the victims were\nIf you go looking at the squirrel hill synagogue shooter or by this or by this guy Robert Bowers look at look at who the victims were who were the victims let's think about this\nThe victims were people of worship now I'm In an evangelical Christian so I don't subscribe to the ... although we do believe\nIn the holy Bible obviously I subscribe to the old and New Testament whereas they uh subscribe to the Torah if you will\n\nBut what were they doing they were in a ... service a Sabbath service Saturday service worshipping\nGod so they weren't the ones they weren't the perpetrators with the with the guns they weren't the one's going out and hunting people or to kill them they weren't professing that others were committing genocide on them although\nThat had been the case during the Holocaust they were the worshipers they were the ones in services worshipping God and so they were not the murderers this squirrel he'll murderer\nOr the synagogue that what what is it the tree of life synagogue\nHe did this wasn't this\nThat's where our high school your high school you get in the high schools and you you talk about everybody talks about success is going to college but yet they don't talk about the burden that they put on the parents or the students but the point you\nYou get them out there if you want to go to college and finished college after you start making a good income and you've got that fancy car or you buy a house I recommend everybody try to invest in the house or whatever but you teach them\nThose valuable things and you want to go to college you can go back to college when you can afford it that's what I'm Talking about coming out the only the college getting yourself in huge debt\nAnd then being being

for you ask Congress dot com waiting for U.S Congress dot com\nOr when before we went to the break all we were talking about uh the educational system we touched on we touched on veterans we touched on the educational system I think you had good ideas for both let's move on quickly to national security what do you propose for national security that was one of the topics on your website\nYes well we yeah obviously everybody's talking about the war which is obviously very very serious because we do have folks coming across the border we have no idea about you know the wall more technology drone technology but we have to slow it down\nUm you know our security is you know our country or frankly right and you utilizing what they've got a lot of people and I'm going to I'm going to put this in perspective is you know we're pretty open were or democracy in a republic\nAnd um you know sometimes our weaknesses are our other ah countries are our enemies strikes so they know or a week out they knew our laws better than we do quite frankly\nI'm they know it's tough for us to defend the wall they they love what's going on right now a for instance this caravan coming up um I call it an invasion I don't call immigration yeah All right oh it's a little rough it's a little rough but you know\nWe have what actually is we know that I Know that a lot of this has been funded now and so it absolutely is\nAnd you know I have medical concerns quite frankly 'cause my ... medical I did program at the arch east back in the eighties and and and my wife is involved in health care all her life you know we talk about this we have no idea what's coming across that border we have\nNo medical records we have no inoculation records nothing\nAnd yet they're coming across catch and release which is you know the administration of president say is is actually a farce and it is\nIn in in retrospect of you know I'm criminals and stuff but I'm I'm so focused on the medical concerns because I Know everybody's focusing on MSN Thirteen and and child trafficking which is a it's a big issue as well but do we have maybe medical facilities across the border\nThat we can cooperate with Mexico to make sure the people coming in are cleared and we know what's coming in and of course the immigration process has to be fixed you know what the you\nKnow go ahead no you know that a ... yeah I'm Glad that you mentioned that as well because\nI was from some of the column that I've read and some of the things that I've heard a lot of people that were participating in this uh uh this this caravan of illegal or migrants that at this point once they crossed over bust through the Mexican border\nI'm ... a lot of them were dropping out because they were say now I ... and sometimes it it's hard\nBecause with this issue it's easy to sound so heartless but the bottom line is every nation is sovereign\nAnd it amazes me that when you look at uh I didn't bring it with me today but sometimes I Will literally keep just like the institution I'll keep a copy of Mexico's border policy\nIt is so stringent it's not even funny we look like fools and the way that we keep our borders just open for anybody to come into America without us knowing who they are without us knowing what type of diseases they could be bringing\nIt's just absolutely ... absolutely ridiculous oh it's amazing to me\nThat left is bash America but the rest of these countries are went around the world will not do when it comes to immigration what the United States is doing ... letting a million people in per year legally\nAnd then all these people guy knows how many illegally are coming in\nWell and that's just that's the point I mean what we're doing is a you know it's it's it's just absolutely ridiculous and you know it has another pundit thing that that uh the president has asked Congress\nTo fix the immigration policy and of course they have not they just continue but yet now they want to get rid of ice and what's ironic is here's a an organization that doesn't do their job\nIs trying to get rid of the people that are doing their job meaning Congress not doing their job but yet they want to ... to get rid of ice you know that are doing their job and you know it's just the concept manipulation you know and when I when my my kids were growing up I said listen always\nI Want to go to this column that was written by Dennis Prager a we're kind of been a time crunch because we have mark meal's coming up at the top of the hour and there were some stuff that we missed a with a Wayne Liebnitzky ... about his opponent and I want operating quickly share some of the issues that you should be concerned about because\nI wanted to make sure when Wayne was on that we heard a we heard what he was four instead of just hearing about what the other candidate is war what he's against per se so waned when he was expressing his views are his policies that that he would like to help push in DC I thought he did a really good job what is Darren Soto about\nRight well when he was in the legislature and ... and you still pushing on gun safety restrictions he wants to ban assault weapons\nAnd assault weapons or whatever\nOr semi what an automatic weapon whether it's a rifle or a shotgun or a handgun\nAnd semi automatic if you're not familiar with guns and I'm assuming mostly you if not all of you in our audience are you squeeze the trigger it shoots\nOne shot at a time\nSo ultimately what left just want to do is ban every\nKind of an old guns except for ... and ... okay so what's next I'm On a reproductive health he abortion yeah he has been endorsed by Planned Parenthood activity everything\nHe's ... he fought against the twenty four hour waiting period\nWhich the Florida Supreme Court will shut down okay on Social Security he's against ... privatization to try and prolonged it and grow it really yeah he wants to guarantee that it's fully funded by the government oh two Twenty one ... a hundred and beyond\nThe next hundred years okay on on the environment he's against offshore drilling\nHe wants to ban fracking he believes in manmade global warming\nOkay ah when it comes to el GV T he sponsored\nLegislation to remove the definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman and he wants to allow homosexual and lesbian couples to be able to adopt okay on\nHealth care he's a big fan of Obamacare you also want so does that ... or in other words he's pushing social eyes medicine\nLast ... last week at the end of the program we broke down and why that's a farce perhaps we'll have time to touch on it a little bit any one of the expand Medicaid\nYeah which uh which is what Obama should have did in the first place instead of destroying the and hire a system one hundred per destroy one hundred percent of our medical system does supposedly fix ten percent and just destroyed oh what\nDoes ... who pays medic who pays for Medicaid\nWe do the state\nYou know we would have to include yet but we ate taxes as true\nTrue true true true sure well according to kill him he would just get the six billion dollars from the federal government\nYes but it's six billion a need for a certain number of years and who pays for it afterwards\nI Know and that's the state is stuck with it which is why we turned it down there right Rick Scott thing on\nImmigration reform he wants through the legal with a pathway to citizenship\nWhat the heck does that mean that means citizenship for illegal means cross the border yeah you're American that's it\nActually you're you're anti American but you live in America\nAnd what a good jobs and the economy he wants to fund local initiatives these wanting Fifteen million to build a high tech sense of manufacturing facility in Kissimmee which\nThis is this is what frustrates me about the ... okay so he wants to create jobs that I just think about this but those are you on Facebook or for those of you in the listening audience right now\nWhen Democrats say they want to create jobs what do they do they take money out of your pocket they take money out of the economy in order to build business I don't need you to steal from me to build business right\nIf you want to build a business ... it's amazing to me that they say they can get\nJobs like this this is why Obama or his whole philosophy his ideology that's why his economy it it just dunked under him that's why you can get in\nMore than what was that one and a half percent growth are rounding like that I think he topped out a loop there was one month that he had three percent or higher yeah and then I'm basically honestly what ... what happened under Obama is that people just get used to living\nOn the list yes last suffering\nAnd over again on Monday by David ... ... it was so the only reason the economy at some point did good 'cause there was like okay we're gonna we're gonna we're going to learn how to be Americans despite\nA President Obama in his policies but it acting like the tax cut didn't have a major impact on the economy absolutely ridiculous anything else from Darren Soto why we should be concerned um was that ...\nThat was pretty much he's got some stuff from Puerto Rico but it's\nAll right so don't even worry about him go to wane for U.S Congress dot com Wayne for U.S Congress dot com we have a very short period of time before we have to go to a break so I'm not even sure\nIf I should start out with this column yeah let's since uh since is such a short period of time let's let's not start with this\nUm let me let me just go back real quickly to this issue with a phase or ... in this world\nHe'll synagogue if you allow allow me to go back in what we'll do at the top of the hour like I said mark meals will be calling in will touch on the Senate races that are\nThat are pretty close and then hopefully Republicans can win or he'll just listen he he's a guy that's just going to shoot straight with me one of the things that I uh I I I like about the I like about him\nBut I definitely want to I Want you to understand what America is is is about and so we'll get to the dentist Prager column it's nothing that many of you uh you probably already understand you get Americanism if you will\nBut I think sometimes it's just good to hear it\nA canoe for conservatives to hear from Republicans stay here and so that we could reiterated uh reiterate our views and what America is about to others then is Prager in my opinion you guys know Prager you\nYeah I'm sure you've heard of his radio show or he just does a great job he's a brilliant man and does a great job of making things really simple um\nBut just a just quickly or some more information on a squirrel hill a synagogue murderer or six or he killed eight people total there were there were a eight men and three women killed\nOr the guy was just a absolute a man ...\nEleven people killed ... I Know ... eight men and we're in women's ... eleven people killed okay so for a total of eleven I'm Sorry if I if I mess up their outs excel a mess [laughter]\nOne of the ... one of the people there I'm not sure if this was a man or woman I Believe this was a woman I didn't write this down\nWas a Holocaust survivor Ninety two years old Ninety seven Ninety seven yes run I mean ... years old Holocaust survivor or and then she was murdered while she's worshipping in a church I'm telling you the problem with our culture is the lack of God that's where the lack of civility is coming from [laughter]\n\n\nWas hardest audience and talk radio news radio not everyone\nPicking at selling your home but one at so fast and for top dollar Hi this is ... Roberts with some important news\nMy friend Laura Peterson at front gate ... and her team may already have a buyer for you yet you heard me correctly Lawrence team currently has buyers and they're exclusive buyers and waiting program\nThe fact is they have more ... which means more money and faster sale for you Lewis timeframe for selling homes is thirty five percent faster than the average age\nAnd at the same time they also get their clients eight percent more money for example just ask Adriana who sold her house an eight days at one hundred one percent of asking price\nLaura is so confident that you're home will sell that they will guarantee it in writing if you're home doesn't sell she'll buy at a price acceptable to you guaranteed so if you're selling your home called Laura Peterson at front gate realty\nFrom your cell call pound to fifty then said the key word real estate that's pounded two fifty and say the key word real estate\nCure soothing for common ignorance yet to toughen penetrating use once a day every day and Rush Limbaugh the old ... old carrying all sensing old feeling old and a certain ... past fast relief from everyday stupidity washing mall radio program Americans\nReal anchorman and American troops are sector and the girl democracy\nRush Limbaugh weekdays\nNaughty ... one WFL Larry do do you find ... ... patients Fremont or Orlando news radio nutty free point one WFL a and I heard a radio station [noise]\nEasy on the border I leave ... Fox News fifty two hundred troops now headed to the U.S southern border as thousands of migrants mostly from central and South America make their way North Koreans\nAnd now they're shows that they're the typically tied your thought let\nMe I I think that's the case I think it's been the case since after the primaries when the races really started a heating up I think both if you really dig down into into some of these polls are that are available publicly for instance the CBS News Hugo pull over the weekend\nThey really do um you can really get into the the inter um\nInner workings of the cold and and really [noise]\nAnd the way they ask questions scene where voters are she held voters feel about their candidates how entrenched voters are are are they likely to change their minds and we have a very very solid\nI'm a group of Republicans Ninety percent of Republicans are voting for Scott and they're not changing their mind Ninety percent of Democrats voting Nelson\nThey're not changing their minds Nelson wins um independence by a a small margin and most of those have already been set and so you have\nA ... you have basically two walls of voters that are not moving\nOkay you have roughly four percent or so of the electorate that is a up in the air at this point let me on that that could be that could be changed your bowl one way or another and you know the call this this really all comes down to turn out right\nThere and wait let me let me ask you this real quick martyr given a you just said it it comes it comes down to turn out from this\nComing out here next week do you think that a benefit Scott as far as turnout is concerned could you see Scott and not necessarily pulling away I think this race will be a squeaker either way it was quite frankly\nYes it will ah but a benefit to Scott with Trump coming out perhaps\nUh I think it's possible yeah but I I I I don't know that it's going to make that much\nBecause you believe that people are just done\nRight it's it's already it's people are already dug in I think most people have already made up their minds the issue is whether people are actually going to show up or not\nShould be concerned given that it's a tight race and he's been a senator for uh since uh Jesus Christ return\nYeah I I look I I think both of them are you have a you have somebody and Rick Scott who's been around eight years he's not exactly a duty\nTo 'em and so uh I I think this is always ... Nelson was always going to have a\nTough race Scott got in and Scott did the Republican Party a lot of favors because he forced\nDemocrats and Democrat independent expenditure are they going to spend money here the point and they had ten seats\nTo defend this year Carl a Democrat senators in states where Trump won\nAnd so even if Scott\nEven if Scott loses by a little bit um I hate to put it this way or as a Republican but he would have done or Republicans of big favor by getting in force the Democrats and Nelson to have to spend money on Penn State were otherwise they wanted to spend it elsewhere\nOkay so even if he loses using a a the your thoughts are he he really did do the Republicans\nA big favor no question okay All right that's a that's pretty interesting okay I'm not predicting he's losing [laughter] I Hope not\nPeople Republicans turnout turnout turnout turnout a well marketed\nIt just it's fascinating are looking at a turnout numbers\nIs there is there a poll that you like better than others when I'm looking at the real clear politics averages I'd noticed you mentioned CBS News that you go\nOh yeah there is there there's a poll that had um really the only poll that did in my opinion a good job in the primary\nI'm back in August [noise] it's a firm called St Pete poll oh yeah yeah yeah okay and so the reason\nThey were good is because they tended to poll later although they did one last week\nThey tended uphold later and they tended to poll that they don't include people who say they're not going to vote okay they call you up are you voting and they say no then click and they're interviewing more people they nailed to the white Gillum\nA movement in the Democratic primary and they also had the Sanders said about twenty two points when other polls showed up putting them moving which they were all garbage went they were terrible polls\nAnd they were among the ... last week that are ... are they were among the first last week the show that the scientists was closing the gap at least in the polls I think they had him down by one and I was like is this and out lie\nWell I I think this is this is where it's all going to wind up going to wind up a tight race anyway okay All right so we we look at turnout numbers and and where turnout friends are are leading to try to figure out what may happen at the end\nOkay All right ah just real a real quick\nA minute or less and then I'm going to have the can I can keep you on the other the other side okay just real quick this cruise in O'Rourke raise a cruise or five points up it showing quickness Quinnipiac\nUh what's your take on that obviously O'Rourke has gotten a load of money out there are there deem and this guy the next Robert F F Kennedy um ... what's your take president yet you he's running for president right now and that you think 'cause I don't think he's going to win this race\nNow he's not okay ... Cruz was going to win this race but um Texas is a changing state as ah the metro areas get a bigger a hate here on our blue Texas is a changing state I'm mainly Cruz is going to win\nAll right you didn't have the depressed me with that one I hate I hate even thinking about it and they tell me to be a real All right well let's let's go ahead and take a break we'll take a look at a few more of these\nUh senatorial races across the country you're listening so Carl Jackson show mark meals on the line\nWith\nCourage accent here for a fern foundation home inspections home is the largest investment you make so if you're looking to buy a home and you want to make sure your purchase is a blessing and not a curse call my friend\nFrom foundation home inspections whether your first time buyer searching for your forever home or an investor don't make the mistake of signing the dotted line without having my friends have burned foundation give you their cell of approval burn foundation home inspections and sharing your peace of mind call three two one sixty\nFour zero two by four or go to Orlando is home inspector dot com\nIt's almost the blast off with a twenty Eighteen you see a football speed skating [noise] does it you see a bites dot com to watch that ice under the lights of spectrum city of Thursday night at seven thirty\nHey man here for my friends at the ...

I agree with you if you go to if you go to Spain I Would expect to see Spaniards I wouldn't expect to see a lot of diversity and culture I could be completely wrong on this but I don't think I Am Africa South Africa\nObvious from South Africa you mention in base during\nThe apartheid era was what was labeled as separate development okay All right so the ethnic groups would divided and um they lived in certain areas in any of that to co mingling workplaces\nBut I Will also say there's a lotta roofing companies that are fly by night you know I encourage my customers when they're trying to compare us versus others\nIf I don't know the company I just say hey you know when you're asking talking to another company just ask them how long have they been in business you know or have they been in business for since Hurricane Irma\nThat may say a little bit about what their intentions are and it doesn't mean that every roofing company that did is bad but you know just junior due diligence so that way if you do have an issue with the roof down the work down the road and the company stand behind the work and I can say without a doubt universal refund contracting can we've been here twenty five years and we're not going anywhere\nAnd you have the war and he has to back it up exactly and you actually have like a next level kind of warrants yeah how many more about that\nSo we are a platinum contractor I'm ... with Owens Corning or which is a great company or we install Owens Corning in certain teach singles but specifically Owens Corning where one of the few platinum contractors\nA preferred contractors in the ... area and um we are really proud of that because it means that we have been a certified and know\nHow to specifically installed their roofing system\nAlong with that a certification huh hum and recognition violence Corning we can also offer warranties\nThat other companies can't offer their extended more real bust warranties homeowners can\nUm can take with their roofing system that other Owens courting of contractors can offer they just can't and that comes with the platinum prefer exactly yup ... and there is only I'm a really a little bit more than a handful of those even in Orlando and the central Florida in Orlando area so it's a\nPretty big yeah that sounds like a big deal I like I like a better warranty pretty proud of it I like being able to look you know\nMy a person in the eye and say you get to be the best possible risk to protect my home and my family and and everything and it I mean that's that's hugely important\nBecause every system comes with a standard warranty from Owens Corning um but this is kind of a step up so if you want added protection and added value for your roofing system we can offer that whereas other companies can't so you know that's a big value to a lot of people out there and it's something that we can offer that other people can't\nAs fantastic Patrick I'm sitting here at Patrick more from universal refund contracting and if you're thinking about\nNow it's time to get that roof looked at it time to get that work done uh right now the first seven colors during the show right now\nFifteen Percent off new roof installations and by calling you can also get priority placement on the list as well\nSo if you're thinking about it just go ahead make the call and get on the list now at four zero seven eight zero nine five one five six that's four zero seven eight zero nine fifty one sex again for zero seven eight zero nine five one five six so the process of replacing a rift you've not been through it before and they just come and take the whole rip off\n[laughter] and you know everything's open air and you gotta wait through the ... it's it's done in a very\nDeliberate process yeah kind of want that but he doesn't put viewer shatter\nYeah so we are very process driven in terms of making sure that we're very efficient and very effective when we install your roof and we did not while your roof exposed anymore than it has to be with the ...\nLike that like you have your punishing goes off and it's just the wood chair usually at the data pull everything off and then a day to put everything back on but it's Florida that evening thunderstorms going to come up with\nWhat's happening there we\nSo we're really so I Will say this about our crews are cruiser like amateur meteorologist like little chemicals in their head or antennas and they just know when a storm is going to come and they're really great about\nCovering the roof and typing in and we really never have any issues with that violent but at the same time you know we're so efficient and effective that quite often most shingle roofs an average shingle roof we can do in a day to day and a half\nAnd the main thing is that tear off process when we get down to the ... as soon as we get that would\nExposed and we re nail it if we need to buy code or um we get that under lame it down and that's really what protects the house so if you was to be a little sprinkler rush hour we are putting cover it but our guys are very efficient they're effective we're not running back and forth to the to the supply store going oh we forgot this forgot that everything's there\nThat we pull into dumped trailer or to the house you know it is loud noisy and dirty I mean it is what it is it's really wanted to be right but it's going to happen quickly and efficiently and effectively for you and when we leave you're going to have a great roof and you're not even gonna know we were there\nAnd you have a great warranted to go a long way that actually that as well so if you're thinking about\nI it's finally time I know there's that you've seen a lot of your neighbors having this done and you just want to have them come out and take a look I highly recommend contacting universal roof and contracting um when I had my roof read down a few years ago it was you know a beautiful process but\nI ... I Know so much more about it now like I Wish I Would have asked the question is if I Would have paid attention to you know what were they using and how were they applying it and how long did it take like\nI've gotten such a great education on roofing from you Patrick thank you so much but\nAside from the warranties and and and if that you guys can want people to like an insurance bumps along the way what are like you're taught to takeaways about what sets universal reason contracting apart from other rivers here in Florida\nI think what you just said is a perfect example mhm we think of ourselves as a consultant our job is to teach you what it takes to put the best roof on your home that not every roof is the same ... there are different shingles there's different systems there's different crews there's there's all these things involved in the process\nWe're not a hard sale organization and we're not going to beat you up over the head we're not gonna make you sign a piece of paper the second I Walk up to your door when I'm walking through the process we're going to explain to you why we're better and why the system in the products we use are better than other companies and so at the end of the day we want you to want us because we definitely\nWhile you're a business as well and we're going to earn it so um that's the biggest thing is ask questions and the other thing too I took ... customers out their potential homeowners customers\nIs when you're looking at your roof find out if you're comparing apples to apples are apples to oranges\nThere's a lot of people think that a roof the roof and so you know there are certain cars if you if you buy one car versus another car\nAnd you know one car you know ... there's a difference in a car in a truck right they're not apples apples there's different parts to it and so they do kind of the same thing but they performed differently mhm and so it's the same thing with roofing there's a big difference of materials there is a big difference in labor or there's a big difference inexperienced and especially warranty that's what I don't know what you're buying and don't just assume it's the same\nAnd if anything give us a chance to come out and explain the differences so you can make an informed decision\nOkay All right I like all of that um but when it comes to roof damage which does more damage storms or squirrels\n[laughter] it's funny you know the girls can do some damage I Know it was girls can do the damage real damage I ah or pesky situation where I I was\nIn my office at home not too long ago and I heard like a water dripping into the roof and I was like okay my ... not that old oh what's going on here and I called my my company back out there like a squirrel is eating the yourself that ... it happens all the time I mean you must see some pretty incredible things\nAren't as crazy I just went to a house that had a a whole family of um of raccoons living in their ... and um I we see squirrels chew stuff all the time\nUh it's crazy I mean it you know and unfortunately you know sometimes there's nothing you can do about it but um you know that's another example of things that we do differently other companies install what they call led booth they just wrap ... led around those pipes that come out of your roof I think that you know they do to them they actually cut their teeth on them that's how they cut their teeth like maybe my kids we should do that\nWith their right but it\nCorals squirrels do that they cut their teeth so we we as a company made a decision we don't put lead on those pipes anymore we put we called Bola boot the kind of a hard rubber a material that goes right over the top of that pipe and make sure that things are not going to leak more importantly the squirrels don't chew on them\nOh my gosh yeah even if you've you've thought about everything\nOh yeah we don't we don't we don't skimp we don't cut corners we do it the right way because quite honestly I don't want to come back out to your roof and fix things I Want to be putting roost on other people's houses so we do it right the first time and then you know on the one off that we get something wrong we come out and fix it because we've been around for twenty five years\nYou're not going to call the office and get a dead signal and hope somebody shows up right we have people there and we will take care of everything\nBut I Love everything about that and if you're thinking about it is time for you to take the next step I highly recommend calling us the crew at University of ... and contracting a for all of those reasons they they definitely stand behind their work we've got the warranties and the\nPlatinum preferred status yes congratulations on that is awesome Fifteen Percent a new roof installations of the first seven colors during the show can enjoy it that offer special to the show ... percent up new rules installations\nAnd calling for zero

about the right way to do roofing if there's one piece of advice you can leave everybody with today when it comes to knowing when it's time to make that call what can you even with\nKnowing when it's time to things if you see people around you getting getting roofs you know it's a great view would I Would go ahead and call that is probably a good chance or maybe some hail and the area or wind

industry quietly paid influenced scientific studies\nBy Harvard linking sugar consumption to coronary heart disease as a result the study implicated fat consumption as the cause of heart disease instead of sugar\nAs soon as you take fat out of your food you have to add sugar to make it tastes good not only was the sugar industry able to link sugar from major health issues it was also able to massively\nIncreased sugar consumption this is a conspiracy of monumental proportions our entire food industry promoted low fat foods which in turn\nRequired increasing amounts of sugar what happened as a result in Nineteen sixty one one percent of our US population was diagnosed with diabetes\nToday it is over seven percent according to the CDC the question is can you believe what you're being told by major establishments in this country just the phrase conspiracy theory makes you think it's a story fabricated by some nut case\nBut we have seen over and over again that there are very powerful people and organizations that have no problem profiting through deception I'm not a nutritionist so I find out about conspiracies that impact or help the same way you do\nThrough someone who
