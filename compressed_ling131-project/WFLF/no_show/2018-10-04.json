about helping you help others [noise]\nIt's been a wild ride\nSo far as if you if you're whether you're one of the rare listeners has been with us from the beginning of um I I was trying really hard to just make it seem like everything was cool and then and then ... led the cat out of the bags we we're we're waiting on\nGlenn who are told us a little bit of the story of of uh of of how many of the wrong\nReady basically yeah we've got to give them their crops for for being persistent\nYeah so uh so uh ... you were asking a little bit about the just kind of uh how how he got started asking NATO with with childhood yeah with\nLeaders um and and their stories so can you give us just a thumbnail of you're growing up and how you decided to spend your life helping others yeah empowering others that have been a better term yeah\nYeah absolutely um so my my parents are both from Jamaica um and they are relocated here to give my self and my three sisters\nI'm a better quality of life and then my dad complained about how cold it was in New York I don't know why there's a lot to me because I go from the island to New York but\nHe complained about how cool it was and then they relocated to South Florida are specifically Fort Lauderdale and that's where I grew up and I've been there since uh since I've been three and then I left when I got a chance to get out of the nest yeah go to Tampa uh and attend to the University of South Florida wherever she my bachelors and\nMy masters and I was the first person in my entire family to actually\nEven graduate high school once I was going to college at a higher education wow but one of the cool things in high school um there's a group that we myself and two of the friends created as ... and I went to know the high school and for those you know Fort Lauderdale well\nAre we create a thing called ... which is known as African American student union and it was just an organization to help 'em the African American students who were on campus too you know help them navigate through the maze how to get into college stuff like that\nSo I knew from that point forward that my life would always been in a form of advocacy or of just um empowerment and uh and I and that's that's been my entire career since ... yeah so tell us how some more\nAbout um the Urban League I knew she had some really significant programs down here like the the the um the HUD\nApproved housing program yeah tell us about that yeah so um [noise] so we are\nLooking to special well let me take a step back so when I took over a and I share this with your hands off you have a fair but\nUh when I took over on November ninth of two thousand Fifteen the organization was in disarray I'm and I'm very fortunate to my chairman and the board who gave me the latitude to find ways of restructuring the organization or so much so that organization was a million dollars in debt or the building that we owned over in a pine hills was in foreclosure\nUm and it was just with the grace of God eleven months ago we were able to be completely debt free allowing them to build a free and clear\nAnd um and then be able to now really focus on what grandma said as do as you say and say you do right now we ... we are now laser focus on improving programs and\nSo as I look at the market um I realize that our friends um God Bless bill okay who just retired from goodwill but\nAre there the nine hundred pound gorilla in job training yeah that's really what they do so for me to try and compete with that doesn't make any sense but we did a survey and we saw that financial literacy is something that's super important\nAnd super key but no one owns that space here so we were able to look at a portfolio of things going to your question we are hard to prove housing counseling agency and what does that mean\nThat means if you come to one of our um our eight hour session classes that we do on the weekends\nThen you're eligible for a thing called a down payment assistance grant\nAnd that allows you to um be able to make a purchase your first for home and\nI'm the HUD defines first time homebuyers as someone who has had a mortgage and three years so God Forbid you had a home\nEconomy tank you lost your home you ... your credit than you can be able to come through and get the class well here's the challenge when we produce in two thousand Fifteen over Fifteen hundred certificate so Fifteen hundred people came to our class\nWhy I said oh how many people buy homes\nAnd thereby give me that their headlights look why and then we looked at it we realized only like one percent one to about two percent actually purchase homes oh so then we did a deeper analysis and we said\nWhy if you don't know if you don't even have a bank account mhm right yeah that how you gonna buy oh yeah how are you gonna get a mortgage yup\nAnd sadly in low to moderate income communities you see 'em check cashing store\nThere's things of that nature and because of the past behaviors yep we realize that um\n[noise] uh we had to come up with a solution so we now provide I'm a first time homebuyer academy we also do an coup program called meet the bankers and meet the bankers is where we heal the financial literacy game plan for you\nGuinea tell us a little bit about this I saw this acronym for the power yeah movement\nOr what what is that so power sense for positive outreach wellness and enrichment resources um it is I'm a segment so we looked at ways of how do we do a community led effort to reduce crime within our community right\nAnd we're very fortunate that are now mirror lacked a Demings and chief Mina a agreed to allow in the community to come together and find a way of what they call it the modern twenty first century of community policing\nAnd at the time or as grandma would always say if you're not a part of the solution you're part of the problem so we saw a lot of this stuff in the media as or release of policing and the African American community and we said how can we bring people together to really combat some of these issues\nSo we have a a committee made up of faith leaders local business owners and the pine hills box\nI'm a ... high school students et cetera\nThat will come together and what we do is that we\nDo weekly piece walks and we also bring awareness to reducing on gun violence within our community um earlier this year we had the opportunity of bringing of students from Austin in Douglas High school and they sat down with students from Evans high school while and and they had a very rich exchange\nI'm a wave of they can like become advocates to help educate the community but then also educate lawmakers on\nWhat do we need to do to take back our community and make sure that our community safe ... now I Want to make it a state of for the record pine hills as I said ... ... is a great community ... come in great those great you could build a business you can raise a family\nAnd less not make the can be paint the whole community based on one or two peoples act right right yeah I'm so one of the things that we love sharing some of the highlights in the great things that pie hills has to offer\nBut more importantly that we want to make sure that we provide the resources in the services for those who need a change in their life right\nSo um we provide that are enrichment resources providing the job training the housing everything that they need to ensure that they don't continue down a life of gun violence and that's that's the essential when the power movement is one\nOf the questions I had one thing just that it's stuck out to me and I maybe it shouldn't and and you can educate me why why why it's kinda fits in with everything else that you're talking about with the idea behind school choice you know the idea that I'm being able to being able to\nUm ... what is it about that you feel like helps you know um before before problems can develop you know to kind of set\nPeople on the right path what what is that to you what what what's the reason for that so I'm a I'm a true champion of education reform school choice mostly in part as a former school board member I can tell you that one size doesn't fit All right all three of us probably have three different learning styles\nBut the way the system is set up traditional public school system is that it is forced to provide one model ... and if you don't fit that one model than what happens to you and\nSo um I've always advocated that led to find the educational model that fits the child not in the system and by doing that you're a creates um\nMore avenues for children individual learning and more quality and it also improves the quality overall ... someone who champion of that\nDo you do you find that there's a almost like a um there's an age at which if you can if you can kind of\nGet you intervene find the right you know find the right learning style find the right motivation to you know kind of in empowering\nGives it a certain age um I Would I Would guess that it would be something where the the younger you are getting to the inner intercede into someone's life and and give them options uh it it\nIt seems like they're just pays greater dividends over time you know absolutely yeah absolutely um and so ah with with the school choice thing is that something that that uh I I Am so ignorant of is that something that's like a a governmental thing that gets decided like there's laws about\nThat a overdose okay [laughter] um\nSo what what happened is a very touchy political subject just to the fact that\nYou have systems that need to be maintained and the way the school choice world works is that the dollar is follow the child's when the child is no longer in the system then there's less revenues for\nThe system to maintain a so then when a kid is going to say a charter school all the money is going there and then people are\nSaying well what does this charter school fails and all this money went there and when traditional school age needs the money from day one what is kitty a go to private schools on the voucher program then you just now took XYZ dollars out of the system\nAnd the ... people still need to get paid and all I still need to be paid CEO that's where the political ... like rub occurs in the school choice argument but for me I was like I don't care about the system yeah I care about the child yeah right I tell you about the child is in my community that needs to quality education\nAnd I've seen 'em in certain communities when you do put these extra\nPrograms an extra charter schools and the local district says well we got to compete so now I'm a put in a new magnet programming that's ... yeah right and then now that now parents of saying okay now I have options let me find what's best for my kid and they can go there\nI liked that a little competition ... brings out the best and everyone that ... that's true in all categories except for me in sports\n[laughter] ever held just further humiliated I mean so if people wanted to go to your website is this great WWW yet\nAlthough try that again W.
