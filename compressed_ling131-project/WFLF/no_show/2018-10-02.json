{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "Their son started my mess around my house and I mean if you see a lot of this\nSquirrels so yeah yeah ... ... they will chew everything up I have a neighbor that eats them [noise] [noise] yeah that's not [laughter] maybe your neighbors throwing feet up on your roof\nMade as well as the amount of money not shells that I find him I got her as I Know where they're going with the peanuts but I was in my office and is it that probably had my roof\nOr place to about three years ago and I was at my home office and during one of our big thunderstorms and all of the night I hear\nIt so it so interestingly enough we uh piles those type event those that come out of your roof vats of the way that we like you know your story\nI Know everybody's story [laughter] or if you look at your roof and you see that it's wrapped and metal it's led um for some reason I don't know why why squirrels or why are this way but they will chew on that mental and that led they cut their teeth on it and I don't really understand the you know what LA\nBehind like locks off my fence they will eat anything that that metal\nThey love the metal and so if you look at your roof and you see one pipe is maybe like you know eight inches high and the other one's only two inches I and it's all non down you've got animals chewing on your pipes now the scary thing about that is\nIf they chew enough they're going to chew a hole in your roof yeah yeah and then now you got leaking and all that so we actually don't put lead pipes on anymore um when we put we called rubber bullet boot\nAnd saw bullet boot is a really hard rubber um peace that goes right over that pipe is got a ... on the top of it so that way the air gets in and out\nAnd that way nothing gets done in it a more importantly the squirrels don't like to chew on the rubber\nSo looks nicer cars you know those metal that's wrapped around hypes it kind of looks like ...\nIt's like somebody just squeeze it around it these look way more professional they look very clean aesthetically they're very pleasing to the world and the rules don't eat them it's great though that's our answer to taking care of that and uh it's it's really the right way to do a roof especially in Florida squirrels\nWell and and now there's oh yeah yeah little\nCritters that like to come into your home one of those so if you're seeing signs just kinda\nKinda recap if you're going to see the paddling in like in your pool or in your driveway after storms if you're noticing any movement on your shingles it all I Would yeah those are two like big red flag signs of you probably need somebody out here to look at\nThat and ... and quite honestly if nobody's looked at your roof in the last year to you just haven't had a roofer come out and your roof estimates too it um you really probably should have an inspection done um you know we do for inspections there's no cost to come out and look at your roof\nAre very easy and painless um you know our folks in the ... and the communication center just gonna ask you a few questions I'm trying to understand what's going on and then we're going to send one of our um one of our estimate is out to look at it assess what's going on and then give you feedback based upon what we see or don't see on the roof\nAnd that was really good to know so for inspections and if you think you are ready for something even more than that I mentioned in this show and that you are listening to Patrick you got that little aha moment with every new home show you can get priority service by calling in at four zero seven eight zero nine\nFive one five six and that free inspection thing that's so I'm sure there are people\nHadn't even thought about there it was like well we didn't get any damage and I just have just gone on where they could just be happening up there oh yeah and just creating more and more and more damage\nAnd if you've had a roofer maybe maybe just maybe purchased a home in the last year or two and you know the home inspection that you had done they said hey you need to think about replacing your roof and the next few years or something like this might be the time to go ahead start getting serious about it now the thing I'll say too is\nA roofing cos I'm are not getting any cheaper fast Hurricane Irma prices have continually increasing on them up um you know sign demand a lot of people had a hurricane or um had roofs done during after hurricane\nWhich is all the blue roofs you solved yet and um and so a lot of people don't realize how expensive it is to do a roof or even right now and so it's a good time to go ahead and start getting prepared I mean none of the thing that I Do with my customers is often I'll go out and say hey\nYou might not need a new new roof this moment but it's time to get really serious about it right so let's think about what does it look like maybe in the next couple of months or six months or this year ... to go ahead and plan on getting a roof put on this house 'cause you don't want to wait so long\nThat you've got water intrusion and lose a lot of people want to say you know it's like it's not like a car right so like I always joke I've got a I've got a big car 'cause I have five kids\nIn my ways [laughter] I always joke I'm going to drive the car till it blows up right [laughter] do you do not want to drive them if you really blows up take advantage of the free inspection at absolutely\nSo ah reach out to Patrick with universal roof and contracting and their entire team and they're eager to help and if you mentioned this show real home show you will get priority service when you call for zero seven eight zero nine five one five six that's four zero seven eight\nZero nine five one five six write it down here you go forward you know seven eight nine to five one five six or go on line to universal roof dot com they are eager to help and with three inspections no reason not to Patrick\nThank you so much about so much information and drinkers cross for very slow hurricane yes thanks for coming in and listening to their new home show\nWFL if find

Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh Fox is the Rapaport has more lime\nYou have to have cooperative evidence to back this up not why because oh you're just saying that because you're a Republican and you want to conserve it among the Supreme Court no\nI'm saying that because when I look at this movement the me too movement believe women but we've all women no matter what and then the right to believe him no matter what\nI'm thinking\nThese are collective is this is group think this is a collective it's think it's a religion there the me too movement in politics today has become more like a religion\nDogma\nThen actually looking at evidence looking at Stax working at reason\nAnd coming up with decent conclusions based on them\nThe words that are being used but we ... I Believe\nThese are things you say\nIt dealing with religion I Believe in God\nI Believe in that these are really just terms and we've now taking these religious terms about what you believe personally in your heart and we've placed it on the confirmation of a Supreme Court justice and that's ironic because justice isn't just about believe\nIt's about looking at the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt condemning someone or saying someone is not guilty based on the evidence presented and they're usually guilty if it's beyond a reasonable doubt or if it's a civil case preponderance of the evidence\nJustice is about protecting the rights of the individual\nBut nobody cares about the right of the individual anymore that's all I'm thinking about I'm thinking about how can we have a society if we have a society\nWhere in accuser can come forward and make an accusation without evidence individual rights in this country are dead are gone that's why you have innocent until proven guilty that's why you have a justice system that is supposed to be blind and looks at the evidence\nThat's why you have these things because it's about protecting the rights to the individual it's not about this group think but we've all women need to wasn't supposed to be a religion based on believes\nIt was supposed to be that women deserve to be heard and yes women do deserve to be heard that does not mean they deserve to be believed that\nBelief has to come from the evidence\nCondemnation has to come from the evidence no justice Kavanaugh actually made this a similar point and this and it's the best one I can give you when looking at the big picture of all there's forget who you believe for a second look at the big picture of protecting the rights of the individual in this country but someone deserve to be destroyed if\nThere's not enough evidence judge Kavanaugh in the testimony that he did on that he did last week he brought this up going to wake up one from your comments\nMayor allegation\nFear assertion of an allegation [noise]\nThey refuted allegation from thirty six years ago\nIs enough to destroy pursue his life\nAnd career for a band in the basic principles of fairness and due process to find our legal system [noise]\nAnd our country he's exactly right he's exactly right\nAlan Dershowitz tweeted out something similar and he had an opinion piece in the wall Street Journal today he said being on the Supreme Court is a privilege not a right but be disqualified based on a false accusation of a crime would be a violation of the fundamental the fundamental right\nTo fairness when you ask\nPeople and the me too movement why they automatically condemn Kavanaugh why they automatically don't believe him no matter what the evidence why they don't care about the evidence\nIt's because we're all men deserve revenge revenge it's groupthink yeah it's totally group think it's all men because of the past deserve this because men in the past\nA lot of men in the past were bad to a lot of women in the past noticed this is very similar to so many things in this country they walk on the matter is a lot of it is the same way\nIt's it's ... it's white people deserve revenge because of the past\nAnd I heard somebody on the national review podcasts made the best statement I heard in a while\nAnd I actually had it on my ... let me see if I can find it but he said um what is ... I had it all I wanted to get I wanted to get this exactly right because there was such a good point\n... or ... where's where's it gonna have to [noise]\nWell now now I'm really doing now is just totally been a whole to this\nAnyway he basically said that one in you know we're policing one injustice for the other is not\n... justice\nJustice denied\nRight what we should be going for is justice justice has to be about protecting the rights\nOf the individual when you go after all men in the accused 'cause that's what I've heard from the me too movement to you know today in the past couple of days well these are all white men and anytime someone who defends cabin all its um wall you hate to women\nAnd you're just a male chauvinist or whatever it is\nAnd that's not what this is about justice should be about protecting the rights\nOf the in the vigil\nAnd unfortunately it's not about that anymore and I don't I have some other observations I Want to make a whole Kavanaugh thing if you have any comments you can call for seven nine one six fifty four hundred touch the two three six eight zero some observations of different people I've talked to\nThis week that you won't really here I'll watch in the mainstream media and we're going to go over that or why are we ... we have a lot more to the um yeah this is this is\nUm I Can't find\nCan find that tweet from the guy from the national review drew me but it's really bothering me because it was such a profound truth and I thought I posted on on my Twitter and I just don't think I see it all this is beyond regional radio shows already beyond reason I'm your host Michel ... we'll be right back\nIf you heart beyond reason radio I listen to the beyond reason radio podcast on our heart radio just download the eye heart radio ... search beyond reason radio\nThe biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to their CWC I already of music\nDo miss the iconic performances ya\nTo watch our must see I heart radio music festival Sunday October seventh and Monday I feel very ... pm on cw Eighteen\nCome to the Orlando gun shell October thirties and forties with seven hundred days on everything from hunting rifles\nAll types of and got shot guns for rather ... whole series Carrie ... gun safe pocket knives and plenty of sexually items they elected a little less concealed weapons permit\nClasses are offered all weekend don't miss the Orlando gun shell October Thirteen fourteen central Florida fairgrounds for info at Florida gun shows dot com that Florida gun shows dot com [noise]\nTune into the retirement coffee talk radio show with your reef river Smith founder as any wealth management every Wednesday from eight to nine PM in every Saturday morning from six to six thirty right here on WFL a news radio solely three three three six six eight zero er visits any a wealth jak I'm\nThe boss you look at all these great mess and they go to mark down for the restaurant ... sees make great disguises for breaking into houses a yeah it's perfectly normal for ... to be looking around the neighborhood who wouldn't be lurking on average just make sure you don't go there and he said touch those things aren't safe press club\nHey before I forget that house we've been case in\nThose folks going out of town again Black Friday as soon as they don't have said that security we don't have to worry you know save such means no two week communicated or crashes match technology no video monitoring and no headaches for me who do you think of my new may I ask is definitely an improvement\nThe AIDS you find another house in that same touching the mask is on me\nHe wants to be fair here very rarely can tell what Saudis on people on the issue people like Dickerson just having a gender their drive it was so obvious now\n[noise] I always forget her name for some reason the who is the the woman I usually does face the nation as she's the one that replaced Dickerson when he went to the morning show and I can't\nThink ... she hasn't been on there I don't know how long she has been on there but she usually does an okay job and I don't notice too much of a partisanship Jake Tapper ... pretty ...

are available and you can catch us on Facebook Live as well just like the beyond\nReason radio Facebook page we've been talking about the Kavanaugh hearings I have a lot to say on it because I was\nI knew my show last week so it was all building up over a week and now it's just all coming out and I'm sure there's like lots of things I'm missing 'em but\nIn the last segment I was talking about how I notice that most of the people that I talk to you that we're you know vigorously defending\nKavanaugh and really upset about how the Democrats treated him were not men but where women while I got a text that came in and you can text to three six eight zero we're staying on message and data right supply from one woman says I can curve as a woman I was outraged the whole thing is ridiculous\nAnd so that that's\nExactly right I'm telling you there are a lot of women because they they see their husbands there and they they would be justice defensive of their own husband their husbands or their brother or their sons or whatever\nFalsely accused so I Know the Democrats really tried to push that and I don't think it's that's successful as they think it will be the next thing I wanted to get too though usually on Sundays\nI mean I deliver groceries a side job but when it while I'm doing and I'll listen to all of a Sunday shows the pod cast of them all and I happen to listen to a face the nation on CBS\nAnd my first thought was who was this guy hosting this week I mean I Know who he is but\nJohn Dickerson he was so out right harnessing and just by white usually they tried to hide their bias a little bit he didn't try to hide it at all and when I'm Talking about if he was she was interviewing Senator Tom cotton\nFrom Arkansas and I want to play most of this interview we're going to go through it and stop you know in between as I comment on it but I Want to point in most of this because I think Tom ... made a good points and then the things that Dickerson was saying we're saying\nIt it was like Democrats talking points that I've seen over and over again which isn't structure of 'cause I Want to basically ... bunk them but let's let's hear the beginning of the interview interviewing Tom tom face the nation yesterday here it is\nJudge Kavanaugh hundred percent denies these allegations there's not a single bit of corroborating evidence every evidence that we do have to include the people that miss for herself name either don't recall this instead or they denied that it happened did you find Mrs Ford or Dr Ford kind of\nMiss Ford was sympathetic and she was sincere she's been victimized by the Democrats in this process John they portrayed her own requests for confidentiality they live just to the media the last minute because they are on a search and destroy mission for Brett Kavanaugh he said well\nOkay so for one thing he's exactly right there that was a search and destroy mission and I just want you I just want to point out one thing he asked him so she seem credible and he gives a pretty honest answer seems sincere\nAnd so let's continue on because listen to how Dickerson kind of continues this conversation it's like he wasn't even listening to Tom Cotton here to\nMe last talked in November I think it's important that women feel they can come forward that's a good change in the norms and the expectations of our society a woman came forward here and you're saying basically she said nothing credible how can women down for\n... he didn't say that did he ever say that no no war and yet his first words were you're basically saying if you didn't say anything credible\nThat's not what he said he said she came up as very sincere\nBut the fact remains that there is no corroborated evidence and you can't condemn someone in a country that believes in individual light you can condemn someone just based off of one scene we credible testimony\nShe couldn't believe a hundred percent what she's saying and still be wrong and still\nBe wrong done has happened many times in the past especially with situations like this so I Want to continue on the interview here here's more of the interview\nInformation including ... veteran I got the information filed with the securities and Exchange Commission\nTroops and their families the military is more than a career it's the journey\nOf every step along the way the U.S those\nAn experience

we need\nThe reason more than ever I Try\nIt's hard sometimes I'm not going to lie [laughter] but I Try to\nShow my question for you is does Kavanaugh stepped down and that's all of this outrage is the best way to describe this circus or\nOr you want me to work in my crystal ball on the productivity is going to step down\nYeah I'm a I'm a I had a theory on that\nOh we'll talk Benton we'll go first dusty I appreciate your call thank you so much\nMy area that is he's going to uh when he gets confirmed he's going to say take this job and shove it oh so he's going to get confirmed immense step down yeah yeah\nI don't know I'm not sure because the way she fought and he said specifically I Will never give out I Do\nI I won't really do that I just find that very intriguing there'll be any won't do it because I think he's a a two appreciative of ... of the appointment a bone Trump\nAnd you know he's been in this arena for a while and he definitely doesn't want to cave in to them is not that guy wants to be given to them I mean I'm not one to predict\nI I Would see I Would see Trump withdrawing his nomination before I see Kavanaugh stepping down and I really don't see Trump withdrawing his nomination either\nSo you know before before we in this hour we have a lot of other topics are going to be drawn to this topics in this hour has been most is been all Kavanaugh stuff really um and that story of other things I Want to get to\nBut I I I found this a piece from David French in the national review and he's been really good on this whole this whole issue you know he's a former lawyer himself\nHe says\nThere is entirely inefficient insufficient evidence to prove even one of the terrible ... runs against President Trump's Supreme Court nominee\nWho's ... says the case against Kavanaugh is collapsing so it's a very strange thing happened over the weekend if you follow Twitter cause you'll notice of the debate over Brett Kavanaugh move significantly from the central question of last Thursday's hearing did he commits sexual assault\nTo a raging debate over whether he lied about highschool dating college drinking or high school swing sorry college drinking inside jokes and whether he was just too angry to be a Supreme Court judge\nTalking about the debate is all of a sudden change which I mentioned earlier there's this torrent of commentary obscures important development the sexual assault coins against Kavanaugh or in a state\nOf a collapse\nAnd he brings up the point that Arizona prosecutors ... Rachel Mitchell released a memorandum to all Republican senators summarizing Ford evidence against\nKavanaugh saying that there are no cooperating witnesses the friends that she was ... she says\nWas that the party in question has denied bean or or knowing tapping on all she doesn't know who invited her to the party where to place how she got there or how she got home\nAfter ... factor but problem goes beyond gaps memory\nAnd that prosecutors said she could not bring this case you will never bring in this case for it as a prosecutor\nBecause there just isn't enough evidence the case is collapsing so the Democrats have changed it and now they want a fishing expedition by the FBI\nOr more to get to hear that this ... beyond reason radio I'm year olds Michael yeah see we have one more hour to go see at the same with me and I'll be right back [noise]\n... me out on the news radio Saudi\nThe IRS doesn't mess around if they want your money they'll take it they can take your paycheck and bank accounts to even threaten your home or business and it's about to get worse the IRS just tired an army of new tax enforcers so if you owe back\nTaxes the smartest thing you can do is go up too much actually optimum has access to a special IRS tax assistance\nProgram called the fresh start initiative and their clients to qualifier saving thousands even tens of thousands one call starts the process to stop the demand letters stop aggressive\nCollection action saying stop at army of new enforcers from targeting you but don't delay it's important to act now while you still have options stopped him at a rated with the better Business Bureau optimize already resolved over a half\nBillion dollars in tax for their clients get your life back call now for your free consultation\nGoal eight hundred three ... three sixty four sixty eight hundred three for three sixty four sixty eight hundred three for three sixty four sixty\nFive to release\nSome restrictions apply for complete details about the much actually dot com WFL I find ... or Orlando news radio Ninety three point one WFL a and I heard a radio\nStation [noise]\nEnding by his man nine lease ... Fox News President Trump continues to defend it Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and a rally in Tennessee ... board has more line at least\nShe was saying and doing things the town hall in other places that I felt were really dangerous for the future of this country so I'm Glad he's changed his mind\nThis is what he said\nSo one of the lessons I've learned since starting march for our lives and this was a truly difficult one to grasp that that surprisingly enough I don't know everything\nNow as a Seventeen year old boy who was dead set on the fact that I knew everything that was that threw me for a loop and a half way through my tour with march for our last summer where we were advocating for more accessible boating and encouraging people to register I realized that I was in I was in Texas and I spoke to some people\nMay be the people who disagree with me I don't want the country to be a bad place maybe they just have different views and I was born in a bubble where my heavily liberal mindset that I still maintain convince me that anybody who didn't agree with me was that now intent\nAnd and they didn't that I thought that people who didn't agree with me on gun laws ... didn't care when kids died that's not the case I learned a lot of things so\nThis is a really important thing for a young person to a conclusion that come to he said I came to the realization was a hard realization for me but he said I came to the realization that I don't know everything\nThis really is the beginning of wisdom\nSocrates who was basically said I Am you know he was called the why is this person in the world because he admitted he no nothing ... you know we're a lot of wisdom comes from is when you come to that conclusion\nI remember when I was a freshman at UC up and I took off the humanities and religious studies classes I ever would just studies degree and one of my humanities classes to\nWe went around asking us what we learned and he came to me and I said I've learned that I have a lot more to learn that I don't know nearly enough\nAnd I have a lot more to learn and he told me the teachers at the beginning of wisdom and the teacher looked at us and he said you know I realized\nWanted to a library once and I realized I could spend every day reading as many books as possible\nAnd probably not make a dent in reading all of the knowledge available at that library or many other libraries\nThat you can study and study and study but you have to realize you don't know everything and you can't know everything and wisdom comes from being able to admit that to yourself so you can open up your mind to learn new things\nNow ... has been saying he still supports gun restrictions\nHasn't changed a lot of his political views\nBut what are you saying is maybe\nBecause you disagree with him doesn't mean you're evil because you disagree with me doesn't mean you hate children or one bad for the country\nYou just disagree and he's right\nCan't believe I'm saying that like I said but he's right now he continues on this point basically saying what is middle ground the group is really all about and it's a good point here it is\nI think that ... strangely enough the conversation that needs to be pursued is a conversation about conversations\nIs the fact that you know if I'm speaking somebody who does not share my views on abortion that does not mean that they are they want to kill babies and they want to oppress women\nI think that if I'm Talking to somebody about the Israel Palestine issue and they what one side of the issue doesn't that doesn't hate Jews and one sided issue doesn't hate Palestinians\nI I think that we need to stop it you you said to me before we need to stop the lesson that I Need to stop attacking each other's worst arguments I think that's a big problem so I'm I'm here to say well where can not even actually agreement how can we approached this was actually\nSo he's created this group and he's basically saying what we need to have in this country is a conversation about conversations\nThat we have to be willing which I've been saying forever on the show we have to be willing to peacefully disagree that because and that's one of the beauties of America is you can have disagreements and you can believe in different things it's ... individual rights is all about\nAnd if we can peacefully disagree we'd be in a much better place to solve problems in the future\nYou know I'm actually a reading Glenn Beck's book because our butts going to be interviewing them later in the week and they send me a copy Glenn Beck's book new book addicted to outrage and I just started it but he makes he's making a lot of these same points and he even emits look I was part of the problem too\nBut we're too addicted to this outrage and it's so true that we are\nPeople I Know people that are addicted to social media and they get addicted to the debates on social media and they can't wait to be hate someone else on social media and be outraged that someone else and so social media they can't get away with it because it actually do something to your brain\nThe doping me actually getting alike are getting a share of getting a retweet can actually have that effect on her brain and people are addicted to it\nNow I have to say I was addicted to it I got so sick of it all that I go I mean I can go\nHold the outpost stuff on Twitter and Facebook and then not will get it for the rest of the day out [laughter] like I'm done with it I'm not addicted to it anymore because I'm I don't like the outrage me personally if you know me personally I ate all the outrage I have all the arguing I hate all the anger it's not me\nSo and I think he makes a good point now what's really amazing about this is I it wasn't that long ago just a few months ago we were listening to all these interviews with these kids in the march for our lives and they were doing exactly the opposite of what he was saying and some of them still are David Hawk was the worst obviously\nOkay mccaskey when the MIT that David how was the worst but he was\nThere out there and they're trying to stoke outrage and they are trying to stoke hatred for those who disagree with them because they think that's the only way to solve problems and I really believe in no camera cast you said this is not why he left\nI think it is a big reason why he left I think he left because he realized that his group march for life was part of the problem not the solution\nBut he was asked about this he was saying you know that group what do you think or is the problem why is that group and so angry and he had a very humble response here says what he said\nTo be honest with you a lot of that was me a lot of that was me telling my friends you know these people don't agree with us that they don't care\nYou know they they they come about that guy and they care about is getting killed\nOr anything I'll criticize about march for our lives really comes from me\nUh I started I was the ... I was was bringing my friend's here's all the time I Know I Know that people in my ... and all them pretty much like the back of my hand I Know that these are people who\nReally just want the world to be a better place and a lot of our areas and messaging particularly if you don't like us you don't care for me and I believed it and I believe that until relatively recently\nI'm embarrassed certainly but I'm also I'm I'm not losing sleep over it because I believed it\nSo he was basically saying that look I was part of the problem that I was actually the worst of them\nAnd I believe that and I was saying these bad things and I realized him to the conclusion that it was wrong and I had to change my mind and I had to change my approach\nThis is really a profound thing that I never see in today's political sphere and this is from a young person when I was watching that CNN town hall I was really fearful for the future and the next generation\nBecause it was the opposite of what this country need and I'm like where's is leading us ...\nAnd now finally have a little bit of hope for the next generation if there are more kids like him now I don't think he's going to get nearly the attention now because unfortunately\nThe opposite of his point outrage cells now outrageous what gets all the attention we've seen it all over the place confrontation confrontation I've talked about before how it's tempting in this business to be more outrageous more confrontational you know more upsetting because\nIt gets better ratings it just does\nBut I just wanted to a point that out because I think it's really important that he's doing this and I I I Wish him luck\nI Hope that he can actually continue to make a difference and we'll see if we can ah making more conservative as we\nGo along here 'cause all noticed that the conservatives are the ones who are more open to this talk him five or ten years and some of the left [laughter] for oh seven nine one six fifty four hundred and you can text to two or three six eight zero or standard message in data rates\nApply so Trump\nIs um praising are celebrating his new trade deal that it's supposed to replace NAFTA the market seemed to be celebrating it as a well they have a new name for Canada signed on in the last segment\nAnd um we'll talk about that but there's something I Want to mention about it as well\nAh why I've been so critical on Trump would trade and there was a piece that really did a great job of a pointing out why free trade is important to get to that next this is beyond reason radio host Michael you have your we'll be right back\nDownload the eye and heart radio lap and catch the beyond reason radio podcast getting ready for\nLand those jobs ... biggest job there and I read a vet is central Florida friday

jobs\nSays no one was harmed by these voluntary transactions and the millions of\nPeople involved on both sides of the oil and it got what they wanted\nThat's why it's called trade\nThe same old true in your personal lives how how's your own trade deficit with Amazon or Walmart or your local grocery store are they buying a lot of stuff you produce probably not\nWhat your relationships remain voluntary and mutually beneficial you get the books and clothes and the and the rutabagas you want [laughter]\nThey get the cash everybody wins there's a tendency\nTo think of trade in terms of surpluses in deficit obscures the more fundamental principle at issue people have the right to voluntarily exchange goods and services with whom ever they want whenever they want\nIn a society based on equal rights and mutual benefit the government should not be second guessing these individual decisions made freely between two willing parties I think he's exactly right and he's on later Yuri says\nWhat's we forget the founding fathers believed that private property was the guardian of every other right indeed the Fifth Amendment puts property an equal footing with life and liberty\nWhen government purposely makes it harder for trade and certain people to transport their family is unjustly denying the fruits of through labor and the right to their own property I'm paraphrasing here a little\nBit why are you so many who are would object to this kind of government intervention in any other context failed to object when it comes to trade\nAnd then it talks about this he says President Trump is convinced that the Chinese are under pressure to make a deal with us you just amounts of first set of tariffs yadda yadda yadda covered just about all Chinese imports of the United states\nAnd it talks about the European Union is of course the best way to get to zero terrorists\nIs to go to zero tariffs Trump said he wants the euro terrorists it'd be one zero tariffs then get rid of all our tariffs\nWe don't need to wait for anyone else to act\nGetting our own house in order would help Americans by cutting costs and encouraging innovation that help improve wives to take just one example of a product used by tens of millions of people everyday sugar costs Americans fifty two percent more than the world price about four point four billion dollars per year because why\n'cause we Tara sugar\nBecause we tear sugar we pay for it here a lot of people do know that we keep seeing if we keep hearing we're getting screwed by all these other countries when in fact we impose tariffs on other countries especially when it comes to sugar\n[noise] um\nHe says forget China averse America this was our government diverse Americans [noise]\nThe irony is that the president is reckoning barriers to trade at the same time the economy is booming because he took the opposite approach and the rest of the economy\nTaxes and regulations he reduced barriers that hold people back and prevent them from realizing their potential\nHe helped get government out of their wives it doesn't make much sense to lower barriers in some parts of the economy or raising them in others a better approach would be the doubled down the economic policies that are contributing to our booming economy and pursue policies that make it easier and less costly to\nTrade it gives exactly right there was a commentary and investors business daily by Steve Forbes and symptoms are so much misconception when it comes to trade and trade policies we don't look at it as we should which is the individuals and businesses trading with each other voluntarily\nAnd now we want to impose more restrictions and that's why a lot of the tariffs talk is not good now hopefully will lead to better things in the future a parallel you have in some ways with this trade deal with Canada and Mexico and other ways uh it didn't\nWhich I mentioned earlier All right that much more to get to I Am filling

A. on filling in for coal Jackson called jacks and we'll be back for his show next Monday Night he asked me to fill in because he had other things he was doing\nEight zero nine five one five six and

or communications center will\nCall you back and set up the appointment and will come out and take everything\nNow is like the typical lifespan of a ...\nYeah so that I get that question all the time I'm Glad I did I point I Am so glad you asked that question um so that's a that's a tough question because it just you know there's so many things involved you know\nLike we talked about earlier you know where does your house it you know how much sun hits it do you have a trees and uh what kind of shingle was use you installed it you know incidents relation can often be um unfortunately when you don't use a reputable company could potentially get a bad install\nUm there's all these things that come into play but I Will say generally speaking so hypothetically say we'd never have a right right we don't have hurricanes any more\nOrder yeah if we didn't have any hurricanes you know most roost in Florida just with the sun and the humidity and the wind and rain that we get\nYou're probably looking at you know if you can get I tell my customers if you can get Twenty years out of a roof in Florida you've done really well yeah that's a solid like we rarely run into people that say hey I've had my route for thirty seven years now it just doesn't happen you know it's it's tough to have a roof that long and then you throw the hurricane in there and [laughter] well\nYou know not just hurricanes as well I mean hell yeah hell does a ton of damage and we get plenty of\nThat ... we definitely get lots of hail hail is hail is um an interesting thing you know you would you'd be amazed at a a small pebble a vice how much damage it can do to your roof\nWhy don't you can see what it does to a car right and that's just one storm ... where's my car but I can hear it coming down you don't think about what it's doing to your ... right\nRight yeah hail hail is an interesting thing because those small pebbles vice that hitting that hit your single what's happening is those little granular as we were talking about earlier that you sometimes see washed away and your letters\nUm when the hail hits those beds into the shingle and impressive the granular down into the shingle and what it does is it\nIt it it a kind of a deal it damages the laminate that's behind the shingle there okay so now at that point barrier between the ... yeah so now that shingles damage\nMeaning that you could potentially get water damage and all these things can happen um it'd be like you know if you took a hammer and started wailing on your roof or something it's not a good thing to do damage so [laughter] hail when hail hits your roof it's kind of that same effect depending on the size of the hill rain\nYou know if it's tiny ... yeah you know but we've we've recently um had some hail damage in the land of central Florida area and\nUm you know if you think you had summer maybe you know you saw you were at home and um I've seen some pictures of um some\nThat was out um I think it's a winter springs area a novel and park that area\nWhere gutters were full of hail it's a lot of hell I'd be freaking out a lot of hail so glad that yeah it's wild and it it it will damage your roof so we can come out and look and um\nWe can see if it's damaged or see if the hill actually hit it a lot of times it's only going to hit like one part of the roof because it kind of comes at an ...\nSo we got to figure out you know did it hit where to hit all that kind of stuff\nAnd then at that point we would sort of recommended or or say to you here's what we think may be going on or what we see\nOK something you don't normally think about yeah hurricanes have which got regular son started my mess around my house and I mean if you see a lot of this\nSquirrels so yeah yeah ... ... they will to everything I have a neighbor that eats them [noise] [noise] yeah that's not [laughter] maybe your neighbors throwing feet up on your roof\nMade him out of ... shells that I find him I got her as I Know where they're going with the peanuts but I was in my office and is it that I had my roof or place to about three years ago and I was at my home office and during one of our big thunderstorms and all of the night I hear\nIt so ... so interestingly enough we uh piles those type event the parts that come out of your roof vats of the way that we like you know your story I Know everybody's story [laughter] or if you look at your roof and you see that it's wrapped and metal it's led\nUm for some reason I don't know why why squirrels or why are this way but they will chew on that metal and that led they cut their teeth on it and I don't really understand the you know\nWhat LA behind like locks off my fence they will eat anything that that metal\nThey love the metal and so if you look at your roof and you see one pipe is maybe like you know eight inches high and the other one's only two inches I and it's all non down you've got animals chewing on your pipes smell the scary thing about that is\nIf they chew enough they're going to chew a hole in your roof yeah yeah and then now you got leaking and all that so we actually don't put lead pipes on anymore um when we put we call a rubber bullet boot\nAnd saw bullet boot is a really hard rubber a piece that goes right over that pipe it's got a ... on the top of it so that way the air gets in and out\nAnd that way nothing gets done in it a more importantly the squirrels don't like to chew on the rubber\nSo looks nicer cars you know this metal that's wrapped around types of kind of looks like ...\nIt's like somebody just squeeze it around it these look way more professional they look very clean hysterical either very pleasing to the world and the rules don't eat them it's great though that's our answer to taking care of that and uh it's it's really the right way to do a roof especially in Florida squirrels\nWell and and now there's oh yeah yeah little critters that like to come into your home plenty of those funny though if\nYou're seeing signs just kind of kind of ... if you're going to see a paddling in like in your pool or in your driveway after storms if you're noticing any movement on your shingles it all I Would yeah those are two like big red flag signs of you probably need somebody out here to look at\nThat and ... and quite honestly if nobody's looked at your roof and the last year to you just haven't had a roofer come out and your roof estimates too it um you really probably should have an inspection done um you know we do for inspections there's no cost to come out and look at your roof\nA very easy and painless um you know our folks in the cold and the communication center just gonna ask you a few questions I'm trying to understand what's going on and then we're going to send one of our um one of our estimate is out to look at it assess what's going on and then give you feedback based upon what we see or don't see on the roof\nAnd that was really good to know so for inspections and if you think you are ready for something even more than that by mentioning this show and that you were the the the Patrick you got that little aha moment with their new home show you can get priority service by calling in at four zero seven eight zero nine five one five\nSix and that ... I think that's so I'm sure there are people hadn't even thought about there it was like well yeah we didn't get any damage and I just have just gone on word that could just be happening up there oh yeah and just creating more and more and more damage\nAnd if you've had a roofer maybe maybe just maybe purchased a home in the last year or two and you know the home inspection that you had done they said hey you need to think about replacing your roof and the next few years or something like this might be the time to go ahead start getting serious about it now the thing I'll say too is\nA roofing cos I'm are not getting any cheaper fast Hurricane Irma prices have continually increasing on up and up um you know signed a lot of people had a hurricane or um had ribs thundering after hurricane turn\nA which is all the blue roofs you saw when you um and so a lot of people don't realize how expensive it is to do a roof or even right now and so it's a good time to go ahead and start getting prepared I mean none of the thing that I Do with my customers is often I'll go out and say hey\nYou might not need a new new roof this moment but it's time to get really serious about it right so let's think about what is it looked like maybe in the next couple of months or six months or this year to go ahead and plan on getting a roof put on his house because you don't want to wait so long\nThat you've got water intrusion ... a lot of people want to say you know it's like it's not like a car right so like I always joke I've got a I've got a big\nCar 'cause I have five kids and my wife [laughter] I always joke I'm going to drive the car till it blows up right [laughter] do you do not want to drive your really blows up take advantage of the free inspection absolutely\nSo I reached out to Patrick with universal roof and contracting and their entire team and they're eager to help and if you mentioned this show real home show you will get priority service when you call for zero seven and eight zero nine five one five six that's four zero seven eight zero\nNine five one five six write it down here you go forward you know seven eight they're an item by one by sex or go on line to universal roof dot com they are eager to help and with three inspections no reason not to Patrick\nThank you so much about so much information and ... prosper very slow hurricane yes and thanks for coming in and listening to their new home shout\nWFL if find ... ... patients every door Orlando news radio nutty free point one WFL a and I heard a radio\nStation [noise]\nNomination fights ...
