have time to get on the show so much I have to say um but we'll try to do it in the next eight minutes or so one thing I Do want to talk about the by the way to be on radio host Michael ...\nIs I posted on Twitter earlier this week and you can follow me out beyond reason are\nIt was a big story earlier this week it's been a big story up till today this whole caravan of migrants coming up from Central America\nBasically they bomb rushed the border into Mexico and they were tried the Mexicans tried to stop him couldn't stop 'em now they're coming up through Mexico when they're coming to the U.S border and Trump had pointed out in a in a statement that he would be willing to send to US military to stop them\nAnd you know I merely asked a question I said well not just how implementing and seeing how that's a good point it would have to be I guess kind of like what Eisenhower did when he sent a hundred and first airborne to help desegregate the schools\nBut my my first question was what exactly would you do you want the military to do what are they going to do are they going to shoot them do you really want to sit in the military down there to the border and shoot them as they're they're coming in\nAnd I basically said it sounds great to say are going to send the military but it really doesn't solve anything because there's no way can you imagine the fallout if there's some kind of confrontation between migrants in the U.S military you want to talk about polar polarization in this country that will make things worse\nI'm not saying we shouldn't stop them I'm not saying we should just let them all in ...\nBut what I'm saying my mere point was that sending the military I'm not sure the best option because it's Colin Powell said the military ... job is to break things and kill people you know that's sending them to the southern border I'm not sure it's going to be the great solution that you think it is it just sounds good\nThat being said the best solution to this problem in general is to build the wall\nI agree with Trump on that part build a wall or some kind of really strong border fence and I have to say a lot of people disagree with this but I think Trump is actually pretty smart to make this a campaign issue\nBecause when you see a group of seven thousand people or so and they're going to try to bomb rushed the border the majority of the American people are not going to support that they're just not going to support the even those who want more of an open immigration system in this country even those who really want that\nAre not going to support styles and the people at once coming up and trying to break through the country\nSo truck bringing that up I actually think it's smarter than people are willing to admit\nI I talked about here when John makes mistakes but it actually pretty smart now something else came up this week that Trump said they had a lot of controversy behind it and go ahead and calling him that play this cut it was from Trump at the Texas rally earlier this week\nWants to do well frankly not caring about our country so much and they don't want weekend you know\nIt's sort of became\nReally we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist so [noise]\nNow a lot of different people came out and this is proof Trump is a racist because he's talking about why ...\nI really don't think that's a fair criticism I'm not one who says he's a ... you know I'm a nationalist but it was obvious where Trump was talking about there is he's talking about putting America First in America's interest first over global wisdom\nThat Trump is talking about it was pretty obvious that we have to put our country first and that's why we have to secure the border because we have to ... you know as president United States is going to put American interest person that's going to a lot of people are going to respond positively to Trump saying that\nNot being said I Do want to talk a little bit about the term nationalism usually the reason I don't like to use to use the term ... I'd rather use the term patriotic\nIs because nationalism historically has sort of a has sort of a combination to\nHow the connotation to the idea that what makes this country great is it's blood and soil I'm going to put America First because of where we are and everything that's not what makes America great it's not blood and soil that makes America great\nWhat makes America green and what makes me support America and want to put America First\nIsn't bad it's the ideas the founding principles the ideas behind the declaration of independence and the constitution and the ideas of the bill of rights and freedom it is those ideas that I support that's why I like the term ... when you go towards the nationalist\nYou're going really beyond just supporting the idea is you're supporting the blood and soil aspect\nIs this country became some sort of authoritarian dictatorship like Nazi Germany or something and started doing bad things and try to conquer the world or something like it or did\nThen I wouldn't support this country anymore because it's not about\nThe country or necessarily about\nThe people I mean I support the people now but it's about the ideas behind the country that's that's what I Would support so that's why I like the term patriotism over just plain national was but I really don't think Trump is thought thought about it that deeply\nYou know people want to put these things and the Trump federal put words in his mouth and even if he doesn't say what about like well he really meant to this and this happens in politics all the time of both sides but I really think all he's saying is\nI'm not a global list I'm going to put America First he's been saying that his whole ministry Asian he's continuing to say that he feels like we've done too much for the world will not doing enough for the people in this country and as a president who stopped should be really to put America First\nBut as long as he puts conservative limited government principles first\nAnd the principles behind the constitution the declaration of independence first that's what you have to put first to put America First if that makes any sense to anyone out there so I just wanted to point that out but I think sometimes we\nWe were too deep we we tried to read too much in the things that Trump says and usually the best ways um yeah oh\nAll right there was a lot more I could have got to on the show today but I think we're almost out of time Tom Benson\nYeah there's a guy with a hook outside the stage left ready to yank it\nYeah but it was a good show if you missed any of the show you get to the podcast anywhere a podcasts are available or by the way you can follow me on Twitter at the beyond reason or you can follow me on Facebook just like to beyond reason radio a Facebook page and uh the debates between Ron descended\nFrom Andrew Gillum it's on channel two I Believe ... um I'll have to watch some of what's going on there and see how it does to\nPick up a game if he wants to win this 'cause he really has been a wing candidate\nI think I didn't call that's I think he's gifts I think that's a little monkey up controversy use really scared to come out\nAnd so many different stations have been trying to give them all not yourself from the can't come off she doesn't want to come on so we'll see what happens I'm not sure even expected to win but we'll see what Amazon and appreciates all listening to showing off it you guys ...

I Know yeah I uh I I feel\nLike uh I feel like more people listen to music on headphones and ... did in our family like it's more common yeah general I never I never really there's every ... music they grabbed me yeah you know a African drumming music more than anything really ah well whatever that's what's that one where what what are the beginning a Lion King\nI'm very cold it is but there is African dry could listen to that for oh me too I'm a gospel guy anytime gospel music comes on and oh yeah that's true or is it is a black choir involved and I am so\nThere it is the best yeah it's a one of my favorite moments ever when we were at north than when and uh and we would do gospel songs was I was watching a a largely white audience of thousands clap along a and boy this isn't going [laughter]\nIf you were to have you heard that first and you'd think they are all just a plot [laughter]\nYou know [laughter]\nLike Steve Martin and that the movie the air yeah it'd be yeah that's exactly right um ah one of the things we do that does not help is uh that you will\nAt the end of your trip to the grocery store like remember like oh my gosh I almost forgot to buy those vegetables are so that I can put them in my refrigerator and throw them away and I know when they're all like we have the best the best of intentions when we go to the grocery store but it just doesn't quite\nConnect with our appetite yeah um and then oh have you ever done this one I'm curious because this one I feel like does help pretended to be rocky well jogging again\nI don't feel like it would do that [laughter] oh yeah absolutely I once I once ran up to a man and a toll rush toll rushing for head [laughter]\n\nBut I did I say one last year just to the either tiger that\nMake you keep

hands Ari brings us to another simple way to help donate blood a it's a that was on the list and a and that is a great\nOne that is a good thing to do to donate your blood especially if you have a rare blood type and also if you don't uh you know there's there's the need for Florida uh yeah it is in general it's helpful or I figured we'd go over a couple of more of the simple ways to help in case somebody who's like I should do that one yeah we can go on to uh what people typically think of with you know helping the poor needy\nWell there's several of these uh we're about listening to people ah letting people speak before you do um and then one of them said um accept others ideas and don't judge them or react to them immediately you\nKnow it's interesting to me is how many\nAre pieces of advice in this list or are you know kind of go tournaments with what you would expect for a list about ways to gain wisdom uh yeah I mean they listen to what other people say not judging everything just based on how makes you feel and uh I mean it's it's it's hard to do that stuff um the\nUh the one that I thought was a really simple way to do is is keeping emails positive ah oh yeah yeah and that's tough yeah emails at a certain ability this is even worse on forums or and so if you're on Web forums you've seen\nThat when you when you don't know you can't you can't see the person behind the keyboard on the other side you can say some soup for me and stuff yeah or or or sound very hearty and just have a tone that you'd never have with somebody and you realize\nI'm the same is true to a slightly lesser degree in emails but still we have a little bit more you know we say we'll say a little extra and you know we wouldn't quite say\nIn person or but do you remember that there are people that are reading those the same things through in traffic\nUm we view and this is actually true psychologically a you know if we are if we have an object that we're using\nOur brain makes that a part of our body and extension of our body in a way we can is why we can hold a screwdriver and use it in and search in a crack and feel something there because we we were that that's become a finger into our brain interprets where that is\nUm that happens on a very complex level with our cars and\nSo it's part of it that way yeah part of what makes ... somebody\nWere to you know smack the hood of your car like if you were to just see that happen to a car you don't own\nA you realize well that has made of metal that's not good but it's it's feels like they've snack do you know it is certainly true um and so that that whole idea of road rage if if there's if if people can remind themselves of this act of like\nI'm Still myself and these people in the car still themselves were were driving these cars yeah uh it I once I learned that learned it in a book\nBy Mr Jordan Peterson now maybe Dr Jordan Peterson eleven doctorates but uh it it made a difference for me like man realizing that you know not doing the car really as an extension of yourself is to make a fence as as you sounded very Italian just then [laughter] yeah he says that does make sense [laughter]\nAh so ah now\nOnto a onto the ways that we can uh um help and and uh in ... when we think of help and and aid to those who needed in general because it's real simple ways to help those around us um but what about the people who aren't necessarily right around us that really really need help yeah uh and so\nThere was this article that was about how you know not all help is created equal there's there's three different stages to helping or people who are in crisis whether that's you know a big geographic area or whether it's a specific group of people\nAnd we walk us through those\nWell first of all most people associate help with some sort of rescue ... um and and when especially for those in extreme need and and indeed that is usually the first stage of help um but if that's all the help you give somebody\nThen basically you have relieve them of the immediate situation but you haven't helped them and there's a difference between relief and actual help yeah and you've helped someone if you've empowered them\nTo either in a void that the next time or to grow bigger because of what just happened to them um and you've got to put together some of the damage that's been done heard a really interesting conversation to be\nAbout a homeless people who um just because they have a home and they um have um a job\nDoesn't mean they're not going to cycle back in homelessness because unless they address some of the trauma that got them there and uh and some of these people have horrible stories um and then there's going to be on a cycle so relief is not is just the first step\nUm the second step is rehabilitation best the kind of putting you're helping people put their life back together so that they don't keep making the same mistakes or better yet they don't keep\nReacting to the same negative events in their life and thereby sabotaging their own happiness and the third one is actually development um and um and that's really important because in that when you um you stabilize someone enough\nThat they can then make progress on their in their life um and so um and so don't we can't figure help just as relief yeah we've got to think of a of the person being more empowered and more enabled in the future to become independent nationally to help others", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "24"}
