point it doesn't matter what color uniform yet where what type of bad you have a wall going up there to help each other out and that's that's huge\nThat's an impressive ...

wait I Need to maximize someone to wait till Seventy what if you don't want to wait till seven right\nThat's what most people say hey I got to wait till seven and get\nThem the most not always the case now not always the case we see it every single week do you apply to different strategies you can potentially getting more money than if you wait until seven eight without waiting till seven rights\nAnd wouldn't you say this is true most of the time people think they have to wait till seven to ... them with the ... hell or most of the time they take it a lot sooner than Seventy and get more and ... how much more we're talking anywhere between a hundred\nTwo hundred three hundred thousand dollars more over their retirement lifetime just by using the strategies that is free money how would you like to have a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand dollars more than money you paid in your paid into it already you're you've already fireworks in life\nWhy wouldn't we maximize and we want to go get it\nBanged up let's do it right let's do this hey we were wanting to change their retirement game here for people and that's why we do this\nThat's why we're going to do this right here

one fifty six hundred\nWow All right Chris that is powerful role right a powerful right there on our ass power powerful right they're\nAll right what we look at it as we seek to educate and empower you every single Saturday right here okay that's what we're trying to do that's what we do we bring clarity and misinformation you know where some more misinformation is Chris where's that most people don't realize your Social Security is going to be taxed\nPotentially a Yeah Yup just talk with somebody ah yesterday about that\nSo whenever you go to get back out mhm they're actually potentially if you're in the rye thresholds on income they're going to tax you on it\nAnd it thresholds are low so most people the majority of people out say are are going to have their Social Security tax\nNot only are all your other tax deferred accounts tax as ordinary income but your Social Security can be taxed to that is just keep comment that just doesn't seem right to me right it but there is a solution if you have a no tax free income they could drop you blow a threshold and boom your Social Security is not taxed anymore\nI said at one more time helped me understand what you're saying\nIf you had tax free sources of income and your retirement tax free source of income tax free right they're going to look at that and they're going to see you don't maybe hit the threshold to get your Social Security taxes also you can potentially drop your Social Security down for being attacks\nAre Sawyer says five enough tax free income coming in is gonna therefore lower my tax bracket and reportable and come to the IRS and they're going to look and I said hey he's not here she's not meeting the threshold we're not going to tax or Social Security is that what you're saying\nBoom you can potentially dropped attacks on that not only going to get tax free from another source which was nice right yeah tax free from there but you're so security's tax now what would normal people do right now hey they don't have ... and most people don't right now Chris ... why should I Do about that\nIf you don't have tax income\nOne of the most powerful streams of income tax free ... taxes you need is you need to implement that right away\nHey we hear about the national debt all the time not here probably every single day was it actually mean for us it means taxes potentially going to have to go a bright bright absolutely right that's what that's that's what everybody's talking about we know that right so are all your accounts can be taxed when that goes up a lot in\nThe first yeah I mean a lot of people's their retirement accounts are going to be taxed most likely at a higher rate than they ever anticipated ... there's not thinking about it it's going to happen down the road\nSo a lot of people are what are called rolling the dice ride the roller dies in the future on this tax deferred accounts when I go to use them in retirement uh-huh but the taxes are going to be lower right yeah that was that thinking that I was a logical\nThat's basically it but what can they do what can they do a you know what can they develop Social Security be index\nWhat can they do about taxes going up on them in the future and having to pay that actual higher tax burden kicking the can down the road rolling the dice that hey maybe hopefully taxes won't go up but we know they are what can what can the everyday American do\nWell you can not reinvent the wheel or you could do something that you're older well you've been doing for decades right you can use the same strategies that they've been doing\nApplying them into your retirement creates some tax free and can we do it every single weaker\nYep we see two thousand people here that we see about eight eight ten well shoot I see about eight people used to be about eight people or other partners she's about eight people a day where jam packed we do this every day\nI think one of the things that people to read this one is tragedies they've got to speak to him for his magazine was the tax free that we love to put into people's retirement right absolutely right\nThat's what you can create ... it's never too late most people think oh it's too late I'm I'm I'm a down the river there is no fixing a now will know you can create tax free in your portfolio almost at any time\nAll right well let's let's show them how to do it that we're going to do is we're we're going to have very easily show you how right now you can implement that tax free strategy\nIn eliminate possibly eliminate or lower taxes on her Social Security as well as have tax free income all throughout retirement therefore having what twenty twenty five percent thirty percent more money in your pocket\nRight Sam here's what we're going to do for the next Fifteen callers only we're going to send you your complimentary Social Security maxim is Asian report what it does is it ... step by step and tells you exactly how to get more\nBenefit in income from Social Security using the proven strategies\nAnd allows you to possibly take your Social Security benefits sooner right and get more than you would if you had to wait 'til\nAge Seventy that's what it does what does that mean for you a more income from Social Security in your retirement\nBut we can only see the next Fifteen callers who call and we can send us out complementary here's what you gotta do you just gotta dial the number gives you a been a pattern whatever you need to write with here is a number eight six four five zero one\nFifty six hundred it's a six four five zero one fifty six

term design Lisa and the camera Fox News President Trump expressed the optimism was just over two weeks into the mid term election I think\nIt's two components put together to make one much stronger\nAnd that was the idea behind fiber eggs along with a few other things a longevity or being able to withstand the things we talked about earlier such as the water leaking into rotting fading all of these terrible things that the the insulation value\nAll of these are protected and a vibrant allows or eliminates all of these processes from happening\nAnd also it sounds as though you can also put it in any shape that you need that gets custom\nOrders and things like that all that's easily done\nAbsolutely by bright she can be custom fit to just about any opening or in your home\nSo when you do you order with renewable energies and you're not just getting something off the showroom floor\nNo you are not a what we do is we actually come out when they design consultant we look at your opening\nA lot of folks in the industry think when they get ready to do windows is really only one way to do it and that's what they have existing in their home so many options out there are so many ways to save money\nFrankly a lot of ways even spend more money to pay how do you do for you want to make your house I'm really good at that most people want to most people in the end of the day won't accomplish do things they want a product that's going to last forever and they want a house that looks like a brand new house at the same or address\nOkay All right yeah I I don't know where I think I Would like improving the aesthetic of my house well one\nOf the things that I've found in many folks that I talked to a in the window industry when I approach folks I asked him hey what is it that you're trying to achieve and when they talk about the aesthetics of the home and how it looks\nThey go Dan I had some ... some folks that look I've seen these windows in the house I've seen these big white clunky thick\nBones looking last week when I was I don't want that look\nIt really show our mission and on one of our goals uh ever knew why Anderson is we want the window and we designed the window to look like it actually came\nWith the home mhm so it doesn't seem to get out of place exactly if you're curious and if you're thinking about and this is something you might want to do a little bit more about if you're in the same kind of mindset that I can get some information but also take advantage of a off that's going on right now to a if you are listening to the show or nearby Anderson you can\nBut the first seven colors get ... percent off windows doors and installation that's twenty percent off of everything so shut down the number\nEight eight eight for eight or nine for eight zero that has eight eight eight for eight for nine for eight zero eight eight eight or eight or nine for eight zero to\nGet the information and hopefully get in on that special offer as well um now I Am looking at replacing it all at once\nThat the doors and windows I'm Ken renewal banners and also do sliding glass doors I mean is there any\n... like is there anything that and your typical home is there anything that you came to\nMe the short answer is no way to answer right um\nWe want to we don't want you you want to be really careful when you are changing opening sizes are sometimes you can begin to get into structural members of the home so we can and larger make openings smaller if it's the right situation okay\nBut the answer your question we can do just we can yes we can do just about anything you want with the custom or be a window\nOkay well in for Neal they enter some kind of want me to the process let's say I give you a comic than I think I'm ready I'm not exactly sure like what's the best way to get a quote to get your design team out walk away to the process All right\nSo the first step is you when to pick up the phone and you would call our national call center or our local call center within a working hours\nAnd you would set up a free and home designed consultant estimate right so that individual when then come out to your home\nThey would take a look at and your name your dreams or whatever you're trying to create a most importantly provide us illusion show we would go we would measure the windows we would go or some design options with you mhm\nUh and then we would uh we have a a design\nA software that we carry with us in the home so you can actually see what the window looks like that you're having designed oh fantastic and so once we had a mystery yeah [laughter] makes it a little bit of time in the home so\nUh be prepared been this way you can get exactly what you want you know it's what you want because you can see what it looks like\nAnd once we knew that ah we simply price it up for you right there in the home\nSo okay so now waiting no waning that's nice I mean you can get an idea of what you can be getting into you\nOften get excited about the process of you know possibly getting these new windows and new doors now let's say I you know I I Love the station I Love the smell of the way everything looks and I say okay and let's go and do they understand let's make this happen in my home what is the next that\nWell the next step is ... how are we going to pay for it right [laughter] can't call mom anymore right [laughter] well my daughter would kill me but she uh she's still calls that so uh yeah so the next set with\nMe we have many different ways to help fund the job orange robots on the job so you can do financing through us you can pay cash or credit card any of that and it's all done on the spot instant financing we have great promotions are\nGoing on uh at this time ... and I'm\nSo is there is quite easy or you don't have to have any money down in um in the process can keep going in the process can game going\nWell tell me about the uh the teams tell me about your crew what what can we expect when it's time for renewal by Anderson to come into my home and actually put in these new windows\nAnd doors and sliding glass doors and everything else yes so the process a is\nReally smooth the we have a concierge service so what that means is once you place the order\nBe contacted ... year and that ... job is to hold your hand through every step of the process so once you place that order with us\nYou will then be contacted and they'll let you know the very next that\nAnd that next step would be a tech mission or any tech measure would come out and measuring the Honda designed consulting because that measure three times ... that's right [laughter] measure three times cut launch right\nSo we do that and I'm a once we are getting the confirmed measure much the windows or order they come in your installers show up so we don't use quote just installers are folks are a Anderson certified master installers\nAnd what that means is we have a scope or national pie and guidelines in these windows have to be installed by okay I often tell people that windows there's two home improvement projects they're really scare me\nWhen I Am a roofing those too that if they're done incorrectly oh yeah they will rot your house to the ground\nGame yeah do we need to make sure that it's being done properly um obviously we have great building inspectors and codes in Florida that help us with that uh but I Believe it or not folks can still get a lotta corners and so we make sure we do it right\nSo what would happen say if you know real renewable energy and it is in the home that insulation process has to be gone and you're taking out the windows and you do find some things structurally wrong\nWell we hope that that doesn't happen we trying to spot it but you're you're exactly right it can happen in ... in in this great state of Florida there's a lot of there's a lot of humidity and there's a lot of ways for water to get in these walls that we can't see\nI'm hoping that's where this concierge service comes and [laughter] and again and we'll have the answers for me\nTo show what would happen in that case um uh when we designed a\nWindow we price out just a window into cosmetic area within a couple inches of the window but if we find out when we remove this window we've got mon infestation and all types of things going on in rotten all the things you\nJust pray that wouldn't be there yes um what we have to do then is we have to bring in a we have to uh refer you to a an al ... Khan tractor that would the specialized in structural damage\nAnd get that are taking care of some on it or to some degree we can handle a just depends on how severe it is\nAnd you've got people that you trust and you're ready and then you can pick up that phone and ...\nWe wouldn't we wouldn't want anybody anybody is home we didn't trust\nThat's comforting yes um let's say go smoothly no bombs at all which we all hope of course with renewable Anderson about how long are you looking for this to be happening in your home and they'll say if you're doing\nTen windows attend when a swap out I mean is that you know a week's worth of open holes in your house or is it something that hopefully a lot smoother than what Gen\nIf it was our first job in Texas about eight months but a sense since we do a you know two billion dollars a year we're pretty fast in this but we are good too yeah so\n... normally it would take a you can usually say about a day for every four windows and that's being conservative but we'd rather you know we'd rather a over promise a I mean a under promise rather than an over promise\nLike family from the beginning and it made it rather daunting task and very very easy\nThey really take the time to find out what you want or what you desire in Iran\nYou have to come here there's no other option the customer service to the ... and to do what I wanted and what her vision was there's no other place\nYou know you can go there and you know that you can trust the value of a shorter and\nThey genuinely care about their customers and not just about the sale it's about\nThe people international diamond center the people's choice for selection quality value and service\nI've got a beautiful diamond on my finger and I'm very proud of a international diamond center and very happy to show it off [laughter] exclusive\nJeweler the Orlando Magic and officials rumors of Florida Gators\nEver wonder why Europeans seem to speak so many languages maybe it's because they use babble the number one selling language learning up an ear of mammals award winning technology gives you speaking right away whether you're learning Spanish French or German and best of all you'll remember what you've learned\nI always thought I was battered languages but after using battle I can tell you I was just taught the wrong way using battles ten to Fifteen minute lesson you can be speaking confidently in your new language within weeks I was amazed that I could start having real life conversations right away so fast and now I'm speaking Spanish\nNo wonder battle is the number one selling language learning happen Europe tried for yourself can see why battle is the quick way to get conversational in a new language like Spanish French for more you can try battles were free to go to babble dot com or download the app and tried for free\nThat battle B a B B.

home show\nBringing you expert advice for home improvement in energy efficiency\nAnd now here's your host Joanna [noise]\nLuckily there were New Hampshire thank you so much for spending part of your day here with us if you or anything like me the eye why home improvements I'm all for it I just need to know more about it before I started diving in\nI'm here with Patrick more from University of roof and contracting and one of the first memories I had when I moved to Florida in two thousand and four was flying in and seeing Lou\nHearts everywhere\nAlmost every home and that's not a decorative thing\nIt's not a decorative bang and I had owned one home prior to that and it was new construction and never in my life that I ever thought\nAbout a roof or replacing\nA root for when you need to replace a real for how do you know when it's time to replace a roof and to this day I still see everywhere is it because of where we live or is it because that's just a homeowner thing\nWell I mean Florida's twilight zone right I mean they were like our own little country down here but I mean all seriousness yeah I mean it's actually not uncommon I mean we are over a year now from a Hurricane Irma which uh you know cause a lot of damage I still\nHave a lot of neighbors getting nervous repaired and replace from that\nOh yeah yeah and so a lot of people have for whatever reason have been putting off of replacing the roof\nOr maybe they don't even know that the roof is leaking or you know there's all these different things but uh yeah it is not uncommon even still a year later or over a year later does is he a tarp on houses all over central Florida I mean they're everywhere I mean\nI live or Winter Park and I've got a couple of houses near me or the ... on them still you know\nAnd that's where the homes that realize that there is a problem for many there can be a slow leak there can be stuff going on in the roof that\nYou wouldn't know that there is a problem going on and I'm sure you see that a lot when you finally get into a home you're like you know at this has been happening for a really long time so what are some of the initial finds that your roof may need repairs and distress or needs complete replacing\nSure yeah that's a great that's a great question because\nA lot of people saw the obvious signs right so there's a big wet spot over their kitchen or they noticed in the bathroom you know the drywall is starting to bubble up or or may have been as extreme as actually we've been in homes where there's holes in the ceiling because so much water was coming into the house which is\nYou know a terrible terrible place to be and so those are the ones where people were very quickly I Need to get somebody here ... need to find out what's going on and that's the people that we've been\nHelping predominantly over the last you know year or so since Hurricane Irma ... uh but what we're still finding even now a year and a year or so later after Irma is people are now just noticing they have water spots right you know or they just now noticed the ceiling is bubbling up um\nMaybe they just looked in a corner of the room at their house they just never look at and they ... yellow on the white drywall um and so we're going into homes now and there's often what happens is there's a leak in your roofing system and it might be so small and so slow that for that water to penetrate\nThere was a roofing system and get to the actual visible places when your house can literally take this long\nShared a roof glad might right yeah it had to take a long time for you to figure out hey something's wrong here right\nYeah and so there's so many people that are dealing with this with their roofs that they're calling us going to have a leak\nIn really on what to do and really what's been happening is it's been leaking for a year\nOr because they have shingles missing that they don't know about they have torn shingles they have singles that have lifted um where the water is driving up under the shingles which it's not supposed to do right and that is really the greatest opportunity for water to get in your roofing system is underneath the shingles\nAfter that bond breaks where the single kind of tax down south yeah wants to win pops up it's really difficult for that to lay back down and stick back the way it was I always say it's kind of like a sticker right like if you take a um Hi my name is Patrick can you put that sticker on your shirt right if you take the sticker off\nThen you put it back on your shirt ill stick but not the same right by the fibers and things aren't\nIn the more you do it at some point it just doesn't stick at all and you're saying a shingle is like that yeah so what happens is a shingles will lift during the storm er during the win whatever it is ... as a lift that tacky underneath the shingle it gets debris underneath it gets ... you water it gets\nA leaves it gets a little debris underneath there and it's not going to stick back so I was just that house not long ago in\nA house with totally normal and I got up on the roof and literally the whole back of the house I just went around with one finger at every single shingle lifted up\nSomeone looked fine it looked normal but when you actually got up there you can see it at the start even compromise\nExactly and we find that a lot of universal refund contracting where people call us and they'll say\nI'm not missing anything goes I think my roof is fine it's just I Want to make sure and we go out and sure enough\nShingles are lifted there might be shingles torn in so don't just assume because it visually looks good that it's in good shape I mean there's a very good chance that\nThere could be something going on and especially if you notice any yellow ing and your ceiling mhm anything that looks like a water spot whether it looks like it to dry up or it looks like it's fresh give us a call and we'll come out and inspected and find out what's going on\nOh that's great okay so if you got to an inkling some of them going on or you know it's been like so many years like how long can you expect a decent roof collapsed in Florida you know storms standing\nIf I don't know the company I just say hey you know when you're asking talking to another company just ask them how long have they been in business [laughter] you know or have they been in business for since Hurricane Irma\nThat may stay a little bit about what their intentions are and it doesn't mean that every roofing company that did as bad but you know just junior due diligence so that way if you do have an issue with the roof down the work down the road and the company's stand behind the work and I can say without a doubt universal refund contracting can we've been here twenty five years and we're not going anywhere\nAnd you have the warranty is to back it up exactly and you actually have like a next level kind of war and yeah I was more about that\nSo we are a platinum contractor I'm with Owens cording or which is a great company uh we install Owens Corning in certain teaching those but specifically Owens Corning where one of the few platinum contractors\nA preferred contractors in the ... area and um we are really proud of that because it means that we have been a certified and know how to specifically installed their roofing system along with that a certification huh hum and recognition violence Corning we can also offer warranties\nThat other companies can't offer their extended more real bust warranties homeowners can\nUm can take with the roofing system that other Owens courting of contractors can't offer they just can't and that comes with the platinum prefer exactly yep flat and there's only I'm a really a little bit more than a handful of those even in Orlando and the central Florida in Orlando area so it's a pretty big yeah\nThat sounds like a big deal I like I like it better warranty pretty proud of it I think I'm gonna look you know my a person in the eye and say you giving me the best possible risk to protect my home and my family and and everything and it I mean that's that's hugely important\n'cause every system comes with a standard warranty from Owens Corning um but this is kind of a step up so if you want added protection an added value for your roofing system we can offer that whereas other companies can't so you know that's a big value to a lot of people out there and uh it's something that we can offer that other people can't\nThat's fantastic Patrick I'm sitting here at Patrick more from universal refund contracting and if you're thinking about\nNow it's time to get that roof looked at a time to get that work done uh right now the first seven colors during the show right now\nFifteen Percent off new roof installations and by calling you can also get priority placement on the list as well\nSo if you're thinking about it just going to make the call and get on the list now at four zero seven eight zero nine five one five six that's four zero seven eight zero nine fifty one if the sex again for zero seven eight zero nine five one five six so the process of replacing or if you've not\nBeen through it before it's like they just come and take the whole rip off [laughter] and you know everything's open air and you gotta wait through the ... it's it's done in a very deliberate process yeah kind of what you do that but he doesn't put us shatter\nYeah so we are very process driven in terms of making sure that we're very efficient and very effective when we install your roof we did not while your roof exposed anymore than it has to be with the ... like\nThat like if you have your point of shingles off and it's just the wood chair usually at the data pull everything off and then a day to put everything back on but it's Florida that evening\nThunderstorms going to come up with\nWhat's happening there we so we're really is I Will say this about our crews are cruiser like amateur meteorologist like the little chemicals in their head or antennas and they just know when a storm is going to come and they're really great about\nCovering the roof and typing in and we really never have any issues with that violin but at the same time you know we're so efficient and effective that quite often most shingle roofs and average shingle roof we can do in a day to day and a half\nAnd the main thing is that tear off process when we get down to the decorating as soon as we get that would\nExposed and we re nail it if we need to buy code or um we get that under lame it down and that's really what protects the house so if you was to be a little sprinkler a shower we are putting coverage but our guys are very efficient they're effective we're not running back and forth to the to the supply store going oh we forgot this forgot that everything's there\nThat we pull into dumped trailer or to the house you know it is loud noisy and dirty I mean it is what it is it's really wanted to be right but it's going to happen quickly and efficiently and effectively for you and when we leave you're going to have a great roof and you're not even gonna know we were there\nAnd you have a great we want you to go a long way that actually that as well so if you're thinking about\nUh it's finally time I know there's that you've seen a lot of your neighbors having this done and you want to have him come out and take a look I highly recommend contacting universal roof and contracting um when I had my roof re down a few years ago it was a beautiful process but\nI I Know so much more about it now like I Wish I Would have asked the question is if I Would have paid attention to what were they using and how were they applying it how long did it take like I've gotten such a great education on roofing from you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "22"}
