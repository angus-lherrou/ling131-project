Fox News as pressure mounts Saudi Arabian officials agree to trying to find out what happened to a journalist who disappeared at the Saudi consulate in Turkey\nI Want to get on to black conservatives I Want to get on to\nA black liberals if you will because uh this whole situation with Kanye last week and I'm not going to spend a lot of time on ... but I just want to give you an overall view on what the Republican Party has been about I'm not one listen I I don't want the black or the black community a community to become a monolithic vote for\nUm for the Republican Party\nJust as I don't want them to be a monolithic vote for the Democratic party but I Do\nWant blacks and whites and people are racist to subscribe to conservative values to constitutional principles more than anything because that is the only thing that is going to keep our country intact we live in the greatest nation God has ever\nGiven man a and it is it isn't even close last week\nSome panelists on Don Lemon show a sad that a a Kanye West is basically what happens when a when he grows don't read while I'm here to tell you differently or Kanye West is what happens when negroes began reading\nReal American history and they stop relying on the ... history that we find on college campuses throughout the United states uh today the Republican Party has played a pivotal role\nIn securing the blessings of liberty for all people but in particular in particular I like to say blacks I don't like to say African Americans because let's face it uh no no blacks are trying to go back to Africa except for vacation\nA and we don't even know what it's like in that culture to live in that culture ironically I have an African American a straight out real African American in the studio a freaking American I'm In the studio ... although he looks nothing like me so that's kind of weird\nIs an icon say those words that you can because they know him is considered a defensive\n[laughter] even though he's African American he has to keep his mouth sealed we do not want him to get us in trouble or for those of you that in ... he can do that when he opens his mouth a huh [laughter]\nSo uh [laughter] so listen if the Republican Party was instrumental in helping blacks out during reconstruction and during the civil rights era does that mean that Republicans are perfect no does it mean that there are ... there aren't any racist Republicans absolutely not let's not be silly let's not be ridiculous okay\nBut but we can say honestly that it was the Democratic party that was the party of institutional racism so if blacks are going to pledge allegiance to the Democratic party based on uh the belief that they care then\nLet me ask you guys is let me ask you guys is in Studio when you say\nWould you say that love is better expressed in word or deed\nDeed deed okay what would you say oh Mr macho says I'm like that but what would you say Toni I'll I'll say\nThe daily okay I mean worse help

it's scary my friend John Steinberg or Florida family policy council that I have two words for Gillum\nHe's he's he's impressive and radical I think that's summed it up perfectly he's impressive and radical\nEnd he happens to be black so because he's black oh he can be a racist against the policies that he's implementing are meant to keep black people down or the policies that he would like to implement so I'm just saying black people if you're going to vote\nOn somebody based upon a care\nThe care word then you need to look at action and not words I'm Sorry government crackers and love

through it up for yourself or did you know that it was the Republican Party that past affirmative action that enforced in for a minute objection did you know that was under President Richard Nixon leadership you don't you don't learn that in\nIn history all these all these people going oh and you know of affirming supporting affirmative ... they don't even know who's for or or or help them out or when it comes to affirmative action but it wasn't the racist Republicans fools it was\nWith the help of president Richard Nixon with the leadership of of a black Republican art Fletcher see what you don't understand that at some point blacks actually did\nVote monolithic leave for the Republican Party or because they knew it was a Republican Party that was the party of civil rights\nAnd then the big switch lie happen and black spell for it hook line and sinker so now we see blacks in our college campuses being duped by other blacks that have been duped and and it's just a big mess we see blacks\nIn the church is no different from blacks owned a secular blacks the the uh\nThe secular blacks that are trying to act afro centric bitter espousing white European socialists marks is news we

is news adequate to talk of outage news radio Ninety three point one WFL Larry\nAre you tired of fake news distracting from real news Moreno more Carl's got your back and here he is now\nIt's just a couple of other quick\nPoint I Want to mention before we go into the audio because some of the audio is is is long but already you wanted to say something remind us about something about the President Bill Clinton\nOut first like ... yes overly like president who was sitting down and where it's needed for energy and they were talking to kids and said\nAbout Iraq Obama ten years ago he'd be serving us cough [laughter]\nI remember that I Do I Do remember that I was\nPretty hot or when a when I heard about that of course Tony thought that could mean something different\nOn that a ... bomber might've been a barista and the ... [laughter]\nWell I mean you know if he was a Republican then obviously we would think it was a racist comment but if he would but being a Democrat maybe he just thought he was just an experience you know and\nYeah that was it got to start somewhere that was it that was definitely what it was about that was definitely a just two other quick mentioned and then we'll go to the audio right away here\nI'm a George W. Bush remember at that time he appointed more blacks to high level positions Republican president than any uh than any of his predecessors they was Ronald Reagan that signed into law Dr Martin Luther king Junior's holiday\nAnd President Bush was racist because he waited for days to go to New Orleans\nYeah he waited four days ago to New Orleans because the governor and the mayor said don't come in Mr President this is what you have to understand three branches of government okay so we have a we have federal state local before President can come in\nThey have to okay ... that's actually\nTheir jurisdiction and they were Democrats yeah and so that doesn't get mentioned but that's why you see governors like Rick Scott now declare an emergency call the president right away before it even happens because no one wants to be the Katrina guy anymore or I Want to go to audio I Want to show you\nI I Want you to listen to what a Christian a person that claim to name a crisis\nThey\nLeave the ... I feel like blood and cribs or leave the Republican Democrat that thing behind leave the skin color behind if you claim the name of Christ this is what I imagine you would sound like praying for any president we go out and play that one of\n... people [laughter] for for you for for you often\nThink you will I Need it probably more than anybody [laughter] so I Would that would be very and I say\nMuch [laughter] [laughter]\nOh God\nGot you for your whole experience on President Trump you get from supernatural wisdom to accomplish all the plans are have for this country and for

was pastor Andrew Brunson who was return a from a turkey um after being with turkey right yet murky\nAfter being in prison for a couple of years three years yeah so ah so this was a guy held against his will a pastor in Turkey he comes back gets on his knees in the White House praised for the president of the United states now let me say this let me just make this real clear real quick just because you pray for a president does it mean\nHave to vote for him but his Christians we are called to a higher standard\nYes we're supposed to pray for those north or yoga but did you notice that even the pastor Brunson was freed after two years in prison because of what President Trump has done President Obama\nClaimed it was because of him [laughter]\nI don't even have time but when you go that's ridiculous let's start\nThe next audio we may have been on the other side after grandma lawyer the top of our but let me\nA black Christian power he\nFor being black\nThe community and marginalized\nDo your homework will come out and do your homework they didn't do their homework so let me\nYou took a little bit of research not just him personally but also some policy they want to pay they should have done their homework they had done their homework they would've known that President Trump has\nIncarceration instructing attorney general Jeff Sessions to revitalize the war on drugs they would've known but okay uh\nWe're we're going to have to break here and there through it uh so President Trump has ramped up mass incarceration is if President Trump has the power in local cities and states to do a such a thing this is a black pastor that obviously well informed next\nLet's fill in federal eighty five have been white and it's just one has been black and one has been Hispanic they would\nThat President Trump supported apartment object in jail and unlawful\nHer just making it difficult laughable\nUnlawful voter purges so that's getting rid of dead people on the voter rolls that's getting rid of the Mickey Mouse is uh that's getting rid of the people that perhaps may have moved or legal or illegal immigrants so voter purges okay guy doesn't know what he's talking about but he sounds great\nLet's go out and vote they would've known talk is ending protection predatory lenders which this passionately on black people and what\nThis was the dumbest thing I've heard so Trump ended protections for predatory lenders their prey on black people but this past year things black people need predatory lenders so he's calling out from Port resilient guy he's he has a doctorate so we should\nListen to everything he said absolutely crazy absolutely crazy\nThis is what's happening in the black community because we were used\nTo think and read for sale we have to pretend like we got to please every black man instead of leaving Jesus we need to turn this crap around I'm getting so sick and tired of it when we get back on the other side of the break we're

issues because there's a lot you know twelve different issues alright air and by the amendment ten protects your right to vote for local officers and and it gives you accountability in county government which is really unique and special so I think we want to protect that but I sure appreciate your your allow me to come on and ...\nOr you can visit ... similar county clerk at the court

people are spending our money we should know\nHow they spend our money and we should have people in place that will help save money when there's cost they don't need to uh to exist or basically so\nAmendment ten I'm voting yes on amendments than let's go ahead and go to a amendment one this amendment raises the homestead property tax or you might be interested in this one so\nUh this amendment and I want to get your take on this to actually uh this amendment raises the homestead property tax exemption or by twenty five thousand for homes worth more than a hundred thousand that would exempt value between one hundred thousand and a hundred and twenty five of a home that serves as the owners primary residence\nCurrently there are two other homestead exemption exemptions for the first twenty five thousand of the assessed property value in for the value between fifty thousand and Seventy five thousand so who supports it\nRepublicans in the state legislature I'm this you know I I I've not looked at this website before so I may be a little biased but our bodies that were actually really good at this stuff so I'm going to get his take on it\nUh but based upon what I'm reading I'm looking at boating or yes for this but Republican Guard ... ...\nLet's take a look at this what you're reading is a summary or what is correct pure on the vote for what you're not reading is the actual bill that they want to pass your okay now Florida being a note tax state where do they get their money from\nProperty property so if they are going to raise the exemption about twenty five thousand way they're going to get the money from\nProperty so they gonna increase I see your taxes but they got to exempt you exams you from twenty five so they bait and switch it's bait and switch from what I can tell\nSo you would be voting no\nI I'm a big no one that now I I was leaning yes on this ... it it makes sense the way that they've written it right\nBut we don't know\nWhat the meat and potatoes on that bill All right so we just getting a summary of what they want a mound Leno the persons that are\nPutting that forward have a motive\nWell they're going to have a summary on the ballot though they're not going to have this long drawn out thing I've actually seen or some of the ballots already so they they're getting a summary on the ballot ... but what are they going to leave out\nOkay All right so now we just confused audience I wanted to be definitive for the audience\nWhat we have the ... we have definitely confused our audience\nAll right so you're saying they're going to find ways to get taxes elsewhere\nThey gonna have to because if we're going to have a balanced budget and the state of Florida we're going to get the money from\nAll right now let me let me let me read this part of this might this might help us out who oppose it it I mean who opposes ...\nGroups that advocate for local governments are such as the Florida associations of counties and cities counties and special districts across the state would lose an estimated seven hundred in approximately fifty three million dollars in the budget and the first year\nOr so there there's a clue right so where does your local government going to get the Texas from they going to increase your taxes\nOh my God you man this isn't a logical\nOkay All right that's good All right that's good so that's why we're here folks I operate being an African American he is a really good at a lot of this stuff\nOn the highest them and my mother wouldn't do that [laughter]\nActually happens it'd be pretty good at home inspection too so it may make sure you call them three two one sixty four zero to five or a so any way he knows this stuff All right so\nMan I was a yes on this thing man and I think you may have just ...\nThe lights went off okay I'm In went on yeah All right [laughter]\nThe light yeah the light went to the light went on okay amendment to this proposal permanently places at ten percent cap on the annual increase of non homestead property tax assessment\nOr this amendment wouldn't change current law but it puts protections in place so exorbitant increases don't impact renters business owners and consumers\nWho supports it Florida tax watch a small businesses and the Ford association of realtors who opposes it the league of women voters a Florida because of the group's position that no tax revenue should be prohibited and the constitution I'm a yes on this\nI'd like to All right so we're in agreement so far I mean I Want to look at the bill man I Want to look at the bill because I I\nAnd that's the thing about African American dishes they're always suspicious and they don't necessarily come\nPrepared again the thing about again let me ask I mean real African American\nWhere will they find the money because if we have a downturn okay ever devaluation in the dollar\nOkay so now is the dollar is now worth what it was ...\nEighty cents instead of the dollar yeah All right the the price of the house the value of the house is going to increase because it used to be with a hundred thousand and that does now and he was eighty percent of what it used to be\nSo\nAll right well you ... you see them go yeah and that's what I Want to see what the bill says 'cause I'm suspicious of politicians\nAll right yeah and I totally agree with that but based on what I've read so far of a ... wonderful I'm going to vote yes on amendments to unless they find out something different and that's the case I bring the information back to you or we're going to go ahead and go to break him in I promise we'll wrap up the next several amendments\nRelatively quickly so we're not just a drag in this house for you anyway this project and show will back in a few

to talk about radio Ninety three point line [noise]\nAre you ready to get your conservative cardio on good\nLet's get back to the Carl Jackson's show that fine like\nHey welcome back to the show you look at these radio Ninety three one that's supposed to curl Jackson show how we're in the last stretch I just want to remind you are\nThere are a lot of people are hurting out there for those of you that are Floridians\n'em and understand what it's like to undergo a hurricane but not obviously to what happened\nThis hurricane Michael has been on believable I have a buddy in a tree business any if we were speaking he went out literally 'cause he contracts with you might as well and uh he went out there and he was like Carl it's it's like nothing I've ever seen he was like literally I'm looking around me\nAnd everything is when he said it looks like a tornado or a bomb or just went off and even during the type of work that he does he's like the way some of these trees in larger trees are just snapped around here so I guess just crazy or so we\nDo have to remember that the uh right now and the you know Orlando central Florida area we have a good there's people in the panhandle uh that are hurting there's people in the Carolinas still\nWe just had what was the what was the hurricane we just had literally that devastated\nUm Irma Irma was that are among the karma yeah\nOK Hurricane Irma or so people still in the Carolinas or I mean good lord they were uh some of them I mean I I don't know it's just crazy what people are undergoing right now so we got to remember to pray for them if you can donate to pick places like Red Cross Americans per se\nA is one that uh uh is one that I like to\nMake sure you give if you're churches involves some way shape or form which I Need to get to\nA my church has a you know a a an organization that goes out and it helps with that type of stuff to make sure you do that I've been slack and all that so I got to make sure that I Do that but also it is a time for a Florida politicians you know we hate to say it but it's it's the truth or the politicians to\nTo step up you know after a hurricane her mean a Gillum did a ... so he's looking to step up right now Rick Scott\nRick Scott went on Florida politics dot com Rick Scott is totally ... thinking about totally counseling\nOr that I said canceling ethic counseling a canceling his campaign\nAnd uh and literally just working on the storm victims and all that kind of stuff because of uh all the damage that's been done\nAre in the in the panhandle area so it's pretty it's pretty interesting it's pretty devastating obviously President Trump made a visit today and he uh like everyone else thought that it was absolutely devastating so are we are going to be looking to see how the politicians handled this a Rick Scott like I said he said he may cancel his campaign altogether\nWhich would be pretty amazing and historical ended up it's so uh but I give this guy credit he's been absolutely fabulous and dealing with these type of disasters the beforehand and the aftermath is just kind of his thing a ... work with bats out there to\nOut um supplies and uh and that's definitely a good thing and I know it's it's a sad statement to make but all of this even though they're helping people of all of it is a political as well because every one will\nThe judge to about a you know over senator\nBill Nelson because of his position in the Senate can help spearhead a the relief package from the federal government\nSo everyone's going to be keeping an eye out or to see how these guys perform and I know it's sad when people are in these areas but nevertheless this is what this is what politicians do uh is their job\nAll right so let me get to 'em\nMan there's\nSuch a short amount of time I'm going to try to cover as much as I can listen Andrew Gillum and the left they are claiming a basically that they want health care for all and we'll kind of get into that but I Want to\nI Want to share with you first the outside influences\nThat are taking over Florida elections or one of 'em is Michael Bloomberg\nMichael Bloomberg has spent two million\nA Tom Steyer has players just spin a hundred and ten million dollars of his own money or during this midterm election season because he said not taking over the house and his opinion would be a total loss a and disappointment a\nDisappointment for him so you've got there's another lefty a big lefty a Soros George Soros so all of these guys are pouring money and I found out today\nThat Gillum I think it was a I don't know he\nHe's had the majority of his money has come from out of the state the support it's just absolutely on believable anybody anyway\nGetting to this Bloomberg article you need to be aware of you need to be aware of this and that man I forget where I pulled this there was off of real clear politics but I don't know why I didn't write down the source\nOr the new source but anyway I pulled the this article and title Michael Bloomberg group to spend two million on these Florida Democrats and the article goes like this every town for gun safety this is\nMichael Bloomberg's non profit anti gun group but it's clearly caught it because this is what the left does\nAh every town for gun safety uh the gun control group co founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg plans to spend at least two million over the next month helping the Democratic candidates seeking Florida Cabinet positions and Republicans\nDid you hear that running for the state Senate\nWow wow\nAll right so that really caught my attention so the group has has given direct contributions to a governance Oreo candidate Andrew Gillum attorney general a nominee Sean strong and agricultural commissioner hopeful Nikki freed uh every town has also hooked up Bill Nelson so\nWe know so many of 'em and and um we have a lot of respect for them but I Will also say there's a lotta roofing companies that are fly by night you know I encourage my customers when they're trying to compare us versus others\nIf I don't know the company I just say hey you know when you're asking talking to another company just ask them how long have they been in business you know or have they been in business for since Hurricane Irma\nThat may say a little bit about what their intentions are and it doesn't mean that every roofing company that did is bad but you know just junior due diligence so that way if you do have an issue with the roof down the work down the road and the company's stand behind the work and I can say without a doubt universal roofing contracting can we've been here twenty five years and we're not going anywhere\nAnd you have the warranty is to back it up exactly and you actually have like a next level kind of warrants yeah I'm a little more about that\nSo we are a platinum contractor I'm with Owens courting a which is a great company uh we install Owens Corning answered and teach singles but specifically Owens corny where one of the few platinum contractors\nA preferred contractors in the Atlanta area and um we are really proud of that because it means that we have been a certified and know\nHow to specifically installed their roofing system\nAlong with that a certification huh hum and recognition violence Corning we can also offer warranties\nThat other companies can't offer their extended more robust warranties homeowners can\nUm can take with the roofing system that other Owens courting of contractors can offer they just can't and that comes with the platinum prefer exactly yep for ... and there's only I'm a really a little bit more than a handful of those even in Orlando and the central Florida in Orlando area so it's a\nReally big on the ... that sounds like a big deal I like I like it better warranty pretty proud of it I like having a look you know my a\nPerson in the eye and say you've given me the best possible risk to protect my home and my family and and everything and it I mean that's that's hugely important\nBecause every system comes with a standard warranty reminds Corning um but this is kind of a step up so if you want added protection an added value for your roofing system we can offer that whereas other companies can't so you know that's a big value to a lot of people out there and uh it's something that we can offer that other people can't\nAs fantastic Patrick I'm sitting here at Patrick more from universal refund contracting and if you're thinking about\nNow it's time to get that roof looked at it's time to get that work done uh right now the first seven colors during the show right now\nIf ... percent off new roof installations and by calling you can also get priority placement on the list as well so if you're thinking about it just going to make the call and get on the list now at four zero seven eight zero nine five one five six that's four zero seven\nEight zero nine fifty one if the sex again for zero seven eight zero nine five one five six\nSo the process of replacing a rift you've not been through it before and they just come and take the whole rip off [laughter] and you know everything's open air and you gotta wait through the ... it's it's done in a very deliberate process yeah kind of wanting to that but he doesn't put viewer shatter\nYeah so we are very process driven in terms of making sure that we're very efficient and very effective when we install your roof and we did not want your roof exposed anymore than it has to be with the ... like\nThat like you have your plan is shingles off and it's just the wood chair usually at the data pull everything off and then a day to put everything back on but it's Florida\nThat evening thunderstorms going to come up with\nWhat's happening there we so we're really is I Will say this about our crews are cruiser like amateur meteorologist like little chemicals in their head or antennas and they just know when a storm is going to come and they're really great about\nCovering the roof and typing in and we really never have any issues with that not violent but at the same time you know we're so efficient and effective that quite often most shingle roofs an average shingle roof we can do in a day to day and a half\nAnd the main thing is that tear off process when we get down to the deck and as soon as we get that would\nExposed and we re nail it if we need to buy code or um we get that under lame it down and that's really what protects the house so if you was to be a little sprinkler a shower we harp uncover it but our guys are very efficient they're effective we're not running back and forth to the to the supply store going oh we forgot this forgot that everything's there\nThat we pull into dumped trailer to the house you know it is loud noisy and dirty I mean it is what it is the truth you want it to be right but it's going to happen quickly and efficiently and effectively for you and when we leave you're going to have a great roof and you're not even gonna know we were there\nAnd you have a great we want you to go a long way that actually that as well so if you're thinking about uh it's finally time I know there's that you've seen a lot of your neighbors having this done and you just want to have them come out and take a look highly recommend contacting universal roof and contracting um when I had my roof read down a few years ago it was you know a beautiful process but\nI I Know so much more about it now like I Wish I Would have asked the question is if I Would have paid attention to you know what were they using and how were they applying it and how long did it take like\nI've gotten such a great education on roofing from you Patrick thank you so much but\nAside from the warranties and and and that you guys can walk people through like any insurance bumps and along the way what are like you're taught to take away is about what sets universal recent contracting apart from other rivers here in Florida\nI think what you just said is a perfect example mhm we think of ourselves as a consultant our job is to teach you what it takes to put the best route on your home that not every roof is the same mhm there are different shingles there's different systems there's different crews there's there's all these things involved in the process\nWe're not a hard sale organization and we're not going to beat you up over the head are not gonna make you sign a piece of paper the second I Walk up to your door when I'm walking through the process we're going to explain to you why we're better and why the system and the products we use are better than other companies\nAnd so at the end of the day we want you to want us because we definitely want your business as well and we're going to earn it so um that's the biggest thing is ask questions and the other thing too I took all the time\nCustomers out their potential homeowners customers\nIs when you're looking at your roof find out if you're comparing apples to apples to apples to oranges\nThere's a lot of people think that a roof the roof and so you know there are certain cars if you if you buy one car versus another car\nAnd you know one car you know ... there's a difference in a car and a truck right they're not apples apples there's different parts to it and so they do kind of the same thing but they performed differently mhm and so it's the same thing with roofing there is a big difference and materials there is a big difference in labor there's a big difference inexperienced and especially warranty that so I don't know what you're buying and don't just assume it's the same\nAnd if anything give us a chance to come out and explain the differences so you can make an informed decision\nOkay All right I like all of that um but when it comes to roof damage which does more damage storms or squirrels\n[laughter] it's buddy you know the girls can do some damage I Know it was girls can do the real damage I ah or pesky situation where I I was in my office at home not too long ago\nAnd I heard like a water dripping into the roof and I was like okay my ... not that old oh what's going on here and I called my my company back out there like a squirrel is eating the yourself ... ... it happens all the time I mean you must see some pretty incredible\nThings are it's crazy I just went to the house had a\nA whole family of um of raccoons living in their out and um I we see squirrels chew stuff all the time\nUh it's crazy I mean it ... and unfortunately you know sometimes there's nothing you can do about it but um you know that's another perfect example of things that we do differently other companies install what they call led booth they just wrap ... led around those pipes that come out of your roof I think that you know they do to them they actually cut their teeth on them that's how they cut their teeth like maybe my kids we should do that\nWith their right but it ...\nOral squirrels do that they cut their teeth so we we as a company made a decision we don't put lead on those pipes anymore we put we called Bola boot the kind of a hard rubber a material that goes right over the top of that pipe and make sure that things are not going to leak more importantly the squirrels don't chew on them\nOh my gosh yeah even really thought about everything\nOh yeah we don't we don't we don't skimp we don't cut corners we do it the right way because quite honestly I don't want to come back out to your roof and fix things I Want to be putting roost on other people's houses so we do it right the first time and then you know on the one off that we get something wrong we come out and fix it 'cause we've been around for twenty five years\nYou're not going to call the office and get a dead signal and hope somebody shows up right we have people there and we will take care of everything\nI Love everything about that and if you're thinking about it is time for you to take the next step I highly recommend calling us the crew at University of ... and contracting a for all of those reasons they they definitely stand behind their work they've got the warranties and the platinum preferred status yes congratulations on that is awesome\nFifteen Percent a new roof installations out of the first seven colors during the show can enjoy it that offer special to the show Fifteen Percent up new roof installations\nAnd calling for zero seven eight zero nine five one five six\nFour zero seven eight zero nine five one five six and four zero seven eight zero nine five one five six\nPatrick ... you certainly seem to know a whole\nLot about the right way to do roofing if there's one piece of advice you can leave everybody with today when it comes to knowing when it's time to make that call what can you even with\nDoing when it's time to things if you see people around you getting getting roofs you know it's a great view would I Would go ahead and call that there's probably a good chance or maybe some hail and the area or wind damage okay the second thing is obviously if you just hear leaking or you see any kind of water spot in there or you just got an old roof\nGive us a call will come out and look at it and will advise you maybe a little more time maybe you don't maybe it's time to call your insurance company or just replace out of pocket\nPerfect

of losses so we're willing to accept a lower return in exchange green money does not have downside market risk\nSo of red money is exposed upside down side market risk and green money has only upside market potential which one is better well that's probably the wrong question to be asking because neither one is inherently good or bad it all depends\nThe very important questions we should ask
