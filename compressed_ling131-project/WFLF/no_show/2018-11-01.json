back Senate candidate Rick Scott in Dubai ... full Ron dissent in\nBut at the same time we love to pay off our house and um so we're not sure what the best movies and if it's financially responsible to do one or the other and I'm wanting to get your opinion [noise] um\nWell I mean typically a Christian school is a private school and there's going to be more expensive and then the question you've got to say is if we go that route it pays off our home in\nSeven years if we go the other route it pays off our home in three years is it worth four more years or whatever the number is you just run your numbers out I just made those up okay\nBut in other words this is going to delay the mortgage being paid off if you go the more expensive school route in order to get that world view which is fine and um now I I Will tell you having educated a paid for the education for three kids that are now adults\nAnd having participated in this discussion a multitude of times with friends that are Christians and and we are obviously to um [noise] that you need to be very careful if you're going to invest in a a a a private Christian school that they are actually implementing that belief system\nThere are some that have a Christian heritage that are no more matching with my value system that fly to the moon [laughter]\nJust ... they once had something that was Christian and on and sometimes they still holding themselves out as Christian schools but the values that they're tenured professors are bringing into the classroom at nothing to do with the values of miles so\nAnd so if I'm going to do that I might have if I won't be on the enemy territory I might as well know that I'm On enemy territory instead of a wolf in sheep's clothing kind of thing so if you're going to invest make sure you're getting what you're\nAttempting to get here I'm not saying that can't be done and can be done there are great Christian schools that do a great job of a quality education with\nThe quality value system but you just gotta make sure you can't just assume because such and such was a Baptist school or such and such with Presbyterian but that might have been many years ago and there and you know they've got that in their heritage but there are no more than fly to the moon anymore um and so\nYou know that then you just pay for an expensive school\nWith a questionable quality you know so they're not the second part of the equation as this and this is not the challenge you it's just a ... what are you critical thinking and you decide which one you want to do in the process my three kids and sharing and I all went to University of Tennessee a public state school\nWhich there is some bizarre stupid but stuff that happens on the campus\n[laughter] okay I mean crazy in some of those professors are proof ten years should not be there you know I mean there is some nut burgers running around over there\nMy university's campus okay and I love University of Tennessee but there's some stuff happening over there that just make your hair curly you know so my kids went there though but here's the thing we figured out that our kids spiritual walk was not based on what happened at school it was based on what happened at home\nOkay\nAnd so our kids plugged into young life while they were in a public university setting and they already had their values and backbone and apologetic established\nBecause of how they were raised inside the rambling house so they were equipped to go into\nThat environment and not quote unquote lose their salvation in the process now I'm not saying no Ramsey kid ever did anything stupid I can promise you randomly kids Ramsey are pretty much known for having done some stupid at one time or not [laughter] but but uh but but you know I I you know you can do that and a Christian school too you know that right\nMhm right yeah ... right off campus is a bar\n[laughter] every one of those and so you can go get do you can go get just as drunk at a Christian schools you can in their states goes all that to say I I don't eat there is no bubble that protects them like your home does\nThe preparation you give them at your kitchen table is their insurance policy it's their fire insurance policy it's not you know the name of the door of the school but that's not to say you should never do of course go I think it's perfectly fine as long as you pay cash for it and you're willing to say we're going to pay off the mortgage a little slower\nBecause of that and how would investigate and make sure that the values are actually taught in the classroom [noise]\nI put my kids in a private Christian school for two years when they were in uh\nElementary school and I found that some of the teaching they were doing over there and I'm like well this is useless complete waste of money\nBecause they're just you know just just\nRaising is as a mainstream I mean you know so I figured out it's going to be made that does this this was the ...\n\nQuestion I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance is to replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse or you
