are persecuted by unjust laws against non violent behavior and also people like our guest here today Juanita Broderick who has not been given a proper\nA hearing for her serious credible charges of sexual assault against\nA former President Bill Clinton and so she's here with me today are sharing her story and she has a book that details what she's saying and also her life guard you better put some ice on that now that was a quote that that is from Bill Clinton is what he said to you callously after the assault right\nOh yeah just act and I'm sitting up on the side of the bad I'm absolutely in a state of shock I'm Crying and as he goes to the door he puts on his sunglasses and emotions should I'm now and says you're better put some I\nLaughed wow oh yeah just horrible [noise]\nSo how have you I mean have you been able to have any semblance of forgiveness or healing take place or does it feel just as a you know as it did when I originally happened\nWell it's still very raw [laughter] you know when I\nTalk about it you know just in everyday life I tried to forget and I do forget\nA but of course the last two years I've been I've been talking about it so that makes it difficult but it's also made it better day Fitch and you say can I forgiving that's the same thing that I asked her saying and I said I Can't yeah\nYou know the man I had never truly are asked for my forgiveness for what he'd done to me and how it's affected my life\nRight and that's the thing is that I think that you should be able to have your voices be heard because you know Hillary Clinton was saying on the\nSteven Kobe or show I think that she was saying that you know this case with Ford is very credible and I mean\nOkay I don't know what happened there but I don't see that nearly as credible as what you're saying because you have actual people you told at the time you can name the place when it happened you have friends that you told within thirty minutes of the act of the event happening\nSo you have a a strong case as far as I'm concerned\n[noise] oh yeah and I told five other people oh you know within the next week very close friends that of course all my faith that I couldn't will cover up wouldn't make up for three to four days\nSo what is your what is uh what is what do you hope to achieve with your campaign to get this message out I Know someone tried to set up a go find me to get money for you and you said nope I don't want it refund their money I'm not here for money and I think that's admirable or what you\nWhat do you hope to achieve with this call I Would\nReally like to see I Would like to have my allegations proven by the FBI and I would really like to go after a Bill Clinton was perks that he has at the former president which amounts to millions of dollars every year from our tax dollars\n... tennis so hopefully that maybe how do we get a how do we get the word out is there a way to sign a petition or anything that they get the FBI to\nPeople and yeah there's people in Washington now trying to get a trying to get the attention\nShouldn't have the people who would actually well they said the only one that can do this for the trial\nSo I'm trying to uh I'm trying to encourage President Trump to ask for this if they can ask for the for the ... the allegations that Dr Ford and the other two ladies uh they should they should uh be able to do mine this ...\nWell I think you deserve to have an FBI investigation it's only makes sense and I'm sure if we get enough tweets over to Hillary Clinton maybe she'll weigh in on or allowing that to happen to since she is the champion of women as she says she has ...\nShe's the champion of women but only one home and and that sort of fell\nRight and then I saw that all is a mulatto you you tweeted her saying you know are you going to pay attention you send to praise Clinton before that and then she\nOh can you believe that tweet I think that needs to be clarified does she still love Bill Clinton so much for being one of the main people in the me too how can she even be a part of that and still support a rapist\nI uh I wanted to ask you a little bit about yourself too I noticed on your pages says that you're a business owner your speaker you're an inventor or a mother and a grandmother or on our program we deal with business innovators and I wanted to ask you some of the things you would say inventor what did you [laughter]\nWell my son was very small I invented a chow travel try and I I guess mainly designed for him\nAnd it was just prior to use but I went ahead and got a patent on it and then within the last I Would say six months I've had some interest in that uh and it it may prove to be you know a very useful item for people\nWow that's interesting we we we love inventions on this program we have people who are always ... doing new and exciting things and I just wanted to let you use you know share some of the things about your life

starting a new frequency of thought a new idea that challenge is what people thought was possible in the world of physics\nAnd eventually disrupt the apple cart completely opening up a whole new paradigm that's how science folks\nHas always progressed and joining me in this final segment he's just a rise in the flash doctor away paying you a top\nPhysicist and aerospace engineering he is here once again folks thank you for\nHaving me again yes and I couldn't be more excited because I'm the last\nShow at the end Jew dropped a bomb and we just acted like there was nothing and I was like wow we got to really unpack that a little bit more a nugget of truth\nWhich is earth shattering\nAnd that is you were suggesting maybe elements are not what we think not elements Iran gold ... uranium those are the elements that make up the physical world right and that's what our table over our our our chemistry a periodic table is made up of wow you're still\nCatch bass and yes I'm a ... what I just I was sad that is actually we can with a human a you know a creation we can create\nAndy elements of ... your numbers that right I'm earners we can create elements ourselves yes which is\nCalled the ... current theory\nNow when I go read my textbooks and I if I go pull up my college text but I don't think I'm going to see that anywhere in the book is it\nA no I'm the kind of theory talking about that and the elements heavier than I wrong\nSo that's the uh you know we can see the as the heaviest elements available okay making ... in the solar system\nBut if they found out when so oh I ... you know the old you know own heavier the gold that you know or or or even lack of them had them all the heavy precious metal\nSo then they have to make you what at a supernova so the the the the reason we we were at the end the kinds of theories that in order to make a heavy elements basically we say make a nucleus which proton or neutral right so like a charge the protons\nFeels to them to gather require high energy okay so anything heavier were required even higher energy okay so then so to sort of something about that but\nWhen you're challenging the atomic model which throws that out the window but you're suggesting yes if Adam Adam's are made up as you've made a losing two earlier and other programs that\nAdams are made up of little magnets having both positive and negative charge each particle right yes then that changes how elements can be constructed\nThis going to be it's fundamentally change the car and if you think about the kind of theory a macroscopic theory that's a quantum mechanics the whole theory beauty the own try to solve the problem is that how could that like a charge of the particle protons\nOr even a neutron neutral how could the fuse together become heavier elements\nHow with the likes charging a supposed to repel together all the theories of someone from the from the other based on solving the mystery\nOf what I find is there is no such Potter called a purely\nPositive or purely neck of charged particles in the universe so every particle has both positive and negative like a little magnet that's all right every particle actually has a both positive and negative so that means you know the few of them together you don't need that extra for higher than\nA map you electromagnetic repulsion but did you get just after the rights condition\nSo what this means folks is absolutely earth shattering if I'm hearing you correctly\nWe if we use the right road map of physics and we get the right map of what we're looking at like we should be able to take ordinary elements\nIn under the right conditions maybe heat them up break them apart and recon figure them into more rare earth elements yes so we can create the resource use ... wow that would be earth shattering and what it could do for technology\nBefore the world for the planet I mean think about the trillions of dollars\nAre that are expanded trying to mind these rare earth minerals in these conflicts sites all over the globe conflicts sites like an African in the middle east where people are fighting like tooth and nail over these rare earth deposits and if you're suggesting that if we have the right science\nWe might not need the rare earth deposit when I have to use those we could actually make them\nWe can solve this resource Pearl by my notes to waltz war or violence can solve so we're talking about\nRight that is amazing so yeah I remember that I remember reading in the History Channel how Isaac Newton sir Isaac Newton\nActually was trying to turn lead into gold ... and it sounds like maybe he didn't know exactly what he was doing but maybe he was on to something in the rye general direction that it's possible to take an ordinary element\nAnd take it into a a rare earth elements now that is a whole earth shattering paradigm that needs to be on pack so just give us another nugget here of how to wrap our minds around this going forward\nI'm so there's been several a different type of research you know us call ... ... ... patients that that's basically the forming heavier elements use a common material so lots of other and then there's some results but the problem is a\nDifficult to repeat because at that level so what I suggest that is\nNumber one when the heat to to to to make a melting point of course you're the hierarchy the melting and then but just temperature itself not enough\nFor we have a right you are ... electromagnetic environment and the white vibration wow we can break up at him and the phone but the new we saw the ... few sheep on new adamant\nWow so this is amazing folks it's all about vibration it's all about those good vibrations and getting the residents of all these particles on line and the right way and we can create elements weaken saw sir Isaac Newton's dream we can make that a reality in our lifetime folks that has\nHuge potential and you didn't need groupthink to see that you see that's what we can do if we think for ourselves and go and explore these new ideas that we can heal our country and the world with it you've been listening to a neighbor's choice will see you next week\nTuesday

if if one of these guys what\nIs the guidelines for the income what percentage\nWill we tell folks and after you is to not take anything more than a force of your take home pay right gotcha home how can they survive but more than that yeah they can survive it more than that and again I Want to hear the story around the income you know they just started the job and you know might be their incomes going to be going up dramatically in the next two years away and so\nI have I have that they're protective tenants on\nThe on the low end I have a sixty five hundred dollar per month verified income and then I have on the high end ... uh twelve thousand wow I'm terrified income and um\nSo I Am kind of leaning towards that the higher income with no pets yeah versus the the the lower income just

[noise]\nWelcome back to the smart money show with HBO I news radio Ninety three point one W. F. L. A. [noise]\nSo Harry I was just going to say that you kind of a relieved today I think it has something to do with like a big ah a weight has been lifted off your shoulders and I guess why because the last week you were talking about the new house and there was some issues with it\nYeah we had a a an issue with the well is contaminated water apparently so even when you're talking about a year or ... yeah it wasn't fun so I didn't have water for the weekend so there's that [laughter]\nYeah survivor you're gay I I did I I just took for granted city water before because you know they they type it in and you you know unlike ... obviously but a Orlando's safe water that you can drink and a this was a well but you'd think in theory would be\nUm healthier and safer and taking from the aquifer and all that good so you're in theory no no you have all kinds of metals but then you can have some bacteria and so we had to have a new um pump put in and had to have it shocked\nWith some pouring and uh and you know but we're able to get the water back on into the pressure is a little better so like Oscar life is good it's one of those things you just take it for granted and like your health and when you don't have it that's when you get really miss it but yeah I mean you were still able to like take a shower I I haven't showered in a way [laughter]\nI thought I noticed that when I Want to\nDo whatever I always I always showering at the gym quite a bit so that was it was all good it was only ... did you have to do they really did I oh wow I stop well it it was you know near the house in College Park and I and I uh I shout at the gym and then that's an option that the office so yeah it's good\nI'm Glad I'm Glad you're able to shower not smell bad when you yeah walked in I I appreciate that word what ... was then but that's okay\n[laughter] All right anyway [laughter]\nI'm back to financial planning I guess I'm One of the things I'd like to talk about as we closed the show is maybe just\nUm the complimentary financial retirement snapshot basically when you come to work with us if you want to take a look at you know where you are if you're on track for retirement there's a lot of different software out there to kind of accomplish that and um what we do in a complimentary\nOf basic financial plan is taking 'em all the money that you've got and contributions to retirement plan and\nRole that forward to a retirement age say sixty five or sixty six\nAnd eight assumes that you're going to need about Seventy percent of what you make now so if you make a hundred thousand dollars basically there's an assumption that you wouldn't have mortgages and payroll taxes and contribution to retirement plans so around Seventy percent of what you make is what you'd need to roll that forward in today's dollars into the future\nAnd then using some um software called Monte Carlo that it basically\nTakes all the past performances which is not indicative of future result my\nPast performance of sectors large cap small cap international all that good stuff and then rose at forward with the investments you've got and the contribution to that you're going to make\nAnd see that at age sixty six is that going to be a bucket of money to dry out that in my example Seventy grand in future dollars 'til the day that you die so and you said this is complementary it is if you want to take a look at hey where am I Am I on track\nThat the the results from that kind of vets out hey well you could increase dramatically the probability of reaching your goals if you just did a five hundred dollar a month rough contribution you know into the market and ... and that what does that do to change the outcome and so\nThat's something you want to take a look at you know I Know one of the words I or phrases I like to use is funded in forget it and that's important to do in terms of retirement plans for one K. IRAs funded and forget it in terms of just getting used to making that contribution\nBut you want to look at it at least once a year to kind of make sure that your diversified again no segments nearly without using your favorite word for word of the day and uh and and then make sure that it's going to um um meet your goals and and so the important thing is just to get it to to\nTime in the market not timing the market is kind of an important thing to to keep in mind and so the the complimentary financial snapshot is kind of a a tool that we can use for anyone to help them see if they're on target\nAll right and so if somebody wants to do that how can they do yeah car office at four O. seven eight nine five twenty four thirty eight and we can take a look at that and see if you're on

had a whole semester just about the crumbling of the Weimar Republic\nAnd athletic [laughter] about flash of that stuff really I've never been like when are we going to this day I I my words [laughter] I should have no [laughter]\nSo ah so what do you how do you attack had the attacker problem like it's just 'cause poverty is a there there's a lot of it um it's it's like a a a lot of the population or is that the poverty line or or you know a hundred and fifty percent of the poverty line which is a which is something in the range of ten thousand dollars a year if you're a single person on our our our ... our guest will\nBe able to um site these numbers more I'm more precisely but yeah I think that's the best in the neighborhood and\nUh of the the poverty line and and what what the what our research department came up with these ten solutions to cut poverty all of them are great idea but it's a ... but they're very complicated when you know the first one is create jobs well duh\nYou know that a lot I got to boil the shot yeah great well okay\nBut here's the problem uh our our unemployment rate right now is a three point nine I\nCan't even remember what the figures but it's the lowest it's been in you know Thirty years or something um and we still have\nA significant portion of our population in poverty and um even the working people and and there are a lot of working poor are stripped that's actually a term um and so creating jobs is not necessarily um a a universal St Louis\nYeah well and it's challenging when if you work a minimum wage job\nUh in order to ah support a family of\nFour you have to work I think it's something like a hundred hours a week my dad was a hundred and two hours at a at a minimum wage job which 'cause minimum wage currently I think it's seven twenty five I'm you know what it was when I got my first job or thirty five an hour is that right when I work being done when I was working at McDonald's or thirty five an hour and I just felt like I was living on\n[laughter] [laughter]\nWhere your expenses were kind of taking care of literally where thanks for that by the\nIsraeli you're you're very well let me spent all my money on just a I remember being really proud that I could buy toothpicks I don't know why I'm going to move you had to be you know when you're in high school you're going to have to but yeah you gotta have like a kind of hanging in like a thing you know to uh you know since I didn't I should have gotten a lasso done working memory you go to\nThis school the chicken coops guy who's\nWatching a farmhouse and then do something last tricks [laughter] okay so let me give you the ash and we've only got wind that grab yeah we have like two minute I Know I Know and and and we're still we're still trying to cure property yeah to the next one is this is a very popular\nAnd raise the minimum wage okay good idea ... complicated issue yeah because if you go to a certain level again are Caped Crusader a guest can tell us this that if you simply give someone raise somebody's salary level\nThen they start to lose benefits um that were important to keep them employed for example childcare so if you if you give somebody Fifteen dollars an hour but they lose their child care there goes the race so it's just a little bit more complicated than this just give her but more money\nYeah and uh and and then there was yeah you're right 'cause I mean some of those benefits I remember working in clinics where the clinic was a it was it was a a charitable clinics where doctors would volunteer their hours\nOr but it was specifically designed for people that were slightly to wealthy to class of news will be able to be on on Medicaid right and they were in this gap between the two and that's and that's a that's a tough place to be\nA and then uh there were some other ones are expanding Medicaid and I'm having a schedule that work act was one of those where you'd have to have schedules known two weeks in advance and you couldn't be punished for asking for time off and all that stuff\nUm but basically it was trying to figure out how do we how do we get more people employed making more money doing that and then uh doing effective job of having the government take care of people that can't do that for one reason or another I\nUm and ah just like boiling the ocean you know that's the solution and so ah but luckily today with us we have somebody who uh is\nUh who knows how to boil the ocean [laughter]\nAnd and what to do in the meantime the executives got to\nBe a slow boil executive director

I have two uncles or both of my mom's brothers and their first name is are just the letter are you are the number here it or anything yeah those are the are they both are named or\nSo anyway the good are you married [laughter] yeah that's right or or um they could have taken her name so um we are\nTalking to you about uh the the the overall approach a two to fixing homelessness the goal um that everybody would like even people that are that don't have a a necessarily a a you know with the recall of bleeding heart for this uh they\nUh it would benefit society tremendously for homelessness to no longer exist\nAnd this housing first idea is something that um I've heard about a couple of times mostly because I hang out with this guy with my dad um can you can really boring family goes we [laughter] we got there we talk about football [laughter] so what what's the idea with housing first ... uh in in fixing it\nSo I asked the name would suggest it really is about putting people in housing is the first uh therapeutic interventions that that is the most helpful thing that you can do for somebody just to get them off the streets in into housing\nAnd what a ... including with these kind of long term homeless population and people who are on the streets who have disabilities and that's been the most challenging group for communities for many many years\nUm I Know it's I Know it's a passion for the community because nobody wants nobody wants to live in a community where you say gosh if you have a disability we'll let you sleep outside now nobody feels good about that um and so what uh again with the research taught us was that\nI'm preparing people to move into housing with not near as effective as just went ahead and putting them in housing and then the you know how to keep them there and that's the ... in a nutshell that's at the housing first premise is\nAnd what's fascinating about it is that is also less expensive for the community than other interventions um\nWhat we know about a particularly a\n... it's a small subset of the homeless population that are the disabled long term homeless which we call the chronic homeless population a it's a small subset but they are incredibly expensive on the public dollar because they spend a lot of time going in and out of jails and going in and out of hospitals and detox\nAnd going in and trying to get some help and then being discharged back to the streets which is not a good therapeutic or finale yeah so uh by putting falls into housing not only are we improving their quality of life\nBut we're saving dollars so we're actually spending a little bit less money and getting a much better outcome which is good for the individual and good for our communities and good for the public per se\nIt's like how often do we have a social evil where we actually know the solution and it cost effective yeah and people effect if that doesn't happen very often and right now we're hearing a sweet spot it\nReally is so so what's harder then is it harder to find a money or houses is it her yeah\n[laughter] you're right there on that more no food [laughter]\nWe uh we need both but this is um resources make a big difference and um\nWhere where in at the critical place right now and trying to identify some resources we have to find resources for both sides to pay for the housing but also to pay for those services because it doesn't work with housing alone\nIt's not housing alone it's housing first housing first and wraparound services\nBut in this community we also as I'm sure everybody out their nose or it's certainly anybody who's been looking for a rental unit for themselves or for their child you know somebody getting out of college or whatever the um the rental market here is really tight and we have one of the most\nDifficult markets actually in the country I'm\nA recent a survey of the hundred largest uh metropolitan areas we came in Second Life from the bottom in terms of challenging rental markets for extremely low income\nHouseholds so for every one hundred of those extremely low income households we only have Seventeen units so that means there's\nThree out of a hundred that there's not a unit there that they can afford\nAnd so we certainly have our challenges and finding units to put folks and um as well as in Spain for those ... and paying for their services\nUm but we still we move forward we're making it happened and will continue to move forward with it because it's the right thing to do for the for the folks who were working with and it's the right thing to do for the community and it's right thing to do for the tax payer\nSo when you guys get together and talk about this because you know pop you are on the ... the director or whatever that was of the of the commission on homelessness a term for what was the German the um when you guys talk through this stuff or if you were just to let a new ... like me\nAn outsider who doesn't know very much about it to kind of like a peak behind the curtain\nUm is is the stuff that we are talking about you know mostly focused on these how do we get more dollars in to do this or that or is it\nIs there something of a that's different people come in and bring different gifts of like you know this guy's the housing guy and he knows this stuff and I'm ... the collaborative effort to it what what what part of it ah what what do you gain from the collaborative effort of having people from different you know for instance I mean you're you're from the church community you know as as we brought you there\nUm is it is it just to try to come up with different solutions or is it tried to implement solutions that we already know or how's that work\nAnd you said pop earlier\nBut I don't like it they can't see that I was there to do that [laughter] I forgot about starting to yes oh\nYeah well let me let me started and then and then quickly uh Martha you chime in because you know there's so much better than I Do I'm Still\nVery much in a mature here uh but I think what we've tried to do in the last couple of years [noise] is we've tried to um\nTo coordinate 'em what each of us can do can do will return to define the liens that we swim in so to speak um and so um we knew that where's the the solution is fairly simple\nUm the different subsets of the population in what each of us can do\nTo be a part of the remedy um is very different as you mentioned at the beginning Joel my", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "03"}
