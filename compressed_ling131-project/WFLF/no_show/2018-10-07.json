pound five to nine on your cell phone on law that's all\nWFL I find holes were Linda once he got paid three months or Orlando news radio nutty free point one WFL a and I heard a radio station [noise]\nA deadly limo ride in upstate New York I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News authorities saying the limo ran a stop sign before crashing into a car and pedestrians in a crowded parking lot all Eighteen people and the limo and to pedestrians were killed\nI have investigated them I have taken witness testimony I've taken victim testimony and statements I've collected forensic evidence everything from a cast of tire prince foot prints fingerprints\nThis was you know ... ...\nNot quite forty years ago but we we didn't have the DNA capabilities we do now but every kind of forensic evidence and witnesses an statements um ... participated in depositions\nWent to trial a set and the witness box as the arresting officer gave testimony worked with state's attorney's office so I just want your audience to know what I'm getting ready to say next comes out of me watching that entire\nHearing Senate hearing with Ford in capital and relating back to my law enforcement experience and all the day that hearing was completed and the next day that day and the next day I did I don't know four or five my memory serves me best\nUm interviews several of them were a nationally syndicated\nAnd people were wanting to know the host was wanting to know my opinion et cetera and on a couple of them I'm getting ready to give you the opinion I gave way back then I mean on the day off a couple of them you could tell the host for a little tight chested about what I was saying because it wasn't necessarily the politically correct thing\nBut I was gracious you know I never come on somebody show when cyber sabotage show but I but I said you know look this is my opinion it to this\nNow the opinion of the host or the or the station necessarily but based on all my years in law enforcement and me directly working in the same kinds of things let me tell you what I think and this is what I said back then I said back then at the end of it all I said here's the deal here's the bottom line\nEither she is lying or he as lying but it can't be both ways that was the day of and I said here's why I said it's not that she's possibly mistaken because she was asked that very clearly\nAnd she swore under oath I Am not mistaken fact she said I Am one hundred percent and those this quote comes right out of a CNN report of the hearing so I'm not making this up she said I Am one hundred percent certain that was Brett Kavanaugh\nSo when you get down to that\n... wrote the book it's it's ... either she is lying or he is why now at the end of the hearings that day based upon everything body language her answers his answers body language\nWho had the preponderance of any kind of hard evidence nobody really had hard evidence but who had the preponderance of anything that even came close to simulate in any kind of evidence and hard evidence and cooperation of witnesses and testimony it all fell to Brett Kavanaugh it just did\nAnd and I and I was very clear I wanted the truth I mean if it turned out and it still to this day if it turns out Brett Kavanaugh actually did it if he has a breakdown in confesses it\nAnd then I Want the full weight of the rule of law to come on him I mean I I I'm I'm not being partisan in this I'm just looking at this as a man that wants to rule of law constitutional republic I'm honored and the truth obtained as best as we can obtain that with God's help\nAnd at the end of that day I said\nEither she's lying or he's lying and as it stands right now I've got to say she's lie on and I told my audiences when I was speaking as I could be wrong and that turns out I'm wrong\nI Will come back on the air I Will put it in print I Will say in speech you can record it I Will apologize I Will admit I was wrong but I said I don't think I'm going to have to do that\nAnd I think he's going to be confirmed because\nShe can't get witnesses to to testify on her behalf the ones that she named some of them went back and said well no that's not really what happened she couldn't remember as you with in your opening monologue a John Butler said\nYou you you you said that you know all she got all these things she couldn't remember the place or how she got there how she got home or who I was there but she knew one hundred percent of it was Brett Kavanaugh\nWell that just I'm telling you an accusation is not evidence okay and in my years of investigating sex crimes I always here's here's the these words are important brother their constitutional and law enforcement and jurisprudence words I always deferred to\nThe alleged victim in other words I Will believe them okay you're coming to me you can you tell me you you're the victim of a sexual crime OK I'm starting at square one by believing you\nNow give me your story and in your story give me some ways that I can verify your story and give me some evidence if you can and nowadays there's all kinds of ways of doing that but again this came from forty years ago so\nSo give me cooperation All right but I Will do for her to the victims I I I don't look at a a victim and say oh now you're lying ... just because the the accusations are against a very important man of course not but I owe so\nI also presumes ... the innocence of the victim until they are proven guilty presume that doesn't mean not declare them innocent\nIt doesn't even mean in my mind I think they're innocent but I have to legally presume that they are and that somebody could be lying or there could be some mistake in the investigation until we can prove beyond a shadow of it out so\nIn all of watching all of this that was my conclusion she's lying and I said I said it on day one\nAnd boy it made some people uncomfortable because that was not the politically correct thing to say but it was the legal list stick the legal jurisprudence thing to say by looking at everything as a matter of fact ms Rachel Mitchell\nWho's a former prosecutor sex crimes expert\nAnd somebody who is you know very very sympathetic to people who are victims of sex crimes she was the one that did the questioning that day and at the end of the day\nUSA Today and the Washington Post who did her as saying\nIf I were still a prosecuting attorney\nI Would not even bring charges against Brett Kavanaugh based upon what I heard today boom that agreed with exactly\nWhat I said by watching it and being a former law enforcement officer having investigated those things I said the same thing before she was even quoted in the in in in these ah these liberal outlets\nSo you know so now as it comes out they called for an investigation I thought that it was awfully ironic and justice was served that the leftist were the ones demanding an FBI investigation\nAnd when the FBI returned their findings here was the conclusion of the executive summary\nOf that finding\nIt says ah but I mean okay here's the last paragraph here's what it says quote\nThe supplemental background investigation confirms what the Senate Judiciary committee concluded after its investigation to wit there is no corroboration of the allegations made by Dr Ford or miss Ramirez now\nRather book here's what that translates to FBI okay here's what that translates to we think she's lying\n[laughter] I mean no no ... collaboration now listen they would not use the word lying I'm you know\nAnd they were trying to be politically correct monitors a liar\nThat's right that's right but the bottom line is if I accused you right here on the radio and of course I Will not brother so hold your breath the whole Deborah but if I used to have some horrendous crime\nBut all the world on your radio station right now and it was shocking and people said oh my gosh and I sat there and started crying I promise you I Know what I'm Talking about I Know\nAnd people were being believing me and the next thing you know you're just in a mess\nAnd the next thing you know it goes to an investigation that goes to some kinds of or some kind of action a trial or depositions or whatever and and and you're just in a mess because I've just put on a convincing accusation but at\nOf it all the person who does the depositions the person who does the questioning the former prosecutor the the expert in crime the FBI who investigates it all comes back and says\nWe don't find any cooperation of what Carl Gallup said about John Butler book\nWhat brother that means it's a done deal John ... butler book has to be presumed innocent in America maybe in China no maybe on North Korea no maybe in the fifty seven Muslim nations of the world know but in America\nIf the FBI investigates if the prosecutors investigate if the depositions come back and there's no corroborating evidence we have to assume that either one of two things is true about Carl gallons\nEither I lied\nOr it might have happened\nBut I just I didn't present any kind of real evidence to give any prosecutor the ability to do anything with it so that goes to John Butler book but that that's what happened here and I want your audience to know I don't care if five years from now we find out Kavanaugh did do it\nYou had the guts and I'm not talking about the president I'm Talking about the attorney general Jeff Sessions he seems to be paralyzed to do anything to protect our country against those are taking the law into their own hands and I don't know maybe my guess didn't agree with me on that but it sure seems evident to me\nThat I think they need to put Jeff Sessions face on the side of a milk carton because I think he's missing\nYes sir good analogy\nYeah and you know done Donny and and and and brother book what you just said about her coaching a well being coached on the lie detector not only that but what makes it all worse everything you said is true but what makes what you said even worse\nIs that during the Senate hearings I watched it they asked her all of those questions you said but they also asked her [noise] have you ever helped coach anyone else in taking lie detector tests and then\nI have never done that she said it two or three times\nAnd then right after the Senate hearings were over its surface that her ex boyfriend said I was present while she was coaching people\nA particular person who was going to take an FBI lie detector test it worked for the FBI I was there when she was coaching her on how to pass it so she lied and hide and lied and lied apparently is what it looks like and I agree with you Donnie\nThere has to be follow up investigation on this if they just walk away from it and now\nThey're handing the leftist more and more weapons to continue to do this like those guys here's what was going to happen they did it with judge Roy Moore it worked they did it with Brett Kavanaugh it all most worked\nAnd what they were hoping is if it worked with Kavanaugh then there was a one hundred percent chance in twenty twenty\nThere we're going to drag out thirty women against Donald Trump and whoever else might run from the Republican Party they were going to use it again these were test cases to take back this nation they lost the Senate they lost the house they lost the White House and they lost thirty governors offices across this land and now they're losing the Supreme Court\nThey're going out of their minds they're playing for keeps they will pull out all the stops and they will lie lie lie and they will use the fake news to back up their line\nYou know something Donny and you know something ... if the truth be known sub would rather have a communist as a president and five good members of the Supreme Court if I had to live with the the one because the Supreme Court in reverse everything the president does it's unconstitutional [noise]\nYeah I don't want to communist in the presidency but that will tell the people why this election was so vital and Monday appointment of this man was so vital they know if they have a five to four decision and for years they've had a five to four decision on the\nSide of the modern and the liberals if that changes there are a lot of things that have been passed it can be reversed once challenged in court and it's not just roe versus Wade there are many things as socialistic programs which are bankrupt in this country which run constitution to begin with\nAnd they're scared to death of that and I do hope you know there's no reason to have a watchdog the watchdog nothing to do anything but wagging its tail and growl when somebody breaks into your house it's good to somebody can say the watchdog to go hand in my books\nAnd shoot it up for me and told his stomach because he was hungry that man will think twice before going on property that is not his word says no trespassing watchdog is here\nOur watchdog has become toothless that is the attorney general\nYeah no I agree I\nI Know I have listened to all kinds of analyses on that the people are are saying you know Well Jeff knows what he's doing he's laying low he's getting ready to come out full bore\nI don't think that's true I I just I just there's been so many opportunities to drain the swamp and turn this thing around and bring some justice to this land and the last two years and Jeff Sessions is nowhere to be found in Donald Trump is constantly talking about it publicly\nUnless they've got some grand master plan and they are master master chess players and they're just faking head faking the entire left and I hope that's the case because I used to kind of like Jeff Sessions before Trump appointed him as the OJ\nBut I'm unless that's the case I think Jeff Sessions has been compromised I think he's either a part of the deep state and was a play actor or he's genuinely a conservative but he's been compromised\nGovernment than on him he did not back Roy Moore and I said\nWhat you said as soon as this thing was going on Roy Moore I'm On talk shows I said this is that if this works they're going to use it against anybody they don't want an office yep\nAnd they did it with Brett Kavanaugh right behind\nYour exactly and they tried to do it with the president came out in the women that they said we're accusing the president would step in the planes and none of that is true yes but if this becomes the rule\nThen our country is in deep trouble yeah and we will never be able to win an election with a genuine conservative individual it just is simply gone out these\nYeah that's why these midterms are so important because I think it's got the base of the conservatives hopefully the Christian evangelical conservatives as well fired up I've preached on all this this morning right out of the scriptures and right out of what's been happening right from my ... this morning [noise]\nAnd uh I mean everybody was just you know I met I mean there's hundreds of people that are brother they were they were pumped and fired up and I'm telling you [noise]\nUm if if these midterms are important because if we don't pull this out and I'm not saying the Republican Party is our savior there are deep state people within our by their name there are traders with ours by their names I'm saying if we don't get people in office\nThat will continue on a conservative and I'm going to say godly and biblical path\nA ... then we're in trouble because the left is they are showing us what America will look like if they ever gain power again\nThe accuser all you have to do is make an accusation and you're guilty it's up to you to prove you're innocent excuse me that's China that's North Korea that's that's fifty seven Muslim nations that's not a constitutional republic the United states of America\nBut they don't care about our borders our constitution our military our security our economy our health care system they want to ruin us they want to destroy anybody that gets in there why\nThey will use the fake news in a packed liberal court and compromised public officers including Congress to destroy the rest of us that's what the plan is brother and I'm told my church this morning\nJesus himself said if you're don't if you don't get out there and be the salt then the salt loses its salt in us and you will be trampled underfoot so the choice is ours\nNo question about it I I I I firmly believe what you're saying is to be this is true Carl or I Want to see how much I appreciate a Donny he uh sent me some good
