big one over in Jacksonville, Florida Georgia is always ... and we've got plenty to talk about so let's get right to elect out in the crowd hey Alexa\nCan hear the same kind of\nCourse they are going to vote on both sides of the ball [noise]\nYeah they're well they're an excellent football team I got a lot of depth a lot of talent across the board just about every position you know I mean if you look at 'em off and so they got a five starters on either for stars back on the offensive line very veteran group [noise]\nReally talented running backs that got you know the two quarterbacks they can play and I got some great wide receivers uh and I think you know a guy was the top tight end and are courting coming out defensively a\nVery good defense a lot of speed front to back up and then ... teams are really solved there I mean there there's a reason we're there one of the best teams in the country they got they got depth and and quality players\nThe position [noise]\nSay one thing we don't dogs Saturday okay there's time my [laughter]\nI'm going to go back to uh to have time in in Nashville who has what you guys are down and getting to talk to a lot of the guys at the game they were they were called they were in control they failed everything was going to be fine so from from a mentality standpoint like what we're talking about before I Do think they handled being being down and then that stuck in a\nWay to handle the robot though it was great majority of our coaches the coaches never flinched players just get sick and I think you know part of it is you're looking at how the game's going in a\nIn a we're moving the ball on off and she wouldn't take the fall right down the field throw interceptions you know I mean we we turn it over a couple of times we kick it around go backwards only time I was concerned\nIs the point we were going to draw fleet they fumble at least start kicking the ball all the way down the sidelines and the ball is about to roll out of bounds and somehow spins around and stays in balance and I fought and I'm you know one of those days you look at like\nMaybe it's just not your day to day you know what I mean like when you see that happen\nAnd look at every plant like ... the balls really I think that's like the ball's going out of bounds and then the laws of physics and fun and came back in about like boy and uh but you know what a what we got to do is we're we're playing decent defence we just were\nWere given up exposed to place we're turning the ball over doing all the things you can't do to win a football game [noise]\nBut we were doing a lot of things other things really well\nSo you know as the coaching staff we just stuck with it just talking about the guy you know hey just well we need to do is stick with it on a fence keep executed gotta finish and score touchdowns we're getting a red zone can't turn up all over defensively all we got to do is create a couple of stops here and there will be right back in the game\nYou guys did that and the second half I just thought we'd just cleaned everything up there was no panic nobody out of control they just clean everything up everybody did their job and and we won the game so many you put up over five hundred yards of all fenced in doing so yeah so I said it wasn't like you know I mean when you're looking at the game it wasn't like oh we're we're in work\nThere just crushing us in every aspect of the game we were just doing up you know they were ... they were\nThey were following the plan to win that we you know you know it's like hey these are the things you want to do to win again they were kind of following some of that and we definitely weren't but they weren't stopping us you know it was as we were kind of hurting ourselves and um [noise] with facts that second hand is I'm hurting ourselves\nCertainly didn't and I think you knew going into this year what what type of running backs you have back there and those guys continue to do some really good things and we scarlet runs heart attack and there'll be runs doing his thing and good guys back\nThere as you know and that they there are a little different combination you know I mean and they both they both have speed they both have physicality but they both get things a little bit differently um you know and that's what makes it um\nYou know ... and ... it's not like a different place got the same place so uh you know but they run each play a little bit differently ... back out to the crowd with a kid Alexa\nSee he's got a\nGreat question for us on\nHigh [laughter] okay so I called them do just that in our staff okay and I think it would do that with George at that point a turnover which was thirty one\nThen I called up our phone last night last\nHow do we make sure one way to limit\nThe law so they don't capitalize\nYeah that's a huge number and they've been very you know if you look at some of their games uh [noise]\nYou know I think I think they said the majority by was funded by Thirteen it ended up being do double digits and they got Seventeen points out the turnover that's how they won the game that last week\nOr their last game they were minus four turnover ratio against LSU so I mean a turnover ratio such an indicator and how the game's going to play out\nAh you know I mean if if you turn the ball over or you're if you're if you're on the minus on the turnover ratio it's gotta be hard to win I mean if you look at us against Vanderbilt all the things you can say look it's statistically you cover up the turnover category we dominated the game\nSo we're monastery turnover and that's why the game was the way it was if it wasn't that way\nUm you know we probably you know we went by a couple of ... uh you know but now you you go look at look at George against LSU\nLet's take away the four turnovers [noise]\nYou know and I'm like oh that was a big win you know ... probably not look it up against Tennessee you take away all our point chocolate turnovers you know it's a seven point game is right down to the wire she'll turnovers are such a key factor in the game so um you know I mean if if there is a big\nDifferential and turnover ratio whoever has that is going to win the game [noise] how much\nDoes the uh the by week now factor into all this from a from a coaching standpoint being able to have the time to look at film I Know you still want to be a dad and his family and stuff like that but you do have some time to be able to analyze and different what what are you looking out the most\nI think you you do a lot you you want you you spend much time on yourself and you know we do a lot of self scouting on by weight what have we done what we've done well what have we done poorly\nWhat shorter than we have any major tendencies all of that stuff\nAnd yeah but I'm sure you got a little extra time to prepare for your opponent you know so uh you can really you know dig into it but but you know one of the thing the league does because I Know this is you know it was a big game as we both have to buy at the same time so it's not like one team is has really has any time vantage in the game over the other side\nWe got to get another break will knock out will come back we'll continue live from the deep end kitchen\nIt's WC a skater talk of the gators I envy sports network gator\nNation this football season it's

Tibet because if\nAs the red Sox fan in the back of your mind [noise] they can always snatch defeat from the jaws of victory right I mean I grew up with that\nAnd uh and you don't want to see that if they do when I went to sleep right sound like I'm going to be competent they're going to wait and I'll check it in the morning then I got up poor too soon as I got up or do back go to sleep [noise]\nBut I did appreciate why we live in Florida yeah yeah there's that looked up there and I looked at everybody in the stands and they didn't well\nDressed the way that everybody here look stressed right now so the\nPlayers are wearing those things around their neck so they'll pull all that and\nIt looked like us to get warm ups of Vanderbilt and your thought we were playing in Green Bay I did see a couple of guys though they were they were pretty macho they threw their shot off it was the only one K. and everybody else had hats and they had the masks on and I mean I'm like oh my gosh for for fifty yeah\nBy a bullet going up as a Pepsi for together dot com questions\nYeah All right uh Donald on live oak hum a Pepsi Florida Gators dot com question wants to know how difficult it is to prepare for multiple quarterbacks\nWell the thing is one thing is if they're running the same stuff [noise] you know you just gotta look at the strengths and weaknesses of a guy but a lot of times seems packages\nFor each quarterback and sometimes that makes it simpler because you know okay this guy runs the place this guy runs this place and you can really defined by who's on the field what place they're going to run so you know I [noise]\nNot that ... it's it's not a huge challenge for you you just got to understand the different skill sets that they have a wide people why they're putting them in the game and how you have to play against that so I mean it it is I don't know it's difficult it's just something you have to prepare\nBecause it's a by we I don't know if it's a big chess match sure what's going on between coaches but they feel visiting there in a majority of the time he's running the ball not throwing a lot do they now think OK well damn Mullen's watching as he knows when fields in the game and he's going to run and so now we're gonna throw feels a lot more to you is that yeah that ...\nThat because it's by weaken field has been in there and run and they know we run so they think we're going to prepare for him to throw the because they're going to prepare for him to throw we're going to come back and run it again I Know I should add the chess match that is what it is and\nYou ought to be honest with you you just got to go in there you got to ask you get around your office you gotta run your defense you've got to be sound you know each team will\nProbably come out I mean usually awful by like everybody has a new wrinkle or to within their you know I mean they always do and uh you know you just got to be sound and and try to execute what you do well and and you know ... you're blocking skiing or your defense against what they're doing to back out to the crowd or elected\nSorry I\nSaid yeah I'm excited I were really excited fired up to go up there a set of such a fun environment you know one of the cool things that people don't get a job I was used to enjoy [noise] you know when we lead to Gainesville friday afternoon for the drive up\nAnd you know you you go back to Jacksonville and I mean there's people come out and cheer on the side of the road for the bus as they go by in every town that you go through you know when you're gone through stark and they are going through Waldo and they're all cheer and\nIt's really cold deal to see people come out and cheer for the team as you're driving by going up to the game [noise]\nProsaic thank you and to sort of comes in in porch or another poor gators I come here to question yet cautioned winter garden would you rather play George as a home and home or keep the neutral site [noise]\nWhat would you prefer [noise]\nThere's some\nSome toss up I could make an argument I don't know that I Want it to be a home and home only because the experience in Jacksonville so cool\nI mean you just go [noise]\nYou know home and home to in Jacksonville home and home until the ... or something of that nature possibly but uh [noise]\nI mean I was a [noise] the game's\nPlayed on a ledge keep changing stadium names but the games and the gator bowl you know I mean I I got no problem stay in a playoff game of the gator bowl were at home or in Florida it's in our state so I view it as a home games I'm not I'm great keeping it right\nWhere it is [laughter] in every game the rest of the way it's kinda kinda yeah when you look at it the only the state right yeah the regular season you know I mean obviously every hoping at some point we leave the state or an early December or you know\nAnd [noise] um [noise] but uh but\nFor the regular season we don't leave the state of Florida which is a which is pretty pretty pretty big deal for us right and you know I mean uh uh as I said though it's it is tough you know because after this year we go back to three straight home games get it I don't always love the three straight home and I mean I just I Love on gap I play [noise]\nI'm I'm I'd be great for like twelve straight home games citizen um but uh you know I think for all of our fans sometimes you know because you saw the difference they made and the LSU game are fan base and how critical it is to have the swamp packed\nYou cynic scientists and sometimes the fans on the you know three consecutive weeks and you know because we ask a lot of uh you know three consecutive weeks like popping up the last two weeks I've been up the games are driven out by the traveled up I've made all the sacrifice to get up again it's hard to get up there three weeks in a row sometimes so [noise] uh [noise]\nWe'll take it I don't mind first and after a while I don't I don't need to play in Fenway next week no I'm a little after looking at what it looked like a match our guys up there and then they put like our guys were protests the gambling yeah\nWouldn't make it well speaking of uh getting up the a lot of opposing quarterbacks haven't been able to get up and get away from what you guys doing defensively that the line and then those rather someone from me and they've been special so far\nWe've done a good job you know we've got to continue to get more physical we've done a good job with athleticism and get people in third talents and Todd comes after you all different ways on third down um you know we still got to I still think we've got a ways to go where the you know they're gonna they're gonna be a physical game we gotta we gotta we still got a ways to be in physical on first and second now slow\nAnd and you know what Georgia law so those two running backs last year but you know do what they do and you know they may replace more they replaced\nSimply I'm pretty good wants to bill uh yeah yeah I got to be understood [laughter] they they can come after you yeah they got some they got some athleticism at the running back physician\nSo yeah and and that's where like how much do you look at last year's film or is it all just this year so is there anything from from last year because they look a little\nBit but you know at at this point you've played a bunch of games this year [noise] so to me is really all about this year because you know there there are different ... you know a little different personality and a half hour teams got its own personality side we spend a lot more on this year and there's\nProbably not really an instance no seven games into this thing really for anybody in the country where all of a sudden\nThere's somebody that hasn't contributed at all it's just going to go make a big impact so as you watch probably you're you know you know what they want to do you know who they want to get the ball to you know what I mean you you\nYou kinda learn your team and who you are a little bit of one of the season we got to get another rate will do that will come back continue with more right after this on WC aviator talk [noise]\nHey gators hindrance the world's number one selling tractor is giving you more for less get an email ... head agency for his lowest seven thousand nine hundred Ninety five dollars with my hindered they've been here limited power train warranty sore after cheering on the orange and blue head to your may hinder dealer and by red hit\nYou know I mean but the ... he was good because it you know it's like I'm and I'm like what you should be and I'm terrible to ... to do that [noise] um [noise] you know but it many [noise]\nHe's good I mean you gotta have some six game to play quarterback\n... you know I mean 'cause I mean you're getting it from every angle now does he get Brian on the headphones with him he got me on the headphones with them you know what I mean any good hit us teammates looking at them and so I mean you get it from every angle so you gotta you gotta have some some some top ... to play just mental toughest quarterback for show\nAnd it seems like the the guy is even you know halftime locker room afterwards like the they're they're all supportive of each other and I don't know they're the videos are out there everybody's saying in the fight song in a joint and having a good time you like to do right you you like them to enjoy what they're going through when that when they're having a good moment\nIt is the thing is we when is it the that's how you when you went as a team and that's what they got to understand that that's what they started to understand you know I mean hey you know [noise]\nWe we went we went over to to to to start to help them to six points one Thirteen to six [noise] right [noise] okay [noise]\nUm [noise] boy that was an all ... teams that off and even though we didn't put up the numbers of the points and all that still contributed you know but the defense really made the plays that needed to stop shut them down slammed the door did all of those things\nBan about maybe we put up we had over five whatever five hundred yards as a whole bunch of points but defense gave up some exposure plays gave us some points\nBut you know it's not all on that that certain of all over and put them into bad position sometimes and I think that guy's really bought into the whole team concept it's not about one side of the ball the other side about me it's about the whole team everybody\nHere you know when when your number's called you're ready to make a play and uh you know and and that's how we've been able to when\nWe talked about it with the gators are back in the slum for whole

where some more misinformation is Chris where's that most people don't realize\nYour Social Security is going to be taxed potentially\nA Yeah Yup just talk with somebody ah yesterday about that\nSo whenever you go to get it back out mhm they're actually potentially if you're on the rise thresholds on income they're going to tax you on it\nAnd it thresholds are low so most people the majority of people I Would say are are going to have their Social Security tax not only are all your\nOther tax deferred accounts tax as ordinary income but your Social Security can be tax too that it's just keep comment that just doesn't seem right to me right it but there is a solution if you have enough tax free income make a drop you below a threshold and boom you're so security is not taxed anymore\nI said at one more time helped me understand what you're saying\nIf you had tax free sources of income and your retirement tax free source of income tax free right they're going to look at that and they're going to see you don't maybe hit the threshold to get your Social Security taxes also you can potentially drop your Social Security down for being attacks\nAre Sawyer set of five enough tax free income coming in it's going to therefore lower my tax bracket and reportable income to the IRS and they're going to look and I said hey he's not here she's not meeting the threshold we're not

right so are all your accounts can be taxed when that goes up a lotta\nSuffered yeah I mean a lot of people's their retirement accounts are going to be taxed most likely at a higher rate than they ever anticipated they're they're just not thinking about it it's going to happen down the road so a lot of\nPeople are what are called rolling the dice ride the roller dies in the future on this tax deferred accounts when I go to use them into retirement uh-huh that the taxes are going to be lower\nRight yeah 'cause I was thinking that I was a logical that's basically it but what can they do what can they do a you know what can they develop Social Security being tax\nWhat can they do about taxes going up on them in the future and having to pay that actual higher tax burden kicking the can down the road rolling the dice that hey maybe hopefully taxes won't go up but we know they are what can what kind of everyday American do\nWell you can not reinvent the wheel or you can do something that you also well you've been doing for\nDecades right you can use the same strategies that they've been doing\nApplying them into your retirement craze some tax free and can we do it every single week

Amazon really really made it hard on a lot of people but uh I Will say\nThe massage\nChair I I was in one of those one time and it was like a good one\nIt's something really good out yeah it really it really does you know because uh one of the things that stress will do is is caused a kind of a a chronic\nA contraction ... an unwanted muscular tone in areas where it is not helpful and uh and so for instance you you don't need really really tight muscles on either side of your spine between your shoulder paid yet stress will be like that'll probably help will just\nAs tight and these bad boy it up and we're ready [laughter]\nOn the day [laughter] I just want to say you can't raise your arms above your head and weren't good\nBut but if you are there there really is a value to a to a massaging that stuff out because\nUh that one's actually science based you\nAre a kind of tone begets tone or you can have a areas of muscular spasm or wear a short of physically lengthening that muscle uh it's it's really hard to actually get it to relax down\nOr you're doing the same thing kind of if you get a cramped or to get a cramped in your calf the way that you fix that is you lift your toes up towards your knee you know you try to huh hum and what you're doing there is\nYour your body is built so that you cannot flex and or a muscle a ... an antagonist at the same time so your calf muscle and then that muscle that's on the front of your ... your interior to be Alice they're opposing muscle so if you're flexing your anterior to\nA ... forces your calf muscle to have to relax a massage has the same general idea behind it you're you're forcing that muscle to relax and then release out some of that or some of that tension\nSo so Brooke stone I'm mostly sold 'em stress relieving

condition that are pretty much everyone who will hear this or has suffered or is suffering and most likely is suffering you know it's it's it's so\n... and more and more I can say this general as Jen generationally I'm growing up in the fifties we did not have\nThe kind of rapid change in a salt on our senses that we have in today's society so we just we didn't have the same kind or the same amount of stress yeah\nThat makes sense ah ... yeah where it's just it's different for different\nGenerations and and now there's such a constant assault\nOn all of our senses all the time you know the the the constant trying to uh have everybody's attention all the time or in in in order to do that in order to get eyes on the news that you're showing your eyes on the app that you're trying to sell or you you have to induce some kind of emotional response and by far the easiest one to inducing people\nOr is stress you know it's outrageous way outrage sells these days so you were saying before that there's there are signs of ... in general the people or if they're wondering like where am I stress maybe I Am um there there are some signs of whether you are stressed or not\n... a research department thank you I'm Becky I'm\nCame up with a list nine weird things that happen to you if you've been stress for a week or more\nUm number one you crave rich foods\nNow I'm I'm probably stressed all my life because like rich foods all the time but a more than ordinary you crave rich foods number two you obsess over little details\nAgain for those of us who obsessive compulsive we got to do that anyhow uh but maybe more than ordinary number three I thought this was interesting you feel clumsy ... I never I never occurred to me\nA number for sex sounds less appealing\nI'm OK I'm\nNumber five you experienced bathroom issues [laughter] a number six you become which which really is a\nDirect corollary with number for a sec sounding\nLesson [laughter] sorry [laughter] [laughter] probably\nThat exactly she probably cleaned it up you know how she is\nUm number six you become fatigued or that that makes a lot of sense because a lot of people who are stretched out of their minds are just absolutely drained all the time\nA number seven you get random boosts of energy a number of member hate you become snappy or you start wearing a bow tie [laughter] I Know that was not where you started snapping at ... and number a number nine or you spill your guts to strangers\n[laughter] you know my problem was now here it is that's really you know what\nA in a in clinic you get to be you get to be on the receiving end of that a lot you have people that are just really really cry ugly stress and they will go into details which have nothing to do with what they're there to talk about or where you just kinda like oh okay well that's\nA that's a good word to we're going to skip over the bathroom issues today a it because it's a it's something where you're just a year it's all ... up you know areas stress is always looking for some kind of some kind of release you know the release used to be I just ran two hundred yards in Fifteen seconds or and and and now they're released we don't get that you know ... this is happening behind the wheel of the car\nA and so all you can do is just a group the steering wheel harder and and it gets internal one as a\nYoung pastor used to make a hospital goes um\nAnd uh and it was funny because you'd walk into a room and I'm just a young twenty something pastor\nAnd and there'd be people there who are really worried about their condition and maybe it's just been through surgery and they go and they just say Reverend look at this and they throw back the covers and show you the star of the surgery they've just been through and you're standing there thinking oh way too much information didn't want to see that\nBut it was part of how they dealt with the trauma of the operation that they had just been through 'em and so and so I I couldn't believe that if doctors here if if ministers here than doctors certainly here yeah\nYeah it's a it's it's it is it's it's almost like there's this feeling of a of a of a lack of control I mean I go along with all the stuff with being with feeling clumsy and feeling like you don't have enough energy to do the things that you want to do um\nThese are um it's it's the mistake they it's a mistake that gets made with the majority I Would say of of psychological and psychiatric conditions and this is one of them chronic stress is a is is definitely a real condition the mistake it's made of chalk it up to some sort of\nA if\nSerial untouchable mental state that if you could just get a little bit mentally stronger you could overcome it instead of what it actually is which is we are\nOrganic living beings were made up out of tissue and that tissue runs on different ... mackerel molecules and having those things out of balance or makes it so that you cannot function I'm ... and\n... when when I used to do some ... or um because I just want to get to a solution to fast but um but people would come in and they would they would be under these incredible circumstances and they'd say I think I'm Crazy and I said well what makes you think you're crazy and they and they say well this happened and I and I got all stressed I said\nEverybody would get stressed out or something like that and ... and a lot of our stress\nIsn't about what's happening to us but about people we love mhm that's where a majority of of a ... you know I'm I don't care really what happened to me but I really really care about people I Love a and so a lot of the stress comes from just that's the price of loving ...\nYeah and that's and that is ultimately the great source of stress for all of us at any given time whatever whatever brings this to our door it ultimately comes down to\nThere is a situation that I feel powerless to help them and ... and again that's why a lot of these stress relieving things are\nHere's a little guy whose head you can question here's here's a here's an alarm clock that you can throw across the room and uh it's it's it's it's some sort of way to be like here you can you have power over this thing um but ultimately\nAre becoming a\nFirst okay with and then useful in in situations where you where you feel powerless or it the first step is to be as clear headed as you can about which is why approaching stress as its own specific problem really is important um a lot of people don't see the connection between\nUm you know my dad's\nIn the nursing home and uh we can't afford it for my mom's though she's living with us and we're trying to you know or take care of her and and
