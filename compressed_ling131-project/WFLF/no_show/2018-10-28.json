I think it is has a Vegas she called us fire\nA which would fit right in with the ship closure partnership between the love shows as a social rush\nWhere you know the devil has a magazine out the similar that it's called a fire\nAnd for those who miss having it's going to be an eternal fire I can guarantee you that what's romance so it's actually also reap Donny I'm going to go to another caller I'm going to try to get as many people in the district that this man running for but you have a question for him before we go\nUh no not specifically a up very impressed with this degree of shame and level headed ... that was that\nWell I'm impressed with this uh service to the military and was it Thirty years Thirty years is a helicopter pilot in the marine corps oh man that's great and I know you would agree Donny Donny were you ever in the service\nNo no I'm older surviving shot\nOK you weren't in the starvation army or anything like that then\nThough gay Donny thank you for your service anyway love you and the lord God Bless joy in Orlando welcome to the John ... do\nI Do very very very nice uh and I agree with a ... as it is very suspicious that mommy\nI agree with you on when I asked a day if you have any thoughts on that so called bummer\nWell it's a lot of stuff just doesn't add up I mean when you see the pictures of the bombing in or they didn't do more smart you know postage and I didn't even get there the simultaneous ...\nAnd it just from the picture that get again too bright or so there's definitely a need to record the bomb threats before right him he should have been on somebody's ... watch list and I'm Glad they've apprehended him I'm sure it'll be investigated I think what this much\nHeat these days are the ... the the light that's being shined on the FBI I I think there is no I think it's gonna be a a thorough investigation and hopefully the truth will come out and we'll find out who put him up to this but\nThe shenanigans whether it's the ... the mob a U.S warming up to our border or or right before an election or these bombs were the shooting in Pittsburgh ... this is not an accident this ... this is a a deliberate\nA push to influence our elections\nAs Nelson Rockefeller center and we mentioned last week nothing happened by accident politically it's always on\nAnd I'm not in the bombs went off\nNo they weren't supposed to and when they try him if he's the one they try to get off without any hard jail time 'cause he's an emotionally disturbed individual that would appear\nYeah well and and then of the the er that from a van you know I think it's just part of it I really do\nWell if you look at all the stickers on the windshield they're not faded\nFor him to have all the prompt stickers in Miami as her where he's from that ban would have been vandalized probably the tire slice it and it was in pristine condition\nI just have doubts about what went on and some time if I have the time I go in to the in depth ability to program an assassin we did that many years ago with John Kennedy Marilyn Monroe\nAnd how we proved with the man who was with the CIA how that can be done which I was trying to prove the case with ... joy I Want to thank you for your call or your first time caller\nA no mistakes and\nWell well listen you call anytime All right\nAbout that one thing or a is there a way I Know a confined out bank records on these people because some of them I think are getting paid\nOh yes I Do too I I I Know I there is a way I'm I Hope that they don't allow that card to not be turned over joy let's pray that the truth guilty party are found those who are guilty and that they're found the equal justice under the law I think you would agree that joy I wanted to thank you for your call\nYeah awesome\nAwesome guy but thank you for ... days God Bless praying for you a ... and they're\nAll right thank you run a highly you'll do a good job will accept your judgment up there now I won't won't let you down All right you take care of us\nBefore I go to Jim and I have an open line for oh seven nine one six five four zero zero you can get in and Dave Smith take any question you have I Want to ask Dave what's your position on securing the border\nWell ... is a ... a a um [noise] directed toward the mob that's moving towards the invasion I tell you we have a humanitarian crisis of international scale Burling uh I think the president has an obligation to stop it before it gets to the border it's it's not our problem Mexico's problem\nWhere's the United nations if they want to be stepping in wearing\nWhere's the world bank where's the international Monetary Fund where's the international Red Cross where all the agencies that could be helping these people in their home countries\nOf cars there again that there are will closed their wealth fed they're not in wheelchairs and walkers or transportation and and so they're seeking asylum they going to apply for asylum in your own country but there there's a ... the United states is not the world's policeman\nAnd we don't we don't get involved in every country's business because that's not our role and responsibility but we are a superpower and in\nA ... this is an invasion it's not a form of a mass immigration and I think though the way to stop it is a\nA since you've you shut off every money transfer in from from the United states into Mexico and you tell the president of President Trump pulled the president of Mexico whoever that may be ... and and and tell them deal with this don't let it get to our more if you make this a U.S problem\nYou're not going to like the way it comes out and and and you whether you call sanctions or actions but you shut off the money flow into into Mexico or from the United states\nAnd and and you'll get their attention and they'll turn those people around and then go back and and if they are\nReally truly seeking asylum than there is a process a legal process to to to go through it but this is not a caravan it is a mob invasion that we can not allowed to come to our border because there's another one right brands line that\nAnd then there'll be another one behind that absolutely this is a kind of like the closest thing you'd\nSee to a Trojan Horse or they're not in uniform there are people with T shirts on who are against our president I Wonder what Hillary Clinton would do if about fifty people strong her door\nAnd she probably has a wall around her home I Know that President Obama does his home and demanded to get in and state that we're hungry and we're cold and we need help and we need hospitalization and we need all these things even though there look as strong as a horse\nAnd they knocked her door down would she take a gun and stop the mob from breaking into her home she has a wall of us have a wall and if you have a home or in an apartment in that door that gets into your inner sank tore him is likeable\nAnd is there to protect you and you have the right to keep and bear arms as long as the worker intro by Republicans will not Democrats and what would you do individual I'm wonder what Nancy Pelosi would do would she stand there and let them come in and feed and clothe them and Lyndon commandeer her home and\nBreak any illegally or would she called the police in which she demand that they stop them at all costs if need be to shoot them\nOut let me ask you ladies and gentlemen if you were the president and many of you are not the president is only one president but no matter what he does they're going to be some that will Herald him in some that will hate him so if you were the president what would you do to stop we need\nNew here maybe you got the plan I don't know but I Want to hear from you and I'm a gym you're in a ... a welcome to the John Butler book show\nWell could act good evening and a good evening to you colonel and uh I Will say the same thing that I checked to Carl Jackson to say to you on my behalf semper fi\nOutstanding Jim good to have another marine on in the audience\nI had the opportunity to vote on the on Saturday at the ... and once again I defy dodge by being the only person that come out of the stuff that you sober [laughter] um and I was\nImmediately accosted while I ... I don't do you mean that a negative way that I was interviewed on camera by an NBC from New York reporter about the reasons that I voted [noise]\nUm and I'm not hearing anybody uh taking a a few are taking a look at industrial diversification in Florida I think we need that\nUm because from my point of view and having spent a long time and transportation [noise] ah there isn't very much coming out at Florida as far as a a finished goods or a manufactured goods [noise] I think that a year\nAnd a mystery to Santas are the right people at the right time hopefully uh in that hopefully meaning that we can start to diversify the industrial base here\nJim you're you're absolutely spot on and and if you if you have a few minutes oh\nOf spare time and anybody else in the audience please go to my Facebook page and and ... David Smith Republican and and you'll actually see a video that I I Do standing out in front of the Sanford Airport\nWhere we have six hundred build double Lakers on airport property owned by the city that you can grow those type of manufacturing jobs ... ...\nYou know besides of a career in the marine corps a pilot I have an undergraduate and graduate degrees in business I've run major aviation repair facilities which were manufacturing jobs I had four thousand employees seven hundred and Seventy million dollars in annual revenue\nSo bring those type of aviation jobs jet engine repair those type of mechanics fixing wings and\nLanding gear ejection seats and all sorts of ... all sorts of different equipment in aviation but my background is in manufacturing and and you're spot on a that's the other thing we need to do inside of Florida is expand our port facilities and the infrastructure to move goods\nOr through Florida a or international trade is that's what the what you're talking about diverse\nFind Florida's economy is going to act as a shock absorber the next time we have an economic downturn and not normal business cycles we all know what's coming we're in a rising interest rate environment\nBut a Florida could grow manufacturing jobs diversify our economy expand ports uh expand our airports are other areas in order to move goods through the city or through the state of Florida will help us in the long run and strengthen Florida\nAnd we all know it as we say at every election cycle that as Florida goes so goes our nation\nWell you can't just be in the tourist straight business forever and orange juice is good but it's not if we have a couple of our own freezes adult changes as it did a few years ago\nGym that's an excellent question and I wanted to mention something to him he majored in the ... seat I Wish she'd been doing that when Jimmy Carter was president I loved it made him a test pilot in the White House\n[laughter] well the the only thing is that a ejection ejection from an aircraft or it's not one hundred percent foolproof\nUm you're lucky too I think probably the last figures I saw were about eighty five percent a of people who I have to be checked will come out with a at least a minor injury\nIt's important that the cockpit file first\nYeah well there's ways to fetch bad happening but uh uh each action at high speed and altitude a can wreck havoc on the ah the body\nJim I Want to thank you very intelligent call thank you sir and basic God\nBless bill out on springs that was another bill that was on dropped off I Hope you'll call back row seven on one's six five four zero zero but before I go to bill I got to go to Sally and Orlando welcome to the program Sally\n\nIs taking my call a first off a quick answer to what the president should do\n... article for affection for declare the invasion which is why it is and the confrontation they have to protect us against invasion I don't care what other lives they have out there are there laws cannot Trump what they're supposed to have\nHow many confrontational level for that fat now might\nThat includes the ... that becomes null and void\nI Try to competition you cannot make laws that violate the base of confrontation\nWait a minute I Want to ask your opinion on that first part and then she'll go part to\nNot I mean she's she's spot on I mean that's correct it it it is an invasion or in in the military is going to be called to the border and it's not a violation of policy comatose which prevents ...\nMilitary being involved in in law enforcement it's not law enforcement it's a military invasion and I you know during my career I flew multiple\nUh missions along a counter narcotics surveillance missions along our southern border using the equipment on my helicopter and uh and and uh the illegal immigration the drug trafficking tracking that goes on down there I mean it's it's all well known it's all well documented but this this a caravan this invasion\nIs is not about challenging our immigration policy it's an attempt to a an manipulate\nA are on this election it's about to point fingers\nWell bill I say there's probably not that many people actually know what you meant when the when you mentioned the Keating Five but I but I sure do and uh uh it goes back to the failed savings and loan a fiasco from years ago when people that that that hit that kinda stuff Bush's brother was in all swept it under the rug but a\n... that that type of corruption has no place in in government uh you know it's that's what we need to to root out now I tell you we were Republicans were were the big tent party we we've got room for everybody under our tent and we have a wide range of of ah\nOf opinions are and you shouldn't be able to get to air those opinions but uh\nUh yeah that's a there's certainly some people that are disappointed but we see it in Florida where we're you're not going to get elected in certain areas unless you're a certain party and and I ... that we've had it in Seminole county in central Florida in orange county to where people will run\nThey'll lose then they'll change their party affiliation and run again and get elected so there's there's a\n... ... people uh people change their party affiliation from time to time is is the legislature or the state's wings and and that's unfortunate but you know that's why when I'm Out on the campaign trail I I don't tell people what I think\nUh I I tell them what I Believe ... when I speak it comes from the heart not from my head a and a and I think that's so when people meet me and they and they talk with me when they walk away the word they\nI think remember is authentic uh uh um what you see what you get in a in one of our callers earlier mentioned you know I and I kind of use it as a tagline it didn't mean to be that way but it's kind of grown but a a I'm a patriot not a politician or I'm going up there to do a job\nBill I think what you're getting out and tell me if I'm wrong when the Republicans were in charge of the house\nAnd the Senate and when they knew they didn't have enough to override a veto they unanimously first of all passed every budget that funded Obamacare Republicans alike they funded and then in order to look good if you look back they voted unanimously to replace Obamacare\nUntil they had a Republican president that would not vetoed that position and when they said on more than one occasion including McCain we want to repeal Obamacare\nWhen they had a chance to repeal it some of those rental Republicans jumped on the other side and they simply lied do their teeth and they should be replaced and McCain was only one of them there were others including the man who heads up the Republican Senate and if you'll recall when Donald Trump looked like he was going to be the nominee\nThey were ready to vote for Hillary Clinton some of them because they belong to the council on Foreign Relations and the council on Foreign Relations has two major goals that Republicans and Democrats are supported open borders\nOpen borders and open trade which led to NAFTA and if you look back\nAnd look at those people who supported NAFTA um many of them are now trying to act like they were opposed to it but it was the speaker of the house that claimed victory over the Republican Revolution and all the young Republicans on there and he put NAFTA on the fast track and would not allow them to vote\nA devoted down and I I I think you know that\nAnd I know and these fellows need to be replaced because we're not Republicans and heart", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "28"}
