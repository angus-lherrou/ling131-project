ourselves and so I'm here to human beings especially scientists aren't real good at admitting when they're wrong and and of course governments never have to admit that they're wrong because\nOftentimes that people who who do the politicians who spent the money or pass the bills are long gone they're no longer in office they're dead whatever it might be\nA democratic government exacerbates all this because it's the opposite of skin in the game it's people spending other ... people promising people good good happy things in other words buttering up voters\nIn ... in exchange

these wild times ran they see the news losing their mind they see half the country thinking we're in a controlled by some kind of a Nazi takeover with the Trump Administration and then and then the other half of the country is kind of missing the mark on some things too about\nHow freedom is the free is the is the is the is the fundamental ingredient to a flourishing of society\nSo can you give anybody's um wisdom are some things to navigate these turbulent times I mean we've got all this debt right and people are kind of if you're awake to that that's a big problem is going to come to crash where do we how do we navigate these turbulent times\nUsing the wisdom in principles of free market economics\nWell on a personal level I think you have to arm yourself with some knowledge you know there's a price for everything and you might need to go spend some time\nReading and learning um about a government about fiscal policy about monetary policy about economics even though that's not as fun as just turning on Netflix at the end of a long day but but if you do that if you invest a little bit of it in yourself not even any money\nWith all the wonderful things on line today um you know you really be a lot more prepared in and one thing we do know is that\nA economies tend to be cyclical no different schools of economics can argue over why but nonetheless there's there's general agreement with that and if we look at the last\nTruly truly\nA tumultuous economy in the United states the great depression Nineteen thirties people who had cash and others who were savers actually did pretty well because of the cost of a lot of things dropped and the purchasing power the dollar went up people who were in debt who own dollars\nAre found themselves in in dire dire straits and often times uh I you know ... unemployed and and even out on the streets so um there's never been a time in human history worth thrift and saving\nIt is a bad thing I I Wish we could apply that at a national level but if we can't surely we can all attempt to apply it individually\nDo you think there's any lessons learned with the Trump phenomenon in terms of his ... his campaign is all about nationalism versus globalism is that is that a trend that's helpful for liberty in your opinion\nOh absolutely I mean that's we'd need three hours to that but I I think I think there's two different kinds of nationalism there's a\nThere's a a obliterate nationalism which it it it tends to impose its way on the other nations in other words this outward looking and I think there can be a reasonably benevolent nationalism\nWhich is which is a lot of pride for one's nation and I don't think nation has to equal state I think those are two different things\nAnd you know I have a lot of libertarians are are very cranky about certain things and I and I understand that but speaking for myself I Love America I I'm very appreciative\nOf the the the wealth we have here of the\nOf the hot and cold running water the electricity that the reason why habitation the roads the medicine that dental care the the the cheap food relative to income so I mean\nI'm you know we're not living through the

Russians use a pencil\nSo that's kind of approach I Am after I mean we don't have to beat our head on the wall and trying to solve a very difficult problem you know why don't we look at an alternative or alternative them see maybe there was another way we can accomplish the same result let's not going to be as difficult or as capital intensive wars in labor intensive\nSo what kind of alternative I usually well uh\nUh like like Dave was saving saying you have to roll roll up our sleeves and do it it's a sign up with my money where my mouth or other my my mind was on you know I retired\nFrom university I set up a home nuclear science lab and I started to you know just a hypothesis is a you know by other people in my own hypothesis is\nUm you know what what we forget it we don't we don't know everything about nuclear science we don't know everything you know about physics so it's important to the basic research and see maybe there are other ways we can do a nuclear reactions maybe you know\nThere are other ways we can accelerate natural radioactivity maybe there are other ways we can extract immense power from nuclear processes and they'll give you an example a few people know that light and he's actually a\nA process that creates nuclear reactions so only recently it has been publicized that anti particles I detected a nurse a sphere gamma rays neutrons all sorts of you know hard radiation originated from like ... you know why the reason oh\nNo good answer so you know this is something that I'm studying in my lab now created a miniature lightning and I'm trying to realize you know why this nuclear reactions occur you know how I can make them you know go faster and more powerful or you know something you know more useful could come out of it\nOr what kind of a stunning results come out of the recent oil a one result is very interesting for example when you create a discharge you expect to have the energy of the resulting X rays\nAre to match the voltage that was used in the church for example if you use a thirty thousand holes you create a discharge a miniature like can you expect to get an X rays that about you know thirty thousand electron volts in energy\nBut you know what I'm observing it is or even at such a low low voltage I get X rays and the range of ah I Know several mega electron volts\nYou and you know that's a potentially a very interesting result in a similar results or obtain and published in ... literature pertaining to lightning but we don't really know what voltage is in life and you know we think it's you know millions and millions of votes and likely that's to be true but in the lab when tests or conducted\nYeah and I like a award by a particular Russian team that used a million votes discharge so they detected\nX rays I don't think they measured gamma but they couldn't explain why they weren't getting new terms of their process because the energy oh they're just charging it wasn't high enough to produce new trends but you know trends were produced\nSo I kind of decided to build on that a little bit and created a miniature just charge you know didn't get what you were turns out it would but got very high

chicks [noise]\nOkay what if it's worth seven thousand dollars and it takes seven thousand dollars to fix it that means is not worth anything that's right there's got to be an alternative way to get this thing fixed are you dealing with the dealer\nOr know dealing with a mechanic to specialize in that you\nKnow and that's a that's a ridiculous you can't spend seven thousand I mean you're better off to just turn in the shower\nI Would think the caller Iran I think the car would probably bring a couple of ground even with the shape it's in but you owe Thirteen on it so basically you're either team thousand or credit card debt is what you're half that's right that's attached to a car so what's your household income\nA almost a hundred okay\nYeah I'm just country like Thirteen thousand dollar a credit card debt I guess a car sits in the driveway um ... other transportation um how do you owe them money to\nUm to the car I get cars USA so what's our bank about veteran [noise]\nOkay we'll go out to the usa might actually work with you and let you sign an secured note for the balance of what it does bring at least that way you can get the tags and the insurance and stuff off of you and you know sell it for a couple of ground salvage and then you've got loving thousand dollars you just got an secured note\nBecause you bought a home you bought a piece of garbage apparently oh

any other ideas man [laughter] as you're getting this job [laughter] see see if he's got something else you can do I don't know I mean the fuel systems are finicky I Know that I've had a couple of them\nAnd generally they're great cars\nI'm a beamer fan ritual and wants to about ... on the other day is really a nice car\nBut um yeah a ... now\nI I'm just going to push back get a second opinion push back on this guy I work with usa and then say I'll make a hundred grand I got eleven thousand dollars worth of worst case ... thousand dollar\nA credit card debt here I just got to pay off how fast can pay it off and you don't get the title back then sell it for salvage if if us I work with you and do it on on secured loan ... transfer that negative equity into and an secured loan but\nUm hopefully you can figure out where to put a couple of grand in it and then if it's worth a global brand salvage it's been two more on this like Kevin for rent it and it would sell for seven man if you

not smell bad when you yeah walked in I I appreciate that I'm a little worried what mine was then but that's what they [laughter]\nAnyway [laughter]\nSo I'm back to financial planning I guess I'm One of the things I'd like to talk about as we closed the show is maybe just\nUm the complimentary financial retirement snapshot basically when you come to work with us\nIf you want to take a look at you know where you are if you're on track for retirement there's a lot of different software out there to kind of accomplish that and um what we do in a complementary and of\nBasic financial plan is taking 'em all the money that you've got and contributions to a retirement plan and role that forward to a retirement age say sixty five or sixty six\nAnd eight assumes that you're going to need about Seventy percent of what you make now so if you make a hundred thousand dollars basically there's an assumption that you wouldn't have mortgages and payroll taxes and contribution to retirement plans so around Seventy percent of what you make is what you'd need to roll that forward in today's dollars into the future\nAnd then using some um\nSoftware called Monte Carlo that it basically takes all the past performance is which is not indicative of future result my\nPast performance of sectors large gap small cap international all that good stuff and then rolls it forward with the investments you've got and the contribution to that you're going to make and see that at age sixty six is that going to be a bucket of money to dry out that in my example Seventy grand in future dollars\n'til the day that you die\nSo and you said this is complementary it is if you want to take a look at hey where am I Am I on track\nThe the the result from that kind of vets out hey well you could increase dramatically the probability of reaching your goals if you just did a five hundred dollar a month rough contribution you know into the market and ... and that what does that do to change the outcome and so\nThat's something you want to take a look at you know I Know one of the words or phrases I like to use is funded in forget it and that's important to do in terms of retirement plans for all and K IRAs funded in forget it in terms of just getting used to making that contribution\nBut you want to look at it at least once a year to kind of make sure that your diversified again no segments nearly without and you say your favorite word the word of the day and uh and and then make sure that it's going to um um meet your goals and and so the important thing is just to get it to his\nTime in the market not timing the market is kind of an important thing to to keep in mind and so the the complimentary financial snapshot is kind of a a tool that we can use for anyone to help them see if they're on target alright\nAnd so if somebody wants to do that how can they do\nYeah car office at four O. seven eight nine five twenty four thirty eight and we can take a look at that and see if you're on target um or website\nOverton advisory dot com is Ohio where you can get all the skinny and some research or see a picture of all of us ... the staff and myself in a where the office is located\nOh now nine what's that going to be bombarded they who they want to know what you look like yeah I I don't know that that can be the case [laughter]\nWhen I meet people that are always like I did not expect you to look like that\nMy mom always said I have a face for radio show or did you want me to disagree [laughter]\nBy on that you are not about your shirt [laughter]\nThey get a little\nBetter but yeah the whole point is a you know you don't necessarily have to work with us we'd like you to work with us but you need to work with someone studies show that when you're working with a financial advisor your performance and and your ability to Richard goals has dramatically improved\nWell that is good advice as we on the show absolutely All right well that's our show thanks for listening and it caused a great Benjamin Franklin investment in knowledge pays the best interest so be smart with your money to have a good night's [noise]\n\nOne of the things that I see the most as avoid a financial advisor or people who think it's too late to continue saving for retirement some don't even realize that it's wise to get a second opinion just\nTo make sure that they are on track to reaching those retirement goals my office is aware that each client is different and we work towards what will help the individual the most one tool that we use as the financial plan which gives you a better insight to saying what it will take to reaching those goals called a schedule your appointment at four O. seven eight nine five twenty four thirty\nMinutes later I was under the

element of surprise on a two hundred pound guy you might have a shot yeah or if he knows you're coming in you're just walking tour just slowly as I can go well I'm so uh yeah there were\nA there was also um this was I felt like the the biggest and and it's probably the one that we uh we can I'm finished this segment on because we only have a minute left because it's most of the rest of the show I feel like media their role rights and responsibilities\nCause a there is such consistent\nLeveled unmitigated outrage towards the a ridiculous left wing media and to the ridiculous right wing media that both sides I mean you you hear it\nIt's the extreme liberal bias and then and then people talk about Fox News as a propaganda you know arm\nOf the GOP I'm neither side uh wins in that one I mean it's it's it's really it's really hard um that one you know it's it's interesting 'cause it just it shapes the national mood so much I feel more even more than the national information you know\nWell the structure of media that is that it it is conducted by a series of soundbites doesn't promote deliberation a it promotes reaction 'em and because it it knows that the way we make decisions\nAnd Jonathan hate 'em said this in his book the righteous mind the way we make decisions is not rational it's reaction or if it's intuitive in its gut level that's how people make decisions and then they use their brain to rationalize the decision they made\nWow well that makes I mean that makes a lot of sense I'm so if you're outraged by uh the others I think we know we're all talking about just

side and this is a show that about helping you to help others are in one of the ways to be helpful is to be able to have constructive conversations or even about controversial topics right a dying art well\nI don't know if it was ever live [laughter]\nI Know that we thought we had graduated to civilization but the prime most of us still it\nReally it really is you know that that uh that emotional reaction um it's it is it is just another example of this ah I I think it's increasingly well understood by people at all different backgrounds that\nOur emotional or the the elephant is the emotion that we are riding on a and we can act like we are trying to steer it around but it really is you know it really is the elephant is taking us around um um and since that might seem political\nOr the donkey or that don't get the enemy yeah or or the Green Party what do they have and I don't work on the Green Party or a film molecule [laughter]\nOff as the worst of it all [laughter] so one of the one of the\nThings we thought would be good to talk about I'm In this uh in this segment number two chapter too is a is the ability to have um conversations a with a with people how to how to um uh be able to have a rational conversation with people that you do know people that you are I'm\nA word that you or that you want to know better there there was this great uh our research department found as great a Dr Martin Luther king junior quotes is that uh people often hate each other because they fear each other and they fear each other because they don't know each other and they don't know each other because they cannot communicate I was at\nThat may as good as good [laughter] um so it is a pharmacy in the top of the mountain and I can't do it just got to be I Believe if I have a lot of respect\nFor him okay junior erase it wasn't clear from that I I only I only ... people that I really respect but the idea behind that did it so it's so accurate and it's very hard to to pick apart any piece of that logic I mean you hate really does come from fear fear really does come from not knowing and not knowing comes from not communicate I mean if it really is that\nI'm so there was this there was this article um that are that you were saying was pretty good about it\nYeah Marissa Mayer a road about some ways to avoid um the conversation going the wrong direction um and and so there were um ah five helpful you know\nI'm One of them is the first one is a void personal attacks yeah\nAnd that I that strikes me as one of those that are\nMost civil people are don't don't go in thinking that they're going to do that but it it I feel like that sneaks in sometimes without even the person doing the attacking really realizing you know uh yeah uh that it's a you know the the\nCordial you know a while I understand that what you think or you know that type of of uh uh you can you can insult people without just being like what do you know\nRamsey ... sexy half on the news radio Saudi\nWelcome back to the bright side this is a show that's about helping you help others I'm Joel Hunter and I'm here with my dad Joel Hunter or who is a helping us\nToday to African constructive conversation I feel like you are\nQualified to to talk about this on this show today well thank you kind of done that because he didn't go Christians uh\nI cringe when I call you that you're not like a lot of famous on ... ... talk to them\nAnd take our our our side our position um and so the least I can do is try to build bridges with people who are different than I Am yeah well that's not enough\nBy [laughter] where did you get like that [laughter] so\nThis is this is really a good it's a it's a really important topic um and one of the things that were him do right now is is list\nFallacy argument said his arguments that you can be aware of the people naturally go toward that are not logical um that are that are not helpful why why do fallacy arguments happened what's appealing about them\nWell what's appealing is that they ah they wish to have this expression short sheet they they it was a practical joke yeah yeah yeah uh but they they advantage you over the one who disagrees with you and so it's kind of\nUm intentionally misunderstanding um ... even in your subconscious you'd you'd you'd you think you're trying to understand what you're really not yeah I'm trying to understand\nJust to clarify in case you're wondering what short cheating was it was when you take the sheet that they were going to climb under and you add folded in half so then they would get in or the bad and then they ah they they they're ... they're all corrupt crippled for you that that was\nThat was back when pranks were holding [laughter] is that when you do on using that as we board fake blood all over again [laughter] watching\n[laughter]\nThe way the government [laughter] um so we already ... the the number one a one on this list or we've kinda covered a little bit the ad hominem\nFallacy which is just um well you're an idiot a you know David ... rather than the ... and that one is a again it sneaks in there but uh but it's it's it's not always my example wasn't very good because it's an it's rarely that well you're an idiot or usually an ad hominem argument has to do with the\nYou know I'm sure you I'm sure you think that because you are from the mid west or I Know that you probably think that because your parents are rich or the you know those are those your ad hominem fallacy um and then\nA next step was strongman argument how would you describe that to the\nStrong man is that you\nSorry um that you simplify you over simplify the other person's argument to the point of being ridiculous easily knocked over in other words I was like a straw man yeah exactly um and so you you you don't\nUm um take into consideration what the person who's actually saying you exaggerate\nUm what they what their overall point is to the point of being ridiculous in other words an example of that is our senator thinks she can solve all our ecological problems by driving a Prius well that's that's that makes the the other person you\nKnow ... grossly inadequate for complex solutions yeah and it categorizes them um or or or misrepresent their ideas\nYeah and the intelligence of their I'd I I mean at some point in the straw man argument should get subtitled the Facebook argument because I it's it Facebook Reddit Twitter all these places where you are you kind of handcuffed in your ability to have a thoughtful back and forth because\nThere's a delay or between responses and because you only have a certain amount of room to write\nUm strongman arguments are extremely popular because it's a it's it's it's a reducing someone else's position to to the point that it's ridiculous and it makes it really easy to to combat that you know so it when you say you know\nAs a so you don't want to ... you don't you want to judge who's a perfect human well good luck finding that well that's not what people you know or or and or they would say well clearly you don't care about anyone who's ever suffered a sexual assault again like that's\nThat's a strong man that's really easy to to to knock over a and and it's a it's it's not helpful at all or it it it's not it's not even doesn't even make you've seen\nCorrect anyone reaches the you know if you do that anyone who anyone else who reads that who doesn't already think exactly like you\nAre it's really hard to you lose credibility when they do exactly that that that's part of the problem with a with many of these fallacious arguments is that um\nIt's not the argument that suffers ditch your credibility that suffers um and the and the communication Yeah Tom so uh what which one did you there's so many of them were I Know I Know like we have to\nWell you know here's here's one let's skip over to the the false dichotomy argument than most folks dilemma is going to it's it's it's creating an ultimatum that were there doesn't need to be one it's pretending they're only two answers um and if you don't agree with one you must agree\nWith the other answer yeah and and that one uh there are there are a true dichotomy there are things that are naturally mutually exclusive or\nYou or you can't I'm having trouble thinking of one now are you you can't have a you know a ... a left hand in glove is left handed because it's not a right handed love\nA there you go a that's a nice at the end of the younger the [laughter] or anything on your hands a left handed shoe so at the uh but but there's not a ton of those I mean it takes a little bit of effort to think of the true mutually exclusive pair absolutely um and people tend to\nUm take 'em they're\nFavorite thing and and makeup and opposition when there really isn't an opposition when I hear a as a pastor and heard for years were you either believe in the Bible or you believe in science\nThat's a false dichotomy [noise] because you know the scripture clearly says that is a turnaround attributes are are um revealed in what has been made and so and so it's important that organizations like bio logos for example um that reconcile\nScripture with science um and create an intelligent a dialogue are are so valuable\nSo many people when they get in arguments or she has a black or white yeah if it and uh and and and a lot of these ah these fallacious arguments they they ... they they pile on each other so that one uh that that kind of false dichotomy of you either believe in science or you believe in a a religion\nUm it it works in people's minds or even though it doesn't look at first it is because they'll immediately go to well you know what about this Bible verses says X Y or Z or what about this passage from the ... says X Y or Z\nUm and uh and so the people that um that practice this stuff or they they can't believe in both um but that that appeals to a different one which is this bandwagon fallacy which is\nUm the worst or best of a certain group like everyone who everyone who does this must be similar to each other you know it's the ... is the bandwagon effect I'm which can be used a negative way people think bandwagon is like my team's winning a everybody jumps on but but it's not always it's it's a\nThere are there are Christians that make me so uncomfortable to listen to 'em as they go through and and ... ... meticulously explain house seat and went into the layers of sediment and put different dinosaur fossils in there\nAnd then he got people like Francis Collins who smarter than I could ever hope to be if I had a thousand years to sit in rooms and read books um who has a faith that just as strong um and he also happens to be able to do\nCode human DNA I mean he he ran the human genome project um the the bandwagon is not all the same I mean the people that believe those things aren't all the same and so that's why it's not it's not science verse religion um there are things that are mutually exclusive that just doesn't have to be one\nWell in what you what you point out there with this ... specifically with this argument is that we don't we're not aware that many times were making the arguments we are to make social relationships or to to to\n... they're not we're not thinking them through were wanting to be accepted by a certain group or we're wanting to be loyal to a certain group that has nothing to do with the discovery and the the liberation of truth it has all to do with what group we want to be identified\nWith I like that yeah which uh which leads us to the new true Scott ... Alice the witch or\nIf that's not a really good cliffhanger [laughter] you know especially if you are related to anyone from Scotland or or you are Scottish or or if you just want to hear what the no true Scott's been felt his stick around we'll be back after this on how to have a helpful conversation\nYou know I bought myself a lot of gifts in the past I bought new cars new boats but the best gift I've ever bought myself is new vision when I had the lasik procedure done at a hunter visual believe me the new cards new boats are nice but the new vision is much more valuable and much less expensive it truly has been a life altering experience to be able to see again without", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "17"}
