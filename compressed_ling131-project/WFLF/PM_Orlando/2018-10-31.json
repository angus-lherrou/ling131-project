... your worst fear and your best year\nI never really made a whole lot of money on I don't feel like I ever really put my degree to work um I Would say my best year this is my wife and I's combined gross income was probably eighty thousand\nI'm currently currently we make a point a to it but it's so gross a sixty thousand so we don't make a whole lot of money so well in your worst year when you started out\nProbably oh just you know when I was Twenty one and two Ninety an hour I think I may twenty thousand a year\nAgo and and your degree is in what\nA business of marketing um I work at a at a grocery store for thirty seven years so it worked my way up and it was a butcher actually and ah I was forced out about three years ago because they show that was too expensive and at that point in time\nI kinda thought I had enough money to retire but\nI didn't want to pay health insurance so\nI just am a courier now and uh I don't make a whole lot of money I make fourteen dollars an hour but so I make enough to call them cover our living expenses of our retirement money is just shut the growing so I'm just kinda hold back\nOkay so you never mind over eighty but you're sitting on a one point eight million dollar net worth\nA told me oh how you did that once the key to that\nAre the key is the one thing I did it was kinda neat that first car I bought I did take a loan out\nFor a um a ever since I paid that first car I just kept\nMoney going into the bank so every car after that I just paid cash or ... and to live within my main I'm working at the grocery store I used to see people that would come in and\nThey would buy peanut butter Dale bread and that's what they would try to live on and I did not want to see myself doing that so I never uh I've never I Do I Do carry a credit card\nAnd I know that's against church teachings but I pay off the balance every month\nAnd a never paid any credit card cheese at my entire life\nOkay so how do you end up at one point four or five million a mutual funds\nThat oh when I did work at a grocery chain every time I got a raise I put it into retirement might think before I was forced out I was twenty two percent of my check into my four oh one K. every every week\nDid you guys go on vacation and enjoy your lives as you were living in minor\nVacation so vacation while you're traveling to the family somewhere or more years they
