is\nBuilding generational well so we're lucky\nAmazing your great grandfather wow you know\nI'm ... and ... are you single\nI and I've got a girlfriend but we'll see how that pans out right\nOkay and um what do you make a year\nOr about sixty right now good for you and how much debt do you have I have not\nLook at you or your great grandfather's kid that's excellent he's proud of that I'm sure I'm\nAll right um how old are you I'm twenty three okay good good [noise] okay\nTypically what will occur in the next five years statistically speaking it's not a requirement is certainly not a law it's just an observation of the way life unfolds or you'll get married and buy a house\nTypically\nOkay you might not you don't have to like I said it's not required I'm not saying that but the point of that being those are two major events and uh\nBoth of them will require money\nAnd so we need to keep that in mind what we're doing this we would always tell you to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses so I Want you to have brown Fifteen thousand bucks or so set aside for that um\nIf you want to buy a home and pay cash for it at this stage an inexpensive home a that's not a bad thing uh I I I Would expect that when you get married you probably wouldn't move again and that's not unusual it's not bad it's just you're kind of expect\nThat show um does generally after you get married you find out you bought their own home [noise] [laughter]\nYeah I I'm anxious to buy a home my older brother is buying a home at this point but I just don't think it's right for me with you know with how accessible moving as for me and my field I Am a nurse I'm terrible at moving anywhere\nAnd you don't you don't have to then that's cool you know my point is there's no rush\nAnd I I I'm personally with you I think it'd be cool if you wait three years to buy your place in kind of quote settling on or whatever number of years and so once you've got your emergency phone in place in your debt free then there's really nothing left to do with this money except three things which is what you should\nAlways do with money you should enjoy some of it\nI'm a small portion of it not much you make enough with no debt to enjoy your salary or you should give some of any money that you have and you should um invest some of it and so the majority of this money\nIf I'm In your shoes is going to be invested and uh the ... the portion that you know you're going to leave alone you're pretty comfortable that you're gonna leave alone at least five years I'm just going to buy some good mutual funds with it I invest in\nFour types of mutual funds in my retirement and in my long term investing which is five years or longer and growth growth in income aggressive growth and international\nI probably would set\nA hundred hundred and fifty of this in something or a little more conservative than that that is growing some but I'm probably going to pull that money out in the next five years and buy a house with it\nAnd um you know something along those lines again it's not a requirement and I would make sure I was settled in you liked the um\nUh the flexibility that you've got now and I think that's a bad I mean I think that's a good thing uh I think you're on hold on to that flexibility for a while I don't want to look up and find your thirty five years old and still having not bought a home\nOr in especially in your situation 'cause you're in such a great situation so I Would give some I Would enjoy swimming I Would invest the majority of it\nAh some of it towards a home in the future maybe just a simple on index fund and ask them the five hundred no load and there's no commission just let it grow um it is going to go it's going to follow the market whatever the market does and then the rest of it I Would invest longer term than that just to build wealth with\nIf you start at your age say with 'em\nAround two hundred thousand of this and you invest it you know and it sits there for forty years in grows a stock market rates of return which has been eleven point eight percent since it started a ... of wealth is going to be unbelievable and it's it's a wonderful way to\nUm honor your great grandfather's legacy ... sit down with a smart rushed her pro is what I Would tell you to do with ... dot com it'll drop down a list of the smart Mr pros and your area when you fill in your stuff you pick out one you like or two or three and interview them I don't care\nAnd go from there and sit down with someone and start to learn about mutual funds how they work what they are how to invest and I think it's good to have two buckets of investing here one with a five year mindset for\nBuying a home and one where the forty or mindset for just becoming on believe a blue wonderfully wealthy a art Ashton is with us from Charlotte North Carolina Hi Ashton how are you\nI'm doing great how are you\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\n[noise] well um I just recently about three months ago started that every dollar at love it I mean with a smart pro investor this week good a from a personal finances and operate but my question isn't on the individual ... thing [laughter]\nIt is on the church or a non profit side of things I was curious if and your opinion or perspective and are there are ways for churches and nonprofits to and for them financially well\nSome people call that being in Dowd a we're a university is typically a situation where you would see that happen [noise] um and that's where there's a large enough sum of money that the investment return off about a camp\nSay out of ten million dollar endowment that had built up and that money is invested in the investing their returns off at ten million dollars will operate the thing\nPerpetuation and so the ... the nest egg causes of the nonprofit to live in perpetuation off of that are you most often see that in a um a a formal large a\nNonprofit or in where you really see a lot as in a university or were there in ... or even a professorship there's enough money in this one account that the income is providing is paying the salary of a professor in whatever field okay\nIf someone just felt like they wanted to make sure that university was able to\nUh pay that professor in perpetuation going forward and that kind of a thing in the local church I almost never see that\nA special the evangelical world okay the ... church now a ... ... has a lot of assets\nAre the Vatican is very wealthy and show that's a different a different mindset on it but in evangelicalism the vast majority of the time those of us sitting on that church border that elder board which I've done many times would say the investment is not to be made in um\nIn earthly investments but instead and\nEnd up people and causing people to make Christ and grow and crushed and that that that's the investments that we want to make and so the only actual wealth is retained as the paid for properties that the thing operates fan or the awesome retained earnings that are sitting there are some\nSavings just to make sure that there's an operational buffer but\nUm but in terms of building an actual and Ballmer in that setting I only hope that helps answering questions that both of our of the day Ramsey showing the bugs will be back with you know in the meantime remember

the goats a faded and their native country yes okay All right\nWell I mean it sounds like you're going into something you're inexperienced in and um I I obviously I'm going to tell you don't borrow money to do it over money you might put into this may go away you uh you know from a business perspective you just got a very narrow demand a product line that the general public is not aware of\nAnd um so it's not like you're\nYou know cow hides leather obviously would be a completely different thing brought more for that\nAnd um or [noise] little obviously there's a broad market for that and so forth but if you've studied the market and you understand who's thing I I don't want to just trust a guy who once raised and they'll pack I halfway around the world and\nHis family did that for two generations or something that's that is a bad idea I mean you're in the United states and you you think about it you need to understand exactly how this was going to turn into money\nAnd how likely it is because you're talking about a business here but you can't get an armored with a hypo allergenic narrow markets stuff because your kids have allergies that's a good way to lose all your money\nSo you need to look at the business aspect of this where does this turn into money and what how many steps does it take to turn into money and how much money does it turn into and how likely is it to turn into money and cause it scared the crap out of me you're in a really narrow market a fad like market\nAnd it sounds like you've got a guy from another country who has come along and told you go to the alpacas worked in another market in another country and now you think they're going to\nWork in Columbus ohio I just I don't know I'm again I'm not an expert but it's just sounds weird so um\nI Would want to know a whole lot more about it that somebody brings something in here that feels weird to me [noise] usually I found out the reason it felt weird because it was weird\nAnd uh so you just kind of got to get down into it and go okay what's the problems with this what am I not seeing what am I blind spots and really study it because otherwise every dollar you're putting it riskier could

is not the problem which is a symptom of something else what's going on I'm right\nAnd it sounds like you guys are never told your money what to do you've never had any savings for emergencies so
