I don't want anybody to be unsafe and I don't want to have equipment\nBut I've got probably a million and a half dollars and equipment sitting here within a Fifteen feet of me right now while we're doing the show I Can't have that equipment going down the show would go down that would cost me a lot of money just like that but but we also don't buy equipment we don't need\nAnd then we make a decision whether we're going to buy new and we certainly pay cash for it\nOn the rich cameras were computer systems in your case it's actually heavy equipment we don't own any heavy equipment um couple pickup trucks to do delivery and stuff around here and one bus that keeps running us between buildings\nBut other than that we don't have any big stuff like that but still I cannabis breaking down all the time but on the bus used\nDonald Harris drives our bus everyday runs us back and forth between our little shuttled between our things and it's it was a huge shuttle and I paid attempt for it on a new one called ...\nAnd H run I mean it's broken down a couple of times when we rented a shuttle for that day when it broke down kept kept moving we'll put it in the shop and fixed it but I mean for that little bit of inconvenience it's safe and it's been reliable enough to get the job done and not shut us down\nAnd so that's a minor example but it's filling in the same metaphor and so yeah you can you can make this work\nBy use to pay cash for your equipment otherwise all you do is work for nothing\nOh you do is end up with no money for all your work because and and the you know the heavy equipment dealer gets all your money and that just doesn't work for me I don't want to live that way [noise] Josh is in Savannah hey Josh welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you doing\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\nMy wife and not from Alabama or Georgia almost a year ago\nAnd we have our tags for our cars are are coming up to be viewed and in Alabama you pay for your

much rain whenever we test drove it it's not much room as we thought it would be once we got strollers you\nKnow if you want to move to a different car that's fine I don't think you have to do this
