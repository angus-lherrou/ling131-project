{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "Well ah I'm going to start with the good old fashioned grandma sitting at the dining room table and you've got a piece of paper you draw a line right down the middle and left side you write prose and ally side you wrote your right cons because here's the deal you are experiencing gross what do you think just a moderate projection over the next two years that growth could be\n\nModerately I think you know we could probably [laughter] I'd be confident almost saying we could double our uh our sales\nI just okay so here again of course the alternative ... but I'm just saying\nI Would I Would not do anything until I had a list that said there were double the amount of prose with crazy upside than there are ... and right now on the surface Christie I don't see what the pros would be unless I'm missing something she's gone bananas\nArms are flailing loving them to the lady raven\nHere here's what jumped out to me and I hear that's in your voice because I have got entrepreneur in my DNA we get so excited about shiny and new and someone has an opportunity here's my question for you or even\nIf they had never approached you would you want to sell the business\nWere you thinking about selling business is selling the business something you want to do if the opportunity had not presented itself because that's your motivation it's in line with your goals your game plan is that something you're excited about if that person ever came to you\nWant to quit but um I Love what I Do and a half the time I Want to know for my hair\nEntrepreneurial journey that's just a real live [laughter]\nYou know um so I I I think if the if the situation we're right that then we're absolutely interested um you know I I understand what you're saying it's typical for someone like me to think about working for somebody else\nUm but the the people you know that that are interested um uh we believe our values the line um you know they talked about keeping us on and the staff on and continuing to grow and operate more or less how we are now\nAll right so let me put you to the test group and let's say you say yes to this they've made you a financial offer you don't have to say it but you know what the number is correct\nOr we're not quite there yet okay\nWell okay even more so let's say that it's a very attractive number\nAnd I want you to say okay they give us a really attractive number that raises my eyebrows and then I Want you to think or if they do what they say they're going to do and you stay around for a little bit but then eventually you're out\nIf you get the number that makes you really excited but you know that it's possible that they push you out at some point in the near future and you are just left with the number and memories\nAre you going to be okay with that I think that's what Christie simple it's really shiny and they should be shiny I think there's a lot of shy but let me ask you what you want is that you argue cool with that ... years from now ... ... you would be cool with that [noise]\n[noise] yes I think I Would be\nOkay when you know hey you got to go with your gut on the one that's the thing is like in business we would love for there to be an absolute formula that says this is always right this has always wrong there's black and white are certainly some of that\nBut a lot of times as business owners were making a value call there's going to be rescued away either way you're going to take on risk of okay I'm going to sell it and then I'm Out like I'm Out forever I'm giving up this baby I'm giving up ownership to what the growth could be in the next three to five Fifteen Years or you could stay with it you know like men there was ...\nThat's where I gave up that awesome offer the shiny things so\nThat's the thing in business you're you're really asking Reuben I think of value decision of what do you want what's in line with your goals were you going to be in three years do you wanna be sitting dreaming about something new with that awesome I'm Out in your bank account or do you want to be in the business and you actually taking credit for all that growth both both could be great it's really up to the ribbon at your business a true life\nGo with your heart run the scenarios use commonsense go with your heart let's go to Adam is on the line in New York New York Adam how can we help\nHey guys thanks for taking my call so uh I'm In a career very started career you've been in my wife and I paid off pretty much all of our house and uh it's coming to the point right now where you know this idea that Fifteen Years and\nI don't know where to start the kind of watch the business ideas so what it is is I'm looking for a pet friendly public way that offers food and beverage to you know bringing the community together um found a prime location um landowner won two hundred thousand a year for early and basically it just kinda [noise]\nI Know there's a demand out there for it I reached search but from there don't even know where to start\nHow would you monetize this this this sale of the food and beverage is\nYeah so it would be felt proven a beverage or along with kind of like a membership fee to get inside the crime is\nJust so you can drink we are like\nA a mix between it's a mix between like a like a gym membership and all the dog park or just you know unlimited access to the facility but that also food and beverage just for a book\nOkay I've got a question for you for this market 'cause you said you've done research you said there's demand for it for this particular particular market that you're going to serve that's going to pay this membership fee and so on what problem or you solving for them through this business\nIn the area that I mean right now they don't have any type of public access dog park for at least twenty five mile it's all private effort on the roads have been totally\nSo this is a dog park meets food and beverage meets\nTech yeah So Adam she's asking the core thing there is no place to take your dog isn't that the big issue you there's no place to take your dog to run around there's no public dog park\nThat though there are um but what the town does is they're constantly ... hours with that type of access or anything like that so this is kind of just a blend between all three I'm primarily yes dog park\nUm but then also it kind of like a gentrified type of situation where you know if I Want to go there and have some type of craft beer or food truck style food um you know all that is on premise\nI say here's what I meant challenge us Adam 'cause I Know we're running short on time\nI I don't think your idea is bad and you seem like you've done your research and I totally get if I could totally see hipsters with their dogs and their laptops they eat and drink and expensive ... like I can totally see what I Want to challenge you to do is\nThink of a one point over and that's the point of version I Want you to think of what is the lowest lowest hanging fruit what is a way to baby step your way into this business without the risk and the commitment of two hundred grand that you may or may not have when the demand may not be there yet\nHow can you start this up on the ground floor organically in a local park in your backyard or really unimpressive version to justify it get some revenue coming in before you take the next step I just want you to prove the idea\nBefore you take out some raskin cost and that type of things I just want to tell you what that's the big dream what the baby version of that dream that you could test first\nThat's really good advice this is an idea I don't know if it's a good idea but I got to give it to this might be a thing where you start to sit down with local town leaders and go hey we need a full public\nParks just for like ... no limits none of this stuff just anytime you want to show up your show that meeting the first need then go have one of the changes that I could get a license to sell so that you got to buy stuff that was at one point are you guys are getting mines in the room because the two hundred thousand dollar amount it's hard can to get\nPeople to pay for something they set for free I don't know what it's like in New York but in Tennessee dog parks are free\nSo I think he's going to sell the food and the drawl of it though all yeah but people have a free place to hang out to get food they don't have a membership I don't know I just got to understand what problem you're solving formed jets go Hey Chris here I think the one I Want to thank our producer James child's their system associate producer Zach Bennett and of course you America thank you so much\nFor the rancher shows [noise]\nTally of trees\nAre you one of the millions of empty nesters are look around their house and just see unused space it might be time to downsize\nBut when you raised a family and I have a lot of emotions tied

messages so they can make us by ads from well it doesn't really work that way guys but I Try anyway he says what's the difference between a credit union in a\nBank a bank is owned by stock holders that when the bank makes a profit and they should make a profit we want them to make some profit when the bank makes a profit the stock\nBoulders the owners of the company\nYet that profit basically I mean it is the profits dispersed in the form of um dividends or the value of the stock has increased because the bank continue ... whatever it is but basically the owners of a bank are stockholders and that's where the profit goes\nA credit union is operated more like a cooperative\nWhere the owners of a credit union are there it's actually not for profit technically speaking and um the not the owners of the credit union are the credit union members which are also the customers\nAnd so as a customer of the credit union those services in interest rates and whatever you pay in with a credit union they profit that has created\nIs return to their members in the form of increased services or in the form of actual dispersed much\nI mean sometimes you actually just get a little check from your credit union put into your account and so uh that's the difference um banks don't ... don't offer banks don't like credit unions they say they have an unfair advantage\nBecause there have non profit status I'm One of us really not true\nUm the it's real simple the credit union simply does not make a profit because whatever profit is made just plow back into cheaper checking accounts better interest rates on loans or higher interest rates on savings\nAnd so the you know basically they end up not making a profit so if a bank wanted to uh make less profit could do the same thing\nSo they don't have a disadvantage they're just trying to keep stock holders happy and sell stuff to customers the credit union has customers that are the stockholders in a sense the owners are the members and so it returns and all of that really doesn't matter ...\nIf you'd get good service from the organization\nAnd so we endorsed credit unions are not because of their nonprofit status but because they have reasonably priced goods and ... are reasonably priced banking services for you to use and you'll be treated not like a number\nYou'll be treated ... by you know people that actually care you'll also have that similar experience at a local community by a regional bank and that's who I Do business with personally\nI don't personally have an account right now a credit union I'm not opposed to I just don't my stuff our our business accounts and our a personal accounts are all have local or reach\nOur regional and I'm a community banks in our area we do business with several banks\nAnd so and it's very simple it just because I Need to pick up the phone and talk to a human being that actually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller ... kind of thing but but in you know that's what you should want you should be able to walk in and talked to a human and not be treated like a number\nAnd you know so I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo\nOr bank of America it's beyond me they treat you like crap and they over charging for most of the services\nAnd this day in time there online offerings their
