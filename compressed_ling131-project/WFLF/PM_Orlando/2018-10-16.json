school you didn't gain any ground you're just ... dollars\nSo it makes sense yeah\nSo I mean first thing we gotta do to make sure you have enough cash is that what you're talking about that you're going to have an up and pay some down the student loans or what\nThat's what I was trying to figure out a paper towel something between twenty grand between now and then the next fall when I go back to school I've gotten I you're not alone so I didn't know stating\nAnd immersing is the first thing the first call is complete school be a hundred percent sure way more than enough to complete school with no new debt now when do you finish school at the end of next year\nWill take about a year and a half\nAnd your degree will be and what\nA good businessman and created\nOkay and I'm\n... move you up in income immediately or are you working now what's your story\nYeah I've been I've been in and out of school I've got a management job now but I don't really see it being able to advance means like higher leadership all kind of my reach me going to go back to school to finish\nNo car which it's not a bad thing to finish up what you're doing I think that's a good plan but yeah the the first goal is to finish with no new debt and make plenty sure you got plenty more than enough to do that but let's say that you add it up and you're saying I Need twenty thousand dollars to finish all my school and then you save up thirty thousand\nAnd then you save up another ten thousand I wouldn't I mean Thirty's ... if twenties all you need thirties plenty that gives you a pad then everything above that you start paying off the dad if you got really really end of the money you see what I'm saying\nBut I mean I wouldn't be I wouldn't have two dollars extra I'd want a little extra to make sure you get through school with no new debt\nThat your first big goal now when you get out of school then we're going to practice dealt with a vengeance\nAnd that's going to be the process but um\nThat that that's just what we tell people don't don't go further and is your first call Jeffrey Rosen Atlanta Georgia Hi Jeffrey how are you\nHow you doing better than I deserve what's up [noise] I made a I work for a company that had the we support while I Will be paying if I Do\nWell I Will be paying one twenty appear to be there to lead a program but\nThey weren't in my car manufacturer they weren't ... who do you work for a BMW okay that is not a normal leasing program this was an Employee Benefit\nOkay and it is excellent because they furnish the car at at a cost that there's there's no way you could have hardly any car for no more than you're paying I mean ... ... you said two hundred and forty dollars right as three thousand dollars a year\nOkay if you bought that car it will go down three thousand dollars and twenty minutes in value\n... author you see what I'm saying so that is a bargain and do they not they furnish like a ... oil and stuff to ... ... is the gas\nEven furnished in that they are can't remember no no no there's one on one of the car manufacturers emerged but it's it's ... it's ... it's all the maintenance and the tires though right everything\nIs the insurance and that to ... see that's a deal of deal I mean you can't buy the tires and the insurance for three thousand dollars a year\nBut that's not a lease that's not like a standard okay they call it a lease but it's more of an employee benefits in other words BMW is losing money\nOn this transaction with you\nTo your benefit because you're an employee it's an employee benefits\nAnd they want their employees driving one of their fine automobiles and you guys do make a fine automobile\nTrying to get there yeah and and I if I remember ... you have what a selection that for that is that the price of a certain car or is that the price of a car up to a certain amount to buy a car no car the one that you liked or whatever okay All right well dude it's a deal\nI mean seriously you know ... you can't hardly buy insurance for that got much less the Tarzan maintenance much Leslie Lawson value but that's different than Joe walking off the street and leasing that car which he did it probably seven hundred dollars a month\nOkay you know and that would not be a good deal he should maybe by a BMW if he's got a lot of money and pay cash for it 'cause it's a good car but you're you're getting an Employee Benefit and it's a sweet deal for you I Would definitely do that if I worked for beamer\nIt's a bargain it's a great deal and there are several of the car manufacturers that have really good deals for their employees but you just kind of have to think about it of if I was driving\nYou know if you're driving ten thousand dollar car man you can't do that for three thousand dollars a year with what we're talking about here\nAnd you're certainly not driving a ten thousand dollar car what we're describing your probably driving forty thousand dollar car so a good question ma'am thank you for calling in and um again it was a great deal appreciate your joining us\nA Amy is on Twitter at Dave Ramsey is there an item or items that you refuse to pay for or by even though you could afford it now\nYeah sure I can\nAfford most anything I Want to do nowadays I mean not anything but most anything and some things just feel weird to me I feel I just don't want to have that invested in that\nUm I've got a friend that's worth um\nTens of millions of dollars and he's a watch guy and he bought a um a hundred and fifty thousand dollar watch which sounds just nuts but I mean he's got like ... million dollars that's a it's like most people buying a biscuit okay I can afford to do that it just I just\nI don't know it's not me number one and and I I'm I'm much been on a boat [laughter]\nBut not on a watch so I mean you know it is just being authentic with you you know\nBut uh uh so\nThe boats bigger than watch this account [laughter] so you\nKnow it just it's something that hits me funny but it's not really a value Judgement to say that\nMy point is is that I'm not mad at him for spending that on and watch he's got two hundred million dollars\nAnd if he spends a hundred and fifty grand on I'll watch it's nothing okay that guy's got plenty of money it's like most people bought a biscuit he gives away his is a generous generous hardest huge he helps lots and lots of hurting people and that's a very very small percentage of his world but emotionally I have trouble\nEven though intellectually I can get there and I'm not judging him emotionally yeah I ... I Would struggle doing that um but that doesn't mean it's wrong to do it just 'cause I Can't grasp it\nAh emotionally it it would be wrong to do it if it's a high percentage of his world and that's why we tell people like on your cars and stuff don't get into a high percentage of your you know your your financial world where you've got you know you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year and you've got eighty thousand or for the cars will that just stupid\nThat they can make a value Judgement on that does not emotions just mathematically dumb but when something is a small percentage of your world there are still some things that emotionally you just don't\nFeel right about but it doesn't mean that it's a more immoral for someone else to do it is my point and so\nAnd really a lot of you could learn that lesson 'cause some people judge other people because they can't emotionally grasped that\n[laughter] and just because you can't emotionally grasp something doesn't mean it's morally wrong there's a difference here I mean [noise] [noise] so anyway that's a good question I talk about a lot of that kind of stuff in the legacy journey book only book I've ever written about welfare and other books I've written about money and something that puts this hour that I've Ramsey show in the books we will be\nFine with me trying to remember there's ultimately only one way to financial\nDaily with the friends of fees [noise] and\nDidn't hear you ever talk to people who say things like becoming a millionaire was impossible these days or people are only millionaires because they come from already wealthy families\nWill we just got done with the largest research ever conducted on American millionaires and bill simple truth is everyday people become millionaires all the time how did they do it the overwhelming majority did so by investing consistently and with the help and guidance upper professional\nBats for our team has already done the hard work for you we've vetted and interviewed thousands of investing professionals all across the country who are committed to helping you reach your goals get started today\nGo to Dave Ramsey dot com slash smart dresser and look up the smart buster pros or in your area that's a big Ramsey dot com slash smart buster and be sure to check out my brand new book everyday millionaires it's available for pre order start in August seventh\nWFL that finding ...
