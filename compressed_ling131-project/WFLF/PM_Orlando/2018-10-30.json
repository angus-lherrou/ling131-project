K\nO shallow wanting to get a loan from the bank and by the car right okay um\n[noise]\nWell I mean there's two there's two things at poll heroin one is she's grown person and you know we don't tell her grown kids what to do we merely try to influence them but the other the other thing that's a pool is is what\nI Do something to what I participate in an activity was one of my children that I thought was bringing them harm even if they're grown and the answer to that would be no\nAnd you are working to get out of your son is working to get out of that you guys are made the decision that being in debt on cars on the other thing is is a bad idea it's not good for your finances\nAnd to turn around put her in dead or participate in activity is on an act of love and so um I appreciate her\nSentiment that she's standing on her own and she can do whatever she wants she's right but as your mom if I'm Ninety and you're eighty five and you're and you're Seventy or whatever I I'm Still going to love you and I'm Still not going to participate in an activity that's bringing your arm\nMhm I Love you too much to do that and ah and if you don't understand that I you know you have the right to be mad or you have the right\nThat I'm On line but I'm just cannot in good conscience participate in an activity\nIt's not good for you I Love you\nKnow I wouldn't sell it to her okay\nIf I were in power in your shoes I'm just thinking through how I Would I've got grown kids and one of them came to me and said you know I Want to do this thing and you're going to participate in those things that that that I don't agree with and that I don't think is good without good for them that I'm not going to do it they should buy or five thousand dollar carpet cash for it\nYou know how much debt do you have not counting your home\nI mean we have a hundred dollars and then what is your house or one eighty\nTo show how quickly are you going to have a hundred thousand paid do you think\nWe're looking at two years notch\nBad as long as they should take max fifty a year making one eighties not exactly the beat deeply sacrificing I'm now given all of those numbers four thousand dollars doesn't matter much you could just show or the car for four or five thousand\nOkay\nAnd not you know but no I won't sell it to you where you go into that I'm not going to participate in that activity okay\nBut if you want to sell it to ... and just help her um because of four thousand dollars doesn't move the needle much and out of a hundred you follow me or what moves the need a lot of a hundred is you're getting really emotional about deeply sacrificing and using the huge income you have declared there's that really really fast\nSo given those numbers I might give up you know some of my value in the car or you got to scrape together five hundred and you pay me cash five thousand you can have a car I might do that but hunting I Am not going to participate you going into bad\nYou're going to have if you're going to be that you're going to do it somewhere else because I Love you too much to participate in something that brings harm to you\nAnd that's even if my kids are grown and that's not me interfering in their life and that's not me being a control freak it's I'm not going to participate in anything that I don't think is good for you that brings you harm\nBecause I care about you and if they can't get that statement than they are option that little rebellious twitch\nSeriously I mean that's just I mean if they can't hear love coming from you\nThat way then there's something wrong but in your case with the numbers I might if you're on your show it to him cheap that's okay too but he's the one is fine with me but no going into debt is not an option Amy is with us in Spokane, Washington Hi Amy how are you\nGood Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I've been listening to you for a couple of weeks and all but then I started filling out college applications that my daughter my son's already in college and\nRight now I'm just like how did we get him into much debt already he's in two years\nThat he started his second year of school and my daughter was like I said in the fall that he already has um like ten thousand dollars and a and school loans and then we have fourteen thousand and apparent pie phone [noise]\nMhm [noise] and so I'm just struggling and know how do I get through this thing how do I get\nThem through college where is he in school [noise] ah Washington state University in your motives the tuition\n[noise] ah about well the first year at twenty seven ... it is um [noise] around [noise] I Can't even think\nTwelve eight and twelve thousand okay tough that probably pretty close Gallo\nBut it should be about there in state tuition and the average ... something like that the national average is about ten but I think Washington is a little bit harder okay and so um that's the tuition only and he's living away from home on campus\nNo he's not living on campus you know the thing in our trade paying very minimal for rent\nOkay that's good news okay working\nYeah he works about twenty five hours per week right now but he does make about fourteen dollars an hour\nThat's decent okay good good [noise] okay and we got to get him on a really really tight budget immunity to be applying for scholarships left and right yeah you got to help him sit down and figure out what you can contribute\nTo the equation she'll between his hard work between the scholarships and you can ear contribution and the fact that he's in a reasonably inexpensive school\nUm we just sit down and really iron the wrinkles out of this and figure out how we can pull it all together and make it happen with no more debt and do that anymore debt\n[noise] okay so then my question is we had the third we have a car loan where\nWe have a car loan for Thirteen thousand five hundred dollars and then I've got he's got that parent PLUS Loan now do I start hammering on the parent PLUS Loan or do a camera and the car loan car\nLoan a car loan and then the parent plus non yes\nOkay because I didn't know if that 'cause you know when you go down your um [noise] yeah um I didn't know invest for kids with\nThis number five but we're not investing for now trying to cash flow with them yeah help him get through with no more new debt you're you're not you're past the point of saving for college or trying to get through college now\nAnd then my daughter is starting in the fall she is selling out scholarship she does have we do have some money you know not much but a little bit of money saved sure\nI'm good work like an animal and she has only out like ten scholarship applications a day\nAnd again she chooses an inexpensive school the least expensive option possible because you guys were broke and you're trying to foolish together as a family and get these two kids through school it can be done but it's going to require a lot of work a lot of scholarships and choosing the inexpensive school option and there's no shame\nIn that game and some people do it every day people go a hundred dollars\nAnd that puts
