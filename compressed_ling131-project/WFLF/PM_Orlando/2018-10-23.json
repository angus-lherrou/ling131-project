{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "This is a Nineteen Ninety two accurate and at ... at it from the new twenty five years ago\nOkay you bought a brand new okay brand new before her well before and um yeah and so what does the car worth probably thirty five forty thousand dollars now while it's done well okay\nWell I pay for it but that twenty five years\nAgo yeah I'm Still I'm shocked at a known them more than that I'm the I'm\nOkay and so what is your household income\nProbably two fifty year\nAll right and uh what is your net worth\nPushing close to three million okay\nUm\nWell I don't know why you would sell like ... you know you should keep a car\nCar they listen let me tell you how might let me let me tell you how America decision okay here is that you make the decision the color is a she's exactly right it's completely impractical it's a toy okay it's emotional but this is like asking her to sell her wedding ring and she doesn't realize that\nI Would never get to do that\nRight and it's a car you've had for twenty five years it's caught it actually means something to your number one number two it is eight oh trust small percentage of your net worth if you'd call me up and said I make sixty thousand dollars a year were broken in debt and I love my car\nWould've said weighing little boys show your car which are not broken into your worth three freaking million dollars you could drive this car off a cliff and it you wouldn't even notice it doesn't change your net worth one iota okay it's such a small percentage of your world it doesn't matter it's like most people buying a biscuit\n[noise] okay and so it doesn't matter it just sits there\nNow in my mind and Keith [laughter] I ... I got my like copilot here yeah I can tell [laughter] you understand so I I Am afraid that would be one of those cars that if you sell it ten years from now you'll see it on TV I you know I don't even\nDon't even care about I don't I don't even care about that ah the point is it's\nA toy you like it yes and it's so freaking smaller percentage of your world it does not matter\nYes if it's if it if it becomes worse a dollar tomorrow\nIt doesn't matter it doesn't change your life that's right you know it's a very ... that's how you justify toy you do it on ratios\nYou know and I like this friend of mine just bought a jet he just bought a ten million dollar jet huh okay that's a nice jet\nMary but he's worth two billion ten million as a percentage of two billion uh-huh that's like this car for you or like most people buying a biscuit it doesn't affect his world\nTen million and my my I grew up many our tendency ten million dollars is what we call a lot of money you know a forty thousand dollar car sitting in your garage is what we call a lot of money you know I grew up that way but it's a small\nPercentage of your world and that's how you can tell if you're out of whack or not with this is just a toy\nIt's just a toy it's just an expensive toy and so she wants to renovate the dining room and spend forty thousand dollars is that you can afford it shut up you do it yeah and if you want to go on vacation and it's been ten thousand dollars on a cruise you can afford it\nI make two hundred fifty thousand freaking dollars a year and your debt free and you're worth three million dollars you've done it man you work like no one else can you enjoy some of it I Want you to be outrageously generous on the other hand I don't want you to be wise and continue investing\nAnd I don't want you to go buy something that costs a million dollars it's a toy that would be out a line in your world Yes sir but this is a small percentage of your world and so that's why you win the argument she is correct that it is a useless impractical thing but it's not\n[laughter] you'd a man\nSo it's you know she wins that part of the argument I get that she doesn't get it I don't blame her for that part she's actually using common sense\nBut it's a small it's a limp on a limb to brush you know and that's the way you look at it and so you know I've had to learn to work with at work and when the wealthy people because I couldn't emotionally grass\nAnd I caught myself saying stupid but stuff like ... much for a guy guy guy\nAnd all that is is poor man thinking\nThat's all that is that's loser talk ... she'd ever have a house that no one should ever had two houses no one should ever have a ten million dollar jet no one should ever have a forty thousand or ... said stupid stuff like that and I had to quit doing that because when I look up and I realized for some people ratio wise\nIt's lint on a limb rush and that's if that's what it is then you can afford to do it if you can burn it in the backyard as in next week's bonfire and it doesn't change your life then you can afford to quote waste the money unquote\nFor enjoyment purposes and that's fine that's why you work but also be generous be giving be helping others with this wonderful net worth in this wonderful income have that as part of the mix I'm sure you are you told me you're sending your employees through a financial piece you're doing other stuff I'm sure church or whatever that kind of stuff so great\nBut it just doesn't matter\nAnd it's just like me I Am looking at my buddies ten million dollar jet ... dead credible so sweet ride I'll just tell you man but it's a small percentage of his two billion dollar world a billion I don't think about that with me I thought I was a million\n... he's got two thousand million\nAnd out of two thousand million he spent ten of them you see what I mean as a ratio that's not much it's like having two hundred thousand dollars in spending ten thousand bucks\nI think about\nIt didn't change your life right you'd be All right but you know when you know you don't even feel it hardly\nIt doesn't it doesn't move the needle and that's not being wasteful\nAt that stage of the game so hold on to any that's a wonderful question made my day to get to answer it and I'm Glad the co pilot was there it was a fun discussions hang on I'm going to send you a copy of the book the legacy journey you you to read that you will enjoy it it's where we discuss wealth all my other books about money\nLegacy journeys about wealth wealth is different than money\nMoney creates wealth but wealth is different than money it's a different subject has a different subject biblical like if you're if for those of us that are Christians those of us are the people of faith the Bible addresses wealth differently than addresses money money as transactional money's the thing we used to buy food for kids and that calling wealth is different\nWolf has more problems with it but more opportunities with it\nAnd one of the things is is that you are encouraged scripture early to enjoy the fruits of your labor\nNot to be a heat and dust\nAnd not to be ... but you know enjoy it and I've got some nice cars I've got a classic car drove it's fat drove a Sunday out in the sun my wife and I stopped down ... got a Nineteen sixty Corvette about the other day\nIt's a sweetie looks like I'm Marilyn Monroe car right now driving around those trends got a little hat on I'm not driving miss daisy [noise] you know it was a lot of fun to all people running around in this cool car it was neat\nAnd ah but hey it's a small percentage of my world a small percentage um our very small percentage of our own so I think for listening to this hour that Iran's are showing the bugs will be back with you before you know it in the meantime remember there's ultimately only one way to financial fees\nDaily with the friends of these\nIssues or something [noise]\nHey it's tally Daniel associate producer in ... in the Senate pain Dave Ramsey sound listeners paid out ... million dollars in cash [laughter] that's pretty impressive continue this year listening to morning Theresa [noise]\nNow did you know statistically when it comes to life insurance in protecting your family that women are more likely to be uninsured or under insured than men this doesn't make any sense women make up half the workforce contributes mightily to family incomes\nAnd in many cases are the breadwinners and take care of their families twenty four hours a day this is one of the most overlooked areas when it comes to financial planning\nDoesn't change the equation that it's still\nGoing to be worth eighty thousand your turned into forty thousand and two years ... even if it's ... even is paid for it and I wouldn't use my retirement to finance my stupid\n'cause that's what you're doing and no no absolutely not\nSo here's the thing you guys can do whatever you want to if I woke up in your shoes having coached more people\nInto wealth and out of debt than anybody else on this planet but what I Do I Would sell something\nA car or a trailer and I don't care which one which one do you like more your luggage truck more I mean Dr ten thousand our truck the difference ten thousand our truck dirty dozen our trucks not much certainly not I got both of them sitting around her run somewhere but it it's just not that much and so I don't care\nIf the trailers if your children's entire psyche is wrapped around the fact they get to stay in the trailer occasionally and you want to really pour\nInto the children and the children the children the children the children the children the children the children the children the children the children the German soldiers truck\nOr if maybe we figure out tent camping is just as much fun or more fun for the kids as much fun for you [noise] um\nAnd it's not twenty seven thousand dollars cash tour Seventy dollars you might want to go that route for the children I don't know above but wants to keep his truck I'm finally the way it is amassing kid you're not going to get rich on and stuff goes down in value Brian is with us in Destin, Florida Hi Brian how are you\n[noise] ah [noise]\nAh we're gonna have to get your phone fix what's the problem with it [laughter] I'm like oh yeah that saying what Iran or talk into it okay try that\nHow you doing today they have good how can I help um\nI had a good problem that I ran into this um my statement I when I was Nineteen I was in the navy and I got a wonderful thirty thousand dollar bonus and I had a great either tell me who invested\nBack at Nineteen and when I did that I put a hundred dollars a month and while I was in the navy for four years while I forgot about it\nAnd it that there are on now only the and we were going through the art they'll try to get out of debt\nAnd found the statement by look it up now or at one point three million dollars and I didn't know
