Ninety six people were approved so I mean that's that's those are the odds you want you know\nI Want I Want to wait ten years only to find out that the government's scam me basically so I'm not I

good stuff All right Tim is one of those in Binghamton New York Hi Jim how are you\nDave how're you doing better than I deserve how can I help [noise]\nOh well I have a quick question I'm about three hundred dollars in debt among or twenty five and my car is about to go but I'm trying to office faith and pay off the debt as quick as possible joined question is is right now I'm putting a seven percent of my paycheck\nInto my photo and K shed doing all that down to about one to two percent and just started throwing money at this loan right now and go to about a hundred dollars a week at it ... just to get it knocked out as fast as possible but I Want to hear opinion should also thank you for so much\nI you know you've got to videos and lifting your show you've helped me avoid a lot of bad decisions like buying a crappy out and going into like a twenty thousand dollar car loan show I really appreciate that\nCool good so well thank you um what do you make what's your income\n[noise] I Do about twenty three thousand dollars after taxes but that's not including the overtime that I get\nYou know what are you there I'm a welder okay should get a lotta overtime or for the most part can you get more Oh absolutely no\nShowing a temporary basis you could really load up your overtime and clean up the ... very very quickly and then save up and get you know in case you're cars have of your emergency fund and then save up and move up in car and cash\nThat would be my learning to do now that would be my first three goals with what I heard didn't then and only then what are restart\nMy four oh one K. so what I'm saying is temporarily not forever but maybe for a year or maybe even to completely stop your four O. one K. to become completely debt free builds your emergency fund is three to six months of expenses and then\nOnce you've done that to save up and pay cash for a car and that's by ... and then you moved to babysit for and restart their four O. one K. and then you start putting Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement but at that point you don't have any payments and you're driving a paid for decent car\nAnd these are all a really good place for you to be and that that's the direction I Would tell you to move towards show yeah while we have people working these baby steps Tim unless your own baby step forward telling you to temporarily\nTemporarily temporarily stop your four O. one K. investing Andrew is with us in Dallas texas hey Andrew how are you\nI'm doing well David how're you doing better than I deserve what's up oh not a\nWhole lot I recently took a new job we're making a good amount of money and I'm very curious about ... stadium more wanted us to get more\nMhm okay um ... are you out of debt\nI'm going to get us are going to get off the whole nine yards should\nDo you have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nAre about twenty grand theater currently\nOkay so what would you be saving for them\nAnd that's the whole thing I knew John ... wrote about five days a week so buying a house kind of out of the question right now mhm\nSo I guess the question what should be enforced it couldn't be more in the Roth IRA right by our age or something I mean he looked for towards future would you recommend\nWell you're at what we call baby step for she'd be starting to put Fifteen Percent of your income away for retirement or beyond that if you wanted to start piling some money into an investment to buy a home later that wouldn't be a bad thing but today it doesn't sound like you're on the market for home yeah\nYeah so it sounds like him to get your retirement savings started and a Fifteen Percent of your income going into that take your gross income before taxes point one five as Fifteen Percent and then get that started in your four one K. do it in a Roth if you can match or if you can if you can't uh\nThen let's do we'll go to Ross on your own to a Roth IRA on your own and let's make sure you're getting that money set aside if you'll say Fifteen Percent of your income throughout your whole life into good mutual funds in a retirement plan you'll be a millionaire usually a multi millionaire actually and um so we can just at least get that started and then beyond that if you want to save\nTowards the house or even invest some money aside mutual fund that's not a retirement account to use for house later you could do that but let's get Fifteen Percent of started now and I think if you're going to get you had it in the right direction so\nGood question man

you're never back again okay so I I Want to revisit part of the conversation 'cause I'm trying to get into your brain and see how you made the decisions to do this so you use the money that was going to be used for you to have a place to stay in a in a a\n... in an apartment to fix your car so instead of being Carlos you chose homeless ...\nOr so what had occurred was that was and parks will a part of the very small town\nSo I wasn't able to find work because it was in the summer so everybody was already very over now so I mean where I had to have a vehicle to drive down to a Korea will be able to secure somewhere I've been working in two shots at the moment mhm\nEvent that I Would have used that money to get a ... um I wouldn't have had transportation to get to work I guess\nThey don't ... know buses drive from a a cheap bus ticket wouldn't have got new to the pleasure that you're living now um and ...\nWell being was early like where the like the car you emotionally and\nSo part of how you got here I guess my point is not necessarily jobs or even financial is just bad decision making and I'm not I'm not trying to shame now that I'm just trying to say I want to analyze how you got here so we never get here again and that's what I'm trying to do with you OK\nI'm at ... and so what we've got to do is say OK when in doubt we have a place to live show I'm the second thing that

his tuition to go to college and so there's work to be done that pays a whole lot more than ten hours a week as a server with bad tips in your situation and so I got to do something to create income here and it's probably some kind of\nSelf employed unpleasant thing that you do for a little while but that pays really good\nI mean for a short term all heavy clean out septic tanks with a toothbrush ship it pays good to get you some money okay 'cause right now in the short term you need money right that's what we're doing and I've done all those kinds of things on the subject and go to Russia but I've done everything else okay\nUh you know cut grass and hauled trash away and shoveled stuff and I've done\nAll that kinda stuff and and honestly you can get people doing that kind of stuff for them or to pay you better event then you can make six dollars an hour or somewhere you know uh and so what happens is is your spend a lot of your effort\nTrying to analyze the local job economy and get jobs suck\nAnd I'm trying to think of how we can get you working a lot like your car running\nYeah my car and driving and delivered pizzas there\nUm\nI think I could probably make our money serving like I\nWas I mean I again I don't know British Columbia but everywhere else you deliver pizzas if you'll do that like five six seven nights a week you can make two thousand dollars a month and we can get you in an apartment\nYeah yeah ... ... as I Am ...

goes like two years ago something happened when\nI started looking at my kids and I was like well maybe we should start saving for that main stop paying for him I mean\nAll those years it was all your well\nIt was both of our guys are really started in about a hundred and forty eight years ago and we were willing it down but we're just sick and tired of it and a\nLong into following your plan we

people when they say you paid off all your debt when you say you pay off your debts and they have to do that\nWhile I think we first started to start to budget together and really get both parties involved all in I was a little bit more passive early on and then I started to really look at the number and then we got really focus so we use every dollar\nWe're just all in\nYou know when she went and got her a second job started working that when I was like well I Can't let her know do that on her own and so then I started working as much overtime as possible as well so okay\nAll right and she got involved in the budgeting huh\nYeah so I'm the spender and uh it definitely is a as the nerve gets involved heavily it it definitely uh goes a lot further\nEffects if the saver get involved as well and both of your work on it they're just accountability absolutely\nThat was the only thing I was the thing is keeping tighter accountability accountable yeah\nUm we also um me like a vision board um until we had like chains we've really got that the kid who was involved in and take links on our chains that have have them involved and they loved it so I'm kind of cool cool so how'd you
