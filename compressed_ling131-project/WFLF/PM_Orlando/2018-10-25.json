I just mean getting more equipped and getting up to date to make yourself marketable\nFind out what that is that when you find out what that is the next question is how much is this going to cost me financially\nThen the next question is based on my budget based on getting out of debt and everything that's going on in my life if it's going to cost me this much much financially how long will it take for me to complete that qualification which will then make me qualified and marketable to do the role I wanted to\nJosh ... that's all you got to do because once you get the answers to those questions that's your plan\nYou understand you just plug and play at this point alright continue this much telling me I say this much money I take this class this course and then you begin to practice proximity and talk to people who are in the Web design space in Winston Salem North Carolina\nWho's hiring Web designers or this could be companies that hire internal people or maybe it's a marketing group Asia you begin to identify targets now this is all happening Josh while you're paying off debt\nAnd this current sixty five thousand dollar over time gig\nIs not going to burn you out any more 'cause you're going to change your attitude towards gratitude which is this job is setting me up to step\nEasily and triumphantly into the role that I ultimately want to ... do you see where that is you see that about a year from now or it may be sooner if you get the qualifications sooner and you can get a Web design job that's going to pay you sixty five thousand or sixty thousand\nAfter you've paid off the debt it's a game changer\nAll of a sudden Josh you wake it up on Monday morning fired up and feeling so white you're not even sure if you're sitting in the car\n[laughter] where they're trying to you but I mean you can see that can't you\nAre ten times as many of 'em were you saying that it makes me my my attitude trained already and I'm I'm Glad I call Jim ... clarity that leader\nWill listen me and I'm Glad you called because I think there are millions of people they just heard your story and they see themselves in your story\nBecause you've you've got to figure it out and and it's just\nComing up with a basic plan Dave Ramsey has been giving people a plan for twenty five plus years\nA folks there's five stages the ... and the dream one discovery who am I what do I want to do what I Want to do it next research you just heard me walk Josh throat research what I Need to learn to be able to do what I Want to do then after I figure out the research what I Need to know who I Need to know\nUh when I Need to learn who I Need to know then we're going to move into\nActually embarking stepping out in making something happen practice that proximity prince will get around people they're doing what you want to do get in places where what you want to do is happening that's the embarking you're gonna start knocking off those mini milestones and those goals\nYou're going to begin to achieve and as you achieve\nYou eventually going to step into that dream roll the role that you were created to fill the world needs you to perform\nAnd that's the final stage of ... and the dream that's meaning waking up like\nJosh wants to wake up each thread Monday morning how many of you dread Monday morning they'll be a shame that Seventy percent of Americans no longer [noise]\nThrilled to sit in for Dave Ramsey want to thank day for allowing me to do this career ... sank are preserved James trials in our associate producer Kelly Daniel but mostly you fine America thank you so much for listen this is that they ran for sure [noise]\n\nTally Daniel producer and find the ... do you have a ramp listener said on the million dollars for any of their\nPlus face it this is a hectic time of year but here's the deal it's not an excuse to lose track of your spending especially when we made it so incredibly easy for you with our free budgeting tool called every\nDollar with every dollar you give every dollar a name at the beginning of the month and then you track the expenses against your budget throughout the month it's really that easy\nIn fact you could do it straight from your smartphone in between running your kids for music lessons to soccer practice and the best part is by using every dollar you know exactly how much money you can spend on school supplies clothes and pumpkins ...\nCreate your first budget today in less than ten minutes just to answer a few easy questions about your money ... income and expenses and every dollar will do the rest folks that I mentioned it's free just started to date\nThe every dollar EPA's available for your iPhone and Android in the app store Google Play store or budget on your own desktop at every dollar dot com it's free\nGo to I found that bind heels ...
