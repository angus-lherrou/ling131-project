{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "You know this is Tom ... extra team can help you with that and get rid of those and then the cars how much do you owe on your cars\n[noise] um we had a truck right now that's forty five out of an ... mile and your household income is what I'm way I had that grow about one thirty here you know\nYou know get rid of both of them and just get you to be years from now while you get this mess cleaned up it's not a forever car ... it's just a short period of time but if you can\nDo the huge amount of money you got going out the door on cars and the huge amount of loss or taken every day and appreciation of how fast you're going down in value is just destroying you guys so I I Would just moved down to like to five thousand dollar cars and\n[laughter] you know even if you got a little bit on those and you got a little bit on where you were upside down finance it over to credit union or something will cover their mouth that you're in the whole it's still a lot less debt than you've got now and you stop the bleeding\nAnd so I guess I'm not exactly sure how to go about doing that if they're going to be on a little\nWhile here and we walk you through it okay let's take the thirty two thousand dollar car that's the dead on the car correct yeah unless pretend that when you look that car up on the Kelley Blue book that you can private cell that car for um like twenty eight thousand which will be like four thousand in the whole\nThing now where do we get to four thousand well you obviously don't have any money you're broke right so you're going to either borrow that from your local credit union or your bank\n\nAnd you'll be four thousand dollars in debt instead of twenty eight states that have thirty two thousand dollars and that so that's huge progress right there okay and the and then let's say that I come up to buy the car a hinder a check for twenty eight thousand you put the four thousand you borrowed from the credit union with it and pay the car off that get you the title to give to me the buyer\nMy okay and that's how you do it now who are your loans with on the cars\nWent after the credit and want to throw ally\nOkay the allied deal will ... will work just like I talked about just now the credit union you may be able to sit down with them and convince them by sitting in person in the manager's office only so it's not a telephone conversation\nBut you may try to say hey look this is how far we are upside down on this car which means that you have a partially secured loan\nYou have alone is secured by this much the value of the car the rest of this one was in an secured loan right\nYou understand what I'm saying yeah OK then the uh\nAnd so Mr manager all we're asking you to do is to admit that it's an secured by giving us in ... alone for the amount that you're there were in the whole I Want to sell the car and get out of this debt\nOkay and then you got a\nFive thousand dollar loan and credit unions whenever the differences are you know at the credit union instead of a forty five thousand dollars or whatever the word whatever the numbers work out to be but I Would dump both of these cars get into some very very cheap cars for a period of time while you clean this mess up and it's going to take you a couple of years clean this mess up\nOh yeah but five years from now you'll be driving anything you want to drive you pay cash for it\n[noise] and it's not like help and\nIt's not open I mean you you can do it mathematically if you just take the steps and sacrifice to get there but you've got to amputate I you know these\nCars I mean you've got a thousand dollars a month car payments are more probably twelve hundred\nAnd um you know it's just it's choking you to death\nHere to feel so much more free when you get rid of those stupid vehicles and then later on get you whatever you want your drive like no one else or later you can drive like no one else you'd live like no one else so later you can live and give like no one else ... is with us in San Antonio Hi Betty Lou how are you\nCan you hear me now yes ma'am how can I help\nI Am I was telling your comrade that I felt like on the poster child at sixty two are having a bad financial decisions and not by a semi retirement\nAnd the reason I'm calling because I I Am working fulltime on sixty two and I\nWant to find out how to leverage my situation my income by say they sat around I have found that to ensure at least a reasonably comfortable retire at which I plan [laughter]\nEight years should go to a much do you make\nI make a sixty six thousand a year\nGood ... how much do you have\nTwenty thousand standing on that and I am twenty eight hundred do online vehicle which our pay off by\nOkay so twenty two twenty three thousand dollars in debt making sixty six that's good All right and how much money do you have saved not counting retirement\nOkay All right how the government's version of a borrowing hey which is a threat they by and I'm sure you're familiar with it and I have about eleven thousand and and I was\nYou have any money to other than that saved\nI have a thousand dollar fine\nOkay good All right cool well we stop adding the ts pay temporarily yes I I I well I took it down to one percent stop temporarily and could concentrate on those twenty three thousand dollars worth of debt with an airline and you've got squeeze\nEvery dollar out because when you don't have any payments then you have control of your most powerful wealth building too\nWhich is your income right now it's all going on student loans carpet damage so we get rid of the car payment you're a student loan payment that we build an emergency fund raising the thousand dollar up to a three to six months of expenses emergency fund baby step three and then maybe step for is saving Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement\nAnd um you know where will that leave you is the next question so we'd like sixty six thousand dollars let's just pretend for a second\nAnd Fifteen Percent of that is Ninety nine hundred and ... says eight hundred bucks a month\nGive or take nine hundred bucks a month something like that going into retirement um and we start with eleven thousand or ... thousand now that I'm putting this on the calculators were mumbling alright on on the calculator and we're going to do this for say I'm\nI'll just put ten years in there for the phone I was just to see what it does\nShe what kind of money we end up with here that would be about a quarter million dollars\nThat you would have at retirement and you would be Seventy two at that point um and that's not counting any kind of match from the government a lot of most of us but you don't have a match and that's not counting any raises you get during the next ten years while you're working\nBut if your debt free and bother in your house will be paid off too by the way um and so if your debt free one hundred percent and you have two to three hundred thousand dollar sitting there\nGoing to make it I'd like to have you have a lot more but it's not as a whole bunch of for peace from social in security is your only\nWay to retire um and you certainly don't have to buy the cookbook Seventy two ways to prepare a bow and love it you'll be able to eat so you put the income for three hundred grand along with um\nThe income from Social Security in your early seventies and everything is paid for 'em I think you'll be okay uh we're we're past panic mode anyway because we now have a

I Want to learn about the Seventy five hundred dollar idea and try that a couple of times I'll I'll gamble a little bit with the medical profession if I'm In your shoes in other words\nAnd that helps me if I'm In your shoes go hey we're going to take a couple of months off and we're going to take ten thousand dollars and and then we're going to go back at it again on the debt while we see how that works out and then if we need to stop again and go at ten thousand dollars and then go back out the dad again that'd be fine\nYeah okay but\nI Will be very happy to hear that\nI mean I I Would do that but but don't just except\nThe one guy as the only way to attempt this okay in terms of ... not not in terms of medical procedure I'm not talking about that I don't know anything about that but in terms of the pricing structure and it has to do with you know the the the the weather they guarantee\nYou know multiple tries us you know you buy a package of five or whatever all that kind of stuff I've heard all kinds of ways of getting out there and it's kind of weird to talk about it that way but but that's really what's going on and so just learn a little bit more push back get some other opinions from other pricing structures and then based on that yes\nYou know if you want to take a month or two off of the baby step to and you know or have the cash to do whatever you're doing and then go back out the baby step to again and then if you have to stop again and try another time that that's fine I don't have any issue with that but um\nDo we just say oh no it's thirty five thousand dollars like discussion the other day which is absurd and we're just going to stop everything and go do that 'cause we've completely lost our minds and uh because this was an emotional subject and
