{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "Yup just launched on Monday you can check that out well I had him on but we have we have fun on the record show super fun\nAnd Hogan crafts become Hogan around here is just phenomenal at what he does so we spent the entire episode talking about everyday millionaires so what does it look like to build wealth would've millionaires look like\nThe mists around that the truth around that and it's so great like we haven't set and George Campbell our very own one here at the Daily Show out in the streets naturally ask people I paid for like for instance your job\nWhat do you think a millionaire when he's at our jobs are and it was like doctors lawyers movie stars right like all the answers but the truth\nIs so different and it's all in the book every day a millionaire so I was just really encourage you know like you said everything from their ... their salaries these people they are not what you would think are the millionaires but the average Joe millionaire out there in America looks a lot different than what you probably have in your minds and so it's really close to the whole episode yeah we have fun talking about\nDid you how to be ... because when I was on your show it was yesterday at the ... have you hang up for it they could bring a shake\nNow saying anything about me money what if the millionaire he showed me a million dollars in ... in this period for cash they want to reach a crucial [laughter] if you pay I'll I'll get a ... eight to five five to too far but you ...\nCheck it out sorry and even Facebook ... maybe you and your shows going well too\nSerious sex them one Twenty one to answer the remote timers are struggling and tore show plugs back to your calls AAA eight to five five two to five triple eight to five five two to five is the number Lauren is up in Atlanta Lauren how can we help\nThinking that they weren't sure what am I hadn't I learn where ya ... and we get really black and claimed by some family and we don't have any that are paid off all that that we don't know what to say [laughter]\nAnd you're and I am a spot where do you mean by that and what do you mean you don't know what to do to I understand you're saying but what does it mean specifically at your next goals are that what you're asking\nYeah yeah I mean we don't make a ton of money on a teacher and he's a ... or so yeah barbaric family his grandmother really financially\nVery cool so is this a financial questioner career question\nNow look like the only thing in our careers [laughter] okay\nGreat I'm there you go right to cook I\nWell I Would say are baby steps learn if you know is passed every step three which is to say three to six months of expenses and the bank do you guys have that cash available\nYeah okay so you have thirty six months of expenses so that's done so then I Move on the baby steps four or five insects for a start funding retirements whatever you guys make than than you know start going into funding retirement like ...\nAh for us ... is that whatever if there were ... if your husband's church as a pastor has a retirement plan plug into that but the Fifteen Percent into retirement and then what do you guys have kids [laughter]\nDo that yet no no no that's all right no cats so then you get baby step five which has kept college you'd skip babies safe because it done which means are near um baby step seven right now so that is just knowing wealth and giving which is a pretty awesome spot to be so what I Would say for you guys the funding that retirement\nBut then also have similar goals that you guys want to me because I'm you know there's there can be this monotonous state that you get in\nWhen you don't have any debt or a housing that none of that and you're just putting money away\nAnd savings and it's just kind of like okay it's just there so you need something exciting that you guys want to do whether that's a vacation you want to take maybe it we want to upgrade our home in five years and can we cash flow that can we go next Kobe are upgrade of our house we're going to complete we're never going to go into debt like bless your grandmother's like us and say\nWhat can you know that if we sell our house put money towards that so still have some things are working towards\nBecause that makes the saving money find versus going just this black hole accounts\nSo for you guys to your lifestyle keeping in check like you don't need to go strap against maybe yeah you get up at a few a few percentage points each year as your income grows that's totally fine enjoy that because you guys are at that spot I'm but had that savings gold went and I\nYou know we we definitely have the couple now we're like okay what do we want to save towards because again like I said it can kind of be monotonous it's just putting money in savings so having those goals for you guys as a couple and as a family is huge and laughing at least learn and it's the first thing we always talk about but it's true I guess\nYou're in a position you know it's a really cool camping because you guys have no payment at all not even help paying that much of an acting out in a while do really the big things you can do now invest safe for something in the short term that you guys are looking forward to and ... you know\nWe know Chris Rock and talks a lot about this on do you do as well I think the thing they need to do next to go to a very nice dinner\nCandlelight dinner and take a pad of paper and dream all but never that remain because essentially what you just laid out was dreaming yet and I think they're in the position to actually really dream\nAnd even about giving and and maybe your homes to what if that's your deal you want to buy land and what happens is now that you're in such a great position you're going to get their way faster than you fought but this was a season to dream\nAnd it and for anyone out there like this is something that couples especially if you're married ... if you're here like us which I think your your three kids right\nBut it's like every day it feels like your alarm goes off you wake up you drink your coffee you get ready for it you get the kids up to get them out the door and how low toward my roof you come back I mean there are things that you know you get home you get get going you got to throw in the bath tub ones running out make it you're trying to get him back in the ... mine are\nLike stage they like it and you finally get 'em in bed and you're like oh\nWhat did happen like and you can live in that state's for you and you never look at a couple of like what we want to look like in five years and that's the fun part ... and it's true in\nMarriage you guys like you get to build your future together so Lauren her husband need to do that debt free but also if you're in that still have those three meetings and dream 'cause that's fun to be able to like what are we going to even if it's our dreams to be out of debt and Eighteen months of the dream go for it\nYeah and if you can make a very key key point and I want to drive this home to folks some of the out there don't have a lot of hope and it's because you're not focused on a vision\nSo there's a psychology study up there it's very well known and uh it's it it shows that the brain what it focuses on we tend to see you notice when we didn't see before and here's an example of the study that most people get when you go buy a car\nYou buy that car lot you drive it out how many times have you done this and you see it everywhere for the next game have you noticed though yet totally so that's real it's a real effect yet and what's happening is is the brain has been so focused on his new car purchase she wanted to look forward to it so much then you go buy it and you're so excited about it\nAnd then all of a sudden you never saw before\nBut it's materialize and in front of you it's always been there but you weren't focused on ... so to your point that applies to this idea of even if you're just just completely covered up and debt right now maybe your baby step one you just got to know Dave and you're you're doing the steps\nIf you can have the meaning that you talked about Rachel what it does is it allows you to see the end of the baby steps and when you can see it and focus on this desire future phrase reuse around here all the time yeah then your brain will begin to see the baby steps in the sacrifices me opportunities to do the long haul stuff to get you there\nThat's the key it's not just as fun romantic dream section it's practical it's what keeps you in the game\nOh absolutely and I said earlier said again ... around here\nIt is certainly feel like okay well see you're you guys were you know wherever she said twenty twenty three you know thinking about Thirty years and you're fifty three like what do you want it is great but I don't\n... the big things Rachel crews were hanging out with me I Want to thank our producer James child our associate producer Kelly Daniel and most of all\nYou America thank you so much for your show [noise]\nYards during\nI'm excited we're
