worth two Seventy five and you spend Fifteen more on it that's two Ninety and that's so you're likely not going to get your money out so whatever you're spending there is in a sense consumption it's like saying I Want to go on a really nice vacation which is okay you have the money\nAnd I probably would do some of that work I probably enjoy some of that money by spending it on the house [noise] but the likelihood is\nIf you told me your house was worth two thirty and or the average house prices to fifty five and you spent two hundred and Fifteen on it and then you would be like up to average and he would likely get your money out depending on what you've spent the money on what the repairs were or the re models were I probably would do some of the work just for the fun of it you know just to enjoy the money\nBut uh but we can't do it based on the fact you're going to get it's going to increase the value of your home because it's not likely to what the numbers you gave me Eric is on the line in Salt Lake City Utah Hi Eric welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\n... trauma what's up\nA got a question just started listening to your broadcast or my dad listens to you and he's been recommended for a while but uh we start listening to you and and go through financial piece of my wife and are planning to do that Tom just finally got her on board with everything\nI'm my question is to start a budget have I'm a contractor and so I get paid you know performance ... uh or peace right um so my my paid changes all the ... one month we might make a thousand women who make four thousand sir how do how do you have a budget without Dave\nTake conceptually here's how you do it in the mechanically will walk through and a couple of different ways okay conceptually we just say okay\nOur worst month and the next coming twelve likely it sounds like yours is five K. very like it's very very likely you're not going to be below five K. in the coming twelve agreed\nAgreed okay they might but it'd be very unusual now so we set the budget up regular on five K. we ... we have five K. coming in we're going to give every one of those dollars a name on assignment of mission and show five K. minus my categories equals zero every dollar has an assignment\nOkay on the five K. and so there you're going to take care of most of the things in your life then the things that you couldn't get on that list but you still\nPrimarily in this case is gonna be want to do not need to do or it might be want to save some money it might be one to go on a trip that might be want to pay off some debt it's you know but it's not necessary for your living you can live on the five probably\nIt's kind of gravy bonus money so to speak above five K. we make a list of those things and we say art after our regular budget if we make a dollar\nWhat is the most important thing on this new list that didn't make the cut on the budget the understand\nYes sir okay and I don't care what it is you and your wife look at that and you say that's number one okay you say are we ... we made enough above five thousand to do that when you put a dollar amount decided it's four hundred and Ninety dollars okay so now we made five thousand four hundred dollars when we make the next dollar what's the next most important thing\nThe ... this month to don't have to be for the rest of your life is just put this coming month and you put two beside that and then it's\nAnd then a four and then you rewrite the list in order now you have a prioritized spending plan for each dollar that comes in it already is spent by prioritization above five caves that logical to you\nYes or no that's your concept the practical application is one or two things you can use your every dollar budget out to do all of that and just change it through the month as the money comes and just go okay where we're going to set up on five but as we get\nMore money animal changed the income and will drop down in and will change the list okay and you can apply route through your every dollar budget out or if you've gotten your financial ... materials or you've got the total money make over book or any other any of the books\nThat are have my based on the front I'm just about they have a budget forms in the back in the back is an irregular income planning sheet that teaches you to do what I just talked to the day\nBut you can do the yellow pages\nWhat I just described is basically mature Saturday morning to do list Mamadu Mamadu honey do list right momma said get it done list and what's the most important thing oh here's one micro smile that's number one\nAnd then what's most important thing in after that number two we get those two things we had a pretty good Saturday but we'd like to go on the number three and so on right now it's just your prioritize them to do with your mom and\nThis was the day Ramsey show\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is
