{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "Long as you have any [laughter] point here\nOkay good and um okay the uh the thing is is\nYou want to keep an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses are probably keep one of six months worth of expenses\nAnd no one's forcing anybody to invest in anything [noise] um the the thing I finally figured out and it took me a long time to get there and it may take you a little while to get there is that buying a mutual fund\nIs not risky and does not keep me up at night if I understand that mutual fund and each track record let me give you an example of how I Know that would be true for you\nYou bought two houses\nNeither time does anyone give you a guarantee\nThat they would not go down in value\nThat day true and they might have actually gone down in value back in two thousand I\nBut you didn't get scared and sell them as you thought well real estate of work out you know\nNow that's what that means is you're looking at the track record of real estate not the guaranteed because there's not one I'm looking at the track record and going you know I'm Seventy three I've watched houses go up my whole life sometimes I go down but most of the time they go up and if I go down I'm not going to panic and they'll come back up\nAnd that's looking at the track record you might not have had the actual numbers memorized but good walking around since ... means you observe really goes up in value over time right right\nSo that's what I needed about mutual funds were some good walking around saying so one of the very first ones I ever bought\nWas Seventy five year old mutual fund and um\nIt's got an average annual return over Seventy five years at a little over eleven percent\nNow that's the average some years it went down\nSome years it went up but for me that was kind of like buying a house on the street with big trees I felt like um that's a pretty stable neighborhood oh an out of the last ten years it'd only been in when I bought it back then I mean it only lost money to two out of ten times\nAll the other years it made money and over the scope of ten years at my money\nSo it was a pretty calm\nGrowth in income ... mutual fund and when I was looking at was the track record and going okay\nI Know there's risk in the stock market and I know stupid people lose all their money in the stock market because they buy some little stupid company in the company goes under and they lose all their money because they're just playing with their golfing buddy told 'em there but I'm looking at a mutual fund here that's invested in Ninety two hundred different stocks\nIt has a Seventy year track record as a you know tenured drag are you in ... and I can actually look at it and go okay what's your average over the last ten years what's your average over the last Twenty years and how many times has actually been down\nNow is that a guarantee that it won't go down in the future which is not a guarantee but your house wasn't either [noise] and if your house did go down one time out of ten years or one time to three times out of Twenty years you wouldn't panic you'd all around the house and you know let it come back up and that's how I first got\nComfortable with mutual funds 'cause you know Rick in my late twenties I went broke and lost everything I don't like losing money I don't like risk but I also don't like money invested in or sitting in an account making one percent when it could be making ten or twelve\nAnd ... and so if I got a mutual fund this average eleven percent four Seventy five years\nAnd it only does half of what it used to do well that still five and a half percent pass\nI mean it's like really suck it's going to do half of what it's done for Seventy five years that's got to be really bad\nI mean it's like the worst ... period of time you know so uh I'm a beat my savings account I'm a teacher annuity I'm a beat everything\nIf it does and that gave me a lot of comfort and and you know and again on but\nBut the reason you're laying awake at night is you didn't think about it in terms of track record and knowledge\nOf history will give you peace on investments it'll allow you to sleep well in in show just take your time and learn take your time and wondering if you need some help sit down with one of our smart vest or pros we will not endorsed people and they're not people who work for us but we don't endorse the smart Mr pros unless they have the heart of a teacher\nBecause we don't want you to invest money in ... right I don't want you to that I think it's that means you didn't understand what you invest in or you did understand and you put it in some stupid\nOr you shouldn't be lying awake at night with your investments just like you shouldn't be lying awake when you bought the house in Texas you bought your home ... awake at night I was with that and so\nIf you go on the website ... um put in your informational dropped down a list a smart rest her prose in your area Saddam parked when I'm there is no obligation just learn the more knowledge you have about something the more calm you are\nAbout it it's a simple or something like driving a car\nThe very first time I got behind the wheel of a car I think that's probably about ten years old ... told me I can move the car down the driveway and um the gravel driveway and I think I emptied all of the gravel out of the driveway because I think I just stepped on the accelerator floor border to end just dug a hole what the ... of the guard\nAnd the first time you ever drive a car you remember how nervous your or there was a field or in a parking lot and then the first time you drive on on the road you remember how nervous your ... and then but you know what\nI'm thinking about it now your ... your brain auto pilots the car in or what happens is or you have learned to do something that has risk\nBecause you can record car there's no guarantee it has risk what you've learned to do it and the knowledge and the practice has given you a piece and you do it without your heart rate even changing you don't lay awake at night on a country I drove a car tomorrow\nIt don't it doesn't bother you even though you're taking risk but it's practice and knowledge in practice and knowledge\n[noise] opens owns a triple eight eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money Justin is on Twitter\nFollowing me at Dave Ramsey about eight hundred something thousand of you do that my son's having a hard time finding an apartment due to ... doing to having no credit any advice\nAdequate looking at the super expensive reporter much he's going into these corporate managed things where they've got a twenty eight year old managing the apartment or the twenty four year old managing the apartment and they're not allowed to think if you have no credit that means you have no debt\nIf you have no debt you know what that means you have money and so you're more able to pay rent as a landlord I Love people that have no credit\nIt's awesome assuming they have an income that means they have a lot of money to pay my rent west\nAnd so you just got to find somebody that again is actually allowed to use their brain in the rendering of the apartment there's plenty of those out there but some of the large corporate things they they don't allow them to think and if you don't have a credit score we can't rent to you know what that means is I'm worth tens of millions of dollars and I can't rent an apartment they're\nGoing to write a check and bother
