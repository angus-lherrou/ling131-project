{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "Uh so I assume he's a pretty messed up\n[noise] yeah we have to say the least yeah how old is he a he'll be twenty eight\nOkay um is ...\nWhat is one of the nature what's the nature of his disability\n[noise] um [noise] a losing land okay I'm In a a in a concrete labor accident\nGotcha okay leg or arm what flag okay\nAnd I'm not to minimize that because that's a horrible thing but that's all\n[laughter] yeah\nAnd you know I think basically what's been happening is there's been so many different disputes back and forth in counter suing going on by lawyers\nAnd that's all that's all behind us you think now you think this will come and go ahead\nI think it it's I'm finally getting to the point to where there's going to be actual real settlement um talk and um there's just been some shady things going on in the court cases\nWells what twenty million dollars is they're going to they're going to mess with it you can count on that [noise] um yeah okay\nWow\nAll right so uh and what is his emotional and mental state\n[noise] I think honestly\nIf one could eat working he wants to have you back at work he doesn't\nWant is going to get what a prosthetic leg and he'll be able to do something with his mind now they won't be doing heavy lifting\nThings or something like that probably right\nExactly that's that's the hope except for he's got a desire to do those kinds of things so it's really killing him to around\n... around but I mean I'm you know you usually actually make more money with your mind that you do with your\nBody anyway right as a career path so generally speaking so that's forced upon him here which is I'm not not a bad thing is what I'm thinking so I\nI think he he gets to sit down and ask themselves that question what do\nI Want to do if I could do anything in the world because now he can do anything in the world [noise] right right\nAnd so I'm going to coach him on finding a career that he loves and I'm going to spend a very small percentage of this money because they won't take as much of that a small percentage of that much money to do some kind of retooling as far as education goes\nAnd saying okay I'm going to get a degree in X or y or I'm going to get some training in X or y and I'm going to learn to be one of those things over there or whatever those things are that he wants to do so what's he want to be when he's\nFifty five years old that he's made his life's work and his career and he\nGets to choose that now that's awesome can be a self employed track that could be a a a track of uh some kind of a a a\nI don't know I mean anything but it's obviously not going to be something that is physically um demanding okay\nRight [laughter] that's okay that's okay\nIn terms of technology though um he's kind of wanting to start his own business now he's getting all these ideas that have have you know um water that acts implication on something like this that you've known it be facing with [noise]\nIt depends on how the settlement is structured and you'd have to talk with his uh uh uh attorney and was from tax advice to find out how it's structured I shouldn't be in California's well\nThat's correct now that that's the first thing you need to figure out what's taxes are going to be and what the lawyers' fees are going to be and then you know what you're going to have met the second thing then is figure out what we're going to I Would I Would urge him to pretend like this money's not there\nBy and large I mean if let's say there's twenty million after taxes just to use a number okay and you know if you've pulled a million out to start a business and to coast for a little while emotionally\nAnd that leaves you're Nineteen million that you just pretend like you're not there [noise] that makes sense that's pretty bad yeah I mean you can buy anything you want to do with that right\nThat's a lot of freeway money okay sounds so absolutely something along those lines and then what I Want him to do is to build himself a uh the Bible says in the uh in in in the abundance of counselors there are safety in the multitude of counsellors there's safety so he needs to build himself a little board of directors\nA needs an estate planner\nA that's a lawyer he needs a tax professional probably that as a lawyer but at a minimum is a CPA um [noise] a needs an investment person in his corner\nI'm ... probably you when someone else sitting there that will look at him and telling me stupid when he's being stupid and he needs to commit himself to\nGathering information from this group of people before he does something\nDoes that make sense because you're white people lose money like this is is that they go off on their own and they don't have the tools mentally to to manage this and you've got to put some people in your life not that do it for you but that coach you\nAs a group to do this I don't want one person managing your with and that's how I get ... right\nAnd and I don't want you doing it by yourself because you're probably not completely equipped\nBut we're going to put a group of people around him if he wants to do some real estate and he has a high quality real estate person sitting on his little board right we've got a CPA we gotta stay plan or we got a tax person may be a real estate person may be an investment person the mutual funds world and then we're going to build a game plan here this is what we do with like an NFL player that asked us what to do\nThey get they get a ten million dollar signing bonus and they're really good at football but they are not really good at money\nAnd so they don't if you don't end up on the front of Sports Illustrated be one of those stupid people that lost and million dollars here's how you do it but some people in your corner that teach you coach you and God you as a group you don't have one person doing it\nAnd then you gradually over the years become very adept at managing twenty million dollars\nWith the help these people teaching you and they all need to have the heart of a teacher they don't need to be arrogant and bossy\nBut then they and they need to say they need we'll look at him and telling the truth and kindly but go listen here's why you don't want to do that you can do it but here's why you don't want to do that and then and he needs to commit to keeping his hands off of the bulk of it and put it in investments and forget it's there\nAnd he can live the rest of his life easy easy but if he goes and decides to open a twenty million dollar technology thing he's going to lose at all by the time three years from now all the money will be gone\nYeah that's what I'm afraid of too yeah I'm so don't do that\nYou know don't don't don't open a twenty million dollar business don't open a business that takes up all this to open a business is very small he's got plenty of money he doesn't have to prove anything okay take your time to be the tortoise don't be the hair\nJust take your time put a group of counselors in the multitude accounts for their safety put a group of counselors in your life that are professionals in the different areas that can speak to you teach you and how old is he today\nTwenty eight so the goal is by the time he's thirty eight he has a clue\nOkay yeah along the lines of managing twenty freaking million dollars\nIn and it'll take ten years for him to intellectually and emotionally get his arms around it and he'll lose it all if he starts trying to do one or two plays with all that money\nWell I'm an open a chain of pizza parlors all gone it's all gone you know I'm gonna I'm gonna be the next Facebook no you're not it's all gone it's all gone OK so take a small amount of it and get yourself back to work to give you the dignity of work and to create an income where you really don't need any of that money any way and it's just sitting there growing\nAnd then this horrible tragic event\nTurns into a financial blessing that changes his family tree so there you know for generations to come because he's wise with it does that make sense\nYes thank you very much appreciate all the five\nMaybe that's exactly what we would do if we were in a situation before she had to call and\nThanks to James child's Kelly Daniels in black Thompson I Am Dave Ramsey your

manager for a interstate retailer\nOh okay very good well you guys are killing it way to go man like yourself what kind of that was one hundred and eighty thousand dollars\nOr what eight thousand was my car and a hundred and Seventy two thousand was our wonderful student loans from a private Christian university ...\nWe were expensive spouses to\nEach other ah oh okay so this or you drop some coin yeah All right and I'm six and a half years that's a long time to pay off their student loans I was thinking maybe it was ... when you don't usually come after years so there has to be a good story tell me your story\nUm well I got a really funny story actually hum when we went through financial piece at our church at the time\nOne of the things that you mentioned in your video was a take cash with you when you when we were we were newlyweds when we first went through and you take cash would you when you go to a furniture store to buy a car and and and flush the cash and talk to them that way so\nWe're at a furniture store and I'm a very not confrontational kind of guy kind of a free spirit and she told me hey let's do this let's put this to practice so\nWe took passion and I'm Talking to the sales guy about a bad that we're trying to buy for our apartment at the time and\nI'm washing the cash and saying hey I'm I'm gonna walk as if we can make this happen right now and he's like I'm I'm Sorry that that's just the price\nAnd uh so I just went out in the car and sit down because I couldn't swallow my pride and buy it but then my wife ended up by the\nUs I don't know that that that is just to show that\nThere was a lot of negotiation from the beginning we were really um when we were dating and engaged at the time we're sitting down with our finances and\nWe were actually writing out the numbers and it was just this feeling in her stomach so uh we're just indebted to these loan companies and we're going to be in our fifties before we pay 'em off and\nUm so and so we started the class we now down a budget and did the envelope systems we were really um persistent unfaithful within ... down and just really got serious about it on\nAnd I think the big part and for us for as far as deciding to really try to work on baby step too as\nWe paid by car off I'm relatively quickly and then he had gotten his first pretty big bonus from work and so we were like okay we haven't really gotten to travel before kids let's take a really great trip to Europe with the money we deserve it\nAnd we were sitting there one time were like oh we're we just their budget you know a few months ago and so that was the first step we use that bonus money instead of a trip to Europe which who knows if we'll be able to take that ever and that's okay but we uh\nWhy wouldn't you might go a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in debt and\nOur first the first and now we have two kids so it just makes\nIt a lot of kids and you're\nAt least in some countries [laughter]\nSo yeah that that was the big you know turning point for us when we put that big lump sum of money in our first a student loan payment and there was an awful feeling that hurt but a good feeling of\nThe show how much of the six years did you make closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years or brothers or the last year or so last year the income doubled down ... and so that's a relatively new figure correct then and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right now so you really have been doing this ... and then the last year a kicked in about the time you saw the light at the end but Donald income comes up ... yeah yeah what what was the hardest part of this for your cars six and a half and a good\nUm I think for me the hardest part was I'm starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see the hundred and Seventy thousand dollars
