school\nYou're single or married ... years old married\nMhm okay and what is a career shift you want to do\nI'm so I'm a registered nurse and right now I'm In management um and I want to go back to school to be a nurse practitioner gotcha okay and how long will that too it's going to be about three years then once it cost a forty five thousand\nAnd then you sell the condo and you rent and you use the money from the condo to live on while you go to school and pay for school\nI was I was actually thinking about saving up um some money in the next year to put down on a house on a Fifteen year loan and um so you know by by the mortgage\nAnd how are you going to pay for a house if you're not working\nWell that was I was hoping I could have a some savings will say some of the funds from the condo go towards um living expenses paying for school or whatever\nThey're going to qualify for a mortgage if you don't have an income\n[noise] I thought I was still working part time I'll still be making about forty five thousand a year oh\nOkay your wife work outside the home\nShe's a cousin told us and she makes what I'm about twenty five\nOkay and she or you are you going to be in the same city doing all of this\nYes of course\nI'm not concerned about homeownership until three years from now if you want to if you want to do this and just keep all the casual valuable and make sure you hit your goal\nThat's fine let's make the turn with no debt and when we get out of the school on land that you know nurse practitioners job and uh your income probably going to go up in that situation [noise]\nPretty substantially um then and you've done all of this for a hundred percent that free then you think about buying just whenever you buy in the next two years is not going to be a house you keep two years later\nOkay because you're going to move up and income your income is going to go ... when you come out of school\nAgreed [noise] yeah yeah and so it's a different house world than all of a sudden for you I don't mind if you rent something and just keep all your cash available to ensure that this dream occurs debt free because\nWhen I Dream of cars and its financial debt it often turns into a nightmare we don't want to go that route but I Love the whole plan on the idea and the will you know your willingness to sacrifice to get it done and researcher life in your thirties that's that's pretty cool man a pretty gutsy and I like it a lot\nUm and obviously you've investigated ... nurse practitioner and what they do every day and that is what you want to do with your life and I'm\nJust going to be heavily invested after this you're not going to be six months into that and go I don't want to someone you don't want to get to that that's you're paying to bigger price to

pick up when I'm ... and you can pick it up there a branch as a family member mentioned it might be a good idea to freeze my one year olds credit do you think that's necessary\nI don't know that it's necessary but probably wouldn't do it\nI'm\nA I froze my kids when they were minors or ... the law came out allowing you to freeze in law just shifted the other day and and like they used in late September allowing you to freeze a credit bureau without any fees now like you were allowed to charge you feed a freezer and freezing\nUp until late September the twenty first the law shifted so um yeah I Would freeze it and and the only reason is if someone were to steal his identity give his Social Security number somewhere and try to open an account of his name\nIs ... the company he's trying to there are trying to open the account with checks his credit they'll find it frozen and they would it would prevent that type of identity theft and fraud\nUm now if they don't check it it will prevent anything and only about three out of ten credit card applications do they actually run the credit on the auto issue the other seven so that's how the issue credit cards on the people in dogs because they don't even bother\nTo check and if they check they'll discover you know a three year one year old with a frozen credit account all fall while this was fraud and they're not going to issue the cars so it'll help you a little from and I probably would do it\nAnd I'm probably not probably I Would go to Sandra insurance so I get out then the theft protection on your whole family including your children and they have a family plan that does that and that\nPoses our that Ramsey showing the bugs will you before you know what in the meantime remember there is ultimately only one way to

that runs the exactly the opposite of the other two and we rent it and said okay in the last forty years if you had run it without international and run it with international\nWhat would you end up with and you end up ahead having run it with international because in the down markets the international are generally up\nAnd they pick up the slack and so even though it's the leg or to still have it in my mix and I'm Still going to recommend you do but you're right you what you found there is representative of you know the real track records or the international recommend twenty five
