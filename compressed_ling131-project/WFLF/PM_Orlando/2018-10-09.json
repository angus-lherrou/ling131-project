having me on sure what's up\nA one to ask you I'm retired I Am still work full time so I have a double dip you have a actually another small Carlin besides my retirement but I've become for Medicare I mean Social Security or the next February\nAnd it was thinking at sixty six out of bed and try to re invest it in any gross more\nA cushion for my wife who's younger than me I think I've got enough money to live on but I Want to help her out a little bit cause she got a\nBad early retirement contributions to marry a ...\nA ... by the end the maximum all that we can and color retirement employment ... so I'm actually twenty four or five apiece starting this year mhm so I'm Wondering what you thought about taking Social Security is sixty six like that\nNo role model\nWill turn around and reinvest it\nWell we'll we'll have to pay some taxes on it since we don't qualify for all but uh well I think\nThey're still puts me on a regular alright\nWell you would qualify for a Roth if you continue to earn at least five thousand dollars a year\nAh well I Am a misunderstanding of there's an upper income limit on the\nOther is yeah yeah you can do not make over two hundred thousand dollar household income do you\nDo okay All right\nThen you can do what's called a back door Roth I'd do that every year I might considerably more than two hundred thousand and the back door Roth is a at over fifty I'm over fifty year over fifty we can put in sixty five hundred each six thousand five hundred each if we want to\nI'm into I put it into good grow stock mutual funds for me and for my wife saw Thirteen thousand dollars each January I Move into a what'd you do is you move it into a\n... and after about four Tom sorry before tax IRA traditional I write because that way you haven't had taxes taken out on it\nYou didn't take a tax deduction and then you roll it to a Roth instantaneously and all in the same transaction it's called a back door Roth IRA I talk to your broker about it if you don't have one ... one of our smart best are pros they can show you how to do that but that that's the rough the IRA issue but you can invest your Social Security money\nMore than you do a Roth or not you just put it in a mutual fund but if you're going to just take and spend it I mean you can do that too but you don't need the money you got plenty of money so I mean yeah I Would go ahead and begin to draw it because I'm\nYou know the the faster you take it out when you turn around and reinvest it the more you're going to end up with a more than you would have and the difference in what it pays you by waiting\nUm so the only difference is if somebody's just consuming it and you're nowhere near that uh then you might run the calculation differently but if you're a poet and invest it answers always pull it as soon as possible and start investing it because you're going to end up with more alive and more dead by doing that\nA Marlene is with us in Austin, Texas how can we help
