I said look if we look over history actually we are at historical lows for taxes even though we are mounting\nPiles of debt that is cause for concern ... Chris I Know that\nFact but man it doesn't feel like it every year when I got to cut that right [laughter]\nYes I hear about that you know so here so here's what Ronald Reagan and he's at a Ninety four percent tax bracket right so what he did and it was once you made over two hundred thousand dollars you're taxed at Ninety four percent so he just didn't make a third movie\nIt it'd be worth less you get six six thousand bucks so taxes\nCause us to miss out on some potentially great movies guys so so the taxes and Ninety Ninety four percent of the question is can they go back there\nWell I think we've already heard that answer having way yeah I mean look debt if there's anything to make us go back to a higher tax bracket and the future\nIt which we think they absolutely will its its debt you know something's funny Chris is a well not really too funny actually is back then we didn't have Nineteen trillion in debt right\nAnd what did you say that top tax bracket was\nIt was Ninety four and back in the seventies there was still in the in the sixties and eighties beginning of the eighties is is in the fifties so you can see if you've got mounting piles a debt the government is not a business right\nIs the only way it gets in Columbus how from us from taxes it's got a service this day where do you think they're going to get it they're going to get it from us\nSo that's one thing that blows my mind is taxes were higher when we owed less and I mean something's got to give their right\nSo so taxes are going to go up we got a lot of debt water people to do in retirement tax are going to go up in the future\nOkay let's say you're in a twenty five percent tax bracket right now okay it hurts but what if it goes up to forty five now you're taking home forty five percent less money now you're taking a forty five percent loss every year in retirement\nThat is crippling sill instead is there a way can we turn the tables\nAnd get a forty five percent growth every year by simply not paying taxes low yeah if you don't pay the taxes and you're getting forty five percent more money in this case in your pocket ... and you're essentially getting so forty five percent more growth but can you can you not pay\nTaxes and not go to jail if it's tax free and become the stock qualified and you don't have to pay on that then yeah okay if it's\nSet up correctly yeah does it set up correctly I got to do is read the whole tax code everybody you'll find it in there right so he wants to do that though\nLet me open up Pandora's box for a second now the ultra wealthy they don't pay any taxes in retirement using the rats strategy you know a very well known strategy in the ultra wealthy communities\nYou know of course that bought ran through my mind as soon as you said that high tax bracket 'cause you know who never ends up paying the actual high tax brackets the ultra wealthy the ultra wealthy you know who the barn always falls on middle class the middle class picks up
