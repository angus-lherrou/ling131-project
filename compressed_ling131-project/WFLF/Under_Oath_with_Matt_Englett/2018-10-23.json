very low probability now if they ask you\nYour opinion among now that's starting to say that they're starting to recognize that there's something wrong but right now none of them think anything is wrong with all this craziness and it's crazy and the main is what it is unbelievable dysfunction\nBut I guess you could just sit down and said mom you know enablers are the nicest people that you'll ever meet mom you're one of them you're a nice person nice you're so nice you cannot say no\nYou're so nice that you think about doing things for my sister that you're doing her favor and the actual truth as enablers are not nice people because they actually bring harm to the people that they're enabling because they are enabling they're causing them they're helping them to do things that are bad\nAnd doing things you know not being a fully functioning self supporting adults at thirty eight years old is a bad thing and to enable that to cause that to occur you you've done harm to your daughter\nIf you're listening to me in Europe for thirty eight year old living in your house that has been there for a long time and you're buying them cars on unless they're mentally deficient in some way\n\nYou are doing them great harm because they have not they have never had to grow the strength of character to stand on their own and when you die they're going to be up a creek\nI mean you built out a trust fund baby here while you were still alive is what you did oh so awful\nDan's with us in Charlotte Hi Dan welcome to the Ramsey\nShip out during the day better than I deserve sir how can I help you\nGet to hear I actually I have I was I'm twenty five years old I'm when I was born I think three months after I was born my family gave me theory\nOn ... um I've had them everything they\nTotal about four thousand dollars as of march I haven't double check to the I haven't had time to sit down and do it but I was curious on your opinion what should I cashed those in and get liquid\nImmediately them 'cause they're immediately even though their interest rate is four percent on um\nYeah but don't you have do you have a pet at all\nNo no I'm actually graduating college ah luckily with no debt my parents helped me and I I I'm\nGood how do you have do you have a um your emergency fund built of three to six months of expense was\nActually just took a hit on it my truck a water pump broke okay if I had to\nI Would imagine to that might have had to use this money to make sure you had an emergency fun once you've done that is there is any of it left I Would start investing\nAnd move on to what we call baby step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement so but yeah they're they're not\nIt's not a great place to park money long term and is not a great place to park on the short term either one so I don't use savings bonds for anything Jesse is with us in Fargo North Dakota Hi Jessie how are you\n\nAsking how are you good how can I help\nSo [noise] I'm debt free at my house uh about two months ago a good Mike yeah for my car uh is worth six thousand dollars and the engine gets went out on a couple of days ago ...\nNot good so I I have a thousand dollars in my emergency fund right now mhm I'm my I'm deciding do I go out and buy seven thousand our vehicle or do I spend a three to four thousand dollars to fix my current vehicle\nMhm [noise] okay well the car is probably worth a thousand dollars as it sets salvage right\nCorrect [noise] and so if you can spend two thousand on it that'd be kind a like spending three 'cause you could have got one for it put two ended his worth and then you could sell it for six even if you were going to turn around and sell it if you can get it running for two\nThat's probably what I wouldn't do much north of that and start to think about it but I mean that you know you're gonna lose five thousand dollars now or you're going to lose two thousand dollars by fixing it and selling it for six you follow me\nWhen you write so I'm probably fixing fixing it was an old used engine what what happened to the engine\nUm became the mechanics\nSaid that there something broke and ... and he doesn't know why it just I was driving it and it and just started inquiring and wouldn't going where\nOkay you need a new mechanic does need to know what's wrong with the car I mean something broke and I will do kidding\nIt may engine coming in I I Know yeah I I don't know whether there\nI Know you don't know what it is but mechanics ought to be able to tell what it is I mean it it had dropped or odd that means that blew it it's what we can all blown engine and in that case you're probably going to buy used engine from a junk yard and have someone put it in there and you probably do that for a couple of grand what kind of car is it\nIt's a four to four ... four okay I mean you could burn a vow of or something and that might be six hundred eight hundred bucks to fix it\nYou know he he said he said it blew the engine\nYeah but he didn't even know what it is you're sad right yeah I\nI you need another opinion dirty and find out what happened to be dead gum car but anyway the worst case scenario is you put a used engine from a junk yard in there for a couple of brand and you sell a car\nFor six foot six in your pocket admonished to that\nYou've taken out of your emergency fund and then you put some money with the ad and move up in car a little bit but you're probably going to repair this car before you shout boggle make more money on it that way\nOr even met open engine but not not above five thousand dollar in genetic two thousand orange and so again a six thousand dollar car does not get a brand new engine in it\nYou put a used engine from a shower Jordan tortured

even when they're still in the Internet where we've had to say that\nI thought you said you were in it I'm Sorry okay so you're a baby step too but you don't have your emergency fund order downpayment\nShe said that he would be willing to actually kind of owner financing for Eighteen months and then she would put the entirety of the aim is that when you look at teen hundred dollars a month towards the balance of belong at the end the Eighteen months\nAnd then come about Seventy eight year old ... selling for one forty seven okay excellent which are here you know her\nWell here's here's what I Would do that ... that would work very similar for her\nOkay but I'm just go structure it a little bit different\n[noise] I Want you to rent it [noise]\nFor that Eighteen months with an option to purchase it for X prize\nAnd the price could even slide down Fifteen hundred a month so if you're walking [noise] okay okay but that's the exact same financial transaction for her but the house doesn't go near name until you have down payment and the emergency room saved up during the show doing much so you don't have purchased a home\nWhich is a lease with the option to

Fox News and so President Trump is saying as a caravan of migrants from Central America continues to make its way to the U.S southern border and the administration has a theory about who's funding it boxes Jessica Rosenthal has more live\nAbsolutely vibrate she can be custom fit to just about any opening in your home\nSo when you do you order with renewable energies and you're not just getting something off the showroom floor\nNo you are not a what we do is we actually come out with a design consultant we look at your opening\nA lot of folks in the industry think when they get ready to do windows there's really only one way to do it and that's what they have existing in their home so many options out there so many ways to save money\nFrankly a lot of ways even spend more money to pay how beautiful you want to make your house I'm really good at that most people want to most people in the end of the day won't accomplish do things they want to ... there's going to last forever and they want a house that looks like a brand new house at the same or address\nOkay All right yeah\nI I don't know where I think I Would proving the aesthetic of my house well\nOne of the things that I've found in many folks that I talked to a in the window industry when I approach folks I asked him\nHey what is it that you're trying to achieve and when they talk about the aesthetics of the home and how it looks they go to Dan I had some quotes I've talked to some folks but look I've seen\nThese windows in the house I've seen these big white clunky fick bowls looking last week when I was I don't want that look and it really show our mission and on one of our goals uh ever knew why Anderson is we want the window and we designed a window to look like it actually came with the home mhm\nSo it doesn't seem that gets out of place exactly if you're curious and if you're thinking about and this is something you might want to do a little bit more about if you're in the same kind of mindset that I can get some information but also take advantage of the office going on right now to a if you are listening to the show renewal by ... and you can\nBut the first seven callers get twenty percent off windows doors and installation that's twenty percent off of everything so shut down the number\nEight eight eight for eight for nine for eight zero that has eight eight eight for eight for nine for eight zero eight eight eight or eight or nine for eight zero to\nGet the information and hopefully get in on that special offer as well um now I Am looking at replacing it all at once that the doors and windows I'm Kendra nobody enters and also do sliding glass doors I mean is there any ... like is there anything that in your typical home is there anything that you can tell\nMe the short answer is no way to answer right um\nWe want to we don't want you you want to be really careful when you are changing opening sizes are sometimes you can begin to get into structural members of the home so we can and larger make openings smaller if it's the right situation okay but\nTo answer your question no we can do just we can yes we can do\nJust about anything you want with a custom or be a window\nOkay well in for Neal they enter some kind of want me to the process let's say I give you a call my dad I think I'm ready not exactly sure like what's the best way to get a quote to get your design team out walk away to the process All right\nSo the first step is you when to pick up the phone and you would call our national call center or our local call center within a working hours and you would set up a free and home designed consultant estimate right so that individual would then come out to your home\nThey would take a look at and your name your dreams or whatever you're trying to create a most importantly\nProvide us illusion show we wouldn't go we would measure the windows we would go or some design options with you mhm uh and then we would uh we have a a design\nA software that we carry with us in the home so you can actually see what the window looks like that you're having designed oh fantastic and so once we got a mystery that makes a little bit of time in the home so\nUh be prepared been this way you can get exactly what you want you know it's what you want to see what it looks like\nAnd once we knew that uh we simply price it up for you right there in the home so okay so now waiting no waning\nThat's nice that we can get an idea of what you can be getting into\nYou often get excited about the process of you know possibly getting these new windows and new doors now let's say\nI you know I I Love the station I Love the smell of the way everything looks and I say okay and let's go and do they understand let's make this happen in my home what is the next that\nWell the next step is ... how are we going to pay for it right [laughter] can't call mom anymore right [laughter] well my daughter would kill me but she she still calls that so uh yeah so the next set with\nMe we have many different ways to help fall on the job or to provide them on the job\nSo you can do financing through us you can pay cash or credit card any of that is all done on the spot instant financing we have great promotions are\nGoing on uh at this time ... and I'm so is there is quite easy or you don't have to have any money down in um\n[noise]\nIn the process can keep going in the process can keep going well tell me about the uh the teams tell me about your crew what what can we expect when it's time for renewal by Anderson to come into my home and actually put in these new windows\nAnd doors and sliding glass doors and everything else yes so the process a is\nReally smooth the we have a concierge service so what that means is once you place the order human contact him ... years job is to hold your hand through every step of the process so once you place that order with us\nYou will then be contacted and they'll let you know the very next that\nAnd that next step would be a tech mission or any tech measure would come out in measurable Honda designed consultant because of that measure three times ... that's right [laughter]\nMeasure three times cut once right so we do that and I'm a lunch we are getting the confirmed measure much the windows or order they come in your installers show up so we don't use quote just installers are folks are a Anderson certified master installers\nAnd what that means is we have a scope or national pie and guidelines in these windows have to be installed by okay I often tell people that windows there's two home improvement projects they're really scare me\nWhen I Am a roofing those too that if they're done incorrectly oh yeah they will rot your house to the ground\nGame yeah do we need to make sure that it's being done properly um obviously we have great building inspectors and codes in Florida that help us with that uh but I Believe it or not folks can still kind of a lotta corners and so we make sure we do it right\nSo what would happen say if you know real renewable energy and is is in the home that insulation process has to be done and you're taking out the windows and you do find some things structurally wrong\nWhen we hope that that doesn't happen we trying to spot it but you're you're exactly right it can happen in especially in in this great state of Florida there's a lot of there's a lot of humidity and there's a lot of ways for water and getting these walls that we can't see\nI'm hoping that's where this concierge service comes at an animal have the answers for me\nTo show what would happen in that case um uh when we designed a window we price out just the window in the cosmetic area within a couple of inches of the window but if we find out when we remove this window we've gotten mon infestation and all sorts of things going on in rotten all the things you\nJust pray that wouldn't be there yes um what we have to do then is we have to bring in a we have to uh refer you to a an al ... Khan tractor that would the specialized in structural damage\nAnd get that are taking care of some on it or to some degree we can handle a just depends on how severe it is\nAnd you've got people that you trust and you're ready and then you can pick up that phone and asked\nOrally we wouldn't we wouldn't put anybody anybody's home we didn't try\nThat's comforting yes um let's say to go smoothly no bombs at all which we all hope of course with when you buy Anderson about how long are you looking for this to be happening in your home and they'll say if you're doing\nTen windows attention to swap out I mean is that you know a week's worth of open holes in your house or is it something hopefully a lot smoother than what\nGen if it with our first job in Texas about eight months but a sense since we do a you know two billion dollars a year we pretty fast or this but we are good to do\n... normally it would take a you can usually say about a day for every four windows and that's being conservative but we'd rather you know we'd rather a over promise a I mean a under promise rather than over promise\nYeah I I've been through a window I'm I've been through a window reinstalled\nAt a at a at a former house and I I Would say in that situation I it it it was like\nThe house was open there for a while and it's it's really company here that with a nearby ... that's not really the case you guys got it down to a science and you can as windows in and out of doors in and out and feeling like safe and you're home with your new energy efficient windows and all that good stuff\nIt's a great point and you did remind\nMe with small children ages cat\nI absolutely uh I've heard horror stories are all over the world you know about these types of situations and\nWe're definitely not going to come in and and pull out six windows in and leave holes in your house for the very reason that you several reasons number one you were writing or something were to happen but number two you maybe you have children wandering around the home we wouldn't want them [laughter]\nFamilies in your big are these\nCalls for ...\n... pound ... on your cell phone\nPound ... two dollars\nOfficers for land welcome to Jimmy done by your new Ninety three weeks it was so good how do you make it quality ingredients in line I mean we definitely don't sing along when it's fake\nParents think through baby right and we don't do the baby carriers and carrying the warm ... we sent to the calling right I mean I'm not face these challenges\nOkay I'll take a turkey Tom oh don't name on it makes it harder\nTry our new nine green we did you mean jobs we were yeah which is building a better bank\nLooked like it starts with\nBuilding capital one ... face warm inviting place this feel nothing like a typical bank\nWhere you can open an account with no fees are minimum in five minutes and you'll always find people ready to help you not sell you\nWelcome the banking reimagining what's in your wallet\nConsumers only offered by capital one and a member FDIC copies available in select locations copyright twenty eight in capital one [noise]\n\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute so you want a volatile market caterpillar posted strong third quarter earnings but Wall Street soured on its outlook international trade tensions jacking up the cost of steel so caterpillar shares fell as much as ten percent and an early Wall Street route\nA late rally fell short equities close lower for a fifth straight day the Dow last one hundred twenty five points to NASDAQ down thirty one the S. and P. down Fifteen\nMcDonald's notches positive same store sales growth for the thirteenth consecutive quarter shares jumped six percent investors have more third quarter earnings to look forward to this week Amazon alphabet Microsoft in intel are among the big names that record\nDyson a British company best known for a groundbreaking vacuum cleaners says it will build its electric car in Singapore and pro crashed a nation isn't so bad for your wallet Deloitte says that people who start holiday shopping early tend to spend more about three hundred and Seventy dollars more on average Martin ...

expert advice for home improvement and energy efficiency\nAnd now here's your host Ghana [noise]\nNot going to get them in New Hampshire I think you sound like you're spending part of your day here with as if you're anything like me the eye why home improvements I'm all for it I just need to know more about it before I started diving and I'm here with Patrick\nMore from the University of rules and contracting and one of the first memories I had when I moved to Florida in two thousand and four was flying in and seeing Lou hearts everywhere almost every home\nAnd that's not a decorative thing it's not a decorative painting and I owned one home prior to that and it was new construction and never in my life than I ever thought\nAbout a roof over placing a real need to replace a real for how do you know when it's time to replace a roof and to this day I still see everywhere is it because of where we live or is it because that's just a homeowner thing\nWell I mean Florida's twilight zone right I mean they were like our own little country down here but I mean all seriousness yeah I mean it's actually not uncommon I mean we are over a year now from a Hurricane Irma which uh you know cause a lot of damage I still\nHave a lot of neighbors getting nervous repair and replace from that\nOh yeah yeah and so a lot of people have for whatever reason have been putting off of replacing the roof or maybe they don't even know that their roof is leaking or you know there's all these different things but uh yeah it is not uncommon even still\nA year later or over a year later does is he a ... on houses all over central Florida I mean they're everywhere I mean I live in winter park and I've got a couple of houses near me uh they have tarps on I'm Still you know\nAnd that's part of the homes and realize that there is a problem for many there can be a slow leak there can be stuff going on and the rules that\nYou wouldn't know that there is a problem going on and I'm sure you see that a lot when you finally get into a home you're like you know what this has been happening for a really long time so what are some of the initial fines at your roof\nMay need repairs and distress or needs complete replacing\nSure yeah that's a great it's a great question because\nA lot of people saw the obvious signs right so there's a big wet spot over their kitchen or they noticed in the bathroom you know the drywall is starting to bubble up a or may have been as extreme as actually we've been in homes where there's holes in the ceiling because so much water was coming into the house which is\nYou know a terrible terrible place to be and so those are the ones where people were very quickly I Need to get somebody here I Need to find out what's going on and that's the people that we've been\nHelping predominantly over the last you know year or so since Hurricane Irma [laughter] ah but what we're still finding even now a year and a year or so later after Irma is people are now just noticing they have water spots right you know or they just now noticed the the ceiling is bubbling up um\nMaybe they just looked in a corner of the room in their house they just never look at and these are yellow on the white drywall and um and so we're going into homes now and there's often what happens is there's a leak in your roofing system and it might be so small and so slow\nThat for that water to penetrate through the roofing system and get to the actual visible places when your house can literally take this long\nShared a roof last night right yeah I had to take a long time for you to figure out hey something's wrong here right\nYeah and so there's so many people that are dealing with this with their roofs that they're calling us going to have a leak in really what to do and really what's been happening is it's been leaking for a year or because they have shingles missing that they don't know about\nTorn shingles they have shingles that have lifted um where the water is driving up under the shingles which it's not supposed to do and that is really the greatest opportunity for water to get in your roofing system is underneath the shingles\nAfter that bond breaks where the single kind of tax down south yeah once the when pops up it's really difficult for that to lay back down and stick back the way it was I always say it's kind of like a sticker right like if you take a um Hi my name is Patrick and you put that sticker on your shirt right if you take the sticker off\nThen you put it back on your shirt ill stick but not the same right by the fibers and things aren't\nIn the more you do it at some point it just doesn't stick at all and you're saying a shingle is like that yeah so what happens is a shingles will lift during the storm er during the win whatever it is ... as a lift that tacky underneath the shingle it gets debris underneath it gets grass to get your water it gets\nA leaves the gets a little debris underneath there and it's not gonna stick back\nSo I was just that house not long ago in a house with totally normal and I got up on the roof in literally the whole back of the house I just went around with one finger at every single shingle lifted up\nSomeone looks fine it looked normal but when you actually got up there you can see it at the start even compromise\nExactly and we find that a lot of universal refund contracting where people call us and they'll say\nI'm not missing anything goes I think my roof is fine it's just I Want to make sure and we go out and sure enough\nShingles are lifted there might be shingles porn and so don't just assume because it visually looks good [laughter] that it's in good shape I mean there is a very good chance that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Under Oath with Matt Englett",
