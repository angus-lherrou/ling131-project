you want to go and not a well I just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt I thought well no he goes well you might as well get up and\nMove around on others as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and hung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were\nThere and uh I was like whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got up there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into the bar or they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar we're focused on me I didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck stuff about\nLike a bar full of empires from something here exactly as like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or at the slaughter bright and sign up on a rope or something yeah and and I\nI got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not very long ago I Need to go\nSo they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean this was an old dad ... yeah and I went in there with them\nAnd to this place and that was a bunch of old\nPeople that there again I felt that often that's in the air\nAnd uh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they found comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I've worked with him um and uh yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in the car and they finally decided well come on let's go well we go down the road\nA little bit and next thing you know a were off on the farm and the caller won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven of us on the car\nAnd uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum\nSo they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in a car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places\nEarlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I've started getting nervous around these people in and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name leaders are\nDoing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer and it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this dude and I went up her where\nShe looked at me and I was an eye out during the word she says are you pray him and I says yep [noise] and she goes even better\nShe knew one looming up\nI was like oh my goodness oh about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car
