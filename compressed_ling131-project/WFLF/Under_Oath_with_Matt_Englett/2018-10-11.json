{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "Okay um and so you're doing your budget in time\nAnd are you trying to put money in every category and the budget\nThey think they'll be currently even grocery do back here that twenty five dollars and that's how we scrape that a hundred dollars or twenty five dollars a week not and I'm OK Raman noodles or I can be in\nTouch and so what's your household income\nUm between thirty and forty thousand dollars a year they have an actual guard and wanting to get to go to our duty as an extra thousand dollars a month [noise] bang when he's home he works for my parents Showtime and have next thirty out here\nWhat does he do for a living me about your mhm okay\nSo what's he want to be doing ten years or Twenty years from now that makes them a lot more money\n[noise] um\nBecause you all are starving to death [laughter] I ... I talked to him about it and he's like oh I don't really know I Dream that would be nice to have more money [laughter]\nKind of acted\nHe is I'm always worked really hard we got married when he was Eighteen and he worked about sixty hours a week then on the corner and held it have heat it's a hard worker and he'd do anything for me\nMhm okay um\nI wasn't questioning hearty works I was questioning and making money\nYou see the difference yes I work real hard to ... yeah a lot\nLike this week already sixty hours and It's Wednesday so I'm\nOr Thursday or whatever it is I don't even forgot what that is are we go so anyway but I'm a I don't always do that every week but\nYou know you've got to look at things and say for the labor I'm putting out on the time I have away from my family and the stress and the strain on my body in my mind and my emotions what am I getting paid in Europe the answer is not much\nIn this part of what you are facing as your income challenge\nIs that right okay and I'm so why why does that bring tears\nI feel like we've just been we've had to go on\nAnd you know like I Try to be we try to be financially responsible you know we we've never will crawl extenders\nYeah I don't think ... I don't think you're irresponsible thinking my really I think you're doing really good 'cause you don't have the money\nI feel like at this point I had hoped to be a little bit more ahead they'll paycheck to paycheck you\nKnow but it there's two parts of the equation right the income side and they almost side\nAnd you know have you noticed I didn't even ask you about the ... and that's because I think you're probably doing pretty good there really aren't\nWe should have babies that number two down in about six months\nAnd I think you're right I think you're stretching the few dollars that you have really well so I think you're I think you're very responsible people I don't think you're overspending I don't think you're crazy I don't think are spoiled brats um and I think he's a hard worker\nYeah\nWell I think you've got all that stuff going for you and that's why I Want you to win better than your winning and so I really think you guys put the kids to bed and I turn off TV light a candle or two and just sit on back porch and talk and say\nWell we got to make some more money um and it's not 'cause money's everything is because when you are or you know doing the best you can do with the dollars you have and they're not stretch and then we've got to look at something well what are we going to do to create some additional income short term short term and long term\nWell actually we did last night and I actually got a job at a local library but after I pay for childcare only bring home about thirty to forty dollars a day [laughter]\n[laughter] so that's that's not that's not the answer then right after we got a better\nA better income coming into for childcare if you're going to be working [noise]\nPay out and he's got to have a game plan and I don't know whether he opens his own butcher shop or whether he becomes the most famous butcher in the world doing it on TV I don't\nCare what he does [laughter] I'm not saying you cannot be butchers but uh you can't be a butcher their ten years from now and be anywhere but where you are right now there's a sense\nYeah and so I I you know what are we going to do with the skill or this thing or did he just fall into this cause your parents were doing it or you know that's kind of exactly what happened you know and so but I mean what if let's just kind of take the white board out and start over erase our life on the white border second and say\nGosh if we can do anything we wanted to do what would we do\nYeah and then let's go about doing that today and walk in and throw you know throw your knife down and walk out that's not what I'm saying but I Am saying we need a plan that takes us somewhere where we say okay this month I got a hundred bucks left over but it's not always going to be this way\nBut it is always going to be that way if you don't change something agreed agreed okay I think you can do it you're good people this is not a\nIt's not a character issue and it's not a a lack of a effort issue and it's not an immaturity thing you guys just simply mathematically it's income minus outgoing or not much income\nYeah so and he told us\nWhat how do we go about playing with my parents then you know like it would really be when he's gone to drill here they always talk about how inconvenient it ends or that and it's so hard on my dad got heart problems and he had to take over all of the work that very very small operation\n\nWhich shows let's kind of think about this for this is not working for your bad\n\n'cause it's not working for has not working for you yeah so this whole thing and it working\n\nBut I don't know I mean the way up bring it up is we love your own we'd love to help you but we are starving to death over\nHere and we're not going to continue to do this anymore and you don't have to do it today but you you know you can say you know my husband who don't we're taking classes and he's going to be a an X or y or Z two years from now and that's what he's going to start doing 'cause that's really his dream\nBecause here's the thing was somebody is going to make some decisions to shut some stuff down or you're going to be sitting exactly where you see it\nOkay and I you know but ... you know you cannot be in this thing of oh we have to starve to death because that's the only way my parents have a good life\nAlthough that's not that's not logical\nThat doesn't make sense right yeah you're right and the truth is your dad if he's got a heart problem and your husband is not there he probably needs to sell theirs are closed right yeah and and so when you start thinking about that or does it make enough to support you guys if your dad was out of the picture\nDoes he need to go home\n[noise] well\n... they're linked though it's not like we divide them on a quake we're not like we're not at all part of the owners of it\nI Know but the owner cannot operate it without this particular employees or what your ship [laughter] oh well I guess the new the new employee or then you talk about selling it to you\nOr giving it to you or something I don't know y'all can talk about there's a lot of different ways out of this mess but continue to do the same thing is not a way out of the ...\nAnd um so ... trying to change the day and I have to change turkey turkey and nobody has to be mad and throw weight around or say anything uncommon\nBut we just have to lay say you know five years from now are we doing some different ten years from now it'll be something doing something different and we're going to make more money are starving to death get um that's where all these fears are coming from stress and now I'm Out in your dad's good people too and I feel I fully understand\nThis is the day Ramsey show\n\nHey guys just

piece\nWFL I find ... Orlando news radio Ninety three point one WFL a and I heard radio station [noise]\nAs a tough as this day is on Wall street I still put it in context historic context and as we close in on Halloween here's kind of a scary little factoid the bottom\nClosing of the S. and P. five hundred in modern history a depending on how you defined modern history was march ninth two thousand nine that was kind of the the bottom after the financial crisis\nAnd it closed at six six six [noise] so uh as scary and an number and we'd also like to talk about is that is if you invested in ... five hundred a E. F. T. or index fund on that date you would have had a four hundred and ten percent return on your money even after the drop we experienced\nOn the last few days so put it in context markets have taken a big correction but they're still doing very well [noise] uh but this like I said in the beginning this is one of those days that I hate to tell you I told you so but never inevitably had to have happened\nAnd as I Do on the show all the time especially in a rising market I say you know be aware of investing\nI'm funds that you really can't\nLose in the short run when you hear all this news about rising markets you know if you turn on financial shows you'll hear to die in the financial show of course yeah Bye bye bye And all that type of stuff\nAnd what happens is um an investor who doesn't invest all the time\nAnd uh he listens to this and they kinda get excited and they build up but they hold back and they end up buying high at a time like this or a market peaks of twenty six thousand or twenty six to wherever it peaked and\nThat's when the corruption happens and what happens is they tend to lose that initial investment announced they keep it in the long run they'll make it back and do just fine of course but what happens is they get in\nMarket cracks they feel like they made a big mistake they get nervous and then they pull out of the market and of course that never get that investment back\nSo this is the ... this is a time when I say you know this is when really the week it harsher do use a better term of folks like me that don't have a lot of extra funds to\nTo lose in the short run need to be careful not jump in a market uh when corrects like this and to balance your investments with some nice super safe old fashion admittedly boring but old fashioned safe\nDeposit products like savings money market and a certificate of pot deposit such as a CD interest go bank\nA we offer a wide range of CD products and this is also a time with rising interest rates that I'm very careful to say uh you know be careful of going too long and the CD so we keep our CDs relatively short term our best featured rate is a too\nTo five percent for two years and then we have a\nTwo percent for Fifteen months and then a a one point seven one point uh eighty five percent for nine months and that's those are nice terms a nice way to return relative to years past\nAnd um it it won't be too long is rates are going to rise even more most likely [noise] so\nWhat we know that you're dealing with the bank you who you're dealing with when you look at compare rates you'll see rates sometimes in the Sunday paper\nThat seem a too good to be true and as the old saying goes if it's too good to be true it might be so I encourage everyone to look at a website called ... our financial dot com Bowers and national organization that rates banks and credit unions\nAnd uh they have a formula that puts the other many variables on all these banks and credit unions and comes out with the star rating and they probably say that they recommend a all four and five star rated banks\nAnd trust bank is proud to be considered a five star rated by our bank so I don't listen to me of course I'm going to tell you were awesome but I'd recommend anyone for anything to listen to something like ... our financial dot com\nAnd make sure that you're dealing with a bow recommended for five star bank\nOr when you compare rates that's an apples to apples cause may not know if a bank and we've seen him around here unfortunately if a bank ever gets taken over by the FBI see where the regulator uh the acquiring bank has actually the right to break your CD and give you whatever rate they want at the time\nSo uh that rate as locked in as you think it is is not as locked in as you think it is even though it's FDIC insured so being with a good strong bank is nice piece of mind plus we've been around for since Nineteen oh two\nAnd a while there's a lot of good banks in this area you'll also find that uh\nUh they tend to come and go pretty quickly and there's wonderful bank that uh I follow I admire that I was just a put it in the paper recently that is going to be acquired by bank of Georgia's so another one bites the dust as they say so sticking with the banks been around since Nineteen oh to\nUh I can say we're pretty safe there will be around for a few more years at least\nSo when we come back um I like to talk about rising rates and rising rates in terms of loans and rising rates in terms of deposits some more and what that means for youth so stick to

today [laughter] [noise]\nWe'll come back to money talks ... and this was money talks powered by trust go bank run our third segment\nI was going to talk about bi weekly mortgages and I will in a minute but we have some tax that I wanted to go over\nA one person ... should I take out a home equity loans do home improvements I eat roof window pool repair oh I'm Sorry if you have to do roof window or pool repair\nBut a yes home equity loan assuming you have the equity is my favorite way to do such things in my favorite way to borrow actually one of my favorite products to offer\nAnd is a a home equity line of credit banks offer you most banks offer home equity lines of credit as well as home equity loans the differences one is fixed rate and as a normal monthly payment like any other loan and the other home equity line of credit is a variable rate\nAnd allows you to borrow and repay it kind of like a credit card although I hate to use that analogy\nBut I really liked the home equity line of credit\nJust for that reason it gives you a allows you to manage what you do with the funds\nIf you take out a home equity line of credit or you don't do anything until you write a check in advance that line of credit [noise] um [noise] if you uh take out a home equity loan you're going to make a payment than a month whether you've actually spent the money or not\nSo home equity lines of credit or more versatile from that perspective they also charge interest only monthly\nAnd which is why I always tell when I was a branch manager I Would tell people I really love the home equity line of credit for disciplined people\nMeaning it is kind of a credit card on the house so you need to be disciplined with it but I mean your discipline with your funds um equity line of credit is a great way to borrow as as long as you stay under the cap deductions cap still tax deductible\n[laughter] um so I really like home equity lines of credit the rates are low um ours for instance is a two point nine nine for the first year and then it goes up to what's called the prime lending rate which has now around five percent so am I going to cross lines of credit are great for that they're also very inexpensive\nUm our home equity line of credit trust go bang for instance there's zero closing costs\nAre so there's no closing costs to go home equity line of credit with us at all as opposed to mortgages where you used to it so yes I Would recommend it for that and then you just keep it there in case you need it later 'cause it stays available to you for ten years\nNext one was how to best way to repair my credit well the best way that's a long question but a best way to repair your credit is start making those payments um I Would also get a free credit report for many of the agencies\nAnd look to see if there's any collection accounts on there that you didn't know about I had a personal experience with this very recently I went to get a car loan or who's going to put my son on a car loan and I signed a form of course just to build his credit because while I'm a true believer and Dave Ramsey\nAnd that's why we ask them to be a spokesperson it and that's why we follow him on the show um\nPeople the world unfortunately puts way too much emphasis on credit score and building credit and um [noise] as a result um while you\nCertainly do well without any kind of credits at all it's not easy to do and the way things are structured today so\nRepairing your credit one thing to do is get a free credit report and see if you have any collection accounts on there that my experience was I uh went to get this car loan and they said are you actually have a collection account that turned out to be a through a local hospital\nAnd it was something that I didn't even know about it was an emergency room visit that I had that I was admitted and ended up having surgery and bought shirts took care of everything and I never got any collection calls and I never got any collection letters and lo and behold some\nFly by night collection agency out in the western part of the state uh had some sort of collection account for me so that was not a pleasant experience as it turned out the insurance getting insurance company didn't pay it [noise]\nUm but through a glitch in the system it didn't get credited so there was a case where my credit was damaged by something that I didn't have to pay and was actually paid by my insurance company so uh well I certainly support and applaud all the great work that are\nHospitals do um the whole building situation with the insurance companies and multiple insurance companies in some cases ah can cause errors to happen so get that free credit report and see if there's anything on there you didn't know about and then try to get a clear it up", "show_name": "Under Oath with Matt Englett", "year": "2018", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "11"}
