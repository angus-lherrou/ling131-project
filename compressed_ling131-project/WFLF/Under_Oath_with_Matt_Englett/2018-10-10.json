I think that's what he owed on the car at the time they reported you only\nCan he owed when they rape artists Seventy thousand yeah what was he driving the garb and like I think it absolutely outrageous [laughter]\nUh yeah any roads and negative equity into that to get the ... and ... and so the the forty five thousand is the difference okay they'll settle that for pennies on the dollar really probably sell about for ten grand but the rest of the stuff I don't know I mean the ex wife thing I don't know what you're going to do that how in the world ends up on her and these two attorneys\nUm [laughter] while a you might be able to settle those would lump sum ... I mean you might walk up to her and say here's a check for thirty if you go away\nUm and uh she might take it you know but you'd have to have the thirty thousand dollars is what I'm doing better not thirty dollars and so you know you're going to put some money together here and that means both of you were going to get your incomes up and you both have to have like I desire to get out of money\nOr to get out of debt and to make more money to do that you have to both have this thing and it's still going to take you a few years I mean if you guys just go bananas it's going to take you a few years\nSo um\nThat that's what you're facing and um but the the thing is folks I hear those will be dating out there it is not a deal breaker as far as I'm concerned it can be for you you decide what you want to do with your life but I don't tell people to not to get married over that\nI Do tell them to not get married over the decision to stay in debt when you don't want to stay in that because that's going to be when you can't be an agreement on money before you get married when money is the number one cause of divorce we can highly predict that your marriage is not gonna last\nIt's it's ... it's okay if the number one cause a divorce you don't agree on\nGuess what you're going to get divorced I mean there's uses a fairly simple equation here and so you have to be in agreement so I don't the two fifty doesn't scare me scares me but it doesn't terrify me to say this guy's not a keeper\nDon't know if he's a keeper or not I can't tell he sure has a bad taste and lawyers and all that but because he got his way up but um anyway man he ends up paying her lawyer his lawyer owes her Seventy grand and half of his income\n[laughter] which is not a ... that's a good gosh [laughter] so uh wow\nYeah somebody so anyway yeah ... this was not\nAn equitable outcome I have no idea what the situation was but wow what a mess\nAnyway so the all of that is behind this now the question is are we committed to cleaning it up if we are then ready to go game all that's fine thanks for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Alex is in Pittsburgh hey Alex our you\nHey Dave how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\nVery good hey we are newly married and looking\nTo create a plan forward good\nTo right away so newly a newly came onto your videos on YouTube so I'm as I'm going through it looks like we are on step there were a free we of six months of a savings both put about Fifteen to Seventeen percent into four one K. wow a new\nOne out or ... or plan that you've already done all of it\nDoesn't happen all the time really really good for you okay so what's your question\nYeah no kidding oh college fund so it's kind of like Ron step six out of about ... ... mortgages are only to okay [laughter]\nI Know and with that we have about Fifteen thousand extra on savings on top of our six month emergency fund so the question is a story about forty eight on the house is worth about a hundred ... um and it's an a good rental area so our goal is to move in about two to four years\nAnd with that fourteen Fifteen extra grand do we use that\nTo start paying off the mortgage more uh right now I Do double payments so already actively trying to pay that off quicker\nBut do we we commit to paying off house early or do we split it and keep keep doing the uh paying down the mortgage and poking up for a um a down payment knowing that one too\nI Love real estate and if you have a desire to homerun all real estate I really want you to get there
