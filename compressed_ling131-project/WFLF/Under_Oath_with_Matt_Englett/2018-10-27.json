there'll be like and it was like no they weren't [laughter] so I mean I think some of it as an education piece and and I think that's where great science writing and science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not\nFor us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself but anyway [laughter] and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this may be totally irrelevant right because\nBy that time the beds and you're going to have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into our DNA when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense then ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about is how big the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be\nYeah I Will yeah but yeah I don't give it a little plug for an up and down there I think you question you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a pond and find it says that they will pray that they would die\nAnd they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this period that you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether it's immortality would be a blessing or a curse a ... you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\n[noise] well it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse a summer camp\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nEr and and so I I'd I'd love to think for about this reference to revelation [noise]\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of a ... of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot ...\n... we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's in the form of a big computer server or it's\nIn the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex and so beyond the you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYeah [laughter] you know it's like the sky net running it's like\nRunning on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the word from saying\nAll sorts of crushed souls of the people in stumps on on you know getting I think you get some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like\nTry and everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know [laughter]\n... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so Jack Lew is exactly where I'm living and by the way\nTo is somebody with a I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say it's really interesting about the Bible and\nIt's the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject\nOf immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolved the so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona and coast to coast David\nGoing hey my question for example and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing me because it sounds like a really good\nQuestion [laughter] yeah and they do we just leave them\nAnd we just love [laughter] oh\nNo Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nI enjoy your show but uh\nBeen kicking machine going on forty five years ... macular degeneration I'd like you know from your guest or when you feel that the shoe will be overcome through Chris or or\nA maybe a journey either by pigs I'll take my answer off the air\nAnd hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you [noise] go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machinery and\nHe's on dialysis is on kidney machines and ...\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now uh with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman who had the operation and you know even though her\nFight it's still not crystal clear she can she can make out fate and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but\nWe're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that or is already working on a second generation\nA that will help actually restore\nSight and people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these primarily a there's a lot of great research and I've reported\nOn off for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell or ... it might\nCreate a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left ended with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and a four year ... spirit and looking forward to carrying on a with open lines next on coast to coast am this is he\nRight Limbaugh you're faced with a challenge to the media picks a story that is their number one story and its

shops and the moving jar\nIf you didn't here's the story on coast to coast am wrote down\nIn downtown Oregon City here are here it's just like at least that's the theory behind paranormal activity witness that fine zero trees a can of his dispensary\nWhat's going to happen now behold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy Gomez next to it\nI thought it was happening and I felt like somebody was standing there like somebody was like right here\nSuddenly the jar falls off the level surface that does happen then Andy remembered the surveillance can live with all the time\nNot long after that this happened watched the Penn ... it's completely skill and no one's around when suddenly depends begin to move\nAnd if you think the videos been doctored as a candidate shop that would be against the law that they had many as GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with\nYou as a farm in ... so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there's no real explanation for why there are goes there\nBut that video ... especially ... and the fact that we were really got me was because it's a kind of a shop law mandates they can't touch the video\n... what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it you want to jump in on open lines of ... let me go to a Mike in Charlotte North Carolina coast to coast to get us started Mike\nAnything good morning hours y'all\n[laughter] we're good thank you\nYeah Halloween all out of the night the hills run in the

are aware of nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but I I I it's impossible because we are not God that was all I have to say\nOh it's fair enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated\nSo a lot of people would say that and it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were why wouldn't it have a soul if other people out there have you know\nUh other men if there are other people who have uh the problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease you know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human or that they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology young soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because I used to be the thing that people said about test tube babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that\nUh okay let's get to where we get a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi I'm I or world power guys first of all for not let in for five years I don't want to get too much into

even know what to do and that sort of firemen now and furthermore\nIn our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first survival situations and there are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know piling compiling surprise for\nThree years to come for for them is families with multiple wives with multiple shoulder with multiple multiple and um and we don't really we are not really part it whether or not\nWe are usable and we don't know even with\nTraining we don't know if\nThe supplies what's this phone somebody in a cave or in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt at all you like to I'm falling scare myself not to\nConsume companies supplies but just chew on my cell and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer\nA myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just hear somebody could even\nHis thing then sell an interesting you don't really know even with things like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know it's going to survive it could be a child\nIt could be a twelve year
