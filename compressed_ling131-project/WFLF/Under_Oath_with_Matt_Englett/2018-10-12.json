Arbor wealth management you got it coming at you are right here\nFor the next hour well we don't have a four hour last no no no last segment we hit on a lot of good stuff we had a lot of the actions that have changed grasp what these all these crazy tax balls going into effect people are still trying to dissect this thing right now\nWe're gonna hit you with what matters for retirees 'cause that's what we talk about right here they're reinventing retirement show\nNow Chris we talked about health care tax credits education credits the directions are those are things that you need to know folks you need to know him\nBut you can check a box on that stuff that that those are pretty easy your account and can do that Sam right exactly not a complex right not that complex what we're going to talk about for the next few minutes\nIs what the effect of IRAs and four one K. is have on your taxes yeah and retirement that's what we\nCare about is the diaries hey when I go to for my money that I worked forty years for to put together and accumulate and I go to pull it out my IRA for like ... to spin how bad am I going to get hammered that's what we want to\nKnow what it comes down to that so we need to know how much am I going to have to give away in taxes so your uncle so your Uncle Sam not use them and on IRS I'm for that and don't ... I mean like that Chris is right on that don't go look here so\nYou will be affected now we just got to know how All right how well he here's some things to to understand when you go to pull your money out of your for all and K IRA right you're going to to pay income tax write well\nDo you think that you're elites out there I'm Talking you know you're you're one percenters sent do are they in are they paying through the nose in\nTaxes I mean we all know Warren Buffett's worth what I don't know fifty billion I don't know was it Fifteen or sixteen pretty ... said sixteen percent was bragging about that's it isn't the top bracket made for him\nYeah there's people on main street\nRight now that don't ... don't have Seventy billion dollars if they make Seventy thousand they're getting taxed at twice the rate what's that\nOkay what's up with that so they're using strategies alright absolutely obviously they're using strategies\nNow here's this here's the kicker though Sam they're using the strategies the same strategies that everyone has access to mhm that everyone can use it doesn't matter\nYou live on Wall Street or main street you actually have access to these whether you knew it or not and I'm telling you right now you do\nSo to figure that out what that means is hey cannot lower my tax brackets potentially let's say by fifty percent like these one percenters yes you can get you Sam exactly you're exactly right so what you got to do is you gotta you gotta understand how to do it\nAnd it's a whole lot simpler than most people think Sam what it comes down to as a group of strategies that you in that you can employ right away\nThat would potentially lawyer tax brackets by fifty percent this is actually\nAll contained in our tax Matt ... that we provide complementary to people\nAnd it's in attacks map and it's going to show you exactly how you can go about lowering your tax brackets of potential about fifty percent getting into that hey that ten percent tax bracket Chris everybody is so different it really pays their habit personalized to and you got to have a personal life is everyone's different\nRight but ... the ... the tax map what we're talking about does this and it is customize for you\nRight but we can't we can't do this for everybody because the the switchboard of air from the calls light up too fast too many people sell\nWhat we can do is we can offer this for the Senate next ten people most of the next ten ten people that call and you can get your own personalized tax map\nThat is complimentary that will show you how and how much more money you can keep them safe from your IRAs and your ...\nAnd how much lower you can lower your tax records quite simple just strategies are in there and it's up to you just just to use them right it's all contained in the tax map so what am I going to give you the number real quick and you call in and get that company right tax map for yourself\nAlright if where you calling lower taxes and retirement that's right what it's about as\nNinety four percent the question is can they go back there\nWell I think uh we've already heard that answer having one yeah I mean look debt if there's anything to make us go back to a higher tax bracket in the future in which we think they absolutely will get its debt you know something's funny Chris is a\nNot really too funny actually is back then we didn't have Nineteen trillion in debt right\nAnd what did you say that top tax bracket was it was Ninety four and back in the seventies it was still in the ... in the sixties and eighties beginning of the eighties is is in the fifties so you can see if you've got mounting piles of debt the government is not a business right\nIs the only way it gets incumbents how from us from taxes it's got a service this day where do you think they're gonna get it they're going to get it from us\nSo that's one thing that blows my mind is taxes were higher when we last Adam if something's gotta give their right\nSo so taxes are going to go up we got a lot of debt water people to do and retirement tax are going to go up in the future\nOkay let's say you're in a twenty five percent tax bracket right now okay it hurts but wonder if that goes up to forty five now you're taking home forty five percent less money now you're taking a forty five percent loss every year in retirement\nThat is crippling sill instead is there a way can we turn the tables and get a forty five percent growth every year by simply not paying taxes well yeah if you don't pay the taxes\nAnd you're getting forty five percent more money in this case in your pocket and you're essentially getting so forty five percent more growth but can you can you not pay\nTaxes and not go to jail\nIf it's tax free income that's not qualified and you don't have to pay on then yeah okay if it's set up correctly yeah does it set up correctly I got to do is read the whole tax code everybody you'll find it in there right so who wants to do that though let me open up Pandora's box for a second now the ultra wealthy\nThey don't pay any taxes in retirement using the rats strategy you know it was a very well known strategy in the ultra wealthy communities\nYou know Chris I bought ran through my mind as soon as you said that high tax bracket 'cause you know who never ends up paying the actual high tax brackets the ultra wealthy the
