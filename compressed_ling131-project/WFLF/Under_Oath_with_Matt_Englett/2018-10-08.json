I just think of their him for a lot and I have come back and offer them that they you laugh without lie\nAnd all that will have to go I think that for a cat here for six hundred and fifty thousand dollars mhm [noise] and at the table at a ... percent down fat and now I get all the time I own ate it for thirty thousand dollar pay that cash I catch the whole thing\nUm but I'm just wondering if something is better to buy it rather than start out because I Know how it started out but they say like hey I just don't want to get your opinion on it\n[noise] well um what I have found is the number one cause of small business failure is cash flow\nAnd cash flow is restricted by primarily to things that cause businesses to fail but don't take care of their tax bill and they get by on on their taxes and they go into debt number two and so um you you increase your probability of failure ...\nIf you go into debt and do this\nAnd I have to tell you I personally don't borrow money for anything and I have never in Thirty years we're doing the show advised anyone to go into debt to buy a business and ever and so I'm not going to do that because you have to pay this bill whether all those clients leave the next month or not\nAnd that could bankrupt you\nCan measure fairly easily actually does you basically don't have any money\nAnd so I don't know what the value of an insurance agency is they are valued you know you've got a a you know you've got a book of business the book of business has a value and it has a um a persistence rate and I mean the number of people you lose two attrition or don't lose too attrition each year\nUm and that persistence rate and the size of the book business creates a certain amount of cash flow generally speaking the net profit after everyone including the owner that's operating ... a business have been paid the net profit the taxable income of the business\nTimes for or maybe times five is a small business equation on insurance industry might be different than that I don't know but what what is the net profit if you were running this thing after you pay you a salary\nFor what I haven't got can how can\nYou would make three hundred and ten thousand dollars in the first year\nThat barely a profit\nI don't have access to the book yeah profit\nOut after the rent is paid the secretary is paid\nEvery body I paint\nAt their payroll after ...\nAfter ... after insurance I Know\nWell that's not a bad price on a business if you can pay it all back in two years in\nLA kind of tricky came out here\nWell if you if you're only paying six fifty four it was sixty five thousand down and you make three ten you live on nothing you pay it all back\nNot thinking oh\nOkay well then it takes three years yeah All right but uh uh that's that's about what I'm Talking about then it sounds like it sounds like about four times the net profit because that does not include having paid you\nAnd so there about four factor that's a fairly normal appraisal Rachel they're not ripping you off on the price has a but I Would not go into to do it I Would start your own\nOkay and then when you go make a bunch of money in your own if you want to add to your own by buying out another practice you could save up the money and do that if you are making two ten in through every three years you could save up and buy a business is worth six hundred right\nRight and so for me that's pretty cool we can do that later and add to your book of business by buying out other agencies are buying out other stand alone\nBut I I Can't recommend I personally wouldn't do it if I was twenty five years old if I was forty five years older but I was put to voters or I personally wouldn't do that\nUm I Would start my own and got it out I did that with this business we started on a card table my living room we've never borrowed a dime there's just under eight hundred of us working here and it's a two hundred million dollar business in seven buildings\nSo um but we started on a card table my living room and all the bumps and bruises alone when I'm really glad I didn't have any debt Vicky is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Vicky how are

retirement their proper information mhm\nThere's so much misinformation out there that causes people to miss windows bumper trinity Chris we tell them every Saturday here's your window of opportunity\nListening give some nugget skin empowered and take control your retirement hey before he went to a break though we said when we come back we're going to tell you some interesting stories right here about Ronald Reagan we're also going to hit on a little bit of a a major strategy\nThat's kind of hidden from the everyday average American mhm has been since Nineteen eighty\nAre Chris oh I Want you to talk a little bit about Reagan and one of the strategies he utilized mhm before we do that guys on this show we tell you things have gotten us featured on Forbes the same strategies we use we're going to tell you on the show\nRight an top five retirement advisor in his country that's what we talk about every Saturday is the same stuff that got us featured\nThat's why this shows the most powerful show on weekend radio what a better time to talk about a great president Ronald Reagan okay doesn't matter where you sit on what's which party line Ronald Reagan was a it was a great man okay and Ronald Reagan\nBelieve it or not and most people don't know this younger generation doesn't I don't think was an actor before he was president\nOkay wow he's an actor so it was a pretty good actor Hugh ... is pretty good he had some swag Disney [laughter]\nSo ... now Ronald Reagan if you look back over his time frame he only made to movies a year\nTo movies two movies that's it not because he wasn't good at acting we've already said that\nIt ... it had it was something different something more important okay here's the reason why so first of all when he made to when he made a movie he got paid about a hundred thousand dollars which at a time of the highest paid actor yeah yeah so a hundred thousand dollars per movie\nOkay and so he made two and two hundred thousand dollars now you got to know something first of all you got to know that at this time period\nWhen he was acting that the taxes top tax bracket was Ninety four percent\nNinety four\nPeople think when you ask people where do you think taxes are now do you think are lower high most of the time they say low much great majority and they say love I said look if we look over history actually we are at historical lows for taxes even though we are mounting\nPiles of debt that is cause for concern\nLook Chris I Know that fact but man it doesn't feel like it every year when I got to cut that right [laughter] yes\nI hear you about that you know so here sue here's what Ronald Reagan and he's at a Ninety four percent tax bracket right so what he did and it was once you made over two hundred thousand dollars you're taxed at Ninety four percent so\nHe just didn't make a third movie it it'd be worth less you'd get six six thousand bucks so taxes\nCauses to miss out on some potentially great movies guys so so the taxes and Ninety and Ninety four percent the question is can they go back there\nWell I think we've already heard that answer having one yeah I mean look debt if there's anything to make us go back to a higher tax bracket in the future it which we think they absolutely will\nGet its debt you know something's funny criticism or well not really too funny actually is back then we didn't have Nineteen trillion in debt right and what did you say that top tax\nBracket was it was Ninety four and back in the seventies it was still in the ... in the sixties in the eighties beginning of the eighties is is in the fifties so you can see if you've got mounting piles of debt the government is not a business right is the only way it gets income as how from us\nFrom taxes it's got a service this day where do you think they're gonna get it they're going to get it from us\nSo that's one thing that blows my mind is taxes were higher when we last and I mean something's got to give their\nRight so so taxes are going to go up we got a lot of debt water people to do and retirement tax are going to go up in the future\nOkay let's say you're in a twenty five percent tax bracket right now ... and that hurts but what if that goes up to forty five now you're taking home forty five percent less money now you're taking a forty five percent loss every year in retirement\nThat is crippling still instead is there a way can we turn the tables and get a forty five percent growth every year by\nSimply not paying taxes well yeah if you don't pay the taxes and you're getting forty five percent more money in this case in your pocket and you're essentially getting so forty five percent more growth but can you can you not pay taxes\nAnd not go to jail if it's tax free income\nThat's not qualified and you don't have to pay on that then yeah okay if it's set up correctly yeah that is set up correctly I got to do is read the whole tax code everybody you'll find it in there right so who wants to do that though\nLet me open up Pandora's box for a second now the ultra wealthy they don't pay any taxes in retirement using the rats strategy you know a very well known strategy in the ultra wealthy communities\nYou know of course that bought ran through my mind as soon as you said that high tax bracket 'cause you know who never ends up paying the actual high tax
