I have a couple of trust here or there but the they have different functions then what this guy is describing and she'll know I Would not build trust now you can set up and you have your attorney or a state planning attorney do this not your financial advisor I trust to a family trust to be formed upon your death\nAnd upon your death some money if both of you die and you have minor children the money goes into addressed and then it's management to go to the children was talking about that in the first segment of the shower\nAnd um or a second second mothers our I guess but you can do that that's that's not that hard to do and it doesn't really cost anything because there's no trust being formed in no trust happening unless both of you died I had that in my will when my children were minors\nAnd then of course my will has changed since the children are of age\nThey're no longer legally children emotionally either for that matter but there and we go so I mean some of you have children that are emotionally still minors but of chronologically moved on like the guy [laughter]\nThirty Years' old ask him what he did for a living he said I'm a stay at home son [laughter] I'm a stay at our own sun [laughter] what a cure but in the street [laughter] my name is Mike in Chicago [laughter] hey my ...\nI'm good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I uh have a baby step too I have a ton of medical bills um and recently I was originally paying ten bucks a month for a medical bill that I had\nA they stopped it was an automatic withdrawal and I stopped taking out and they've sent my account to collections and then to a lawyer and refinance film into court ... I'm I'm just trying to figure out what my\nOptions are all if I Need to hire a lawyer or what I Need to do\nHow much is on that bill a Fifteen\nSixty one thousand five hundred and fifty okay and what's your household income\nOr about Seventy five thousand dollars for him and what ten dollars a month because of all the other bills\nYeah I got all campaign hundred dollars in medical bills and a lot of credit card as well student loan so what's what's the total medical bill balance\nOf all the medical bills and I have are probably Fifteen thousand dollars mhm huh and my daughter just diagnosed with a few other medical issues that more bills will be coming show\nHow to get a dollar and\nA three and cry and what were the medical issues or she\nHas what's called ... syndrome a a carry mail formation and then she was diagnosed with epilepsy ...\n\nOkay you're going to you guys have a hard time with this little baby girl honey\nYeah yeah she's got a few ever since she was born so they have a lot of things going on [noise]\nAnd how much credit card that do you have a lawyer probably\nAt twenty five thousand dollars\nMhm and how much didn't want to do\nThat one up there that's about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars ...\nWho's the doctor [laughter] I'm just a teacher my wife has stayed home um [noise]\nHuh [noise] All right [noise] um well what normally happens if you have a heart\nAnd you're a good person and you have a baby that is sick you pay all of your attention to the baby and it drains every drop of emotion and love and concentration and focus out of your family your body and your life and it's all directed at this baby\nAnd that's what's that's what's happened to you which just means you're a good dad and the good husband\nYou guys are not paid attention to the money at all and all that means is your human but as screwing up your life now and you're going to have to deal with it right [noise] yeah so as tough as it is I'm your daughter is not going to get one hundred percent of your attention anymore\nI'm your money's going to have to get some percentage until you get this thing back under control shores put their student loans or if they're not already on hardship referral um if you scrape together five to seven hundred dollars on offer it to the attorney on this Fifteen hundred dollars is a lump sum settlement they'll take it\nOkay because we called today are very feminine federally call today and we said you know we ... what can we do and they just said um you either pay the full amount of court cheese and attorney fees ... or hire a lawyer and when the when court okay\nYou're going to come back and say I've got five hundred bucks I can use that for a lawyer or I can give it to you to settle is that what you want to be one of the\nOkay and what if they don't take that and then you\nYou keep messing with the national weather and messing with them\nBecause they're like listen or you are dealing not with an attorney you're probably not even dealing with a paralegal you're dealing with a large law firm that runs medical collections through like a ... in a factory this is your life at your daughter is the illness and the struggles\nIt's got a lot of emotion tied to it to them\nThey have no soul there is nothing to this thing except you're just a number on a page\nAnd they have a whole bunch of numbers on a page they talked to ... stop thousand people I Do every single day and they give everybody the exact same script\nOkay this is not like you owe me money and I called them we would actually talk about it you're dealing with a robot in a factory and if you get that yeah talking to your head when you're talking to the person on the other line it's emotional to you it is not to them\nIt's a robot in a factory\nLike a movie okay and just keep that amount and just keep going well I don't have that so does that computer for you you know can you compute that I don't have Fifteen hundred dollars and that may go into court or you're taking me to court doesn't make me have Fifteen hundred dollars I simply do not have it I Do have five hundred and sixty two and you can have every bit of that\nAnd if you have every bit of that you have to get a settlement in full no I Will not give it to you as a partial payment to get started no\nI'm not going to put this on payments that hasn't worked for me and it hasn't worked for you but I Will settle this with you for pennies on the dollar and you're going to be lucky to get that 'cause I got so much debt coming out my ears from this little girl that I'm pretty sick or you people and I'm thinking about filing bankruptcy and given use zero anyway\nAnd you are having these conversations with these idiots okay now you legitimately all the money so we are going to work with them but you know you just keep it all ended\nUp it's not it ended up going to court\nOr it ended up going to court then they will take a judgment against you you don't need an attorney you're going to lose okay because you all the money and they weren't in before the judge and the judge says Mike deal with the money and you say yes and he goes guilty [noise]\nRight over it as a matter if we tell them you know my daughter's fifth grade I had all his hair [noise]\nI don't ... I don't care if the industrial side of the medical world they don't care I'm Sorry I Wish they did but I Do and so I just try to satellites and then let's put together a system to work out of this whole mess and I'll help you put together the whole system and financial ... university and I'm going to put you through that for free you and your wife are going to get\nYour arms around the money thing to put yourself in a position of strength to walk through the rest of the junior year to walk through with his daughter because you've got to fight with you you got this thing will will with you hold on\nThis day Ramsey show\nGuys this is James child producer of the day Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing aid on six hundred radio stations across\nTo find one near you had to Dave Ramsey dot com slash shown\n[noise]\nDid you know that fifty\nSix percent of homeowners are over paying for their insurance and one in three drivers is doing the same thing that means there's a pretty good chance your spending more than you have to\nOwn insurance and folks just because you're paying a lot of money doesn't mean you have the coverage that you really need when you work with an independent insurance agent you get access to dozens of insurance carriers through one person that\nMeans lots of policy options and little work on your part our endorsed local providers are independent agents who will find the policy that works best for you\nIt doesn't take long to get a quote and you could save hundreds sounds like a no brainer to me go to Dave Ramsey dot com defined the insurance he'll be in your area and see how much bang you can get for your buck it's time to stop over paying and get the policy that works best\nFor you go to Dave Ramsey dot com to connect with your local insurance E.

Fox News that's the warning from Florida governor Rick Scott hurricane Michael now a category ... storm with top sustained wind it one hundred twenty miles per hour it'd\nYou know for windows that you love to look out of that when it comes to replacement time you're like oh boy\nRight exactly and so yeah you have um you know so yeah absolutely specialty when those costs more than than regular windows and Anderson is the the ... by Anderson is\nA really the premium a window on the market but also you know it has been developed and designed for the purpose of replacement and so in Florida you know we have a lot of existing homes that have aluminum single pain and glass windows so they're\nThey're horribly inefficient um you know your your energy in this area his yang all of that\nIs absolutely you know and of course this summer's been super hot super rainy and uh and so you know where we are are faced with challenges how do we make sure we install these highly energy efficient windows making sure that all the water proofing has done correctly\nAnd uh and that the customer home is beautiful side as well as really improve their energy efficiency\nNow I just had a situation at my house where we had a window as the original winner to the house in elite it created a mold situation and everything had to come out and describe the whole thing and\nYou start to really think about what's happening in my other one does at what point should you really start considering replacing your window\n[noise] well I think you know for that it does vary for for people you know I mean I think um you know if you look at your how home it was an older home bill\nYou know ... two thousand five\nYou're going to have aluminum single paying windows mhm so you're going to have an efficient windows so that's something if if energy efficiency is is really important to you and reducing um\nYou know our carbon footprint or however you inherited a you know that that is a great reason to to get your windows replace you know because again in Florida I don't know why I'm builders always just thought hey this is for to\nNeed official windows and doesn't make sense because it's all I mean that's single pain windows um and it's you know and it's just doesn't make any sense\nUm and then another time would just be the function do you do your windows operate do they do they operate well um do they uh you can you slide 'em up on on on the nice days and when winter in in the spring can you open your windows and and have a nice a air flow through your home\nAnd you know a lot of times or the way some of the order windows the melon servers and walk systems and even the screen systems don't work I I had in my house I had a single pain aluminum windows and I couldn't open I'm not because they didn't work but because the screen system was so seems silly that hey I Can't have my windows because of the screen\nWill actually keep anything out see I don't know if and some of my windows and house now because I'm afraid the winters are going to come down like that the springs systems and um they they aren't super trustworthy as I'm sure as they once were and with a little one in the house my fear is that she's going to go to open a window or go play by the window and it's going to come down so that's a red flag for me right there\nAbsolutely is that is a concern and then um you know and so you do have to be careful with those things I also have a young kids and you know they get into everything absolutely very inquisitive they want they want to figure it out and then um\nYou know and then another reason and it's a very valid reason is they just don't look nice you know the the grills or falling if they do have to pay and there's a ... a seal failure in between so in between your glass logging enough\nAnd a nod yeah doesn't look nice and you know so I became my front windows right yeah our ... [laughter] I mean I understand\nAnd uh uh we'd love to put some new ones in there for you but I you know so uh in our homes obviously our our biggest investment and do we want to uh and I wanted to look beautiful yeah\nAnd functional and house it to help out with bills and whatnot and if you are intrigued by what Jim and I are talking about here with me and my aunts and they do have a limited offer going on right now at least for the first seven colors\nThat if you want to get the information go ahead and call now because ... percent off all windows and doors plus twenty percent off installation and just doing the quick math in my head that's a lot of money that you can save right now so you want to call\nA date for a for nine for eight zero that's eight for eight for nine for eight\nZero if you want to take advantage of this which is happening right now for the first set in college and a new by ... percent off all windows and doors plus twenty percent off your installation\nAt eight eight eight for eight or nine for eight\nZero so like I've been talking with you about here I've been really considering changing out my windows and doors for a long time now\nWith the storms last year I really thought that was going to be the final push but now that I'm thinking about it with the I got the leaking into one window I've got sliding glass doors that my daughter can barely open and I get down there and Greece them up as often as I can but they're just big and heavy and that's also something else as a mom you know\nThe stores and there is so heavy what is the product like with what the fiber acts as it is it light is it I mean you say it's dirty and strong but is it too is it at stake heavy kind of product\nIt is not it is a sick or looking products or the the goal again was to have a window that looked like a painted wood windows ... but um but it is it's still a ... an extra rooted products so it is hollow core but with the absolute perfect engineering to ensure that it's a strong as it needs to be\nBut it's not so much the size of the window or the door but it is in the hardware the operation are the are the balance is working correct case my windows or the cranks are they good and solid are they are resistant to corrosion so they don't rushed\nSo they don't Russian and cause problems are the doors are the rollers a solid and well may have roller with proper bearing systems so they\nThey roll properly across there so yeah you want you actually want a big heavy door panel with multiple pains of glass and an Oregon insulation in between those ... glass in a beefy frame so it doesn't work for twist or any of those things but you also must have the proper hardware so those stores operate the way that they should\nI Want to blow up in my doors to my patio like Mary Poppins on spring day but it's like you know I got a whole door open right now so yeah I think that's another reason it might be time\nYeah that that is absolutely true so we definitely want to have you know I'm you know the bigger the door obviously the more they're going to weigh but they've got her operate correctly they've got to be light there should be easily opened with just a delight\nYeah what my seven year old or by someone an\nOwner like ourselves yes like [laughter] especially you know later on in these parts that we do get the great weather all year long and and you want to be able to open your house up and what I've learned through my mold remediation situation earlier this year is that we need to open up\nOur doors in our windows more often in our homes because of the moisture retention inside the homes and if you're not using the humidifier all this stuff I had no idea that I I've learned a lot this summer yeah I'm\nSure I'm and you've already said that what the fiber acts that it it's it's because it is a high rate of the wood as well as you know the other technologies is it a reasonable product I mean are you feeling like that's something that can enhance that in my home we'll\nSee what you really want is you want to be able to see a little uptight when you want to during storms during the summer like this and when it's like this I don't want any of this weather coming in I don't want any of this heat moving into any my air conditioning going out so you really want it filled up tight with the best product as well as the best so many things you really don't think about is is the weather stripping is and what type of\nWhat type of or engineering or materials are they using on the weather stripping no cars so you want to feel it tight and then you want to release that when it is when it's the weather is right\nIn our in our winter and our our ... winter it's right around here say favorite time of year and I love to open up the windows and doors\nThinking about just quickly uh obviously Anderson's based in Minnesota so they do know what cold is like oh yeah I Know I mean you know above all maybe the importance is really ceiling that into a reduced the amount of outside air coming\nIn and say opposite of here and they want to keep their heat in and keep it cold out we want to keep our cold and keep the heat out\nExactly and and the engineering of course does work going both ways\nThat's awesome that's especially you know in the summertime round here when you see those air conditioning bills jumped by like a hundred dollars you're like\nOh wait a minute I can put that in the piggy bank into my window financially [laughter]\nActually [laughter] and now they're really good time if you are thinking about it I Want to take advantage of what's happening now with a new old by ... percentage twenty percent off all windows and doors plus twenty percent op insulation for the first seven callers right now during this show so if you're even curious it's worth making the con getting on that list is eight\nEight eight for eight for nine for eight zero again that's eight eighty four eight or nine for eight\nZero now in your mind do you have like an\nUnless it's like a baseball to the window or something like that what is your time frame is a good time to replace your windows and doors and home within five years ten years Twenty years\nYou know I think in general most people are looking at ten to Fifteen earmarked because of the older windows they do really start to to not just work properly and you really do start as some of those two fish but we have replaced um windows that had seal failure just after a couple of years even really new home yes\nWow how'd that made me mad\n[laughter] it wouldn't make it very mad as well and so that's just part of the you know I'm part of the product issue where if if you do open those when there's a lot and you have a substandard product it's not going to support the Sasha and the and the some of the violence and things I Do work and twist in the heat to ... we have plenty of\nAnd so that's where you start to lose your seal around the glass and with fiber its product you just don't\nIt just doesn't hasn't happened though I like that yeah take it all sorts of things to worry about right exactly so okay let's say I am ready upon the trigger you guys can then you measure everything out like what's that process\nOf okay I've made the call now you're coming into my home how do we get this all taken care of\nOkay well actually called the number and a and you'll speak to one of our great call center representatives and they're going to send out a design consulting they're going to help you with

Ghana\nThan what you're getting into their new home so I Am not the expert I Am to someone who has a lot of questions when it comes to a lot of things around my house and we bring in the experts here I have got Patrick sitting with me I'm universal Ruth in contracting thank you so much but yet again by the beer when I moved here and two thousand and four\nI remember flying in from my interview and seeing a blue tarp on every single roof\n[laughter] oh yeah yeah that was about the right time is of Florida saying yeah that's a that's what we call hurricane hurricane aftermath oh my goodness I think the tarp tired and oddly enough we're kind of back or we're almost back to that same place in the last year or so with her uh after Hurricane Irma\nAbsolutely I I tell you still um every day in my neighborhood I hear the seven thirty alarm clock and it gets here roof\nGoing out of their air guns those guys as working hard yeah\nAmazing I'm and I'm not going to pretend to know much about you know\nRuth ... when you need a roof and how do you know when you need a roof and that's what you hear you I mean when I bought my last house they were like you're going to need a new and I'm like okay right so we had a great experience and you know we said we we went to the store pretty well\nBut let's say you don't know how long you've had the roof up there or a previous owner or\nWhat are some of the signs that may be time you need to be thinking about a new\nSure that's a great question um and I think there's a lot of people out there in the same situation they're not sure now\nIt's pretty obvious when you have water coming in your house and you see water spots on the ceiling water might be literally running into your house or the ceiling ... that's an obvious sign that you got you know some issues going on with your roof\nUm but you know a majority of people aren't necessarily in that situation where they've got a hole in their room for a water pouring in although it does happen and we still have a lot of customers in that situation but\nUh you know one of the things they need to be looking for is you know just uh just the shape of the shingles you know if you have a pool deck or you have a ... a um maybe up from front driveway and you notice every time it rains that there's a little granular on your\nWay deck talking around yeah maybe\nIn your pool alone will see the Washington Airport or the number one way to find out is just in carefully do so um grab a ladder jump up and look in your gutters if you have gutters and if you see not just gunk like dirt but you actually see\nLook like tiny little bubbles yeah that is the uh that is the shingles that are eventually you know washing I'll see a lot of people have the idea that um shingles and should should last thirty forty fifty years which in theory they should but in Florida it's own other right so you know it's\nA whole different beast here we have humidity we have rain we have constant sunshine\nSo the shingles are just taking a beating day after day after day and so I mean it's the same thing is like the paint on your car or other things that you put out in the sun it's gonna fade it's going to wear and tear same thing happens with a roof you know the rain that we have the when the we have hurricane and whatnot so\nUm to know or the time exactly those are some of the ... the signs I'm In the main thing I Would say is if you're not sure ... call universal ... roofing contracting and have come out and look and give you an idea a lot of times I'm On the sales manager and so I have a great sales team of guys that come out\nThey assess what's going on they see hey this is happening or this isn't happening and you know the thing about us as we are going to be honest and up front and say hey you might have some life left in this roofer hey you're in a situation where you either have damage or if you don't do something soon you will have damage\nI'm so that that's kind of that's kind of what we're looking for when we go look at a roof obviously of shingles are laying in the yard or\nYou know that kind of stuff like that yeah you need to call us ever walking out after the storm and and seeing singles in the yard and going okay those aren't mine right that was not my right [noise] yeah I had\nOne of my guys was at a at a at a measure call we call it when we come out and look at your house the other day and he actually found shingles on a roof but the roof was perfectly fine he looked at next door and it was the neighbors shingles that were to have alone across and had landed on the other neighbors roof\nThey've been there since Hurricane Irma they've been up there for what is you know we're almost a year now or whatever it is so um yeah so if you got shingles in your yard you know that's why\nI'm obviously you know hurricanes something we do have to think of around here and and I think a lot of people if you weren't around for ... for you learned a lot last year and is there a way like okay we're we're already and hurricane season now the is there a way it kind of on this prepare yourself\n... ... that's a good question um the answer is no [laughter] I mean a roof is area of right and so um you know obviously you know there's hurricane preparation obviously to get ready but you know that's just the unfortunate thing when we get into a situation where it's an act of God right it's it's something that we can't control I mean ah when you have a hundred plus mile an hour when", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Under Oath with Matt Englett", "city": "Pine Hills",
