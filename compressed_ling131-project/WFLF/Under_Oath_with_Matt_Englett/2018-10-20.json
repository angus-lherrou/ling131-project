deflect the blame from the prince because American intelligence agencies are very condensed\nThe crown prince was the one who was behind democracy OJ's disappearance\nStuff doesn't just happen there are no rogue agents for the most part in Saudi Arabia these things come from the top down direct orders and things like that so that's what makes this much more interesting how they're trying to place

[noise] [noise]\nThis is the daily dive weekend edition\nI'm Oscar ... and we're running down some of the top stories of the week and don't forget to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter] I think one of the stories that's captured everybody's attention this week is that of the lottery the mega millions jackpot is the largest that it's ever been\nPowerball is going to have a big drawing over the weekend also\nI think between the both of them they're going to be given away at one point three to one point four billion dollars in lottery Miranda if you won the lottery who would be the first person you'd call\nAnd I think I called my friend Meghan McCain because her family has been insanely mouthy forever so she's the only person who would not try to get money out of yeah and she would know that people to call the primate that new leftover generation\nThat's funny that I mean I thought you were to say something like hey I'm as rich as you guys but\nI I mean I might say that the experts say that the first person you should be calling is actually a lawyer\nBecause there's a lot of stuff that you have to deal with when you win the lottery a lot of times in states your name has to be publicly announced you can't get away I think there's only six states where you can't be named where you can remain anonymous oh it's crazy but just you know\nGood luck to everybody out there playing\nFor the mega millions your chances of winning or one in three hundred and two point six million a breeze for winning the Powerball it's one in two hundred and Ninety two million so and then the chances of winning both let's say you played everything\nOne in eighty eight quandary really and that ... followed by Fifteen zeroes so and I miss the odds are crazy we spoke to Rodrigo ... he's a reporter for the record in New Jersey and we talked to him about why you should be calling a lawyer first and how they can help you out\nKeep your mouth shut and call a lawyer towards winning big I spoke to a a JC Carlin he's an attorney based in New York He's actually a self proclaimed lottery lawyer he's represented more than thirty lottery winners ... eleventh\nI saw him at his name mentioned in a bunch of articles yeah he is the guy\nI guess you'd say the expert on this type of stuff and he said that's pretty much\nThe first thing he told me before you speak to anybody call a lawyer particularly one that has experience in representing lottery winners and basically protected them from a lot of the pitfalls of winning so much money and such a short time\nRight 'cause people don't know what to do with all that money at first and the jackpot for the mega millions is nine hundred and Seventy million dollars if you take the cash option\nIt's five hundred and forty eight million dollars is still a ton of money one of the main pitfalls is a lot of states require you to be publicly announced it was like a matter of public record so you can't get away with being anonymous\nIn New Jersey I actually did another article trying to answer that question because a few months back the jackpot for the mega millions was also\nPretty large so people the the question that I get most frequently is can I claimed my jak anonymously if I win\nSo I figured it out and unfortunately the answer is no you you really can't in New Jersey it's a matter of public record in other words if the average citizen is allowed to and encouraged us to file what's called the public record a quest and through that you can obtain the name of any lottery winner\nBe a director actually of the state lottery said you know this is a very public game\nSo we want people's names out there you know this is\nWe want people to know who's getting the money that they've spent on this state wide damn this lottery and you know a lot of people have also offered up well can I start a lousy or an entity to claim the pride reading James carry his his name director of the lottery he said yeah that's fine you can do that of course\nAnd they'll pay the jackpot to whatever entity you set up for that but your name will still be public record\nWow I I guess it may may be the only thing in that is that you could ... your name coming out because the the trust of the house he might get first building\nAnd there's there's only six states where you can remain anonymous Delaware Kansas Marilyn North Dakota Ohio and South Carolina [laughter] you know pretty much anywhere\nYou're names and to get out there I I Know people have said you should get off the Internet immediately before you announce close your social media down if you have a landline making unlisted before skip town if you can write a letter got an ounce it so that you're not there and you know you work in the media as you've seen when\nAnything major happens in the news\nThe media starts hunting down any pictures that they can of you or you know all the details because everybody wants to know so you know some experts have said close all that stuff down just to help avoid it\nThat's one of the first tips that I've gotten from multiple expert says yet tried to get off social media because like you said that's the first place that not just reporters look but people that might want to start contacting you for money for charity and that's another issue is that you know a lot of charities that\nWill tend to reach out to jackpot winners\nThey all digital ... but then there are a lot they're bogus that's what they think Carlin the lottery lawyer was telling me is you know you kind of have to keep it to yourself in more weight in more ways than just one not just a matter of not talking to people and telling them about it but yes scrub your social media if you can you have your phone number out there and try to get it down just so that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Under Oath with Matt Englett", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "20"}
