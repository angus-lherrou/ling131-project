I mean I I ... I don't tell people to buy a home when they're in debt okay so if you call me how to tell me where is all due out to buy but this house has not like you know if you call me up you're making thirty hundred dollars your house payments Fifteen hundred dollars and I we got a problem\nI'm going to put that house on the market but your house payment is way less than a force of your take on pay\nAnd so you're fine I mean it's really not your problem I think you guys are just starting to budget and uh the emotional weight of a a of dealing with the medical situation you're facing and when you're with your baby I mean when you're babies' heart and it just that's just it just wears you down you know\nIt just makes you human her makes you a good daddy and a good mommy but according to the truth is it makes it kinda hard to see past ah I'm just looking at the ... numbers right now I don't ... I mean I I feel for you guys know pray for you but I don't have the emotional weight\nThat you guys have got facing the stuff you face every day dealing with this situation you know so\nThat's just very real a ... but but the math actually you know thirty eight hundred bucks minus nine hundred dollars minus a eight hundred dollars for a house payment or you know minus ... minus ... minus water doesn't leave a lot of room but you could pay your payments on everything doing that\nAnd then you can pick up your overtime and start making some headway on some of these deaths and cleaning them often as they these little that's clean all these credit cards outstanding medical bills in student loans clean off\nYou know over the next year and a half two years you're going to start having a little bit of wiggle room and you guys will keep moving forward and head but I think that that you're just you know you're just feeling the weight of all of this and it's kind of clouding it's this is doable though where are you are is doable I think you can pull it off no I Would not sell your house\nOr would not have bought it because I don't ... to buy a house where we got debt but\nIt's your house is not like when I hear those numbers on my like well what are you crazy none of that so there none of it you're you're it's very very reasonable\nOr for your situation now would it help if you earn an extra thousand bucks a month you dead gum writer clean this mess up faster two thousand bucks a month even faster so are you have you got a couple of years are really ...\nFor work and lots of overtime and saw jobs ahead of you yup you sure do\nAre you guys gonna be taking a bunch of friends who vacations new you've got a bunch of that\nYou're going up at your reality but hold on I'll have gilly pick up we're going to get your copy of the total money make over book and give it to ya and help get you started and if you need some more help you call me I'll help you in any way I can\nI'm Sorry you guys are facing all these challenges but I think you're up for it I think you can do it the math makes sense to me that you're giving me unless there's something we left out of this equation so thank you for the call Josh is with us in Los Angeles Hi Josh how are you\nGood how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] not too much I've got a question for you I'm On baby steps which it pay off my house early [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't have any other debt because my house I have a six month emergency fun um but I kinda did all your stuff out of order because I've never really liked that but anyway um [noise] I have a hundred and sixty four thousand dollars less pay off my house\nBut I also have about a hundred thousand dollars invested in mutual funds and stuff like that and I'm curious\nWould it be wiser to um take a hundred thousand dollars out of my personal investment cook at all for the house and then just pay off the remaining sixty four thousand or should I leave that money invested and the money that I have every month to accelerate payment from my how\n... what's your household income\nUh probably about a hundred and fifty thousand\nSo you could be like debt free and when you were if you did the\nUh um yeah I'd be done by the end of next year I'm sure if I if I took the hundred thousand for the court house\nIf your house was paid for and you didn't have any money and investments would you borrow a hundred thousand on your home to\nPutting investments [noise] you know same thing in a\nUm I don't follow okay well\nI mean if you have a hundred thousand dollars in an investment and you take it out of the investment in order to put in and pay off your home that's the same thing in reverse if you didn't do that it's the same thing is if you if you leave it in the investment it's the same thing is borrowing own your home to invest isn't it\nGot it\nOkay so it's a balance sheet equation meaning that balance sheet is where you list your assets on one side of the page or liability on the other side of the page\nAnd right and you can switch them back and forth by borrowing money\nMeaning if you were sitting there with no investments paid for house you could you could borrow money and put you know money you drop dead over there on that one side of the page but on the other side of the ... now you'd have an investment right and all I'm doing is on doing that by asking the question in reverse though it's a bit of a trick I kind of ...\nAh the trick is that it makes you think not just with your head but also with your heart\nAnd I always like to think of when my my head is where I Do math in my heart for a measure risk\nAnd your real risk averse you hate that like I Do and so the idea of borrowing on a paid for house degrading investment is absurd and your mind\nYeah I mean you immediately reacted\nBut that's a heart things we that's where that's at risk bark this ... that you're measuring this cause you to do that you didn't stop and do math you went you recoiled then went crazy in your mind right you know\nThat that but and and start by asking it in reverse so all of that to say yes I Do the hundred grand at it in a heartbeat I assume this was not in a retirement\nAccount well no penalties right [noise] uh no that that hundred thousand is just ... right yeah and the only thing is I mean you're talking about the head and the heart just with the mathematics of it I'm ... years of it if you leave ... by if you put risk in the mathematics of it\nAnd it changes the mathematics\nAnd so and so your heart is actually correct your heart is helping you do a complete measured amount\nAnd so yeah so I take the money out of their house I'll be ... she's actually what I'm the\nGuy just Blake

F. L. A. and I heard radio station\nBattle wears on nine leads sound like ... Democrats and Republicans continue to argue over the confirmation vote for judge Brett Kavanaugh boxes John helping live on Capitol Hill\nYou know for windows that you'll have to look out of that when it comes to replacement time you're like oh boy\nRight exactly and so yeah you have um you know so yeah absolutely specialty when those costs more than than regular windows and Anderson is the the ... by Anderson is\nA really the premium a window on the market but also you know it has been developed and designed for the purpose of replacement and so in Florida you know we have a lot of existing homes that have aluminum single pain and glass windows so they're\nThey're horribly inefficient um you know your your energy in this area his yang all of that\nIs absolutely you know and of course this summer's been super hot super rainy and uh and so you know where we are are faced with the challenge is how do we make sure we install these highly energy efficient windows making sure that all the water proofing has done correctly and uh and that the customer home is beautiful side as well as\nReally improve their energy efficiency now I just had a situation at my house where we had a window was the original window to the house it leaked it created a mold situation\nAnd everything had to come out and describe the whole thing and you start to really think about what's happening in my other windows at what point should you really start considering replacing your window that's\nWell I think you know for that it does vary for for people you know I mean I think um you know if you look at your how home it was an older home bill\nYou know pray two thousand five\nYou're going to have aluminum single pain windows mhm so you're going to have an efficient windows so that's something if if energy efficiency is is really important to you and reducing um\nYou know our carbon footprint or however you inherited a you know that that is a great reason to to get your windows replace you know because again in Florida I don't know why I'm builders always just thought hey this is where do we don't need efficient windows and doesn't make sense because that's all\nI mean that's single pain windows um and it's you know and it's just doesn't make any sense\nUm and then another time would just be the function do you do your windows operate do they do they operate well um do they uh you can you slide them up on on on the nice days and when winter in in in the spring can you open your windows and and have a nice a air flow through your home\nAnd you know a lot of times of the way some of our windows when Alan ... and walk systems and even the screen systems don't work\nI I had in my house I had a single pain aluminum windows and I\nCouldn't open I'm not because they didn't work with because the screen system was so seems silly that hey I Can't have my windows because of the screen will actually keep\nAnything out see I don't know if in some of my windows and house now because I'm afraid the winters are going to come down like that the springs systems and um they they aren't super trustworthy as I'm sure as they once were and with a little one in the house my fear is that she's going to go to open a window or go play by the window and it's going to come down and so that's a red flag for me right there\nAbsolutely that is that is a concern and then um you know and so you do have to be careful with those things I also have a young kids and you know they get into everything absolutely very inquisitive they want they want to figure it out and then um\nYou know and and then another reason it it's a very valid reason is they just do look nice you know the the grills or falling if they do have to pay and there's a ... a seal failure in between so in between your glass logging enough\nAnd a nod yeah\nDoesn't look nice and you know so I became\nMy front window is right now you are and I understand\nIn a uh we'd love to put some new ones in there for you but I you know so in our homes obviously our our biggest investment and we want to uh and I wanted to look\nBeautiful yeah and functional and how to help out with bills and whatnot and if you are intrigued a by what Jim and I are talking about here with my aunts and they do have a limited offer going on right now at least for the first seven colors\nThat if you want to get the information go ahead and call now because ... percent off all windows and doors plus twenty percent off installation and just doing the quick math in my head that's a lot of money that you can save right now so you want to call\nA date for eight or nine for eight zero that's eight for eight for nine for eight\nYear if you want to take advantage of this which is happening right now for the first set in college or the ... by ... percent off all windows and doors plus twenty percent off your installation\nAt eight eight eight for eight or nine for\nEight zero so like I've been talking which in and out here I've been really considering changing out my windows and doors for a long time now\nWith the storms last year I really thought that was going to be the final push but now that I'm thinking about it with the I got the leaking into one window I've got sliding glass doors that my daughter can barely open and I get down there and Greece him up as often as I can but they're just big and heavy and that's also something else as a mom you know\nThe stores and they're so heavy what is the product like with what the fiber acts as it is it light is it I mean you say it's dirty and strong but is it too is at stake heavy kind of product\nIt is not it is a sick or looking products or the the goal again was to have a window that looked like a painted wood windows ... but um but it is it's still a ... an extra rooted products so it is hollow core but with the absolute perfect engineering to ensure that it's a strong as it needs to be\nBut it's not so much the size of the window or the door but it is in the hardware the operation are the are the balance is working correct patient windows or the cranks are they good and solid or they are resistant to corrosion so they don't rushed\nSo they don't Russian and cause problems are the doors are the rollers a solid and well may have roller with proper bearing systems so they\nThey roll properly across there so yeah you want you actually want a big heavy door panel with multiple pains of glass and and Oregon insulation between those ... glass in a beefy frame so it doesn't work for twist or any of those things but you also must have the proper hardware so those stores operate the way that they should\nI Want to blow up and my doors to my patio like Mary Poppins on spring day but it's like you know I got a whole door open right now so yeah I think that's another reason it might be time\nYeah that that is absolutely true so we definitely want to have you know I'm you know the bigger the door obviously the more they're going to weigh but they've got her operate correctly they've got to be like they should be easily opened with just a delight\nYeah what my seven year old or by someone that owner like ourselves yes like [laughter] ... especially you know later on in these\nParts that we do get the great weather all year long and and you want to be able to open your house up and what I've learned through my mold remediation situation earlier this year is that we need to open up\nOur doors in our windows more often in our homes because of the moisture retention inside the homes and if you're not using it to a humidifier all this stuff I had no idea that I I've learned a lot this summer after\n'em and you've already said that what the fiber acts that it it it's because it is a high rate of the wood as well as you know the other technologies is it reasonable products I mean are you feeling like that's something that can enhance that and my home well\nSee what you really want as you want to be able to see a little uptight when you want to during storms during the summer like this and when it's like this I don't want any of this weather coming in I don't want any of this heat moving into it and he my air conditioning going out so you really want it sealed up tight with the best product as well as the best things you really don't think about is is the weather stripping is and what type of\nWhat type of or engineering or materials are they using on the weather stripping no cars so you want to seal it tight and then you want to release that when it is when it's the weather is right\nIn our in our winter and our our ... winter it's right around here say favorite time of year and I love to open up the windows and doors\nWas about just quickly uh obviously Anderson's based in Minnesota so they do know what cold is like oh yeah I Know I mean you know above all maybe the importance is really ceiling that into a reduced the amount of outside air coming in and say opposite\nOf here and they want to keep their heat in and keep it cold out we want to keep our cold and keep the heat out\nExactly and and the engineering of course does work going both ways\nThat's awesome that's especially you know in the summertime around here when you see this air conditioning bills jumped by like a hundred dollars you're like\nOh wait a minute I can put that in the piggy bank into my window financially [laughter]\nActually and now they're going to get time if you are thinking about it I Want to take advantage of what's happening now if I knew all by ... percent off all windows and doors plus twenty percent off insulation for the first seven callers right now during this show so if you're even curious it's worth making the call and getting on that list it's eight\nEight eight for eight for nine for eight zero again that's eight eighty four\nEight or nine for eight\nZero now in your mind do you have like an unless there's like a baseball to the window or something like that what is your time frame as a good time to replace your windows and doors and home within five years ten years Twenty years\nKnow I think in general most people are looking at ten to Fifteen earmarked because older windows they do really start to the not just work properly and you really do start to see some of those fish but we have replaced um windows that had seal failure just after a couple of years even really new home yes wow how'd that made me mad\n[laughter] it wouldn't have gotten very mad as well and so that's just part of the you know I'm part of the product issue where if if you do it when there's when there's a lot and you have a substandard product it's not going to support the fashion the in the\nSome of the violence and things I Do work and twisted in the heat to ... we have plenty of\nAnd so that's where you start to lose your seal around the glass and with fiber its product you just don't it just doesn't hasn't happened\nYou know I like that yeah take it off of things to worry about right exactly so okay let's say I am ready upon the trigger you guys can then you measure everything out like what's that process of okay I've made the call now you're coming into my home how do we get this all taken care of\nWell actually you call the number and a and you'll speak to one of our great call center representatives and they're going to send out a design consulting they're going

here's your host Ghana [noise]\nGetting into their new home so I Am not the expert I Am to someone who has a lot of questions when it comes to a lot of things around my house that we bring in the experts here I have got Patrick sitting with me I'm universal Ruth and contracting thank you so much but yet again by the beer when I moved here and two thousand and four\nI remember flying in from my interview and seeing a blue tarp on every single\nRoof [laughter] oh yeah yeah that was about the right time is of Florida say yeah that's a that's what we call hurricane hurricane aftermath oh my goodness I think it's hard it's hard yeah in oddly enough we're kind of back or we're almost back to that same place or the last year so with her uh after Hurricane Irma\nI I tell you still um every day in my neighborhood I hear the seven thirty alarm clock [laughter]\nAnd it gets here roof going out of the air guns those guys as working hard yeah amazing I'm and I'm not going to pretend to know much about you know\n... when you need a roof and how do you know when you need a roof and that's what you hear yeah track I mean when I bought my last house they were like you're going to need a new and I'm like okay right so we had a great experience and you know we said we we went to the store pretty well\nBut let's say you don't know how long you had the roof up there or previous owner or what are some of the signs that may be time you need to be thinking about a new\nSure that's a great question um and I think there's a lot of people out there in the same situation they're not sure now\nIt's pretty obvious when you have water coming in your house and you see water spots on the ceiling water might be literally running into your house feeling ... that's an obvious sign that you got you know some issues going on with your roof\nUm but you know a majority of people aren't necessarily in that situation where they've got a hole in their roof for a water pouring in although it does happen and we still have a lot of customers in that situation but\nUh you know one of the things they need to be looking for is you know just uh just the shape of the shingles you know if you have um a pool deck or you have a girl or a maybe a front front driveway and you notice every time it rains that there's a little granular on your\nFlight deck talking around yeah maybe in your pool alive we'll see them\nWashed into their pull or the number one way to find out is just in carefully do so um grab a ladder jumped up and look in your gutters if you have gutters and if you see not just gunk like dirt but you actually see what looked like a tiny little bubbles yeah that is the ah that is the shingles that are eventually you know washing I'll see\nA lot of people have the idea that um shingles and should should last thirty forty fifty years which in theory they should but in Florida it's own other eminent right so you know it's it's a whole different beast here we have humidity we have rain we have constant sunshine\nSo the shingles are just taking a beating day after day after day and so I mean it's the same thing is like the paint on your car or other things that you put out in the sun is going to fade it's going to wear and tear same thing happens with the roof you know the rain that we have the when the we have hurricane and whatnot so\nUm to know or the time exactly those are some of the ... the signs I'm In the main thing I Would say is if you're not sure ... called universal ... roofing contracting and has come out and look and give you an idea a lot of times I'm On the sales manager and so I have a great sales team of guys that come out\nThey assess what's going on and they see hey this is happening or this isn't happening and you know the thing about us as we are going to be honest and up front and say hey you might have some life left in this roof for hey you're in a situation where you either have damage or if you don't do something soon you will have damage\nI'm so that that's kind of that's kind of what we're looking for when we go look at a roof obviously of shingles are\nLaying in the yard or you know yeah that kind of stuff yeah you need to call us ever walking\nOut after the storm and and seeing singles in the yard and going okay does aren't mine\nRight that was a not mine I yeah I had\nOne of my guys was at a at a at a measure call we call when we come out look at your house the other day and he actually found shingles on a roof the roof was perfectly fine he looked next door and it was the neighbors shingles that were to have alone across and had landed on the other neighbors roof\nThey've been there since Hurricane Irma they'd been up there for what is you know we're almost a year now or whatever it is so um yeah so have you got shingles in your yard you know\nI think the white um obviously you know hurricanes something we do have to think of around here and and I think a lot of people if you weren't around for ... for you learned a lot last year and is there a way like okay we're we're already in hurricane season out but is there a way it kind of on this prepare yourself\nNow it's ... that that's a good question um the answer is no [laughter] I mean a roof is their roof right and so um you know obviously you know there's hurricane preparation obviously to get ready but you know that's just the unfortunate thing when we get into a situation where it's an act of God right it's it's something that we can't control I mean ah when you have a hundred plus mile an hour when", "year": "2018",
