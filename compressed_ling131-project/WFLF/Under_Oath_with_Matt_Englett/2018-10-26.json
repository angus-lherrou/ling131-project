control of your retirement the proper information mhm\nThere's so much misinformation out there that causes people to miss windows bumper trinity Chris we tell them every Saturday here's your window of opportunity\nListening get some nugget skin empowered and take control he retired but hey before he went to a break though we said when we come back we're going to tell you some interesting stories right here about Ronald Reagan\nWe're also going to hit on a little bit of a a major strategy\nThat's kind of hidden from the everyday average American mhm has been since Nineteen eighty\nChris oh I Want you to talk a little bit about Reagan and one of the strategies he utilized ... before we do that guys on this show we tell you things that we've gotten us featured on Forbes the same strategies we use we're going to tell you on the show\nRight and top five retirement advisor in this country that is what we talk about every Saturday is the same stuff that got us featured\nThat's why this shows the most powerful show on weekend radio what a better time to talk about a great president Ronald Reagan okay doesn't matter where you sit on what's which party line Ronald Reagan was a it was a great man okay and Ronald Reagan\nBelieve it or not most people don't know this younger generation doesn't I don't think was an actor before he was president\nOkay wow he's an actor so it was a pretty good actor is pretty good you have some swag then he [laughter]\nSo now Ronald Reagan if you look back over his time frame he only made to movies a year\nTo movies two movies that's it not because he wasn't good at acting we've already said that\nIt ... it had it was something different something more important okay here's the reason why so first of all when he made to when he made a movie he got paid about a hundred thousand dollars which at a time of the highest paid actor Yeah Yup so hundred thousand dollars per movie\nOkay and so he made two uh two hundred thousand dollars now you got to know something first of all you got to know that at this time period\nWhen he was acting that the taxes top tax bracket was Ninety four percent\nNinety four people think when I asked people where do you think taxes are now do you think are lower high most of the time they say low much great majority ... say love I said look if we look over history actually we are at historical lows for taxes even though we are mounting\nPiles of debt that is cause for concern\nBut Chris I Know that fact but man it doesn't feel like it every year when I got to cut that right [laughter]\nYes I hear you about that you know so here so here's what Ronald Reagan and he's at a Ninety four percent tax bracket right so what he did and it was once you made over two hundred thousand dollars you're taxed at Ninety four percent so he just didn't make a third movie\nIt it'd be worth less he'd get six six thousand bucks\nSo taxes causes to miss out on some potentially great movies guys\nSo so the taxes and Ninety and Ninety four percent the question is can they go back there well I think ah we've already heard that answer having a way yeah I mean look debt if there's anything to make us go back to a higher tax bracket in the future it which we think they absolutely will get its debt\nYou know something's funny Chris is a\nNot really too funny actually is back then we didn't have Nineteen trillion in debt right and what did you say that top tax bracket was\nIt was Ninety four and in fact in the seventies it was still in the in the sixties and eighties beginning of the eighties is is in the fifties so you can see if you've got mounting piles of debt the government is not a business right\nIs the only way it gets income as how from us from taxes it's got a service this day where do you think they're gonna get it they're going to get it from us\nSo that's one thing that blows my mind is taxes were higher when we last I mean something's got to give their\nRight so so taxes are going to go out we got a lot of debt water people to do in retirement tax they're going to go up in the future\nOkay let's say you're in a twenty five percent tax bracket right now ... hurts but what if that goes up to forty five now you're taking home forty five percent less money now you're taking a forty five percent loss every year in retirement\nThat is crippling sill instead is there a way can we turn the tables and get a forty five percent growth every year by simply not paying taxes well yeah if you don't pay the taxes\nAnd you're getting forty five percent more money in this case in your pocket ... and you're essentially getting so forty five percent more growth but can you can you not pay taxes\nAnd not go to jail\nIf it's tax free income that's not qualified and you don't have to pay on that then yeah okay if it's set up correctly yeah does it set up correctly I got to do is read the whole tax code everybody you'll find it in there right so he wants to do that though\nLet me open up Pandora's box for a second now the ultra wealthy they don't pay any taxes in retirement using the rats strategy you know it was a very well known strategy in the ultra wealthy communities\nYou know of course that bought ran through my mind as soon as you said that high tax bracket 'cause you know who never ends up paying the actual high tax brackets the ultra wealthy the ultra wealthy you know who
