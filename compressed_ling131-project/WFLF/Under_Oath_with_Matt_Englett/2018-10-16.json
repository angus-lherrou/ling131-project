... what are you talking about you know that\nIf they're not that so that's something else we we we have a car at all I Know I'm going out for a place so that the current thinking about sounds kind of a toy car that's what few years and you know as much as I like it I'm thinking oh\nWhat's ... what's the what's the car that you need to replace [noise]\nSo the the car need I Will need or a place of the the ... it's a good reliable but I Know that no actually the miles of getting up there\nOne of the you know there are normal normal but why can't you just save up between now and the time you replace the car how much longer you going to drive the Hyundai forty replace it\nAll depends on how long it lasted about a hundred and Eighteen thousand miles battle\nHow long are you drive the Hyundai before you replace it\nProbably three to five years to save up a car price between now and then I think I could yes\nOkay then you don't have to sell the toy car for that the only question is do you want to keep the toy car or do you want to keep the brokerage account because one of them needs to go so you can have an emergency fund\nYeah yeah which one do you want to um [noise] I dunno I guess the\nThe second put on a brokerage account most with long term so I think if I sell it it's just a matter of you know it'd be additional income to my salad here that\n\nEven now that we don't have any basis in that stock\nAgain no I don't know why\nYou didn't pay anything no\nNo I'm Sorry yes I have a basis in there so there's there's that ... as far as taxes go it only be the capital gains\nTerm exactly which one would you rather have a car with a brokerage account because one of them needs to sell when you decide that you'll know which one to sell and you'll know how to send your emergency fund and keep the other one but now says with us in San Diego Hi Vanessa how are you\nGave him gain great how are you know\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um I just wanted to do that a bit of help on where to start um I'm looking to start as I did and it's like a full time business I down the line and I came to try to um I had been\nMean and you're right at the ... and I'm already I'm already got a copy of the book\nYeah I had that that child where ... in the car yeah and I and I'm looking to move forward on my idea I have a business plan that had it out that few years back\nNow I'm trying to look forward to it on\nMy plan and a sports camp um my question is how do I start where do I go up my problem in me permit or local park um I have ideas that asking why in a theater ... it's basically um practice in\nA baseball or Pakistan batch about somebody need location it's not just a plain park out Neal mhm\nWell I guess you could talk to the Y. and asked them if you could split revenues with them or something like that in order to use their stuff\nA lot of wise to do that with personal trainers and in a sense this is a type of personal training I mean I guess if you're holding up I I Would suspect some of the yoga teachers or the aerobics teachers or whatever at the Y. probably just do a split revenue deal they'll say\nOkay I I Would I don't I just want to be contract or I didn't want to be owned by the why now I\nWas going to do that you're just you're just a teacher right now and what you're going to get in there and you you work out all the kinks out of your system and you learn how to do it any developer reputation with people\nBut I and they may not let you necessarily have a business name on this they may just pay you as a teacher there to live for right now but that'll get some income coming in and get you in the field actually doing this and then the next step would be that you could actually rent\nPart time someone else's gym to do this with or part time someone else's ball fields to do this way up and you know you can you can start there if you want if you got the money if you got a little bit of cash\nNow I Don ... you know basically a plan that I had gotten in that dream right age for the longest time and now that I've had the book and I can hear podcasts I'm empowered I'm Jess ... nowhere to go hat in art\nThink I might make some money kind of almost as a side job doing this exact thing at the Y. or at some place like a why first and as I said then you get the kinks out of your teaching methods and all that kind of stuff in the next step is you take that cash\nAnd that gives you the ability to rent the gym or rent the ball field on a per day baseless\nBut right now let's say you go rent a ball field and and you can't get anybody to sign up for your course\nOh my gosh you just lost all that money oh wait a minute you don't have any money oh my gosh you just got into that no we don't do that see that's that's what I'm trying to avoid so let's create a little bit of money while learning a few things about how to talk to people how to teach people how to coach people and\nProve out some of your dreams and your theories that you've got here by just poking around them under somebody else a roof a little bit and then then when we got a little bit of cash we can go rent the ball field or rent the gym by the day for a little while and then um you\nKnow that way will break you if you don't get clients a write off the bat ah when I started financial piece University Our a office building allowed us the people that were tenants in the office building they had a common conference room that you could book\nDoesn't cost anything but you had the book and you couldn't just keep it look good to just look at you know for a meeting you can you know other people go in there you see it as a meeting and it's like a hundred and thirty people is a nice size little conference room and a little meeting room kind of thing tables that move around and all of that that's where a financial peace university started\nIs in that little conference room\nAnd I'm pretty cool if you think about it and so but I had to just look at as a ...\nOf renting the little office that I was in and so but it wasn't really my meeting room it was the office buildings meeting room\nAnd you could just use it and so I booked it in the evening and then I looked at in another evening and I looked at another evening and then I was looking at so much they asked me to start paying a little bit none of us are paying a little bit but I had a lot of classes going by that but I just the first night I did that are for people came\nThank goodness I didn't rent that thing for the month and therefore people come goes we would have probably gone out of business last month [laughter] so that's what I'm saying it's OK to start it on a very piecemeal basis and started on the cheap\nThere's nothing wrong with that at all I'm really proud of you can do this when I said go do it go do it it's time to do it it's time to get off the dream and move into the actual action go do it you can do this a promise you you can do this very well done good good good\nLara follows me on Facebook dot com slash Dave Ramsey is it worth it to refinance a student loan to save all interests if you're saving on interest\nYou can get a better interest rate it's okay to do that make sure\nThat alone is a fixed rate\nAnd make sure that it is a lower fixed rate\nSometimes people refinance student loans and there's throw 'em all in one pile and end up paying a net right that is higher because they'll mixture of four or five or six or seven in there and get it all at six but the foreign the five wouldn't cheaper and they don't end up

Fox News hurricane Michael now blamed for at least twenty states dance across to south most in Bay County Florida where the storm roared ashore as a category for as the search continues for any survivors that may be buried in\nA lot of folks in the industry think when they get ready to do windows is really only one way to do it and that's what they have existing in their home so many options out there so many ways to save money frankly a lot of ways even spend more money to pay how did you do for you want to make your house I'm really good at that\nMost people want to most people in the end of the day won't accomplish do things they want a product and it's going to last forever and they want a house\nThat looks like a brand new house at the same or address\nOkay All right yeah I I don't know what I mean I think I Would like improving the aesthetic of my house\nWell one of the things that I've found in many folks that I talked to a in the window industry when I approached folks I asked him hey what is it that you're trying to achieve and when they talk about the aesthetics of the home and how it looks\nThey go Dan I had some quotes I've talked to some folks that look I've seen these windows in the house I've seen these big white clunky thick\nBones looking last week when I was I don't want that look and it really show our mission and on one of our goals are ever knew why Anderson is we want the window and we designed the window to look like it actually came with a home\nMhm so it doesn't seem like it's out of place exactly if you're curious and if you're thinking about and this is something you might learn a little bit more about if you're in the same kind of mindset that I can get some information but also take advantage of the opposite going on right now to a if you are listening to the show renewal by enter than you can\nFor the first seven colors get ... percent off windows doors and installation that's twenty percent off of everything so shut down the number\nEight eight eight for eight for nine for eight zero at us eight eight eight for eight for nine for eight zero eight eight eight or eight or nine for eight zero to get\nThe information and hopefully get in on that special offer as well um now I Am looking at replacing it all at once that the doors and windows I'm Ken renewal banners and also do sliding glass doors I mean is there any ... like is there anything that in your typical home is there anything that you came to\nMe the short answer is no way to answer right\nUm we want to we don't want you you want to be really careful when you are changing opening sizes are sometimes you can begin to get into structural members of the home so we can and larger make openings smaller if it's the right situation okay\nBut the answer your question we can do just we can yes we can do just about anything you want with a custom or be a window\nOkay well for nearly an or some kind of want me to the process let's say I give you a call my dad I think I'm ready not exactly sure like what's the best way to get a quote to get your design team out luckily through the process All right\nSo the first step is you win a pick up the phone and you would call our national call center or our local call center was in\nA working hours and you would set up a free and home design consultant estimate right so that individual would then come out to your home they would take a look at and you're\nMeans your dreams or whatever you were trying to create a most importantly provide us illusion show we would go we would measure the windows we would go or some design options with you mhm uh and then we would uh we have a a design\nA software that we carry with us in the home so you can actually see what the window looks like that you're having designed oh fantastic and so once we had a mystery yeah [laughter] makes a little bit of time in the home so ah be prepared been this way you can get exactly what you want you know which is what you want to see what it looks like\nAnd once we knew that uh we simply price it up for you right there in the home so okay so now waiting no waning\nThat's nice I mean you can kind of get an idea of\nWhat you could be getting into you often get excited about the process of you know possibly getting these new windows and new doors now let's say I you know I I Love the station I Love the smell of the way everything looks and I say okay and let's go do they understand let's make this happen in my home what is the next that well\nThe next step is ... how are we going to pay for it right you can't call mom anymore right [laughter] well my daughter would kill me but she uh she still calls that so uh yeah so\nThe next set with me we have many different ways a cell phone on the job or to provide them on the job\nSo you can do financing through us or you can pay cash or credit card any of that is all done on the spot instant financing we have great promotions are going on uh at this time ... and I'm\nSo is there is quite easy or you don't have to have any money down in um [noise] and the process can keep going in the process can game going\nWell tell me about the uh the teams tell me about your crew what what can we expect when it's time for renewal by Anderson to come into my home and actually put in these new windows\nAnd doors and sliding glass doors and everything else yes so the process a is\nReally ... the we have a concierge service so what that means is once you place the order you'll\nBe contacted ... job is to hold your hand through every step of the process so once you place that order with us\nYou will then be contacted and they'll let you know the very next that\nAnd that next step would be a tech mission or a tech measure would come out in measuring the Honda designed consulting because that measure three time that's right [laughter] measure three times cut launch right\nSo we do that and I'm a once we are getting the confirmed measure much the windows or order they come in your installers show up so we don't use quote just installers are folks are a Anderson certified master installers\nAnd what that means is we have a stove or national pie and guidelines and then these windows have to be installed by okay I often tell people that windows there's two home improvement projects they're really scare me\nWhen I Am a roofing those too that if they're done incorrectly oh yeah they will rot your house to the ground\nOkay do we need to make sure that it's being done properly um obviously we have great building inspectors and codes in Florida that help us with that uh but believe it or not votes can still kind a lotta corners and so we make sure we do it right\nSo what would happen say if you know real real they understand it is in the home that insulation process has begun and you're taking out the window than you do find some things structurally wrong well\nWe hope that that doesn't happen we trying to spot it but you're you're exactly right it can happen in ... in this great state of Florida there's a lot of there's a lot of humidity and there's a lot of ways for water and getting these walls that we can't see\nI'm hoping that's where this concierge service comes and [laughter] and again and we'll have the answers for me\nTo show what would happen in that case um uh when we designed a window we price out just the window in the cosmetic area within a couple of inches of the window but if we find out when we remove this window we've gotten mon infestation and all types of things going on in rotten all the things you\nJust pray that wouldn't be there yes um what we have to do then is we have to bring in a we have to uh refer you to a an al ... Khan tractor that would the specialized in structural damage\nAnd you can get that are taking care of some of it or to some degree we can handle a just depends on how severe it is\nAnd you've got people that you trust and you're ready and that you can pick up that phone and ...\nWe wouldn't we wouldn't want anybody anybody is home we didn't trust\nThat's comforting yes um let's say go smoothly no bombs at all which we all hope of course with renewable Anderson about how long are you looking for this to be happening in your home and let's see if you're doing\nTen windows the time when a swap out I mean is that you know a week's worth of open holes in your house or is it something hopefully a lot smoother than what\nGen if it was our first job involving takes us about a much but a census since we do a you know two billion dollars a year we pretty fast and this but we are good too yeah go ... normally it would take a you can usually say about a day for every four windows and that's being conservative but we'd rather\nYou know we'd rather a over promise a I mean a under promise rather than over promise\nYeah I I've been through a window I'm I've been through a window reinstalled at a at a at a former house and\nI was in that situation I it it\nIt was like house was open there for a while and it's it's really company here that with a new ... and that's not really the case you guys got down to a science then you can get those windows in and out the doors in and out and feeling like safe in your home with your new energy efficient windows and all that good stuff it's a great point and\nYou did remind with small children just cat\nAbsolutely uh I've heard horror stories are all over the world you know about these types of situations and\nWe're definitely not going to come in in in pullout fix windows in and leave holes in your house for the very reason that you several reasons number one if it were raining or something were to happen\nBut number two you maybe you have children wandering around the home we wouldn't want them [laughter] funny I have no running out of a window that they're not supposed to be going out of so yes we take one window out at a time uh and we were the other one in uh in in some cases depending on how big a\nA R crew is on that particular job it's kind of a like a assembly line effect if you will have a we have one removing the window one putting it in and then processing route so we speed up the project but get it\nDone right oh that's fantastic now if you're thinking about replacing windows doors sliding glass doors in your home with her new by Anderson going on right now there is a limited offer\nIt was for use of over fifty five thousand ATMs member [laughter] [noise]\n\nHe was later I'm Gordon bird news radio Ninety three point one WFL lay the news\nIs a service of trust ... bank Florida's hometown bank the recovery mission continues in Mexico beach ground zero for hurricane Michael Palm Beach county deputies reported finding two bodies this morning survivors are trying to go home but sometimes whole isn't there anymore sharing Monroe of the central Florida Red Cross says people are going in and out of shelters some people\nWill go home or at night or two and then they get there and they'll come back to the shelter so that they have a place in\nThe interim president of soon cook when University in Daytona Beach says he's optimistic the historically black institution will stay afloat amid financial worries students rallied against a possible move by the board of trustees remove Hubert Grimes\nSchools in ... county are about to get another layer of security sure of Wayne ivy and superintendent Mike Mullen's say twenty seven armed guards will be an elementary school campuses starting next week all day every day and he was weather and traffic on news radio ... three point one WFL lady I'm Gordon bird [noise]\nThis is a Bloomberg bark admitted Wall Street had its best day in months the Dow Jones industrial rose five hundred forty eight points or to point two percent to twenty five thousand seven Ninety eight\nThe NASDAQ closed two hundred Fifteen points or two point nine percent higher the S. and P. five hundred added fifty nine points or to point two percent\nAfter the market's closed Netflix posted a third quarter profit the top Wall Street estimates the streaming video providers revenue matched forecasts\nJohnson and Johnson was among the winners of stock rose to ... percent confused ... trading the pharmaceutical company raised its earnings forecast for the year after posting quarterly results that topped estimates the people to put up new houses are more upbeat and industry groups measure of home builder confidence increased this month\nThat was a surprise to economists the pickup and sentiments suggest the market for new rebuild homes maybe regaining some steam crude oil futures closed at Seventy one Ninety two a barrel Jeff ...

[noise]\nI'm not going to the New Hampshire thank you so much has been part of your day here with as if you're anything like me the eye why home improvements I'm all for it I just need to know more about it before I started diving in\nI'm here with Patrick more from university roof and contracting and one of the first memories I had when I moved to Florida in two thousand and four was flying in and seeing Lou\nTarts everywhere almost every home and that's not a decorative thing\nIt's not a decorative bang and I owned one home prior to that and it was new construction and never in my life that I\nEver thought\nAbout a roof over placing a root for when I Need to replace a real for how do you know when it's time to replace a roof and\nTo this day I still see are everywhere is it because of where we live or is it because that's just a homeowner thing\nWell I mean Florida's twilight zone right I mean they were like our own little country down here but the seriousness yeah I mean it's actually not uncommon I mean we are over a year now from a Hurricane Irma which uh you know cause a lot of damage I still\nHave a lot of neighbors getting nervous repair and replace from that\nOh yeah yeah and so a lot of people have for whatever reason have been putting off of replacing the roof\nOr maybe they don't even know that the roof is leaking or you know there's all these different things but uh yeah it is not uncommon even still a year later or over a year later does is he a ... on houses all over central Florida I mean they're everywhere I mean\nI live in winter park and I've got a couple of houses near me uh they have tarps on them still you know\nAnd that's one of the homes and realize that there is a problem for many there can be a slow leak there can be stuff going on and the rules that you wouldn't know that there is a problem going on and I'm sure you see that a lot when you finally get into a home you're like you know what this has been happening for a really long time\nSo what are some of the initial fines at your roof\nMay need repairs and distress or needs complete replacing\nSure yeah that's a great that's a great question because\nA lot of people saw the obvious signs right so there's a big wet spot over their kitchen or they noticed in the bathroom you know the drywall is starting to bubble up or or may have been as extreme as actually we've been in homes where there's holes\nIn the ceiling because so much water was coming into the house which is\nYou know a terrible terrible place to be and so those are the ones where people were very quickly I Need to get somebody here I Need to find out what's going on and that's the people that we've been helping predominantly over the last you know year or so since Hurricane Irma [laughter] ah but what we're still finding even now a year and a year or so later after Irma\nIs people are now just noticing they have water spots right you know or they just now noticed the the ceiling is bubbling up um\nMaybe they just looked in a corner of the room in their house they just never look at and they see yellow on the white drywall and um and so we're going into homes now and there's often what happens is there's a leak in your roofing system and it might be so small and so slow\nThat for that water to penetrate through the roofing system and get to the actual visible places when your house can literally take this long\nShared a roof last night right yeah it had to take a long time for you to figure out hey something's wrong here right\nYeah and so there's so many people that are dealing with this with their roofs that they're calling us going to have a leak\nIn really what to do and really what's been happening is it's been leaking for a year\nOr because they have shingles missing that they don't know about their torn shingles they have shingles that have lifted um where the water is driving up under the shingles which it's not supposed to do right and that is really the greatest opportunity for water to get in your roofing system is underneath the shingles\nFor that bond breaks with a shingle kinda tax down south yeah wants to win pops up it's really difficult for that to lay back down and stick back the way it was I always say it's kind of like a sticker right like if you take a um Hi my name is Patrick and you put that sticker on your shirt right if you take the sticker off\nThen you put it back on your shirt it'll stick but not the same right by the fibers and things aren't\nIn the more you do it at some point it just doesn't stick at all and you're saying a shingle is like that yeah so what happens is a shingles will lift during the storm er during the win whatever it is ... as a lift that tacky underneath the shingle it gets debris underneath it gets ... your water it gets\nA leaves that gets a little debris underneath there and it's not going to stick back so I was just that house not long ago in\nA house with totally normal and I got up on the roof and literally the whole back in the house I just went around with one finger at every single shingle lifted up\nSomeone looked fine it looked normal but when you actually got up there you could see the star even compromise\nExactly and we find that a lot of universal refund contracting where people call us and they'll say\nI'm not missing anything goes I think my roof is fine it's just I Want to make sure and we go out and sure enough\nShingles are lifted there might be shingles porn and so don't just assume because it visually looks good [laughter] that it's in good shape I mean
