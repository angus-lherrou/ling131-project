{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "And good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm so I'm calling because I have just started to look into the Dave Ramsey program and I've\nCreated my budget and I'm trying to get my fiance on board with it out of he's come on board but he's not all the way [laughter] but my my question is is how do we work on baby step to pay off all of our debt while also trying to cash flow a wedding okay\nWho show how much debt do you have personally\n[noise] um well our\nFinancial together no they're not together you're not married\nOkay gets me I have about eleven thousand in credit card debt okay and that's it I Know how I have a five thousand dollar car and I have about forty four thousand seven hundred in student loan\nOkay cool and what does he have\nHe has only a car or the eleventh hour than four hundred okay and\nWhat is his income his income is about thirty eight that was like what is your income about thirty three thousand going on and when are you wanting to get married one is the wedding in September twenty ninth next year country got twelve much good got\nOkay show you are not going to be a hundred percent that free and pay cash for a wedding between the two of you with that income\n[noise] those deaths mass murder you would like to do our best exactly oh I didn't want you to do poorly on the just just observing that mathematically we're not going to knock all of that out\nSo given that that's the situation we need to have a modest wedding would you agree with that yeah okay so ... we do have help from his parents parents oh good how much are they chipping in um\nWell his parents are paying for the catering and the reception many in which the huge ... of it yeah and then um venue a tree and we're getting married at the Capitol Grounds for a little\nFree good and then um we my parents paid for that dress and then they are paying off though for um the limited free alcohol that will be there\nAnd okay phenomenal good and so uh what do you guys need to put in to add to this\nI'm I'm hoping to stay around eight thousand for what for decoration I'm renting things like for the linens and stuff like that and flour if they think that's too much\nYeah I've done to really really nice weddings with two daughters are like really nice things and um I mean you've got the big dog in the wedding is the reception usually the typical wedding it's at least fifty percent of your budget usually the dress and the you know the the camera and the venue is usually aren't hiring the preachers not usually that much\nShow our friend is actually doing it\nRight so so we've got you know we generally speaking really you've got the big things covered here [noise] um yeah you're probably a little rich just for ... linens a lot of people have a really nice wedding the whole wedding for Denver him okay and the national average is less than thirty\nOkay for and that includes ... princes Diana type weddings okay I mean you know yeah [laughter] right so um\nMy mom always says I have um champagne taste with a beer budget\nYeah well I I kinda let me too that that's how I Want broke so [laughter] if I'm you know it's not a big deal but I'm going to back that down in the spirit of\nWe want to get out of debt you know I I'm going to just make up a number you guys can adjust it your adults you and your ... you and your fiance talk about it okay we're both handy I liked him a good thing I'm going to say I'm gonna say let them cover the stuff they're covering and you put in five K. decamp are up OK okay you you could change it\nYou could get for you could make it eight you can change it later OK okay but whatever we do I'm going to put that in the bank first\nOkay before you start your total money Mike over okay I'm going to go ahead and bank five grand between the two of you and I want you to do that and you know it\nSaid to save up for the wedding and then\nHey you know and I want you to do that and like too much okay perfect and then two months I Want to past Christmas yeah we can do that okay\nAnd then we're going to start the debt snowball each individual a do not run your money together until you're married\nI Know you said you were a bad idea it's bad for your budding uh engaged relationship\nIt's really bad legally because if something God Forbid happens and I believe me I've been coaching folks for Thirty years and I see things happen that aren't nice okay it's stuff like a car wreck or something weird okay and you just all kinds of stuff happens and if he has paid off a bunch of your dad\nAnd you're not married it's it's it's a problem and that's really what setting up here so um\nThe the other way you could do this since you've got a lot more than ... you could just attack your debt snowball and he could build up to five grand\nOkay I just don't want to make him pay for that all\nIn a sense he's not because of the day we get married it's all combined mhm and so he's not paying for it we're paying for it okay if as long as it combines on September twenty ninth there is no\nPaid for it I paid for it okay this is our money at that point right yeah because here's the thing if if he um\nPays off the eleven thousand dollars he should be debt free\nAnd you guys ought to have the wedding\nAnd then we got you to deal with when you get a call home from the honeymoon and okay the actual going to have Sallie Mae moving in your spare bedroom right well we already do I know but I mean she's still going to be there when you get the honeymoon they got to get rid of VIX you'll notice over the next year or two but we're hoping yeah the thing is just lay out a plan that both of you agree to\nOkay but please don't\nI don't want him paying your debt ... okay it gets weird okay I I absolutely I didn't see it like that yeah it's just possible downside is all there and the upshot is very little if\nYou get to the point that he has extra money the weddings covered in huge debt free and he wants to pay on it it's just ... big pile of cash in on September the thirtieth write checks towards your bed okay but then if something God Forbid happen that everything's still separated between now and then okay\nAnd I'm so cool cool congratulations must send your wedding gift is called the book the total money make over

educate and empower on his show [noise]\nWe seek to empower you to take control of your retirement through proper information mhm\nThere's so much misinformation out there that causes people to miss windows ... opportunity Chris we tell them every Saturday here's your window of opportunity\nListening give some nugget skin empowered and take control your retirement hey before he went to a break though we said when we come back we're going to tell you some interesting stories right here about Ronald Reagan we're also going to hit on a little bit of a a major strategy\nThat's kind of hidden from the everyday average American mhm has been since Nineteen eighty\nOr Chris oh I Want you to talk a little bit about Reagan and one of the strategies utilized mhm before we do that guys on this show we tell you things have gotten us featured on Forbes the same strategies we use we're going to tell you on the show\nRight and top five retirement visor in this country that is what we talk about every Saturday is the same stuff that got us featured\nThat's why it just shows the most powerful show on weekend radio what a better time to talk about a great president Ronald Reagan okay doesn't matter where you sit on what's which party line Ronald Reagan was a it was a great man okay and Ronald Reagan\nBelieve it or not most people don't know this younger generation doesn't I don't think was an actor before he was president\nOkay wow he's an actor so it was a pretty good actor is pretty good he had some swag didn't he [laughter]\nSo now Ronald Reagan if you look back over his time frame he only made to movies a year\nTo movies two movies that's it not because he wasn't good at acting we've already said that\nIt ... it had it was something different something more important okay here's the reason why so first of all when he made to when you made a movie you got paid about a hundred thousand dollars which at a time of the highest paid actor Yeah Yup so hundred thousand dollars per movie\nOkay and so he made two at two hundred thousand dollars now you got to know something first of all you got to know that at this time period\nWhen he was acting that the taxes top tax bracket was Ninety four percent\nNinety four people think\nWhen I asked people where do you think taxes are now do you think are lower high most of the time they say low much great majority ... love I said look if we look over history actually we are at historical lows for taxes even though we are mounting piles of debt that is cause for concern\nLow Chris I Know that fact but man it doesn't feel like it every year when I got to cut that right [laughter] yes\nI hear you about that you know so here so here's what Ronald Reagan and he's at a Ninety four percent tax bracket right so what he did and it was once you made over two hundred thousand dollars you're taxed at Ninety four percent so he just didn't make a third movie\nIt it'd be worth less you'd get six six thousand bucks so taxes causes to miss out on some potentially great movies guys so so the taxes and Ninety Ninety four percent of the question is can they go back there\nWell I think we've already heard that answer having one yeah I mean look debt if there's anything to make us go back to a higher tax bracket in the future\nIt which we think they absolutely will get its debt\nYou know something's funny Chris is a well not really too funny actually is back then\nWe didn't have Nineteen trillion in debt right and what did you say that top tax bracket was it was Ninety four and back in the seventies it was still in the ... in the sixties and eighties beginning of the eighties is is in the fifties so you can see if you've got mounting piles of debt the government is not a business right\nIs the only way it gets income is how from us from taxes it's got a service this day where do you think they're gonna get it they're going to get it from us so that's one thing that blows my mind is taxes were higher\nWhen we last Adam if something's got to give their right so so taxes\nAre going to go up we got a lot of debt water people to do and retirement tax are going to go up in the future\nOkay let's say you're in a twenty five percent tax bracket right now okay it hurts but what if that goes up to forty five now you're taking home forty five percent less money now you're taking a forty five percent loss every year in retirement\nThat is crippling so instead is there a way can we turn the tables and get a forty five percent growth every year by simply not paying taxes well yeah if you don't pay the taxes\nAnd you're getting forty five percent more money in this case in your pocket and you're essentially getting so forty five percent more growth but can you can you not pay taxes\nAnd not go to jail if it's\nTax free income that's not qualified\nAnd you don't have to pay on that then yeah okay if it's set up correctly yeah does it set up correctly I got to do is read the whole tax code everybody you'll find it in there right so he wants to do that though\nLet me open up Pandora's box for a second now the ultra wealthy they don't pay any taxes retirement using the rats strategy you know a very well known strategy in the ultra wealthy communities\nKnow of course that bought ran through my mind as soon as you said that high tax bracket 'cause you know who never ends up paying the actual high tax brackets the ultra wealthy the ultra wealthy you know who the barn always falls on middle class the middle class picks up the slack yet\nAnd that's not right All right Sam here's what
