Fox News President Trump and the first lady in Pittsburgh to paint was banks did those last in the mass shooting honest in a God taxes can turn off Scott has more lives\nA lot of folks in the industry think when they get ready to do windows is really only one way to do it and that's what they have existing in their home so many options out there so many ways to save money\nFrankly a lot of ways even spend more money to bail out and do you do for you want to make your house I'm really good at that most people want to most people in the end of the day want to accomplish do things they want a product that's going to last forever and they want a house that looks like a brand new house at the same or address\nOkay All right yeah I I don't know what I mean I think I Would like improving the aesthetic of my house well one\nOf the things that I've found in many folks that I talked to a in the window industry when I approach folks I asked him hey what is it that you're trying to achieve and when they talk about the aesthetics of the home and how it looks\nThey go Dan I had some quotes I've talked to some folks but look I've seen these windows in the house I've seen these big white clunky thick\nBones looking glass windows I don't want that look and it really show our mission and on one of our goals uh ever knew why Anderson is we want the window and we designed the window to look like it actually came with a home\nMhm so it doesn't seem like it's out of place exactly if you're curious and if you're thinking about and this is something you might want to do a little bit more about if you're in the same kind of mindset that I can get some information but also take advantage of the office going on right now to a if you are listening to the show renewal by enter than you can\nFor the first seven callers get ... percent off windows doors and installation that's twenty percent off of everything so shut down the number\nEight eight eight for eight or nine for eight zero that has eight eight eight for eight for nine for eight zero eight eight eight or eight or nine for eight zero to\nGet the information and hopefully get in on that special offer as well um now I Am looking at replacing it all at once that the doors and windows I'm Ken renewal banners and also do sliding glass doors I mean is there any ... like is there anything that in your typical home is there anything that you can tell\nMe the short answer is no way to answer right um\nWe want you we don't want you you want to be really careful when you are changing opening sizes are sometimes you can begin to get into structural members of the home so we can and larger make openings smaller if it's the right situation okay\nBut the answer your question we can do just we can yes we can do just about anything you want with the custom or be a window\nOkay when they enter some kind of want me to the process let's say I give you a call and then I think I'm ready not exactly sure like what's the best way to get a quote to get your design team out luckily through the process All right\nSo the first step is you win a pick up the phone and you would call our national call center or our local call center within a working hours and us up\nFree in home design consultant estimate right so that individual would then come out to your home they would take a look at and your name your dreams or whatever you're trying to create\nA most importantly provide us illusion show we would go we would measure the windows we would go or some\nDesign options with you mhm uh and then we would uh we have a a design a software that we carry with us in the home so you can actually see what the window looks like\nThat you're having designed oh fantastic and\nSo once we got a mystery yeah [laughter] makes it a little bit of time in the home so uh be prepared been this way you can get exactly what you want you know it's what you want to see what it looks like and once we knew that uh we simply price it up for you right there in the home so okay so now waiting no waning\nThat's nice and we can get an idea of\nWhat you could be getting into you often get excited about the process of you know possibly getting these new windows and new doors now let's say I you know I I Love the station I Love the smell of the way everything looks and I say okay and let's go and do they understand let's make this happen in my home what is the next that\nWell the next step is how we're going to pay for it right you can't call mom anymore right [laughter] well my daughter would kill me but she she still calls that so uh yeah so\nThe next set with me we have many different ways to to help fund the job or to provide on the job\nSo you can do financing through us you can pay cash or credit card any of that is all done on the spot instant financing we have great promotions are going on uh at this time ... and I'm\nSo is there is quite easy or you don't have to have any money down in um\nIn the process can keep going in the process can keep going well tell me about the uh the teams tell me about your crew what what can we expect when it's time for renewal by ... percent to come into my home and actually put in these new windows\nAnd doors sliding glass doors and everything else yes so the process a is\nReally smooth the we have a concierge service so what that means is once you place the order you'll\nBe contacted ... job is to hold your hand through every step of the process so once you place that order with us\nYou will then be contacted and they'll let you know the very next that\nAnd that next step would be a tech mission or any tech measure would come out in measuring behind the design consulting because that measure three time that's right [laughter] measuring Tom's cut launch right so we do that and um but once we get the confirmed measure much the windows or order they come in\nYour installers show up so we don't use quote just installers are folks are\nA Anderson certified master installers\nAnd what that means is we have a scope or national pie and guidelines and then these windows have to be installed by okay I often tell people that windows ... there's two home improvement projects they're really scare me\nWhen I Am a roofing those too that if they're done incorrectly oh yeah they will rot your house to the ground\nOkay do we need to make sure that it's being done properly um obviously we have great building inspectors and coaching for to help us with that uh but believe it or not folks can still kind a lotta corners and so if we make sure we do it right\nSo what would happen say if you know real real they understand it is in the home that insulation process has begun and you're taking out the windows and you do find some things structurally wrong when\nWe hope that that doesn't happen we try to ... but you're you're exactly right it can happen in ... in this great state of Florida there's a lot of there's a lot of humidity and there's a lot of ways for water to get in these walls that we can't see\nI'm hoping that's where this concierge service comes and [laughter] and again and we'll have the answers for me\nTo show what would happen in that case um uh when we designed a window we priced out just the window in the cosmetic area within a couple of inches of the window but if we find out when we remove this window we've gotten mon infestation and all types of things going on in rotten all the things you\nJust pray that wouldn't be there yes um what we have to do then is we have to bring\nIn a we have to uh refer you to a an al ... Khan tractor that would the specialized in structural damage and get that are taking care of some on it or to some degree we can handle a just depends on how severe it is\nAnd you've got people that you trust and you're ready and that you can pick up that phone and ...\nWe wouldn't we wouldn't put anybody anybody's home we didn't\nTrial that's comforting yes um let's say to go smoothly no bombs at all which we all hope of course with we knew by Anderson about how long are you looking for this to be happening in your home and they'll say if you're doing\nTen windows ten when it's wipe out I mean is that you know a week's worth of open holes in your house or is it something that hopefully a lot smoother than\nIf it was our first job involving takes us about a much but a census since we do ah you know two billion dollars a year we pretty fast if\nThis but we are good too yeah go ... normally it would take a you can usually say about a day for every four windows and that's being conservative but we'd rather you know we'd rather a over promise a I mean a under promise rather than over promise\nYeah I I've been through a window I'm I've been through a window reinstall at a at a at a former house and I was saying that situation I it it\nIt was like the house was open there for a while and it's it's really company here that with a new by ... percent that's\nNot really the case you guys got it down to a science then you can get those windows in and out of doors in and out and feeling like safe in your home with your new energy efficient windows and all that good stuff it's a great point and you did remind with small children just cat\nAbsolutely uh I've heard horror stories are all over the world you know about these types of situations and\nWe're definitely not going to come in in in\nPullout fix windows in and leave holes in your house for the very reason that you several reasons number one if it were writing or something were to happen but number two you maybe you have children wandering around the home we wouldn't want\nThem [laughter] funny I have no running out of a window that they're not supposed to be going out of so yes we take one window out at a time uh and we were the other one in uh in in some cases depending on how big a\nA R crew is on that particular job it's kind of a like a assembly line effect if you will a we have one or a moving the window one putting it in and then processing raw so we speed up the project but get it done right\nThe smartest way to hire based on trust pilot rating of hiring side to the ... ...\nDollars a pound five to nine on your cellphone law that's all [noise]\nIn the\nWFL a new center I'm Gordon bird and he was radio Ninety three point one WFL a of the news is the surface of trust ... bank Florida's hometown bank to people did one taken to a hospital after a helicopter crash in Sebring highlands county deputy say the chopper crashed into a mobile home park destroying one home and damaging another\nRiverside county deputies stop a potentially horrific crime they say they're undercover detective caught Twenty one year old Alexander barter of Texas trying to obtain a young girl they say he planned to murder and then eat the victim has an cannibalism they hope to put him away for life\nA scare on the UCF campus today police questioning a student after he showed up to class wearing a Halloween costume was real bullets attached\nDavid told them of seminal county had to rescue his your key after a black bear attack did he says the dog named gator slipped out of the house and encountered three hungry bears told them run out kicked one barrier grabbed his dog and ran for his life back into the house\nAll day everyday news weather and traffic on news radio Ninety three point one WFL late I'm Gordon bird [noise]\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute Wall Street's closing bell came as stocks hit their high point high enough to send the down as in the back into positive territory for the year with games of about one and a half\nTo one and three quarters percent the down roads four hundred thirty two points then asked at one hundred eleven the S P forty one strategist credit more optimism on trade and bargain hunters textile seized back their losses\nAs they waited for Facebook to postage earnings report from last quarter after the closing bell shares finished the session up three percent\nAnd they rose in late trading as well the social network reporting more than two billion people use at least one Facebook service each day that overshadows sales numbers that came up short of targets\nUnder Armour hasn't seen a day like this one in ten years shares jumped by a quarter of their value Wall Street getting its full approval to the athletic where companies restructuring especially is profit speed estimates last quarter I'm Joan ...

I'm Still you know\nAnd that's where the homes and realize that there is a problem for many there can be a slow leak there can be stuff going on and the rules that\nYou wouldn't know that there is a problem going on and I'm sure you see that a lot when you finally get into the home you're like you know what this has been happening for a really long time so what are some of the initial finds that your roof\nMay need repairs and distress or needs complete replacing\nSure yeah that's a great that's a great question because\nA lot of people saw the obvious signs right so there's a big wet spot over their kitchen or they noticed in the bathroom you know the drywall is starting to bubble up ah or may have been as extreme as actually we've been in homes where there's holes in the ceiling because so much water was coming into the house which is\nYou know a terrible terrible place to be and so those are the ones where people were very quickly I Need to get somebody here I Need to find out what's going on and that's the people that we've been\nHelping predominantly over the last year or so since Hurricane Irma [laughter] ah but what we're still finding even now a year and a year or so later after Irma is people are now just noticing they have water spots right you know or they just now noticed the the ceiling is bubbling up um\nMaybe they just looked in a corner of the room at their house they just never look at and they yellow on the white drywall um and so we're going into homes now and there's often what happens is there's a leak in your roofing system and it might be so small and so slow\nThat for that water to penetrate through the roofing system and get to the actual visible places when your house can literally take this long\nShared a roof lag might right yeah it had to take a long time for you to figure out hey something's wrong here right\nYeah and so there's so many people that are dealing with this with their roofs that they're calling us going to have a leak in really what to do and really what's been happening is it's been leaking for a year or because they have shingles missing that they don't know about the torn singles have singles that have ...\nDid um where the water is driving up under the shingles which it's not supposed to do right and that is really the greatest opportunity for water to get in your roofing system is underneath the shingles\nAfter that bond breaks where the single kind of tax down south yeah once the when pops up it's really difficult for that to lay back down and stick back the way it was I always say it's kind of like a sticker right like if you take a um Hi my name is Patrick and you put that sticker on your shirt right if you take the sticker off\nThen you put it back on your shirt ill stick but not the same right by the fibers and things aren't\nIn the more you do it at some point it just doesn't stick at all and you're saying a shingle is like that yeah so what happens is a shingles will lift during the storm er during the win whatever it is ... as a lift that tacky underneath the shingle it gets debris underneath it gets ... your water it gets\nA leaves it gets a little debris underneath there and it's not going to stick back\nSo I was just that house not long ago in a house look totally normal and I got up on the roof in literally the whole back of the house I just went around with one finger at every single shingle lifted up\nSomeone looks fine it looks normal but when you actually got up there you can see the star even compromise\nExactly and we find that a lot of universal riffing contracting where people call us and they'll say\nI'm not missing in ... I think my roof is fine it's just I Want to make sure and we go out and sure enough\nShingles are lifted there might be shingles torn and so don't just assume because it visually looks good that it's in good shape I mean there's a very good chance that there could be something going on and especially if you notice any yellow ring in your ceiling anything that looks like a water spot whether it looks like it to dry up or it looks like it's fresh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Under Oath with Matt Englett", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "30"}
