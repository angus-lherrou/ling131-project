by hand when in fact I make sure I fully understand hit my head after he had a question it is it appropriate I can see that well and you have any suggestions on how it for that conversation\nOr it's more than appropriate as a matter of fact it's just flat out strange he made you the executor without first talking to you\nThat's like weird [laughter] yeah that's a very presumptive to say the least show a let's re start the conversation ... ... ah I didn't sign up for this and I am willing to consider helping you in this way\nAnd I think you thought you were honoring me with this and I appreciate the honor I think uh but there's a couple of things that are going to go along with me agreeing to be your executor\nUm otherwise I Can't be your exact number one is I have to know what

that at your stuff but you need to take me off of the executor ship\nBecause those are my terms for serving as executive does that sound unreasonable do you\nNot at all I I appreciate that's how I was feeling as well ...\nYeah that's exactly what I Would do and by the way if he won't take you off as soon as he dies you step before the judge and say I refuse it\nI'm not going to take it I told him

misinformation out there that causes people to miss windows ... opportunity Chris we tell them every Saturday here's your window of opportunity\nListening give some nugget skin empowered and take control he retired but hey before he went to a break though we said when we come back we're going to tell you some interesting stories right here about Ronald Reagan we're also going to hit on a little bit of a a major strategy\nThat's kind of hidden from the everyday average American mhm has been since Nineteen eighty\nAre Chris oh I Want you to talk a little bit about Reagan and one of the strategies he utilized ... before we do that guys on this show we tell you things that we've gotten us featured on Forbes the same strategies we use we're going to tell you on the show\nRight and top five retirement advisor in his country that's what we talk about every Saturday is the same stuff that got us featured\nThat's why this shows the most powerful show on weekend radio what a better time to talk about a great president Ronald Reagan okay doesn't matter where you sit on what's which party line Ronald Reagan was a it was a great man okay and Ronald Reagan\nBelieve it or not most people know this younger generation doesn't I don't think was an actor before\nHe was president okay wow he's an actor so it was a pretty good actor Hugh ... is pretty good you had some swag didn't he [laughter]\nSo now Ronald Reagan if you look back over his time frame he only made to movies a year\nTo movies two movies that's it not because he wasn't good at acting we've already said that\nIt ... it had it was something different something more important okay here's the reason why so first of all when he made to we made a movie he got paid about a hundred thousand dollars which at a time of the highest paid actor yeah yeah so a hundred thousand dollars per movie\nOkay and so he made two uh two hundred thousand dollars now you got to know something first of all you got to know that at this time period\nWhen he was acting that the taxes top tax bracket was Ninety four percent Ninety four people think when I asked\nPeople where do you think taxes are now do you think are lower high most of the time they say low much great majority on this they love I said look if we look over history actually we are at historical lows for\nTaxes even though we are mounting piles of debt that is cause for concern low Chris I Know that fact but man it doesn't feel like it every year when I got to cut that right [laughter] yes I hear about that you know so here so here's what Ronald Reagan and he's at a Ninety four percent tax bracket right\nSo what he did and it was once you made over two hundred thousand dollars you're taxed at Ninety four percent so he just didn't make a third movie\nIt it'd be worth less you'd get six six thousand bucks so taxes causes to miss out on some potentially great movies guys so so the taxes and Ninety Ninety four percent of the question is can they go back there\nWell I think ah we've already heard that answer having a way yeah I mean look debt if there's anything to make us go back to a higher tax bracket in the future in which we think they absolutely will get its debt you know something's funny Chris is a\nWell not really too funny actually is back then\nWe didn't have Nineteen trillion in debt right and what did you say that top tax bracket was it was Ninety four and in fact in the seventies it was still in the ... in the sixties in eighties beginning of the eighties is is in the fifties so you can see if you've got mounting piles of debt the government is not a business right\nIs the only way it gets incumbents how from us from taxes it's got a service this day where do you think they're going to get it they're going to get it from us so that's one thing that blows my mind as taxes were higher\nWhen we last Adam if something's got to give their right so\nSo taxes are going to go up we got a lot of debt water people to do and retirement tax are going to go up in the future\nOkay let's say you're in a twenty five percent tax bracket right now ... hurts but what if that goes up to forty five now you're taking home forty five percent less money now you're taking a forty five percent loss every year in retirement\nThat is crippling sill instead is there a way can we turn the tables and get a forty five percent growth every year by simply not paying taxes well yeah if you don't pay the taxes\nAnd you're getting forty five percent more money in this case in your pocket and you're essentially getting so forty five percent more growth but can you can you not pay taxes\nAnd not go to jail\nIf it's tax free income\nThat's not qualified and you don't have to pay on that then yeah okay if it's set up correctly yeah that is set up correctly I got to do is read the whole tax code everybody you'll find it in there right so who wants to do that though let me open up Pandora's box for a second now the ultra wealthy\nThey don't pay any taxes in retirement using the rats strategy you know a very well known strategy in the ultra wealthy communities you know of course that bought ran through my mind as soon as you said
