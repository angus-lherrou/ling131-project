{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "And when other people that here's what happened and if you do have to go heavy on somebody a little bit just blame it on me go on a day where you're just like David said OK and just go you know you can argue with David you argue a day but you know he got five million people out of that I don't think you'd it sure\nSo um you know whatever it might not be that abrasive right what's the point is you can go got bad guy they call it off on me and lean on that and so\nLike when ... first start speaking um I mean she was twenty four years old and I'm like what she thought sure [laughter]\nNow she's twenty eight and had three ... three national bestsellers and now a few people cares what's so but she has blamed it on me\nOr if we're in a Christian so I think we blame it on the Bible okay you know this is what the Bible says the Bible says the borrower slaves the lender and you want to argue with that how you got yeah and the Bible you know Jesus said don't build a power without first counting the costs less to get halfway up and you know what I mean ... obviously you begin to mock you and say this men began to build and was unable to finish\nSo you should be on a written plan is what Jesus was saying so\nReally I mean I get up on him I mean you know a ... that kind of stuff now again I'm being kind of sarcastic and bombastic he would be\nI Would even be more gentle than that in a setting in a smaller setting the bigger the setting the more wild I Am the uh but you know when you're one on one you're just gentle and you just go guys I'm only thirty one I don't have all the answers\nBut here's what we did know and you know if you want to have those same results aspect if you do the same thing we did you'd have the same results we didn't have those results because of our age we had those results because we applied proven principles\nRight you know I mean let's let's say that you are leading up let's say you were a personal trainer\nAnd the guy you're training a was four hundred pounds and he was a forty five years old\nBut he doesn't like you're telling him anything goes you're thirty one and you have I ... I mean come on\nYou know the personal trainer you got out and got up so yeah so I mean he may have he's got a ... you know you just you just kind of this is what you're doing ... my point is you have proof but but you just approach it with the same spirit you approach this question well okay and that's just a a level of humility uh but you can be\nForceful on the principles\nAnd on the scripture as the backup for the principles and even on the day Ramsey or Dave Ramsey organization her brand or whatever as proof of the principles and your personal life is proof for the principles\nAnd if they don't get it through all of that because you're thirty one they're just using that as an excuse ago but ... and again you don't want to be abrasive but you're not going to be you wouldn't even asked this question if you were going to be a race right it's just not your style it's neither you guys are okay\nBut do really you've got great story\nThank you can just tell your story is this what we did I mean you do what you want it there is what we did right and they look what happened you know I lost three hundred pounds if they set up to donate to smooth this is what happened you know\nAnd it's applied the principals and as I say thank you so much for teaching a class well thank you so cool that you're doing that yeah I'm excited and you know what's what you'll find is interesting is\nThat people don't look down on age when there are results mhm okay it's when you have no proof\nIn your life you know that that you you know that they look down and they go look I got socks older than you you know and they you know they they won't but but that's but you got us or\nEurope they wish they had been when they were thirty right you know and and so they can still be that when they're sixty if they'll go do it the right question man thanks for joining us thanks for coming by and thanks for taking the class Haley is with us in Seattle, Washington Hi Hailey how are you\nI'm Glad I have um a question concerning from some plan\n[noise]\nUm I have I'm twenty five thousand pay their employer in a retirement plan and I know you talk about pulling it out and putting it or not\nHer and get out but transferring from Utah fun good so I went to a guy in our church and he worked for a drive in financial and he does say that he our jails and and so I um\nI I I Need the ... well he was pretty sad that we put that money into variable annuity rather than mutual funds and I wasn't sure why or if that was okay or is that what you're following\nYou and I did not following you know what is not following what I teach I'm Glad I didn't think south to answer that part of the quite\nVariable Newt mutual fund or variable annuities are mutual funds inside of\nAn annuity if you pretend like the mutual fund as an investment in the ... is a coat that goes around the investment to keep it warm from Texas\nOkay okay and you pay extra for the annuity portion of this discussion now\nWhat you could buy those exact same mutual funds with less fees\nWithout the new coke wrapping around them okay so what is the ... do for you the coat wrapping around it to keep it warm it does the same thing the fact that it's been an IRA already gosh so you're buying to coach for the same kid\nOkay okay you see what I'm saying you got it's already going to be kept out of the cold of taxes by the fact that you're rolling it into an IRA okay and then you move it into a newly inside of an IRA it's redundant\nBecause you've already got the protection now the only thing the annuity will give us they'll give you some guarantees a along the lines of you know if it goes down in value you know they protect you on principle and it will give you at least a four percent or five percent of income but if you're invested in good mutual funds when you're young you don't need those guarantees\nSo I'm okay and truthfully not not trashing thrive in I mean driving or friends of ours are good people um but I Would not use that product there and the thing you need to remember about variable annuities versus a direct mutual funds sale\nIs there's two things going on usually usually if someone's trying to show you that because they don't have a securities license they only have a life insurance license\nOh okay and that it's a way they can make such a way in insurance person can get you into mutual funds is through the variable annuity they cannot sell mutual funds directly unless they have a securities license\nThe second thing that you run into that region you run into this and it's less often for this and I don't think that would be the case with thriving is that they're actually doing this because the commissions on a verbal and earlier about four times what they are are on a regular mutual fund\nOkay so some people ... just because they make more on them\nAnd I would not accused the ticket our guy of that and the situation\nI mean knowing his from knowing the setting that you did this my guess is he's probably not security ... that's my guess okay and and here he is still giving you a bad recommendation\nNow he did say that I can do that and you're trying to find exactly as you recommend them has a new thing him\nHe didn't really kept pushing that variable annuity and asked me to go home with all the number at my husband review and think about that Mm well I wanted to call you immediately I knew what you are going to say already\nYou know so now we've got another problem OK okay if this piece of advice was bad and you knew it what about the next ... by that you don't know is bad\nI you're right that can go and I I had to let\nThem know that right away I just felt bad 'cause he goes to our church and that you know network yeah\nAnd that's okay I mean is that you don't have to do business with people at church is not necessary so and so I I I don't think I'm going to do business with this guy um because I mean I I I don't like his advice and I might not like it next time when I might not understand next time\nI just get a smart restaurant row and\nMoving that way is a series of gross our major sons correct\nThanks for the call this is that I Ramsey show

Orlando news radio Ninety three point one WFL a and I heard radio\nStation\n\nFox News alert targeting Democrat ... camera crew pipe bomb sent to two former presidents high profile Democrat and CNN do York headquarters boxes ... has the latest lined\nSo that that was Trump's comments that's basically the right thing and needs to say of course\nI Want to get behind the microphone and tell you that things are going to get better soon that we are going to unite soon that we are going to get past this soon and we're going to get rid of this horrible polarization that has now turning into violence unfortunately I just don't see the evidence of that\nToday I feel like things are just getting worse and worse\nAnd worse and the reaction to this today and the reaction to Trump today\nKind of is an example of it so this was actually a Carrie Cordero she has a CNN analyst says media they're cut to go ahead and her immediate reaction this was a lot of reaction from the media was immediately to point fingers\nThis is what is happening today this is what happens every time something like this happens what we do is we play the ...\nGame in both sides are guilty of this and of course today was the left in the media doing the same thing this is what she said\nIt also it's hard to ignore the fact that the president everybody know that the president is the one who has contributed and if the primary proponent behind the course of American political discourse\nSo also ... oh yeah that that that that wasn't\nThere we go immediately is about blaming Trump\nWants to look at the violent instances in the past couple of years there is no doubt that Trump doesn't help the situation Trump has very heated political rhetoric I've condemned to a lot of that rhetoric on this show in fact if you follow me on Twitter at beyond reason are I pointed out earlier this week to Trump\nBecause Trump was complaining about democratic mobs while at the same time praising our\nCongressmen who body slammed a reporter\nSo obviously you can't complain about mobs environments in South and then praised the guy who body slams a reporter\nBut what to look at all the violent ... we've had in the past couple of years we had a guy shoot up a bunch of Republicans tried to kill a bunch of Republicans on a baseball field he was a radical Bernie Sanders supporter\nBefore that we had um it was a black ... black lives matter activists in Dallas shoot police officers [noise] course we had Charlottesville and someone on the extreme right ended up running over\nAn innocent girl in killing her then we have um antifa that has come out and destroyed college campuses and is now started violence and they block traffic in Portland and done some pretty bad things there\n[noise] we've had people you know harassed congressmen other stuff harassed at\nRestaurants I happened to Mitch McConnell again this week but what also happened last week was Nancy Pelosi was harassed going into a building\nAnd she was harassed as a communist and everything I told you this was going to happen when the left was so outraged by Trump I told you what's eventually going to happen is the other side is going to want to fight back because too many times I here we have to fight fire with fire and I keep telling people know that just creates more fire\nIt just makes things worse\nSo this is a problem on both sides to this is a problem\nWith our country right now\nAnd of course you know I think the answer is the answer is Jesus if he actually follow the teachings of Jesus we wouldn't be doing this to each other but people aren't doing it\nThere's a couple of things that are causing this problem once the fact is both sides believe in totally different things now that it's hard to find compromise\nThe other problem is social media social media seems to be bringing out the worst of us so you have bad inclinations in your head now you can go online and find lots of other people who have those bad inclination to and you can find Web sites that reinforce your bad ideas and it grows and grows and grows and it gets to where\nWe are today\nI've been saying for a while what we have to do is a warrant to peacefully disagree that means we don't we don't go to the worst intentions of people I get this all the time when someone disagrees with me on line when someone disagrees with me on social media or whatever\nI Will get people say I'm bought by Bain Capital or something 'cause Bain Capital used to own Clear Channel or they were part about buyouts so I'm part of the Romney meaty I've been shoes of being a conspiracy theories I've been accused of all kinds of stuff\nAnd this happens on both sides\nYou know it was it was interesting\nOn my vacation when I was in Virginia I happen to be flipping through the channels and I was working at I think it was on HBO or whatever\nAnd I noticed pot pot sees America was on they had some kind of TV special on I think it was HBO and they do a pretty popular pod cast out there\nAnd they were doing a TV special and immediately what they started doing was basically calling Republicans bigoted homophobic racist\nAnd I'm thinking this is what we do now we attack\nWe attack people's motivations we can't just disagree on ideas anymore we can't just disagree on policy anymore\nWe attack people at the very core so if I post a story that I think it's very interesting instead of going through the actual what is being talked about like an opinion piece instead of you know disagreeing with the peace and what it says the ideas and the peace immediately wallets\nFrom that ... wanting to look at it I get is from both sides if I put some from the Washington Post all watch fake news Washington Post post something from conservative view all review oh conservative or if you you can't even look at that\nThis is why we are where we are and Trump is just as bad with this he calls the other side evil\nWere never you cannot coexist with your fellow man that disagree with you if you are convinced that the reason they disagree with you is 'cause they're evil at the core\nI don't believe everyone who disagrees amusing evil at the core\nI just don't maybe we just have different ideas maybe we just have different opinions\nThat's why we have so many problems today so they ... the other big story of the day is I'm Rhonda saint this in Andrew Gillum and there's actually an example I Want to get to on a sec\nAfoul what Andrew Gillum has been doing lately kinda feeds into this feeds into a lot of this\nWe're also going to talk to my

[laughter]\nYeah I think this and this has to win\nA in spite of him on a in in that\nAre not anything to him I mean I I just think that we're going to amount I think Andrew Gillum playing the race card or heard them obviously the information coming out I Believe it's going to hurt them but run this camp this just wasn't ready for the race that was before him he relied on Trump to heavily relied on Sean Hannity relied on Laurie room\nAnd he hadn't really run a statewide rate wasn't you said it was used to running the congressional rate so and then you at the back they kill them one I don't think no one was expecting Andrew Gillum to win including myself I thought it was going to be going ground\nI really think that that really do a ranch in his campaign and then he comes out with that
