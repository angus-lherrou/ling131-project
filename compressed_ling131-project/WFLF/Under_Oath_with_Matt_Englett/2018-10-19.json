I made a humiliation the embarrassment vets when other than my observing KKK march them on for about ... that was one of the dramatic experience that I Will never forget my lights\nTell me the story about the Klan the Klan and say it's\nYeah and in a way it goes to the Klan off yes\nThey stood declaring off because what happened they were going to mark Goldberg because Goldsboro come in and they had um had a shutdown of store in Goldsboro and the reason they shut this down and goes wherever the owner who was a white man let's put and black boys in a freezer\nAnd this one at a store is that we always telling Goldsboro and it took him button about ten boys in the freezer they wouldn't die but because the kids are run to that child house and tell the moms go get him he had in the freezer\nAnd I'm so that the citizens of ... me and they got really upset and is not going to happen in more so they got that shot guns they end up like a not a clue politically and we're supposed to march oh Goldsboro they got their shot guns they made a ...\nA a barricade mhm\nWanted the streets and when the Klan got about oh I guess maybe about a hundred yards from they said if you come in at close to ... they had shot does point at them they had their roles zone and they\nApparently with no guns and they turn around and ran\nAnd never much don't goes burgan\nThat's it that's the way it works yeah and just to um well not to follow that but the other topic a shopping all black ... you know we get a lot of questions and I know sometimes oftentimes I get followed\nUm I Can't think of the most recent for me but I can think of my friends and ... who is actually start in Broadway in New York and live their winter trinity Pratt\nYou know from a great community and she told me she went to one of the day goes I think they call them in New York and that the owner was following her down every single aisle and she said she went there every single day to get her products you know her food her groceries and says she says she's never going to go back in there because of how that made her feel\nUm it doesn't feel good to be watched in scrutinized um for not even doing anything et cetera\nAre stopped and not let in this bill at all\nThat happened to me and say if it was raining one day and I I I Love antiques and say if it turned into a lot I to shop and I was walking not to get out of the rain but I went in the store and the man stop\nMe as I got rid of the door to door was open and he said you can't stay in here because it's raining you can't spend your time and he added a rain\nNow here I Am I doing bad is per se\nBut I had a two thousand dollar Gucci first on my shoulder\nThat my daughter had given me and apparently\nI don't look like a steel I guess I don't know maybe I Do ...\nBut I never I never got past him in the store and this was about\nTwo years ago maybe you\nAnd I thought you were going to say this was twenty five years it was forty five years ago this was no ... and this is what is happening in our community at right now right you know right now right here driving shop in all of it\nGet a you know of Malcolm X\nHad a a ... and ... called the ballot in the bullet about it or the bullet or just kind of speaking about the trials of the debate whether you should vote or not I think it should be the ballot and the bullet frankly uh I think you need to attack on all fronts and not attack in a physical sense but right now there's so many different\nIssues that we have to tackle on top of us just going through the regular life everybody else has to do that we need to celebrate the little victories we have you know what I'm saying we need to celebrate the guilt aims\nWe celebrate the uh the uh the new state attorney ... around because we celebrate any time somebody gets in a position of power because we are hoping so much that you can make changes from the inside\nSo it's just difficult when you have to fight against people telling you that your issues don't exist which is why I applaud the me too movement this is a lot of women coming out saying these are things that are happening between the lines that you all have been underway and ran on like yo what that's going on we feel the same way with regard to what happened in the U.S with race\nBut some people are trying to make it seem like it's so far gone but it's nothing you have to worry about now now we don't use these as excuses to not be a productive members of society\nBut we have to wear them on top of everything else and we just feel that if at least with the knowledge universally as opposed to there being campaigns against any time there's somebody was trying to bring attention like a call in a capital make or somebody like that\nUh we feel that if you would at least acknowledge us then that some sort of progress but we're always met with fierce opposition and that's why we have so much more where\nWe are going to wrap it up and I wasn't going to say thank you where do I have time for one more person\nI'm looking at the boss I'm up here you\nKnow I just want to say 'cause a lot of people talking about um whether it was changes and\nNo improvements

we need to change the electors we need to be able to like go to the police academies ...\nChange how they approached us we need a change to talk to our church is about how it is pretty much knew how to change and figure out a new method of how we approach each other 'cause um I told you not to um a friend of ... but my oldest son having talked to him\nHe ... he has autism and being a father of
