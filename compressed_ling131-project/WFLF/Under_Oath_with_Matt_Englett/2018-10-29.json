but\nI I think you just say I'm you know I don't do well at this this and this and so I'm Better for that that bad and um\nIt yeah I when I come over here to your organization I Want to be bring I Want to be a game I Want to be bringing you a hundred percent competency\nAnd when I'm outside of my competency it it doesn't indicate a lack of ambition it indicates a lack of self awareness on my part and I'm self aware enough to know that I'm not good at that\nAnd um so that's why I Want to step down not good at this and um if that's the truth anyway I just tell the truth it's amazing when you do that how it just kind of releases you Eric's with us in Afghanistan and don't get a lot of calls from Afghanistan Eric how are you\n[laughter] pretty is or how you doing\nBetter than I deserve your military\nA ... a former military I'm a contractor announcer\nOkay well thank you for your service how can I help today\nYes sir I'm I have a rental property addition to my primary home that I also rent out [noise] um but I was just mortified by my property manager that the house came up on the market or the house so um that can kind of do it out the uh\nThere was an inquiry if someone actually wanted to buy the house and now my question was whether I should just sell the house or continue renting it out\nOr is the house or Senate how Paso Texas\nWhere's your home it's southern Arizona\nOkay so when you finish contracting in Afghanistan and you live in southern Arizona if you did not on a rental property in El Paso Texas would you go by one\n\nOf what I go by another property if I\nDidn't have the opportunity you know I was in your lead in southern Arizona and you did not have any rental property and you got it ready to buy a rental property I suspect you by southern Arizona NATO ...\nAbsolutely yeah because you'd probably have this house left over from being stationed there right\n[noise] um yeah well I bought the house right out I was a right after I got done being stationed in Fort Bliss a I bought a home there then um I moved I ah 'cause it was it was a good deal together they're down VA loan so I took advantage of it which is stupid in hindsight\nYou know I'd sell them but how solid after\nThe reason I Want to sell it is because you wouldn't buy it again\n\nIt's also for the same reasons you wouldn't buy it again you wouldn't keep it by the way you can apply that decision making tool to almost anything if you got a boat sitting in the yard that you never used and you look over there and go you're not never buy another boat then so that one\n'cause you don't use you know for the same reasons you wouldn't buy another one you saw that one and that is true of investments that is true of rental properties true of a lot of stuff if you wouldn't buy it again\nThen don't keep it a cause by keeping it tomorrow you bought it again in a sense so I think you take the offer or get a really sweet offer up their off or whatever but uh

[noise]\n\nAll\nRight and we are back with the reinventing retirements show we're going to reinvent your retirement one strategy at a time we seek to educate and empower on the show [noise]\nWe seek to empower you to take control of your retirement the proper information\nMhm there's so much misinformation out there that causes people to miss windows bumper trinity Chris we tell them every Saturday here's your window of opportunity\nListening give some nugget get empowered and take control you retire but hey before he went to break though we said when we come back we're going to tell you some interesting stories right here about Ronald Reagan we're also going to hit on a little bit of a\nA major strategy is kind of hidden from the everyday average American mhm has been since Nineteen eighty\nOr Chris oh I Want you to talk a little bit about Reagan and one of the strategies he utilized ... before we do that guys on this show we tell you things that we've gotten us featured on Forbes the same strategies we use we're going to tell you on the show\nRight and top five retirement advisor in this country that is what we talk about every Saturday is the same stuff that got us featured\nThat's why this shows the most powerful show on weekend radio what a better time to talk about a great president Ronald Reagan okay doesn't matter where you sit on what's which party line Ronald Reagan was a it was a great man okay and Ronald Reagan\nBelieve it or not most people know this younger generation does it I don't think was an actor before he was president\nOkay wow he's an actor so it was a pretty good actor I knew where he is pretty good he had some swag Disney [laughter]\nSo now Ronald Reagan if you look back over his time frame he only made to movies a year\nTo movies two movies that's it not because he wasn't good at acting we've already said that\nIt ... it had it was something different something more important okay here's the reason why so first of all when he made to when he made a movie he got paid about a hundred thousand dollars which at a time of the highest paid actor yeah yeah so a hundred thousand dollars per movie\nOkay and so he made two uh two hundred thousand dollars now you got to know something first of all you got to know that at this time period\nWhen he was acting that the taxes top tax bracket was Ninety four percent\nNinety four people think when I asked people where do you think taxes are now do you think are lower high most of the time they say low much great majority ... but I said look if we look over history actually we are at historical lows for taxes even though we are mounting\nPiles of debt that is cause for concern look Chris I Know that fact but man it doesn't feel\nLike it every year when I got to cut that right [laughter] yes\nI hear about that you know so here sue here's what Ronald Reagan and he's at a Ninety four percent tax bracket right so what he did and it was once you made over two hundred thousand dollars you're taxed at Ninety four percent so he just didn't make a third movie\nIt it'd be worth less you get six six thousand bucks\nSo taxes causes to miss out on some potentially great movies guys\nSo so the taxes and Ninety and Ninety four percent of the question is can they go back there\nWell I think we've already heard that answer having way yeah I mean look debt if there's anything to make us go back to a higher tax bracket in the future in which we think they absolutely will get its debt\nYou know something's funny Chris is a well not really too funny actually is back then we didn't have Nineteen trillion in debt right\nWhat did you say that top tax bracket was it was Ninety four and back in the seventies it was still\nIn the in the sixties in the eighties beginning of the eighties is is in the fifties so you can see\nIf you've got mounting piles of debt the government is not a business right is the only way it gets incumbents how from us from taxes it's got a service this day where do you think they're going to get it they're going to get it from us\nSo that's one thing that blows my mind is taxes were higher when we last and I mean something's gotta give their\nRight so so taxes are going to go up we got a lot of debt water people to do and retirement tax we're going to go up in the future\nOkay let's say you're in a twenty five percent tax bracket right now okay it hurts but what if it goes up to forty five now you're taking home forty five percent less money now you're taking a forty five percent loss every year in retirement\nThat is crippling sill instead is there a way can we turn the tables and get a forty five percent growth every year by simply not paying taxes well yeah if you don't pay the taxes\nAnd you're getting forty five percent more money in this case in your pocket ... and you're essentially getting so forty five percent more growth but can you can you not pay taxes\nAnd not go to jail if it's tax free income that's not qualified and you don't have to pay on that then yeah okay if it's set up correctly yeah does it set up correctly I got to do is read the whole tax code everybody you'll find it in there\nRight so who wants to do that though let me open up Pandora's box for a second now the ultra wealthy they don't pay any taxes in retirement using the rats strategy you know it was a very well known strategy in the ultra wealthy communities\nYou know of course that bought ran through my mind as soon as you said that high tax bracket 'cause you know who never ends up paying the actual high
