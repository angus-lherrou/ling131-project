F. L. A. N. I. heart radio\nStation\nFor evidence ... Fox News the pressure mounting for answers and the disappearance of journalists Jamal with his show last seen it the Saudi consulate in Istanbul three weeks ago trinkets officials claim he was murdered which the Saudis deny America's top diplomat met with Saudi and Turkish official\nAnd he had the article kind of goes into a couple of things I'm going to touch on but I but I think it just\nReally drives the point home for some of my clients one of my clients I met with today\nIs mid eighties and he just sold his business to family just a five years ago maybe at age eighty and\nWe had many a conversation over the years about\nWell the fact that he doesn't play golf than what else what do you do and he enjoys what he does so you know retirement um that our society has placed on people as kind of artificial and so at the article kind of highlight it a couple of things one I found I found the stat interesting it was chancellor Bismarck from Germany\nSigned a law years ago implementing a law implementing compulsory retirement and it was the first example of modern retirement combined with the Social Security system and at the time the mandatory retirement age was Seventy and yet the average life expectancy was forty six and yeah what year was that Eighteen eighty five Eighteen\nEighty five and the retirement age back then was Seventy yeah which is even higher than what it usually is now\nBut I Would be I Would be dead now according to this my life expect the force died [laughter] so you know that's great so but you know here we are a hundred Roger not that later [laughter]\nI mean what would you be doing right now just thrown up at night and I said I I I Know that's not a hundred and thirty three years later and ah you know how many of you feel like you're living in industrial age life\nYou know and I get most of us don't\nAnd so the article and I thought this was interesting it's\nJust how mandatory compulsory retirement makes little sense now and and you know you just need to focus on what brings you happiness and the the\nArticle also talked about a British study that showed workers suffer us thirty percent short term memory loss within the first year retirement and then another study from Gail showed that working an extra year instead of retiring may increased life expectancy by as much as a lemon present\nYou know I could I could see why that that is is because when you were tired of not using those parts of your brain as much you're not using your memory as much that you would use in the job because you're retired or not doing the same things so I I'm definitely in the brain is kind of like a muscle where you have to use it to keep in shape\nAnd I I was actually talking to someone not too long ago who was saying the same thing he said he was afraid to retire because friends of his who have retired he is notice they're not as sharp mentally as they used to be\nYeah a lot of people uh equate retire with dying and do yeah why retire if you think that you're going to just die so I I I understand that that the blueprint that he lays out in this article is talking about a quote ethic retirement\nEat the icy and actually the sea\nChallenge so\nWhat you said you know challenging yourself in in all different capacity so that you prevent dementia Alzheimer's all that good stuff physical challenges are also important because challenging one by one spotty helps to stimulate the brain and I guess there are ways to do that\nIn retirement as well but for some people like the your client that you were talking about earlier they love their job they loved their business he loved his business yeah and so why why stop if you don't get\n... especially with this this company um you know it was clients service and so\nYou you you missed that client interaction and so he still I mean when we met today it was in his office because he you know continues to like interacting with clients that if he just up in up retired then you wouldn't have that\nSocial network yeah I've heard that one of the keys to happiness is interacting with other people yeah so um but but one of the quotes in here I really like because I I think it's so true it's when you when you wake up with curiosity everyday it's impossible to be old\nOh you know always learning always challenging yourself I think that's so true my uncle who is\nLet's say Seventy six Seventy seven now I think he retired after working for all his life at Georgia Tech and can still continue to interact with tech students alumni and he gets up at five AM plays the piano\nAnd speaks five languages and he continues to just challenge himself and learn show off yeah he's a\nHe's a rainy a well you know are achiever being at Georgia Tech he could audit language classes\nFor free so then he could learn Russian and oh okay I'll go with study abroad programs and and go to Russia so he had you know kind of some advantages over over us by makes me feel like an under achiever makes me feel like and I was up at five AM to play the piano I mean yeah\nYeah it's it's impressive but it just basically speaks to what this article a emphasizes and that's\nThe see in ethic engagement is the e purpose and integration and and purposes you know\nHaving a lots of money for retirement doesn't necessarily gives you purpose and that's an important part of one's retirement is continued to yes challenger ... south and then find purpose in what you do whether it's helping others or spending time with family\nYeah and this does not mean that you should plan for retirement Asians and say oh well I'm going to uh I'm never going to retire so I don't need a four one K. or something or no because sometimes health reasons force you to retire other times uh your your company that you work for forces you to retire so right\nAnd I and I think the um the the important thing is is\nKnow how we're going to spend our time and how we're going to pay for that so the first question needs to be how you're going to spend your time and retirement and then\nSpending money\nIs a reflection of how one spend their time ah writes ah we're going to take a quick

word before and it comes to investing\nMy ah I've heard it in passing but I'm definitely not an expert on that I think I've heard like in a commercial or something but never really understood what it actually meant\nPairing up yes only starkly we you know investments in your portfolio would be comprised up typically stocks bonds cash you know and then you know this insurance product feature became available but those historically played a big role in pensions because you needed a\nYou needed 'em fixed products that make up a lot of the historic uh pensions but I'm an alternative is a series of investments that can be a number of different things that don't necessarily correlate with the market so a good example of an alternative investment would be a non traded ...\nOr or what or a non traded real estate investment trust okay so thank you for clarifying alright so I had no idea what a ... is essentially ... is wanting to tell you it's a um a pool of money that is put together to than by\nA real estate commercial real estate and it can be used to by various different um real estate property is whether it's a strip mall whether it's a single building whether it's a nursing home or something like that and it's specifically commercial\n... well it it can it doesn't happen to be but it's basically made up of real estate and the money's pulled together then and the requirements of having read is Ninety percent of its income is paid out to a shareholder so\nThey'll package this and it's considered an um an alternative investment because while it's not and then a new using other uh industry term for you it's not non court lady but it's low correlated with the market in other words if the U.S and the five hundred is\nIs is up dramatically or down dramatically it's not necessarily following it's it's\nIt's nine correlated or in this case very low correlation so the stock market volatility doesn't affect it as much\nAnd I'll Try it was so if you're one of these people that is really worried about stock volatility might be good to work at this kind of investment\nSo there are certain sectors now publicly traded ... year to date or down you know upwards of ten percent so publicly traded reach trade like in the stock market and so they're correlated by um non traded reads enable you to potentially get\nDecent ill six seven percent perhaps in some cases that is for and then give you exposure to this sector so if you didn't say have a couple of million dollars to go buy your own property fix it up and rent it out and have rental income\nThat a lot of people don't necessarily have you can take a small amount of money by this thing called a non traded rate get exposure to that sector\nOf real estate whether it's you know strip malls or what not and then take advantage of some of the ... the a feature so for instance in a in a if you if you're buying in what's called a non qualified account with after tax money you buy this read\nA lot of times they have what is called accelerated depreciation taken on a lot of the buildings\nSo your income isn't all fully taxable\nSo for instance if you made a thousand dollars that year in this uh ... maybe\nFive hundred dollars is taxable and five hundred oh OK non taxable so when you always a good thing when you own it like that it has some attributes that a lot of my clients like um if if obviously if it's in a qualified account like an IRA doesn't matter it's fully taxable\nBut um so that's kind of one of the varieties of of alternative investments that how that how that helps your portfolio is basically when you have exposure to and in my example commercial real estate at as the alternative you're able to bring down risk and\nThe form of what is called a standard deviation it brings that down and brings up the overall income on your portfolio so by adding ten Fifteen or twenty percent to your portfolio in a\nA non traded rate or an alternative investment you can bring down risk on the overall portfolio because if the market's going down stock market didn't want to study this won't exactly and yet and yet still increase returns because you can still add some yield from the reach\nInto the portfolio so it's a way of\nBringing risk down adding a diversification and and adding some income\nWhat what might be some of the downfall of it or what what are some\nOf the as yet in I've slowly there's always pros and cons with anything and in which something like that it typically is ill liquid and so if you have say a exposure to in my example a non traded ...\nYou might not be able to take out your money for a couple of years because they want to preserve the integrity of the trust 'cause they're blue and all that money and buy properties other kind of out\nOf money to to buy those property so they can't have everybody redeeming right away so it's ill liquid into a lot of times broker dealers will limit how much of a client's portfolio you can put in that
