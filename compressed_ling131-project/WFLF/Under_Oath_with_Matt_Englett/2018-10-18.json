and just lean you've got to have that guideline everybody does single or married that those boundaries those guard rails and that's what your budget is it tells you what you can spend if you want to get your goals and you have a goal of twenty thousand dollars in one year and so you know it's like Seventeen hundred fifty bucks a month you're going to be paying on his car\nOkay which means you're not going to be doing some of the stuff you're doing now\n[noise]\nBecause you want it because you want the car and you want it paid off true\nYeah I mean the show it's just you you just punch it in the face hard and fast hard and fast and you know I I think you can pay it off in a year and I think you should commit to doing that and then save up your emergency fond of three to six months of expenses and save up your down payment for your house I think you can do it\nHold on I'm going to send you a copy of the book the total money make over it'll walk right through the baby steps of exactly how to do what I'm Talking about I think you can do this if you read that book it'll show you exactly how to not only get out of that not only get your house but also become wealthy okay\nToby is with us in Topeka, Kansas Hi Toby our you\nI'm All right how 'bout yourself\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nHaving a quick question me and my wife are on step to um we plan on being get free within six months or in the ... our\nOur goal is within two years to move now we'll be on step three um and my question is if we come in about five to ten thousand dollar short of our emergency savings fine but yet we sell the house for a pretty good profit\nCareer oh some of the money from that sell the house into the into the emergency farm in order to bring that up to date and then put the rest toward the house or how would you want us to go about doing that\nI'm confused why would you come in short\n[noise] um just because we need to save up for some other things she need a car before we move out of town um and just with the money we be cutting in there and we come up maybe just a little bit short before you want to move but we do need to move [laughter]\nUm\nWell you can do what you want to do I mean you're grown up you're allowed to there's no law on any of this but um yes um what what I Do I think when you buy stuff that's not an emergency before you have an emergency fund you are inviting Murphy to move in your spare bedroom okay I think you're asking for trouble\nWhen I got an emergency fund in place a quarter of an emergency is there was the weirdest thing but as long as I was broke my life looked like a country song\nAnd I think you're asking for it I'm so no I don't think our bond buying her cars on emergency\nAnd so it does not supersede\nYour ah your need for emergency fun now if you want to say three to six months of expenses are emerging coupon and you want to say well we're going to get to this remark and then we're going to do some purchases and we may be put up a little bit more later\nBut we're comfortable with the three months of expenses emergency funds at least until we get her a car or whatever these other things are that you're wanting to do that's fine but I bought her cars on emergency\nShe's not\nShe's got a car\nSo that's how we know we don't usually emergency fund for it mark is in Orlando, Florida hey mark how're you\nDoing good and you better than I deserve what's up\nOkay so my girlfriend and I have been together for about three years or very young and we would like to move on and move forward in our lives and get married good and moving together good\nAh we don't know over financially stable though we we don't want to be smart about it financially ...\nHow old are you Twenty one okay and what do you make\nA about thirty thirty five year [laughter] and what's your career or right now I'm just a warehouse worker okay so what's your plan\nI you know sure I I don't know if we should go and no no it wasn't as your career plan\nOr replace our yard and pretend like some young man who's a sharp young guy who's working in a warehouse or Twenty one just walked into your house or want to marry your daughter\nYeah what would you tell him\nI don't want to know what his dad gummed plan is right Yes sir how are you going to take care of this girl\nI Would love to take care of her but I can\nNo I'm giving you a hard time brother okay if you're if you think about it that way if forces you to think about your long term prospects which is as her dad that's what he'd be looking at right they'd be saying OK guys a sharp young do\nThey not make anything right now he's working in a warehouse but everybody's got really got a really good career path he's got a plan and it's going to work out I mean by the time he's thirty one what are you going to be doing you know so I'm more concerned about that I think you can make it on thirty five does she have a job\nA cheese in school and doing a part time job at a restaurant when she graduated from school chatted about another year and a half years okay and what were her degree being\nAh she's Peter okay and who's paying for her school right now her and her parents okay\nAlright would they continue that and she can complete and be a teacher while you're married\nTo act but hopefully I I think they would go down critical within\nOkay that's good so you could go ahead and get married and you'd have her part-time income and you're thirty five thousand dollar income knowing that in a year Eighteen months she's going to be a teacher and your household incomes going to more than double you'd be making over Seventy ... close to eighty thousand depending on what she's teaching where she's teaching and all that kind of stuff right\nBut with a teaching certificate in Florida she'll she'll make good money\nAnd then you've got better prospects 'cause you're going to start thinking about what you want to be when you're thirty one and start taking the steps to be that so that when you're forty one year also a better one and fifty one year rich one\nThat makes sense okay there\nSo I think you've got the stuff to get married uh but I I'm more concerned about where you're going and where you are today\nTo answer the question of are you ready for marriage and I think you are you're sharp young guy and I'm obviously she's doing she's got a great career track there\nSo you know what I Would want you to answer for your own satisfaction I was poking at you and saying let's pretend it's her dad right but for your own satisfaction\nWhat are you wander wherever you go because let me tell you if you aim at nothing you'll hear that every time you will be thirty one year old warehouse worker\nAnd you don't want her that there's nothing wrong with no shame and being a warehouse worker but you want to be growing and evolving right yeah you want to be something better you I Want you to own the freaking where\nOK okay you know that's how I Would look at it and if you got all that kind of talked through and so forth and then you got a game plan C I my goal was I was going to be rich and real estate when I was just what I wanted to I was dating my wife I was Twenty one I was so broke I couldn't pay attention to the dollar sixteen and my checking account\nI'm driving all on our second date in a modern Carlo that had two hundred

have there's an awesome person so\nWe're talking about some great things happening uh ... bank I Would like to uh get to what we were talking about earlier that we were teasing earlier tell me about this blended rate mortgage\nSo the reason I I wanted to talk about this than I as I usually try and come up with things they talk about based on\nMy experiences out in the mortgage world when the networking world and questions I got especially networking 'cause you really see you know working in the industry deal a lot of people that are already understand the lingo they kind of got the they have a grasp on how how it works\nWhen I go to networking of ads and get questions from people it really opened my eyes to I think misconceptions conceptions that people had so I happen to be a an Orlando young professionals of that I'm On the board on Tuesday which is a great event\nAnd we've been having a groups ah UCF students actually come out and kind of learn but at working is and how it works and I was talking to one of them who recently actually purchase their first home which is great\nOr snow yesterday in college and some that someone that young\nAnd was talking about a different debts and he made the comment we're talking about you know adding solar panels and they said well I'll just refinance it into the loan later on\nAnd it occurred to me that people kind of assumed sometimes with big purchases that you know if they're going to use equity from their home to pay for it that they just are going to have to refinance their home\nVersus looking at all of the options that are out there so a blended rate what it is is looking at the what the rate if you combine instead of refinancing at your entire mortgage out of new rate\nIf you combine your existing first mortgage and you get either a home equity loan on equity credit line\nAnd you figure out what the rate the effective rate that you're getting across both low and that is\nSo for example right now we're seeing interest rates rise so if you purchase your home a few years ago you might have you know a really great interest rate on your your first mortgage though you know mine is that three point nine nine and I bought my house about five or six years ago now jealous [laughter]\nAnd I actually think in the Seventy today who had a three point to which I thought was just as real or you know and all\nWhich is great so when you're looking at you know today the interest rates are conventional is five point one to five so when we're up to five point one to find the national average with five one last three weeks we've gone over five\nSo if you're looking at refinancing you're going to lose that great rate that you had and you're going to refinance this entire day at the high higher interest rate\nVersus if you take out a home equity loan or line a whole equity loans right now for us our second lean possession loan as five point eight seven five so yes it's a higher rate but when you look at the combined\nRate of that second and that first it's actually much lower\nThen if you were to go around and refinance the entire debt that that's kind of what it is important to look at those things before you decide to opt for refinance versus a home equity\nLoan you know if you're concerned about rate fluctuations with a home equity credit line there's great home equity loans worth a fixed rate fixture and pretty much just like your first mortgage except with trust co we pay the closing costs for you the way you're not hang closing costs beer out losing that great right you have on your first\nAnd you still have you know the comfort level of eight term with a principal and interest payment and a fixed interest rate so you're not worried about these rate fluctuations that happened in the market\nSo one of the great easy ways that you can test this out is on is just Google Search bank re dot com has a blended rate calculator", "show_name": "Under Oath with Matt
