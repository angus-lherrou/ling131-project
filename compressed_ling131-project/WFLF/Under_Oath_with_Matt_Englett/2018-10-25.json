I Know you're not gonna like that but I got it I have a\nThousand dollar emergency fund but the Ira hit ... and uh they ... they are going to get that money [noise] um I can save up\nI mean I thought you were out of that oh no no no I'm not out of bed now has paid off their iPhone already five thousand\nIn the last year but now that was torn my student loan that\nActually I have and you didn't pay the IRS before you paid your student loan\nThat just came out and know where that happened I'm getting paid park in the mail from my\nCPA by half a T o F F a marked on right now\nMhm ballot now mhm\nOkay and so you have one thousand dollar saved for emergencies is all\nYeah but I I have I got a credit card and I know you don't like credit card and I don't normally use credit cards but if you're an extra Twenty one line and I can use their credit card and it has a hundred dollars a month\nUsually for one\nCandidate for the auto body repair which is eight hundred dollars yeah yeah\nI ... and I mean that that's so backward from everything you've ever heard me say I'm appalled that you think I Would actually respond positively to that ridiculous statement\nI mean really you just called Dave Ramsey and said I Want to use a credit card on the air\nOkay well I take that back I Know [laughter]\nI mean either way you are going on here no\nI mean you've gotta you've gotta think about an hour a day Ramsey thanks but you need to think about what how do you want to live your life here's why you lost your motivation is you're inconsistent\nYou need to say in your mind and in your heart of hearts and you need to grasp intellectually and spiritually that the shortest path to wealth and generosity and stability in your financial sustainability is to get out of debt and stay out of debt and at that point you're saying I'll never borrow again as part of that\nRegardless of what I Need to have happen now you are in a car accident they do not get an insurance settlement for that\nNow they're saying that there was no you know ... ... a damage to our vehicle and they're saying they don't believe that it um in that crash injured me\nBut I I'm actually had pain before the crash occurred so I'm just paying for myself what my um health insurance\nOkay but I'm Talking about the car wreck that so you did not get any insurance for the damage to your car\nOh yeah I did I got five hundred dollar that tape them I thought\nOh OK\nInstead of putting it on the auto body repair which now you want to do yeah so this repair is very very minor an eight hundred dollar a bump it's not our okay\nSo the eight hundred dollar repair the reason I Want to do it now become a great deal because it's not it damaged that I've been driving around with\nHer a long time the other damage yeah let me stop everything that it was on a few thousand dollar let me stop for\nA number one I'm not going to tell you to borrow money you knew that for your call me right number two and this is not an emergency\nSmelled emergence right there it's not an emergency\nI don't care if it's a great deal slum emergency and you don't have any money you accept what's in your emergency fund now and you've got the IRS breathing down your neck which is a lot bigger deal than a bump on your car\nAnd so no you didn't clear up the Irish and save up the money to fix the car if the guy won't do it in a year from now for eight hundred dollars then when you actually have the money then you just won't be able to do it with him or you just missed that deal but so what\nI'm you know one thing I have learned is that when I Am impulsive\nAnd when I make quick decisions on something based on something I feel like I'm being emotionally drug into it's almost always a bad financial decision and a lot of the things circling around this conversation to have had that feel to them\nAnd so you need to slow down get yourself on a very strict plan and live that plan all the way out regardless of what opportunities or crisis is come into your life anytime there's a problem you just get back on track back on track\nBack on track and when you stabilized that you're going to stabilize not only your money but a whole bunch of other areas of your life but it also felt like a dog ... to tell you where you just been going in circles\nAnd that's what's going on I can hear it I can feel it and talking to you you're going to be All right but that's what you need to do and no we're not going to use a credit card to take advantage\nOf a bargain to fix your car\nNovelty Ira free the better now is not an emergency so we're not using the emergency fund and very clear principles apply them just like a lot of them to everyone else\nBut you get to do it because you're thrown a\nThis is the rams

organization and I wanted to get involved and there's some benefits to the bank to 'em but the truth is probably like a lot of people listening I thought of habitat\nVery in not in a bad way of course but I thought of it is pretty much you know that nice organization that build houses for people the Jimmy Carter used to be involved in\nSo and there's some truth to that but it's just so much more than that and what I really like about it is the way that Catherine and the folks that habitat\nGreater Orlando work with people from the start to the finish in the application process a straight
