down [noise]\nMark is with us in Indianapolis I mark welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThank you for your service sir thank you how can I help\nWell I'm sixty and I have six little properties three that are free and clear and three that small mortgages and I just always assumed that we would probably sell one of the time are basically about now they'll start now and and that would be part of your retirement and a friend of mine said well wait a minute ... ... with the\nUh the reason I thought we needed to sell them I thought that to Social Security at a limit of around fourteen thousand or so that you can make for a year before they uh\nThey like you and he says way that on long held investments I don't know that that applies\nTo upset or not and I think when I think there's just passive income and doesn't apply you need to check that out I agree with them I'm not positive but I wouldn't keep I wouldn't sell a good investment just to change my Social Security stuff\nSocial Security is not that big a part of the equation these properties or two if they're good properties I'd keep them even if it does mess up Social Security\nWhere they're profitable and yeah we've we've been I guess you'd say thinks that's all it but they're not the you know there is bread and butter ran a three bedroom one bath house is\nThat's the best kind I stay rented it was a big market for 'em right\n[noise] yeah yeah but it allows you because I Know you know rich period I mean when you're sixteen fifty five on the same you know what I'm saying you've been through with Reuters and\nIf you don't want for renters that's a different equation but I'm not selling them to get out of Social Security ...\nI may or may not cause they're so scared abroad may be passive income might not come up with Social Security but you might want to sell them anyway if you just don't like being on the runners anymore but overall is real estate investment to carry all the way through retirement if you don't mind mess around with it that's that's a good investment and this is the\n\nOnly towns in the production officer for the day random show\nShow these days either by these\nGuys are going to say

college if you're going to go that route [noise]\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago I Mike how are you\nI'm great Dave it's an honor to speak with you you too sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward they can prepare for retirement and we're using the excess our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our gross take home pay our dilemma is when we have an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that and I ... that we already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from August coloration so when we save the thicker than we're able to have a lot for a mortgage coloration so is it okay to do that or him recommend saving the twenty four\nPercent now they the mandatory amount that you're putting in are you ... are you vested in that is that uh uh you're choosing an investment for that or is a pension\nAt the end and there's no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or\n... okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct correct okay I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly runs state and now we're better than all those guys [laughter] uh yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we Canada's before then that means we need to put it in ten percent\nRight you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension and Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that so a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and just round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage\nA little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it was a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so um\nThat was that's what I Would to back it off a little bit\n... thanks for the call appreciate your joining us this is that Iran to show [noise]\nAll big giant extraordinary things start from ordinary things that may start from changing the ordinary habits in your

and Harper who seven\nAll right good looking family very cool and all the way across the United states here to Nashville through your debt free scream you bet I love it how much will be paid off\nRight about six to nine thousand good for you and how long did that take close to nine months wow that's fast range of income right about a hundred and fifty thousand what are you guys do for a living so I'm In charge of management sales for Wells Fargo\nAnd I'm I'm a full time stay at home mom but during that process I was a um health and fitness\nCoach okay very good and what kind of debt was the sixty nine thousand dollars\nA couple of cars and a little bit of student loan left\nCool did you sell any cars or did you just pay them off\nWe just pay them off in the car got us into the travel okay very cool\nBut nine months ago some kind of a switch flip because men you went all after it you went game own hair this is a pretty serious numbers wild on tell me the story what got you started\nSo probably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car needing right um other one is going out and we decided to baton for ... yeah the emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we wanted probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we did the brand new\nAnd it was in we are just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills even though we can pay it no problem that we just we didn't want to any more um we one we're more excited for the future and that was just going to be in the way for the future so we just we ... intensity near term so ...\nSo how did you end up where in this process to connect with us\nSo it I'm a huge following pod cast a lot of time on the road and always listen to and it's like I said we can do this you know ... we've got this no problem so we started doing that at the same time it always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church ration center and so we uh\nGot that started right about the time we started we got everything in line to start a few in January at our church and\nWe did that and so it was kind of who started it and then as we ... we were learning for the first time was the mentors and now on her second session and loving it\nWhile well thanks for leading the class yeah very cool well there's nothing like leading to it I mean that so that you you couldn't attend and may be kinda slough off right but are not hardly it's very difficult to do that but it's almost impossible to lead it and not be game on\nExactly and I think that just kind of thing for me to it because I Believe in modeling all the various ... if I was going to model what I wanted my children having a future I had the model that myself\nYou know my daughter ritual cruise always says that when you're teaching kids Morris caught them part yes the modeling thing is a big deal they're going to do what you do how many times about open my mouth and one of my parents' voice came out I mean oh my goodness you know that's what happened much happened on this show and you're much [laughter]\nSo\nWell done you guys very well done so when you have someone in your class and\nTheir show up for financial peace and they're not game on because they're scared and they don't think they can do this the the whole passing kicked in yet the belief housing kicked in yet what do you tell them they need to do\nTo be debt free one of the things you need to do if you want to pay off sixty nine thousand dollars and nine months\nWe don't do whatever we did yeah and you start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell there's kind of a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team it can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as long as to if you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nThe main things that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Under Oath with Matt Englett", "city": "Pine Hills",
