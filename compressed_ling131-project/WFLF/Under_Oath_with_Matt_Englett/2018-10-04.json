money at that\nThan babysit when you're out of debt but the house then baby steps three years you return to the one thousand dollar account raise it up to three to six months of expenses and then [noise]\nUh I'm\nPast that you restart your retirement sharp putting Fifteen Percent away for retirement start saving for kids college pay off your house early as baby steps six so the house is way down the list so it it's not even going to come up you're not get into the house right now you know in the money ... ... ... then we bring in this idea of I'm going back to school to be a nurse which is an awesome goal\nOr I'm not only will you be very employable you have the ability to make really good money and um and can really adjust your schedule in crazy ways to really double your income if you want to for short periods of time I mean you've got all kinds of options in nursing that are going to be really good for you and your family [noise] um\nSo are we the return on investment\nThe investment into Austin is a really good investment\nBecause of your field of study you know you're not you're not getting a degree and left handed puppetry here this is actually a good degree and so\nIt's worth every penny or spending on it and a bunch more is what I'm saying so we're for if our goal is to get out of debt so that we can build wealth than the first step of that before we start anything else to say no more new debt\nYou can't get out of debt while you're getting into debt that you can get out of holding out the bottom rights so that means we got a cash flow college so what's college going to cost\nA it's about three thousand dollars a semester semesters\nA it's probably at least three years' worth of school\n... years three years of school so I'm thinking really twelve maybe so you you didn't complete your undergrad already then\nNo I mean I'm I'm a baby and in college I I'm just now starting I mean it is a master one I haven't you know this\nIs okay but you don't have an a or you don't have an undergrad under your belt that you're adding a nursing degree to rye rye okay she got to finish up some undergrad or do some undergrad and then move into the writing so you need a three thousand a semester\nTimes three our our I'm Sorry ... for three years you said is what I'm going to take you and so six thousand dollars a year for three years Eighteen thousand bucks right\nYeah something like that OK okay and what's your household income\nUm it it was about sixty thousand dollars and my wife were having our first baby next well in the beginning of November\nWhat's your household income during the next three years gonna average\nProbably around forty to forty five thousand dollars\nWhoa okay so you're not going to have a lot of cash to finish school and you have how much savings\nOr twelve thousand okay ah I guess\nIn that emergency fund fourteen thousand\nOr your emergency fund is small yeah okay yeah I think your total money make over baby steps are on hold until we get college paid for okay so I'm going to set the twelve thousand over in my college fund and it needs to be Eighteen\nAs my very first gold\nAnd then when it gets to Eighteen ... and we can talk about building the uh you know we talk about taking the emergency phone down to a thousand and start working on the other day that's how much of the dead of you've got not counting your house\nOr the car how much do you do on the car it's about twenty five thousand\nOh lord and you make forty five\nWell at that time we uh we made like I said I made about sixty sixty\nFive dollars an hour if you're going to be making forty five thousand this car does not fit in your goals for the next three years\nOkay mathematical insanity\nI mean look at look at these numbers we got an Eighteen thousand dollar a you know investment into Austin which we've agreed is a really good investment we we've got three thousand dollars to our name we got a forty five thousand our household income\nAnd twenty thousand dollar car no I Need to hear like five thousand dollar cars wanted me to hear\nOkay in the middle of this because cars not your goal right now your goal is to get all this mess cleaned up and get your education and your belt and double your income which is what's gonna happen\nOkay agreed yeah so a car okay\nGet you get you a much much much cheaper car so that you hit these goals because what you're doing is you're paying a price to when you're living like no one else so that later you get to live like no one else\nBut this car as it stands out as you had this have this really logical really smart a whole thing going on until we got to the car and then and we went to stupid land\nIt just it just sticks out it doesn't it doesn't fit in your equation it doesn't even fit in your life is like you all had a you know a really bad impulse one day and you know just went off the ranch or something I don't know but even if you're making sixty five it didn't fit it was ridiculous purchase so it's just way too high\nAnd even if you paid cash for it in all of the middle all of this so it wouldn't have made sense ... tons of time to move that puppy and then let's live our lives because the good news is you'd rather than you want man 'cause your income is going to be eighty\nWhen you're finished with this and you remember pay cash and you know but you can't have these blockers in your way that you're trying to get around this elephant in the room that says car it it seemed when killing you it's killing your plant it's it's it's just it's death\nSo anyway that's what I Would do and I think you guys are really smart and I think you'll do it open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Doug is on Twitter is it normal to continually adjust my budget during the first month\nYes\nAnd it is okay to adjust your budget continually during the first month if\nIt is not because you're out of control being immature and impulse sing if it is instead because you didn't estimate properly\nLike for instance you didn't have enough set aside for food\nAnd it wasn't because you went out to eat every night and you were a jerk it was because you just didn't have enough set aside for food you on that an unrealistic budget for food and you're discovering life looks different than your theory and you adjust that\nBut I have to continually just my budget so that I get to do whatever the slip I Want no that's not a good idea\nOf people do that but that's not a good idea so your budget is to give you a guideline but it takes about three months of doing your budget trial and error adjust to trial experiment trial adjust\nThe ... experiment adjust experiment adjust to get a completely dialed in and the first month you're going to have we always laugh and say you got forty to emergency budget committee meetings but those are to adjust to only the things\nThat you miss estimated or you just forgot and it is something that's real and something that's important it's not like oh we've been on a budget for two days and I'm like really tired of that I Want to go out to eat no that's not what I'm Talking about [noise] [noise]\nNo I just you know and really you know this is really stressful I've been doing it for three hours now though that's not what we're talking about we're talking about you just missed your food budget or you didn't put anything aside for repairs and you think about and then you have a car repair gee I have to stop it adjusts for that and pay for that\nAnd so yeah you gonna continually adjusting for three months here first month the worst second month or next\nMonth and that's how it's going to play out\nTo address or your impulses list\nChild producer of the day brand new show\nOn

[noise] um it was just a good day on Wall street and again it's one of those times and I'm always careful to\nYou take the opportunity to warn people that um [noise] you know one market to this high\nEnd for this long there's a tendency or a negative ability that eventually the market will correct itself and correction can be ten percent Fifteen Percent sometimes [noise]\nUm and uh so it's just one of those times a lot of people who aren't usually in the market to march experienced investors they kinda keep hearing this drip drip drip\nAmazing ... stock closing the market's doing well and they they kinda get antsy and they eventually dumb jump in with money that isn't really in a position to lose it in the short run and you know that sometimes can cost some ... some short term pain so\nI always warn people while it's exciting it's a great time it's always good to invest diversify um but be careful not to invest money that you can't afford to lose tomorrow 'cause as I always say

north SUNY Albany and SUNY Cortland right\nThere exactly right my friend and uh it's always good to uh have various ways of uh of funding retirement and we'd like to talk about that on the show and what are some of your favorite ways of of funding retirement\nWell obviously for those who\nAlmost all of us who aren't fortunate to have a pension the true pension is always the best of course um and a four one K. of courses wonderful thing to it allows you to put in up to twenty four thousand five hundred if you're\nFortunate enough to be over fifty like me but uh for so many people that\nThe investment of choice is probably the IRA and of course that takes two different forms the traditional and there were off\nBut I always kind of get a kick out of that bumper music as you call it\nA million dollars or something I Love to talk about on the show because for most people that's just a a song in a dream and a million dollars is so far away sergeants such a large number but you know everybody has heard of the book\nThe millionaire next door and boy that book is just so true and quite frankly even Dave Ramsey while he doesn't talk about\nGetting a million dollars per se he certainly gives so many ideas that are\nTalked about and the millionaire next door that are really anyone almost anyone could\nHave a million dollars cash if they just you know a budgeted for it and with IRAs I just love to do that example with the IRA use that song to illustrate it\nThat you know without IRAs and you as an annual contribution of up to fifty five hundred dollars it's a sixty five hundred if you're over fifty\nBut you know that's a daunting number for so many people as if it would certainly seemed to be um\nPut away fifty five hundred dollars a year but that's why I break it down into budgeting and trust bank offers a wonderful tool to help people with that and it's called the trust go IRA saver it really all it is an IRA money market with an automatic savings feature\nA and what you do is you pick a dollar now now if you wanted to do the maximum it's simply two hundred and twenty nine dollars for a pay period that will be deducted from\nYou know twenty dollars you might end up with six dollars in fees met fourteen dollars that's a big fear on a percentage basis but if you're but with all point which was a member of a which is really nice uh\nPeople that are
