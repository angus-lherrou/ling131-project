I think over the long run the it'll the federal look I'm as they they acted appropriately with rising uh with raising rates to get it closer to normal and I know that it's going to result in some pull back in the equity market and it makes it frustrating because a lot of bondholders see their um bond\nPrices because there's an inverse relationship as rates go up bond prices go down so you could be in a conservative bond portfolio in his rates go up\nYou're looking at your account statement wondering why went down\nBut um there's ways to deal with that that will talk about next on the show\nOkay

F. L. A. [noise]\nBy Mike [noise]\nWe're halfway through [laughter] indeed are we are now [laughter] now before the break I mention that un held a seminar earlier today and also a Q A session tell us a little bit about that what part of Florida where are you in and what was this all about\nI I did I ah I have a much clients down in a retirement community called solo Vita\nIn point part in it it's a it's kind of on the border of a point see in a ... it's down there but ah\nIt's kind of a an Italian little villa island in all ... by itself that it's kind of an interesting little cool community they've got a couple of guys I Want to live there it's it's nice it's nice\nIt's um it's a you know average size community I guess I've got a bunch of clients down there so I go down there and do some a market update\nType thing you know you call it a seminar you call it kind of a client appreciation market update you know whatever you want to call it but\nUm you know serves um coffee and doughnuts and kind of just take questions on the market and uh you know it's always interesting to me getting feedback from from them or what they think of what's going on with the market and so so often those communities are just um\nHit hard with the insurance salesmen and they're sold a lot of insurance products typically we talked about that yeah so so the the word annuity invariably comes up in conversation is is it good is it bad you know um and I and I've always felt like there\nThere neither good or bad I'm agnostic about the products that are just about that can be used appropriately and sometimes and appropriately but\nOne of the uh I I think the questions they had and and a lot of confusion about those products usually revolves around\nAll of these complex crediting methods they have to to aren't interested in those products and\nYou know a lot of them that are fixed products um at the at the end of the day are tied to the ten year treasury so a lot of times the lower interest rate environment where in although it's growing it's getting higher those rates that are crediting inside those cats are making the more attractive but\nFor a long time here those I haven't been as\nAttractive shall we haven't potentially I don't understand why couldn't earn as much and so\nThere's typically questions about annuities and then I always I'm always interested to see um what the general consensus is it was a a non random sample I can I\nAsk whether they thought it was going to be a blue wave or a red wave and everybody was red wave at your own poll get [laughter] nine statistically valid but it was a GOP country earlier margin of error ah yeah give or take three [laughter]\nAnd uh yeah so um and and we kind of talked about that and I'm always interested that there's\nIn a group like that you have some people that are retired and and look every day at the market what it's doing and others that don't look at it ever and I'm I'm kind of always amazed that you don't look at it at all and then I'm also imagine that those that look at it every day I mean you're retired\nYou know so I mean maybe it's fun for them it probably is I think it is I think and if they've done it for a long time it's kind of a one of the things that they just can't let go of it I mean when\nYou retire Harry what are you going to be like you think you'll just ignore it or you looked at it every day\n[noise] uh let's far off but I have a look at it every day yeah private everyone alone one\nWay or another planet Lancet ... device that I've got you know ended up just give me a thumbs up thumbs down type thing whether I couldn't afford that cup of coffee that day or [laughter] something I'm not sure\nBut you know the thing that they are concerned with the most is you know outliving your money you know low yeah longevity and inflation at the two big risks and so we kinda talked about in general\nYou know in addition to Social Security well where does an annuity makes sense where you could have a guaranteed a new um income from an annuity that might make sense and they come in a lot of different flavors fixed variable immediate all that good stuff but\nThat could make sense for part of their portfolio and especially if they don't have any kind of traditional pension but then also a emphasizing the the need that they have\nTo invest in equities as well\nSo and and as we talked about before pensions are not nearly as popular as they used to this is a lot a lot more people that don't happen to them for the shuttle\nThey don't yeah the pensions are gone um Social Security is going to be there but it's not going to hang out like it used to and people are living longer and so that's why the need for those products in some way shape or form is important because um you know one of the things they had questions about was a\nUm you know the the four types of investing that I'm Dave Ramsey recommends and\nIt's all all equity all all I'm no bond exposure\nAt all and it's all credit oh really out keeping keeping pace with inflation and I think that's great if you're\nTwenty five and you're in a four one K. and those buckets are I think aggressive growth growth international and maybe small mid cap and um that that could work if uh if you just let it sit in there for a long time but if you're imagine you're sixty five\nAnd you're retiring and you you start to withdraw that first dollar and you hit a market like we're hitting now yeah ... that's where I just don't think a hundred percent equity is is that smart but you always want some exposure to equities I'm just not quite as much as you had when you were say twenty five in my opinion\nI think it's important to back up a little bit here because there might be some things that you mention that the average person doesn't really know anything about what exactly does one of these insurance annuity products to how does it work", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Under Oath
