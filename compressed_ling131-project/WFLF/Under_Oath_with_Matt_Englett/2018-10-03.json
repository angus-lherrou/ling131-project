paying your own and so um you know you just call it out and you just have some fun with it laugh about it be sarcastic about whatever your family gift is right\nAnd I'm In some of them are going to be upset but there'll be upset 'cause you don't buy their food then well oh well you know\nAnd as far as friends go do the same thing but if this is a continual thing then we just aren't you know it's not a real friend 'cause a friend that you have to buy the relationship that's called prostitution that's not friend okay and so um you know I don't have to buy my friendships\nMy my friends I've got friends that are wealthier than me and friends that are nowhere near as wealthy as me I'm doesn't matter I might buy dinner but that's my choice not on their expectation\nI'm\nI'm pretty generous about done a lot but I don't I don't think about it but the point my wife is like you really don't need to pay every time I but I I don't I'm not worried about it is but if I ever since somebody being title I'd get all hillbilly in a second you know I'll be like no you're not entitled\nUm and my wife has a little bit more\nUh she has this thing about fairness and so she wants everything to be fair and I'm just trying to explain to her bears what happens at the county fair is not going to happen but but you know you just ... that's okay I mean you talk it through is what I'm saying\nAnd you're going to find occasionally somebody that you're not going to be able to continue in relationship with\nAnd um that could even be family if it's extreme but hopefully it's not something like that that's very hurtful for you but um most of the time it's just like no you know we're paying our sure you pay your split it up\nOr this time we're going to give you a gift and we're going to pay for everything but that's on your option is not a gift if it's entitlement so it's a good question though um and that happens\nMore\nIt probably happens more to people with family than it does with French\nI mean you got a real low class group of friends of all your friends expect you to pick up the tab all the time just goes your debt free I mean you're running with some\nTry to park trash you know I mean really you you you got to think about that I just I ... that really it's more of a family thing for most people um I Will tell you that honestly\nAs weird it is for us um was sharing an eye because we're kind of in the spotlight uh we've had very little boundary issues with family or friends on this we've been really blessed were really fortunate and ah so that's the tip of the hat to both of them\nThat we've had almost no times that we've had to sit down with a friend and go a new\nAnd almost all times with family I mean it's um but our families are you know responsible hardworking people I mean I kind of thing and so it's just that we're blessed in that way because I Know people that you know they get their record\nDeal when all of a sudden some cousin they didn't even know comes out of the woodwork you know and uh I've not had that I Know I've got some cousins that I don't hardly know but none of 'em came out of the woodwork they stayed in the woods\nGood for them so I'm not looking for money away I wouldn't mind seeing some of them but I mean don't come looking for money laundering even though you are so um it it's something everybody deals with I think

Fox News the Senate Republican leader hoping to make good on his promise to hold a confirmation villain I'm Brett Kavanaugh this week it's not clear if he has the votes doctor you can't help and lime on Capitol Hill\nFrom Germany signed a law ... years ago implementing a law implemented compulsory retirement and it was the first example of modern retirement combined with the Social Security system and at the time the mandatory retirement age was Seventy\nAnd yet the average life expectancy was forty six in yeah what year was that Eighteen eighty\nEighteen eighty five and the retirement age back then was Sunday yeah which is\nIs even higher than what it usually is now\nBut I Would be I Would be dead now according to this my life expectancy for died [laughter] so you know that's great so but you know here we are a hundred ... [laughter] I mean what would you be doing right now otherwise just throwing it up and ... and I said I I I yeah that's nice hundred thirty three years later\nAnd uh you know how many of you feel like you're living in industrial age life you know and I think most of us don't and so the article and I thought this was interesting it's\nJust how mandatory compulsory retirement makes little sense now and and you know you just need to focus on what brings you happiness and the the article also talked about a British study that showed workers suffer a thirty percent short term memory loss within the first year retirement\nAnd then another study from Yale showed that working an extra year instead of retiring may increased life expectancy by as much as ...\nPercent you know I could I could see why that that is is because when you retire not using those parts of your brain as much you're not using your memory as much but you would use in the job because you're retired or not doing the same things so I ... in the brain is kind of like a muscle where you have to use it to keep in shape\nAnd I I was actually talking to someone not too long ago who was saying the same thing he said he is afraid to retire because friends of his who have retired he's notice they're not as sharp mentally as they used to be\nYeah a lot of people uh equate retire with dying and do yeah why retire if you think that you're going to just die so I I I understand that that the blueprint that he lays out in this article is talking about a quote epic retirement\nEat the icy and actually the sea is challenge\nSo just what you said you know challenging yourself and and all different capacity so that you prevent dementia all signers all that good stuff physical challenges are also important because challenging one by one body helps to stimulate the brain and I guess there are ways to do that in a retirement as well but for some people like the your point that you were talking about earlier\nThey loved their job they loved their business you what his business yeah and so why why stop if you don't get\nIt ... this this company um you know it was ... service and so\nYou you you missed that client interaction and so he still I mean when we met today it was in his office because he you know continues to like interacting with clients that if he just up in up retired then you wouldn't have that\nSocial network yeah I've heard that one of the keys to happiness is interacting with other people yeah so um but but one of the quotes in here I really like because I think it's so true it's when you when you wake up with curiosity everyday it's impossible to be old\nOh you know always\nLearning always challenging yourself I think that's so true my uncle who is let's say Seventy six Seventy seven now I think he retired after working for all his life at Georgia Tech and can still continue to interact with tech students alumni and he\nGets up at five AM plays the piano\nAnd speaks five languages and it continues to just challenge himself and learn show off yeah he's a brat [laughter]\nHe's or any uh well you know are achiever being at Georgia Tech he could audit language classes for free so then he could learn Russian and oh okay I'll go with study abroad program right and and go to Russia\nSo he had you know kind of some advantages over over us by makes me feel like an under achiever makes me feel like an I ... up at five AM to play the piano I mean yeah\nYeah it's it's impressive but it just basically speaks to what this article a emphasizes and that's\nThe see in ethic engagement is the e purpose and integration and and purposes\nYou know having lots of money for retirement doesn't necessarily give you a purpose and that's an important part of one's retirement is continued to yes challenger ... self and then find purpose in what you do whether it's helping others or spending time with family\nYeah and this does not mean that you shouldn't plan for retirement shouldn't just say oh well I'm going to uh I'm never going to retire so I don't need a four one K. or something or no because sometimes health reasons force you to retire other times uh your your company that you work for forces you to retire so right\nAnd I and I think the um the the important thing is is you know how we're going to spend our time and how we're going to pay for that so the first question needs to be how you're going to spend your time and retirement and then\nSpending money is a reflection of how one spend their time All right so we're going to take a quick break here you're listening to the smart money show with H.

going for me which is nice [laughter] Caddyshack reference therefore you Mike anyways\nWe talked about um alternatives in your portfolio have you heard of alternatives that word before and it comes to investing my\nUh I've heard it in passing but I'm definitely not an expert on that I think I've heard of like in a commercial or something but never really understood what it actually meant\nTearing up yes only starkly we you know investments in your portfolio would be comprised up typically stocks bonds cash\nYou know and then you know this insurance product feature became available but those historically played a big role in pensions because you needed a\nYou needed 'em fixed products that make up a lot of the historic uh pensions but I'm an alternative is a series of investments that can be a number of different things that don't necessarily correlate with the market so a good example of an alternative investment would be a non traded\n... or ... or what or\nNon traded real estate investment trust ... so thank you for clarifying alright so I had no idea you know what ... is essentially ... is wanting to tell you it's a um a pool of money that\nIs put together to than by\nA real estate commercial real estate and it can be used by various different um real estate property is whether it's a strip mall whether it's a single building whether it's a nursing home or something like that but I Do and it specifically commercial\n... well it it can it doesn't have to be but it's basically made up of real estate and the money's pulled together then and the requirements of having a ... is Ninety percent of its income is paid out to a shareholder so\nThey'll package this and it's considered an um an alternative investment because while it's not going to new using other uh industry term for you it's not non correlate it but it's low correlated with the market in other words if the U.S and the five hundred is\nIs is up dramatically or down dramatically it's not necessarily following it's it's\nIt's non correlated or in this case very low correlation so the stock market volatility doesn't affect it as much and I'll Try\nIt so if you're one of these people that is really worried about stock volatility might be good to look at this kind of investment\nYeah so there are certain sectors now publicly traded ... year to date or down you know upwards of ten percent so publicly traded reads\nTrade like in the stock market and so they're correlated but I'm non traded rates enable you to potentially get decent meal six seven percent perhaps in some cases that is for and then give you exposure to this sector so if you didn't say have\nA couple of million dollars to go buy your own property fix it up and rent it out and have rental income\nThat a lot of people don't necessarily have you can take a small amount of money by this thing called a non traded rate get exposure to that sector\nOf real estate whether it's you know strip malls or what not and then take advantage of some of the ... the uh features so for instance in a in a if you if you're buying in what's called a non qualified account with after tax money you buy this read a lot of times they have\nWhat is called accelerated depreciation taken out a lot of the buildings\nSo your income isn't all fully taxable so for instance if you made a thousand dollars that year in this uh non traded ...\nMaybe five hundred dollars is taxable and five hundred oh OK non taxable so when you well know is a good thing when you own it like that it has some attributes that a lot of my clients like um if if obviously if it's in a qualified account like an IRA doesn't matter it's fully taxable\nBut um so that's kind of one of the varieties of of alternative investments and how that how that helps your portfolio is basically when you have exposure to in in my example commercial real estate at as the alternative\nYou're able to bring down risk in the form of what is called standard deviation it brings that down and brings up the overall income on your portfolio so by adding ten Fifteen or twenty percent\nTo your portfolio in a a non traded rate on alternative investment you can bring down risk on the overall portfolio because if the market's going down stock market you know on a ... well exactly\nAnd yet and yet still increase returns because you can still add some yield from the rates into the portfolio so it's a way of bringing risk down adding a diversification and and adding some income\nWhat what might be some of the downfall of it or what what are some as yet in I've slowly there's always pros and cons with anything and and with something like that it typically is ill liquid and so if you have say a exposure to in my example a non traded ...\nYou might not be able to take out your money for a couple of years because they want to preserve the integrity of the trust because their pool and all that money by property so they're kind of out of\nMoney to to buy those property so they can't have everybody redeeming right away so it's ill liquid into a lotta times broker dealers will limit how much of a client's portfolio you can put in that typically it's\nTwenty percent is the maximum of our clients and festival assets that could go into on an alternative investment because you can't liquidate in the early years and typically after three years there are a hundred percent liquid but um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Under Oath with Matt Englett", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "03"}
