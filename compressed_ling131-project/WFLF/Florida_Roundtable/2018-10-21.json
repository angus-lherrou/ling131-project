Orlando news radio Ninety three point one W. F. L. A. N. I. heart radio\nNow most of them are not proposed by this commission and he's calling to abolish their proposed to by other means every year\nBut so many times and I read through the ... amendments on before the constitution\nI think to myself aren't these things that should be left up to the legislature we're not a direct democracy in my opinion it is not the job before the voters to vote on specific things\nLike what we see in these amendments this year that's why we are representative for public even Florida is where we vote representatives to take care of the things I mean a lot of these amendments in general do get voted for him passed\nOn the ballot and then it'll show up on the ballot next time to get rid of the previous amendment because the for the legislature realizes they can't do it\nIt's just kind of mess that just really doesn't belong on the Ford about in my opinion but this year it's especially bad because of what the CRC is doing I mean just look at one of the amendments this the CRC is proposing and that will show up on your ballot this year\nThis is amendment nine it says the water's mostly the water's most immediately adjacent to for this coastline are in state control then become federal jurisdiction further offshore\nThis a member pertains just to state controlled water prohibiting oil and gas drilling for exploration or extraction in offshore areas so basically amendment mind the first part of the ... has a banning on drilling for oil or natural gas or other things off of Florida's coast\nOkay a lot of you might support that but there's a second part to this amendment that you probably should know about the second part of the amendment prohibits the indoor use of e cigarettes and vaping devices how those two related\nHow can you have in the same amendment a ban on offshore drilling and then a ban on e cigarettes smoking them inside the obviously not related at all\nBut this is just one example of what the CRC put on a Ford about this year proposed amendments\nIt's ridiculous obviously there was something wrong with the process of the CRC at how all of this work if these are the kind of a man that you're going to be voting on that's just one example there are other examples of these amendments be bundled up together and they said the reason they did this would make it easier\nSeems like it's going to make it even more confusing and I have a feeling I'm going to be waiting in line for a while while I'm voting\nBecause frankly everyone's going to be confused going through all these amendments the winds are going to be pretty long in Florida\nIt seems like so we're going to be talking with the gym challenger from ... to save my constitution coalition he's very passionate about this subject as well he has a lot of interesting things to say on that matters or we're going to get to that next year or listening to the Fort around tables services for to talk of an entertainment network\nThe interview coming up in a

all joining us today and today I Am talking with a very special deaths\nWho is with the theme my constitution coalition\nHe he's a member of that coalition his name is Jim\nCalendar and he's going to tell us a little bit about the saved my constitution coalition which is against the constitution were vision\nCommission which proposes amendments on the ballot every Twenty years so Jemma welcome to the show today but it's like what a day or so before we get into the details of the amendment and the details of the constitution revision commission I wanted to give you an opportunity to\nAh see a little bit about yourself and also how you got involved personally with the save my constitution coalition\nSure uh my I'm a former legislator from\nThe sugar Florida area [noise] um I was a member of the four house representatives and um he'll be in a former member of always interested in what's going on politically around the state and a ... she\nUh engage a last year early last year you know as kind of watched\nAnd that process a with a lot of interest and saw a lot of things that were very concerning um but kinda figured while the end of the day they're probably going to\nGo ahead and put or some some proposals that are are meaningful um but in that process you know I've been engaging in talking with my fellow former legislative friends and ask them like hey you know if you've been watching this process and I may as well I've been watching and\nA half of the St faucet I did and uh again just very disappointed with the performance of Shearer see\nA and the way they were I guess I Would say behaving and uh so we just kind of started talking and spreading the word of mouth for her\nLungs former legislators and uh we came to that a decision to go ahead and form a coalition and a two to speak up against the work of the CRC\nUm you know we kind of feel as former legislators you know we still have a we feel and duty and obligation to get engaged\nAnd uh we feel it's only fair we try to inform\nA Ford is voters of what's going on and encourage them to vote no on on these are proposed amendments\nTalk a little bit about hum the constitution commission as you mentioned it's ... proposes ballots a amendments on the floor and about ... would be for the for the constitution\nTalk a little bit about what the exact we do the history behind that and then why your organization or coalition has a problem with it\n[noise] okay um well it and just to you know the people twisting our tongues ... I guess we'll just call it the CRC the constitution rubbish commission\nUm you know so they need every Twenty years\nUm we had a a new I guess I feel quote new constitution was an act and back in Nineteen sixty eight a and in that new constitution they created\nA the CRC which meets every Twenty years or to basically review our constitution and that propose\nAny changes but you know to to be clear on that you know the language in the for the constitution\nThat directs the CRC ... you know and I'll quote it says ah the sheriff she has to make its proposal if any of a revision to this constitution and\nUm and we think that the ah the currents there she has gone way beyond that call of duty\nI'm you know very simply the original intent of the CRC was to review our constitution wore\nA minor corrections I guess I Would say I'm such as uh reducing the size and scope\nOf the document um you know cleaning up any arcane are outdated language or or you know maybe streamline the documents for efficiency and clarity\nUm so\nSo yes we're we're we're saying vote no on all of them of the process was flawed as a result of proposed amendments are are flawed\nAh they're politically charged and motivated um and and the voters are are merely ponds are in this political game of the CRC\nAnd a as a result you know we just don't think that's fair for voters to be you know kind of pulled into that and so we're encouraging hauled voters to reject\nAll those amendments are six or ... you know there may be\nSarin and don't mean to cut you off but we are just short on time we're going to get more into it in a sex hold that thought were talking to Jim challenger who is with the the my constitution coalition this is Michael ... with the foreigner round table and we will be right back well\nAre you worried about your mom or dad living alone in their house by some land and\nListen I Know how difficult it is to find your care for someone you love\nThat play I recommend to pre service called my friend ... mayor the nation's largest senior letting referrals serving\nPlate from on today to receive free information on senior living communities in your area goal in place for mom and one eight hundred seven and find a zero for three five six\nTo nine offers free one on one night from local advisors andme personalized land and senior many communities you can visit\nQuestions about senior care for your mom or dad there's a place for answers place for mom\nCall the police were mom and the next ten minutes to get your free book on financing senior care as well as free information on senior living communities in your area call one eight hundred seven zero for three five six that's one eight hundred seven to bind zero for three five six\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute a maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area make silver sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trained to mile dot com or call eight eight eight Marines\n\nThis is another edition of the Ford around people here on for to talk of an entertainment networks I Am Michael yeah the filling in for Reagan\nSmith who was out sick this week he should be back next week\nAnd this week I'm Talking with Jim ... who was went to save my constitution coalition said my constitution coalition if an organization that is specifically against the the R C which is for this constitution reveals in\nCommission and they're actually advocating to vote no on all the amendments propose to buy the CRC and Jim challenger a joins me right now\nSo Jim ... before the break I was talking with you and I asked you specifically what should voters do when they see these amendments on the ballot specifically by the CRC and you were pointing out that you actually think they should just vote no on all of those amendments and the purpose\nOf why do you think why are you calling for them to vote no on all them\nSure like you know essentially the CRC is and I'm just going to say this and I ... I don't like the body of lobbyists ... with no accountability no checks and balances are in this group is attempting to amend the constitution was politically charged proposals\nThat for most part don't even belong or constitution and really ought to be handled through the legislative process uh this group a conductor services under the heavy influence a special interest groups\nUm and as a result but put forth a multitude of confusing or we say intentionally misleading and really a suspiciously bottle that much\nOr in an attempt to gain our support our votes or for their hidden agenda so really because of this\nWhat we call mischief of the city or see again is former legislators who you know feel\nA sense of duty and obligation to get involved and you know try to you know if we can educate the people Florida ah of what's going on you know fairly warned them above you know with the sheriff's he is up to\nAnd encourage them to vote no on all share seeing them as a sixth through Thirteen you know we don't we cannot one cannot really reasonably nor respectfully look at the ... proposal simply because of the\nUh I'll say simple way that it was conceived I'm so really no matter how good some of these may sound there's a hidden objective behind them\nAnd we shouldn't be subject to these political games and as a result we're we're saying boating on all\nYeah it sounds like what you're saying there is that you're basically telling people even if you agree with some of the wording in these amendments the process is so crooked that they should vote no anyway\nYeah because we really don't know we're getting I mean we we reached the end you know maybe it sounds good\nBut you know what's the real intention of that I'm at and you know it's hard to you know figure it out all wow\nA walk through the legislative process you know trust me you know through that through that those to the base of deliberation ... comes out but in this process or their Shearer see you know basically they have the dog and pony show when people got to stand before the group and\nYou know make their their presentation but you know after that meeting everybody was behind closed doors and came up with all these proposals that we see are seriously flawed 'em and you know\nLike if you ... and most voters won't do this you know you go to get your ballot you look at the summary and they go off as good idea or just a bad idea but you know if you looked at all the real language behind all the stuff you'd be probably not only interested but\nThey be surprised to find that you know there was a one or two sons summary but they're going to be you know ten Fifteen twenty pages of legal leaves behind each one of these I'm\nVery true yeah if you go to the court and partly to stay on their website you know they have the proposed\nConstitutional amendments and you can see the full tux and ah it's just not one or two cents as long as there's many many pages long um but again you know most voters will take time to look at all that stuff and because of that and you know the sheriff see they they know that\nUm they feel they can kind of pull fast for over the voters and uh and so we should we should not be caught you know in this game so we're encouraging a no vote on all their proposed amendments\nWow I just I mean to pointing at the amendment some of the wording in the summaries that are going to be on the ballot are confusing in\nInto the cell that can only imagine how confusing they will be to look at the whole twenty page and it's like you said behind the amendment on all the legal ease on my arm already thinking that people are going to be standing in line for a long time because there are many wing for people reading through all these amendments\nYou know what's really interesting is uh one of the ... members was asked\nYou know about the bumbling water they bundle all these ideas and really unrelated ideas and ... some mindless and the answer was well to make it easy for voters to save time I'm a I don't think that makes it easy for voted I think it may so extremely hard\nOr something and then to be out with\nThese multiple issues um and so we're kind of saying you know well was make it real easy unless honestly make really easy and so what we're saying our group\nIs go to all those amendments six through Thirteen voting on all of them and that's easy\nYou know you talk about bundling so many amendments I'm just looking over some of the amendments right now amendments six the first part of that says expand the scope of victims rights under before the constitution\nAnd then the second part of it says raise the mandatory retirement age for the judges including Supreme Court justices from Seventy Seventy five and I can imagine the average voter will read that anyone will read that and will say well what does one have to do with the other they're totally not related to how can I vote for this\n[laughter] you know and I'm like I'll give you another example unlimited number of ten which has very and and I are in that particular environment or concert controversial issue that deals with how he's um but you know they put in there\nUm you know creating a department of Veterans Affairs and the constitutional law we already have this department\nI'm One of our coalition members is former executive director and a former veteran um this is totally unnecessary but there are plenty of them there to create a sense of okay well this this sounds good but they're basically exploiting\nYou know our veterans to to gain a vote 'em in that same amendment they are ... are requiring ... before department law enforcement to have an office of of tear on counterterrorism", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Florida Roundtable",
