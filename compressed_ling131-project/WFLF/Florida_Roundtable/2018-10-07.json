{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "Right okay so if you came a\nYou know you'd be at about a five year plan if you were a little under two hundred thousand right thirty six thousand divided into two hundred thousand right rather than it would be um six years roughly if you do the pool two hundred a little over two hundred but\nSomewhere between one fifty and two hundred you could do it and about five years not counting getting raises and not counting saving even more that's the most I Would want to go\nOkay I don't want to wait much more than five years or to buy and I don't want to wait much more than five years out of your retirement system\nSo I mean whatever you're going to do I would try to do it in under that um but then so the point is you're sitting with a paid for property no payment in the world at that point right and you're making really good money and you're thirty something thirty one thirty two years old\nRight and so can you can you become a multi millionaire doing that absolutely you can\nOkay is that what you just pay yourself a house payment from age thirty page sixty you'd be a multi millionaire\nRight okay okay great so we'll we'll\nGo ahead and went through that maybe if we did the might be a guy to do maybe I tend to retirement and say maybe a little bit less\nIt's up to you if you're going to go longer than five years I'm starting to get pretty nervous about it okay okay if you're going to be under five years and you want to do zero in your case you're still going to be very young and without a house payment when you pay cash for this house\nRight thirty one years old is very young was zero house payment you and you got the income for the rest of your life to build wealth with I mean if you will just keep paying attention again by yourself or house payment plus or minus a little you can be a multi millionaire\nOkay great thank you don't mind they create your eyes\nVery well done good job you're thinking Deborah's whether it's in Tampa, Florida Hi Deborah how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call I'm\nSure what's up\nWell I'm I Am working on that to a a financial peace university and I have paid off forty thousand dollars in twelve month good for you and\nYes and I'm Down to just one dead which is a hospital bill that we've been paying for many years now ... ah with very small payments mhm and uh it's been offended collection and we've been looking at our credit report just making sure that all these deaths have fallen off\nAnd um it well it turns out that hospital bill has fallen off of our credit report and because of that my husband has been a\n... with the idea of just not adding that to the debt now ball and just continuing that men on payment or even not paying it at all and that scares me to death but I wanted to know from you what are the implications of doing something like that\nWhere there's two problems whether\nOne is you actually owed them money so you should pay it\nYes that's one problem the second problem is is that it's gonna come back to ... just 'cause they're not reporting it today doesn't mean they're not going to take an active outstanding account and report it at any time\nAnd so right what happened what's happened is is the collection a agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with is just not downloaded their files to credit bureau but they could do that at any time\nAnd then you've got a bad mark not just to mark what a bad mark 'cause this is a defaulted this is a bad bill\nIt's not a current bill because they didn't offer you payments at the start they only offered you payments because you couldn't pay them right and you owe them the money and so ah how much is the bill\nI it's less than seven thousand at that point okay what I Would do is continue to pay them I Would continue to\nPay them the minimum wage and I would build up a you know a lump sum of three or four thousand and offer them that a settlement and let's get it settled in full and get it in writing\nOkay but in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees and late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore it because it's currently not showing up on your credit\nIs on was because it will end up showing up again and on top of that you will the bill so clear the bill move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nA lot of thank you for taking my phone call sure what I have I have a question [laughter] I Am Seventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment options from attack sheltered anybody [noise]\nUh and I wanted to know what would be something like the best option I when I took a annuity out my thinking was to take a lifetime monthly benefit and so then when I went to I ask about it they gave me several other options [noise]\nUm because of the other options for ... and ... monthly income which should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no\nNeither one way you take another fixed and the lady with a nursing care home policy no or another option but to take a tenure certain with which would be lower premiums and on your lap and then it went race could be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above um and uh so uh [laughter] the anytime you started weaving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra fees and garages\nNotice I didn't even ask but I'm not I didn't even ask what the numbers are when that's on the insurance world we call that his bundling\nAnd there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance your homeowner's insurance together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of this stuff is gimmicky gotcha garbage and so that I smelled harassed and you have a good you have a good nose on your kid out [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you there's I Would tell you the check with an investment advisor like one of the smart buster pros and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling an income off of that\nI think you'll end up with more money alive and dead doing that then you will\nMessing with us from New Jersey because the other thing that you can be sure of with an insurance company or an investment firm anytime they give you a guarantee that means they're giving you less than you could have made if you didn't have a guarantee\nOkay oh and so I you know it's like with your home you didn't get a guarantee when you bought your home\nNo guarantee it's going to go up in value we're down in value either one no no insurance backing your home no nope FDIC insurance on the value of your home and yet you felt really comfortable taking that quote unquote risk why because well we can look at their track record of homes and be very comfortable with them\nAnd if I could find a mutual fund that I was just comfortable with\nIts track record it's volatility as I was with your home at Seventy years old\nSomething like a growth in income fonder balance fund that kind of a thing that's probably where I'm putting my money if I'm you at Seventy um and it wouldn't be anywhere near an insurance company so I'll be rolling this whole thing over into something else\nChecked smart faster at day Ramsey dot com put in your intro it'll drop down a list of the smart Mr

G A us the dot com if you want to read economic stuff um most of my readers and listeners suggests that hearing is better easier\nSo are the three CDs that I mentioned are are different ways of the Federal Reserve which we didn't we haven't talked about yet but it's a very critical component of this economy\nUh the definition of money what the heck is a dollar if we don't know that it's hard to could just can't do anything else and then the third protecting your wealth\nThese are three most popular CDs that part of the package of books that I sell but I'll give them free to Florida roundtable listeners if you already mentioned that you heard it either a break and ... my ... my ... just for the roundtable that'll work\nMentioned that and we'll send them to get absolutely free but you just call or eight hundred number eight hundred\nFour six eight to fix for six or go on line if that's your thing to a Andy Garcia Ga us the dot com\nAnd in in let's talk about the Federal Reserve than the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates very slowly um to kind of make sure we don't have inflation even though we really haven't had a problem with inflation so far what do you think about the Federal Reserve doing this now\nWell there are three components to inflation right and the first one is an increase in the broad money supply\nNow that is one thing President Obama gave us our I think we have some twenty trillion dollars in various forms to the economy when a President Obama was in office so rather than fix any problems that exist let's just create more money\nAnd throw it at the problem and and do you have to think of that in terms of you ordered a pizza and there's more people than there are slices so you make the slices smaller people aren't as full perhaps but at least everybody gets a slice\nAnd that and that's the way that they've handled the economic crisis up until now so we increase the broad money's get we didn't have enough jobs for the folks that were working so that's really the second part of the equation what they call resource slack\nA we were getting killed and trade department people were foreign companies and countries were dumping they're good they're undercutting American manufacturers in American labor and making it virtually impossible to have wages rising\nAnd keeping American manufacturers American business on the hedge all the time that this of course is being take it up as we've all heard or should have hurt unemployment is at a record low and factories are humming along and and companies are building new factories so this\nI mean seven hundred billion dollars just in the steel industry alone on the back of his uh tariffs on foreign imported steel so these policies have taken out the resource slack\nFactories running at full speed and people are fully employed so that means they drawn to get a higher wage time to build another factory right that resource lack of it in the third and I think one that\nI Can't even believe the statistics I look at monetary velocity Americans have been so frightened by the crisis of two thousand eight\nBut they have not kept their moving it's just when President Obama was in office for example as fast as Americans would earn a dollar\nThey would take it out of circulation and put it away they would not spend\nAnd so monetary velocity fell to eight fifty year low\nLike one point two five times a dollar would turn it over and it's all based on consumer confidence if you don't think the future's bright\nAnd you're going to squirrels your money away and that's what folks dead\nIn fact during the period the President Obama was president in our national savings in total or you measure that and money with a zero maturity this is the federal\nReserve measurement money that we put in the bank and have no plans to invest no plans to spend went from seven trillion dollars in two thousand seven to nearly Fifteen trillion dollars when President Trump took office so it doubled\nAnd that money not being working and moving of course so there's no inflation when that happens\nOf course all is turned on its head or when you fix the three components of inflation venue you're going to see in place and so I think the Federal Reserve is moving in the correct direction or by raising rates so to try to\nFend off some of the speculative activity companies buying their own stock with borrowed money speculators buying their of buying stocks and bonds with borrowed money\nOf this of course is slowly coming to an end as the Federal Reserve drives these folks out of the market with higher interest rates and additionally America's savers which there's a bunch of you in Florida who are retired and have a fixed amount of money\nIt's very hard to live on a two percent or one percent return we need to get back to where what we call a ... mean\nIn terms of interest rates if you look at it over forty years or fifty years\nYou should be hurting for five maybe six percent on your on your savings so these two factors combined I think I'm the Federal Reserve raising interest rates and the economy coming back to full swing will be good not only for America's earners but America's favors as well\nI Want to go back to the Federal Reserve is well always been one of my favorite topics and then I noticed one of yours but I'm President Trump provided as a change in leadership at the center reserve and of course one of the big towns that you talked about over the years\nIs there's a lack of truth in ... the Federal Reserve has do anybody but I just I don't know that when we come back to that but I'm interested in your assessment of the new chairman of of the sand in how you think that's going in and he will not work out well for us in the long run\nWill certainly Jerome Powell is a is new to the scene so to speak so we don't have much to judge him on but it appears to me as though we've had the right direction so that is the new fed chairman you know we have Alan Greenspan ... very well known names\nAnd then along comes drowned out which we don't really have a history of Janet Yellen I think was minding restored to be quite Frank
