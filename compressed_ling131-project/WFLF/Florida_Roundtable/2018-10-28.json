is to preserve American history and and these stories and infighting and had to cover it kind of a toll history is the my specialty if you will or forte and the unknowns it's no different\nIn that long line it's gets as I'd like to say the story found me and and that that said the story found me [noise] um when I was in in France\nAnd I was giving a chore to the wounded warriors regiment of the marine corps as we were touring Omaha Beach and in the other landing sites in during the day is worth it to the airport drops elves and quarter they too are also involved the great World War one

Patrick\nO'Donnell his brand new book the unknowns they untold story of America's unknown soldier in World War ones most decorated heroes who brought him home\nIs from rural Atlantic available all the find bookstores from Florida and places like Amazon dot com and Patrick is always a great pleasure to have you with us or as we came to the end of that last segment you were talking about uh the importance of the fight\nOver keeping the American forces together that the French woman do just catch them in a company level or or a little bit larger\nWhere they were needed in general purging took the stance that no no no no the Americans fight together and remain as an army and I want you to\nPick up that story and then continue with that [noise]\nGeneral Pershing was was given essentially two orders\n'em by the secretary of war at the time and through the president itself the first order was to keep the American army together an independent and always fight independently\nUm and the other order was to come home\nAlive and uh you know healthy and um the the main the main order though was was to fight independently and create the army the British and French wanted to take the um the American do boys\nAnd and basically put them into the depleted French and British Army and let them fight is is putting battalion sized strength they would have been effectively cannon fodder and fought um you know with the same tactics is French\nAnd English ... casualties would have been absolutely enormous we wouldn't have really had any kind of political sway at the end of the war um have we done that and that's you know there's also question whether or not the war would have even been one\nIf if we're at that tactic was employed to ... great credit he um he navigate it's a very tricky um political waters and diplomatic waters and was able to keep the of the army largely intact and by the end of the war in the Meuse Argonne offensive for instance\nThe army was over a million strong in that sector alone it's really quite an achievement you mentioned earlier about your grandfather who was um\nWe went over and and you had his diary and you know he was from the New England area one of the stories in this book is is from the twenty sixth debate and it involves a a a terrier dog named sergeant study\nAny one of the the supporting characters in this book which is\nI think quite an interesting story the mascot for for one of the for one of the units and um you know fights in and around the trenches there's there's a little movie out or animated movie now which I think it's quite good\nBut that that's there is a true story behind it and um you know the dog was quite remarkable safes and people's lives was able to warn people about gas attacks that were pending and are just quite one of the little one of the interesting stories within the doubts\nThat just really puts a a human face or not in this case but it it it it humanizes the war in a in a sense and it gives people an understanding of of what it was like\nAnother point that I think is very important and that is a new technology the early part of the twentieth century\nAnd but this is the war a that brings us poison gas and ... and long range artillery and changed the face of the way wars fought [noise]\nUm it's this is the civil war\nOn steroids it's a it's the changing face of battle from you know if a tree uh tactics where people marched in line in in large columns informations and it's changed suddenly by the technology is on the battlefield the machine gun friends suitable to\nAnnihilate no small machine gun team to take out thousands of individuals [noise] if it's properly place it and there's a high explosive artillery shells in the gas which is just so deadly um you know I\nIt's hard to imagine fighting in the trenches but then fighting wearing a gas mask for hours sleeping in this stuff was persistent it was constant and you had to be vigilant because if you\nDidn't have it on even for a couple of seconds you could you take your your life or a you know severely scar your lungs [noise]\nThe um there's different types of gas which I get into in the book there's mustard gas for instance which is Reece oily droplets that or it just gets under the skin and irritates\nUm everything uh and even you know forces you in some cases take your mask off and he could get hit with another type of gas [noise]\nI'm extremely brutal and difficult\nTo fight in and I think that's one of the great stories in the book too is just how our that generation of do boys largely untrained um innovated\nAnd and overcame and became defeated one of the greatest armies of the world that time the German army and they did it with bad training in proper training but they were able to figure it out on their own and uh were incredible army by the time the war ended\n[noise] bumping you\nAbout a little bit in the book are some figures who would become major figures in major roles in World War two including the likes of Marshall and pat and talk a little bit about their roles in World War one which isn't as well known [noise]\nUh George Marshall initially is just the only major but he has a brilliant mind and purchasing it relies upon George Marshall's we use primary planner for all the major battles during World War one and some of these things are just\nExtraordinary feats of logistics just moving a massive army\nOver all the time you know tiny French roads that are not very well developed and they have to do it\nUnder the cloak of darkness under the German dies\nAnd they're you know George George Marshall's able to pull off two major offensive to one at San ill and the other at the Meuse Argonne in you know short order quite an extraordinary story of planning and logistics\nAnd execution or an organization does that very well and uh you know that's just are planted there for his you know the ultimate great success or World War two\nAnd then you have George Patton is story is told in the unknowns says well he's a you know Cal ... officer", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Florida Roundtable", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "28"}
