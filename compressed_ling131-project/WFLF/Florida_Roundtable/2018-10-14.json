Michael at this point in the program we are joined by our special guest health ... or\nTease and um he is a gentleman of extraordinary accomplishments we are delighted to have been with us and ah Alfredo welcome to the Florida roundtable\nReagan thank you very much for having me appreciate it\nWe're uh I'll tell you what instead of me sitting here and rattling off your credentials and whatnot you ahead and take a little time here on the front end of the show and and I'm sure your bio graphical notes with our audience\nSure sure absolutely happy to do so when Mike also I think he's got me on the show\nOr a friend or teams I Am the president and CEO of an organization called job creators network\nIt was an organization founded about seven years ago actually by a gentleman uh who we are no true has a very accomplished store it's called the Home Depot and the founder of his name is Bernie market\nAnd uh he actually no small business all too well because he started the Home Depot in Atlanta with just two stores and now it's a major success that ended the day was about a hundred and twenty billion dollars in revenue point about four hundred thousand hardworking Americans across the country\nAnd job creators network was really for him to be able to give small business owners the voice in the megaphones they desperately needed over the past several years\nTo be able to really uh you know hit hit it hard in terms of the fight that they needed for years to be able to support their business grow\nAnd unfortunately under the Obama administration small business owners were dying and Reagan and Mike I'm you know that small business owners are extremely important small businesses across the country but also in Florida in fact about there about two point five million small businesses in Florida that employ Ninety nine point eight percent\nUm you know it's going to represent Ninety nine point eight percent of all Florida businesses\nAnd represents a over forty percent of the four to work for so uh we're fighting for a four to small business owners and their workforce across the country a and a really just real being able to you know hit that hit that ground with a message of how important small businesses are thirty million a small businesses across the country and point sixty million people\n[noise] so what was it during the Obama administration that you feel was really hurting small business\nYou know I think that's a great question we actually you know I was out on the road a you know ... small business owners they're trying to get a sense of what was going on because I could sense that there was just such a low level\nOf optimism and we did a national survey of small business owners um and what we found three main things were really hurting small businesses and chicken them ... and it was over regulation just way too much red tape\nOver taxation in fact in some cases fifty cents of every dollar was was was basically being paid back to the government um and then also the lack of access to capital um and and lines of credit primarily driven by Dodd Frank a dock Frank and emails to know drove out about two thousand community bank had closed because of it\nUm and mostly rural areas and so our small business community has really hurt by that and so those were the three main things and so three years ago we started will called the brain small business back to where\nI'm going across the country talking about the importance of small businesses the thirty million I'm On small businesses plane almost fifty six million hardworking Americans\nAnd really talking about that because nobody was really driving that point nobody was really talked about that important\nAnd so um so we did that three years ago uh last year we actually embarked on what was called the tax but now a tour which was really to try a the importance of a tax cuts for all businesses across the country and individual\nAnd then this year we have our tax cuts work dot com tor which is really tried to be able to talk about the the successes of the better jobs back and really what it's doing for economy for also for all businesses whether you're small medium or large\nAnd therein lies a good deal of what we want to hear from you today and um how things have improved over the last couple of years here ah for small businesses a lot of folks think back and and we still hear it to this day\nUh you know when Ronald Reagan did his tax cuts and and the people that they said they talked about the trickle down economics you know that oh oh it doesn't work they said and um\nI did well when they didn't do well I didn't too well\nUm if you remember there was that one of the lowest points in our economy when things were really dragging\nAll the Christmas parties were always cancel right and what would happen because there was no money to spend Christmas parties right every single dollar mattered and so the savings ... companies were cutting talk left and right\nGuess what gets impacted you know the local deli down the street which is a supply that right which is a caterer those those are different party and guess what the and the guys who were inclined a deli meats and the bread tried I mean now that ripples through the economy is so clear\nAnd the only the people who really I've never run business make those kinds of statements because they know that when the large companies do well\nMedium small does well because those are their suppliers and in fact some of these companies have direct uh eat X basically within the within the companies say we want to look for small business we want to look to minority on business as women do businesses right we want to do business with them so when they do well small business well\nHow do we have reached that point in time where we have to take a little bit of a pause along our network line\nWe want to remind folks that they are listening to the float around table a service of Florida's talking entertainment networks I Reagan Smith and Michael you have any harm or a special guest this days Alfredo Ortiz is the president and CEO of the job creators network and we'll continue our conversation following these messages\nSort of fly somewhere looking for cheap flights or cheap tickets and then call that tried to call\nThe low cost airline travel hotline now for prices solo we

is services motives talk in the entertainment networks I'm Regan Smith and Michael Hugh Hefner very special guest this days Alfredo\nOrtiz he has the president and CEO\nOf the job creators network a specializing in assistance to small business owners a ... a small business making forty percent of all the jobs in Florida and that's not to be taken lightly and\nOh freedom oh I Want to ask you it seems as though things are getting turned around we've we've seen the uh low unemployment in business creation record employment uh amongst a\nA R minorities are among Latino is in the black population doing better than um possibly that they've ever seen and and these numbers have now lasted a while\nBut I Want to talk about longevity you we seem to be on the right track here how do you ... how do we keep it going\nReagan I think that's a great question again I Want to hit again just one more time the important small business but that's you know it it's what I Do the right twenty four hours a day seven\nWeek in Florida Ninety nine point eight percent of all or to businesses are small business which is an amazing number thing but you mentioned is that\nOver forty percent of the state workforce are ... are are are employed by small businesses for almost ... million small businesses they're a minority\nI'm so against the according to small business across the country again a block of thirty million hardworking Americans and about six million employees are these small businesses are dependent on the success of small business and so one\nOf the things we want to make sure that we do have a ... small business\nThat means that the type of cuts for example the twenty percent of deduction right off the top for small business that was including the accident job back we want to see more of that right we would love to see\n'em a some of the definition than we thought the recent definition come out that added some clarity to um the exclusion than inclusions of\nOf of what it is part of the twenty percent adoption we want to see more of that where I Want to see more service industry has picked up they want to see a deeper cut we'd love to see a little bit of the bigger deduction on that\nOn to close that gap between a Sikh corps and that's ... you know the the larger companies small companies and we want to see more done for a small business because they are the backbone of our economy but outside of that we want to continue to promote the tax cut themselves that happened because we know\nThe tax cuts work just like our tour is doing today in fact the kickoff yesterday that the second leg of that we're going to be going to about twenty six different states fifty two different stops between now and November excuse me between now and November\nTalking about the importance of these tax cuts right because that is what's missing Reagan is these kinds of conversations the wheel kind of conversation\nThe real news in terms of what is happening is just completely missing in mainstream media news so we have to get the message out first and foremost that's one of the things that can help longevity um but in terms of keeping a new these tax cuts permanent\nBad it's something that we know that the house ways and Means Committee and other folks in Congress are working on right now as we speak to try to make sure that these tax cuts for main street small businesses and for individuals remain permanent unfortunately they couldn't do that last year because it was some of these budget rules arcane budget rules that they had a\nKind of you know stay true to 'em that limited some of that but this was always their plan right pay based one with last year face to this year\nAnd that the tax cut jobs back kind of a to point out excuse me and so we want to make sure that we keep on pushing for that I'm entering and if I could take a couple of minutes of talk about the tears because I Know there's been a lot of conversation of that\nI'm In a lot of people saying we are very concerned about the terrorists but you know we wrote actually and opinion editorial in the hill up in Washington DC to talk about\nTrumping actually indicated on terrorists because what he understands all too well he understands leverage\nAnd he understands that it's the biggest trading partner across the globe with every other country we actually as the United states of America has the leverage to make sure that these trade deals are done correctly enter done our best interests because that's what it's about right it is about America First\nAnd in this particular case ... a lot of these trade deals were on the books for for decades by democratic presidents Republican presidents um they didn't they just weren't paying six and so what Trump has done is minister ration is they've taken a little bit of this great news that four point one percent GDP Growth\nRecord low unemployment rate waging a rising wages\nAnd they're taking a little bit of that just like any good business person or a president and CEO owner of a company is going to do what they're going to take those good time\nAnd they're going to take the opportunity to reinvest back in their business and that ... is President Trump has been he's reinvest in back in this country by resetting these trade deals\nI mentioned a little bit of a an analogy here like breaking your uh you know breaking your arm for example right I think we've all been there have to reset it and sometimes when that reset you almost have to break it again so that stronger even going forward\nAnd I think that's what President Trump is done on these terrorists we're seeing how the ... came to the table with fixes\n'em ... basically terrorists have been dropping both sides with the EU and in fact I Love highly negotiate the buying of soybeans for farmers uh you know in in in you know a hardworking farmers true patriots who are standing behind President Trump on these terrorists he\nHad you buy with the Chinese were basically hitting us with terrorists so he he's really offend half a business person he's treated like a business and and I applaud them for for the types of effort that he's doing a try to reach that these types of trade deals and that is going to keep us a growing in the long term\nSo what do you feel like maybe who's the number one bird and spill on small businesses and if that's preventing them from growing in the morning\nYeah that's a great great question Mike one of the things and this is currently being picked says well is healthcare costs\nUm the Affordable CARE Act and as we all well known now would be anything but that I remain unaffordable 'em and continue to actually have you know rising healthcare costs it was doomed to fail from day one because\nUh it it it was set up so that frankly more dollars are going to be paid out and we're going to be taken it and it's kinda like Vegas everybody probably has been to Vegas at least once I understand I have always had went right for it to stay in business insurance always have to bring in actually one dollar more than the pay that\nAnd the way the Obamacare what set up that wasn't the case it was the reverse shows it was destined to fail actually\nAnd so we have to control health care costs the president has taken two major initiatives uh one is to help on what they call kind of these uh these short term plans um which now we're or limits only three months or allowing for these you know ... plans\nOr to be a little bit longer term and potentially go over here to ah that's one big fix that he's done and also association health plans it's a big opportunity for small business owners to band together\nTo be able to buy insurance are really across state lines and healthcare benefits frankly pour their employees\nYou know that one third of small business had to drop health care benefits of the second Obamacare really was introduced because of the sky sky rocketing a health care costs that it was bringing they just couldn't afford the premiums anymore is a third of small business to have a ... so we've got to fantastic opportunities there are going to help our small businesses to
