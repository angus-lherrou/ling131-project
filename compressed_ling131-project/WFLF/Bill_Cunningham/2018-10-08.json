{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "And now the gun show operators are kicking back suing the city in federal court at ... ... if I can recall has been there for\n... for a long time and they've been having gun shows there for Thirty Years' war memorials they're sixty seven years looks like a giant armory there you know the the military style curves building on the top of you know like a a giant reinforced stone armory so\nA two day shows attracted thousands of visitors to the city owned auditorium in holiday park where shows have been held by Kevin set for over Thirty years huh well you know I've been to want to do a good show is challenging the city's decision not to renew his contract following the February shootings at a Parkland Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school I now\nI recall after either the Valentine's Day shooting there was a gun show they're I think it was the in March so it was in within a you know three or four weeks after and\nThe gun show ran you said you know what it's probably just a little bit too soon too soon too soon and then they said okay yeah you you know what will respect your request will we won't have this one then Avon hopefully that would be the end of it there'd be playing you know playing nice playing ball with with the city of Fort Lauderdale and I'm really it really it didn't work out that way\nAnd Fort Lauderdale position is we are going to help you find somewhere else right would you still want you to have it here because we don't want the political blowback right so do find someone that's not a city owned property and it's not it's not part of the county affiliation just just go have it in a private ...\nAnd the the owner of the show a has been unable to\nSecure a such a facility ... the city says they tried to help by showing or giving him the names of other places\nAnd uh and and\nAnd he said yeah we listen we we tried it just doesn't work just to do you do to this place a caters to weddings and didn't and does a food events and then they want to sell food and we don't really sell food Reagan's to bring the country are so it's it's a couple of different places there was the ... the arena down there\nThey were like ... and we know now I think that you got you're in an affair with our seasons right right exactly right so\nThe city says they also want out because of safety concerns in the city park\nAnd the negative image of having a city building hosts kind of events this is with a new mayor has said ... book is what it is just what folks\nAre just so many safety concerns guess how many issues have happened there ah you wouldn't be a writer zero zero zero zero concerns but you have to understand or all he says\nWell just because it hasn't happened doesn't mean it won't happen yeah because you know we it hadn't happened at that school and then it happened\nHe said it never they never had an incident in Parkland either white temp danger and we can avoid it\nYou know how many successful robberies in assaults take place at gun shows\nYour your user zero that's right there it's not the safest place in the world that would be with your grandma why it's close that's close drawing a close second you know how many people have been shot in mass shootings in my presence\nA\nIs an email is take that one [laughter] I mean I Know and ... and ... around here oh\nYou're the only place say for instance inside the studio is um well no actually probably isn't anywhere safer than inside an Indian at this moment at this moment except at my grandmother's yeah\nAnd this comes down to the the mayor there a mirror dean a trend tell us ... is a either like he doesn't ... he says well listen we're not trying to ban the sale of guns in our city uh we just don't want you to\nSell guns in our city yeah this is funny I don't want you to go away mad I just want you to go away for\nA while the suit or said there there was a safety issue\nBecause the events have been run smoothly and safely without incident but again he says why why cafe there might well this case why why why do they have a dry lightning rod protector on the building was but I think my ... well that that's the only three surrounded by foaming at the end pillows gangs falls the troops are some ...\n... I Wonder does does he Dr ... does this city commissioner drive to work every day you know he's got married Joanne read Dr ... car [laughter] say life in that ring and many people I'm actually die on the streets of the state\nYet he you know commutes to work like the rest of the same thing\nYup yup outlets and they've offered to the city here Fort Lauderdale tried to offer the Broward County convention center which by the way is not in the city of Fort Lauderdale ... so they tried to give it to somebody else are they offered to the\n... the the arena where the the the ... the the Panthers play ... which is a not in the ... mhm uh and they had the signature grand which is one where they do the weddings which is in the city of Davy which is not in the city of Fort Lauderdale so it's not that the city of Fort Lauderdale doesn't want them in the city it's just that the city of Fort Lauderdale doesn't want them in the city\n[laughter] the gun show he's been there again it's been going out for over Thirty years or the gentleman's gun show he owns he doesn't throughout the throughout the state of Florida does you know five six different locations does thirty forty different shows a year and there's there's never been an incidence again\nBut there might be yeah there may you may remember them there might be\nWasn't until this new city commission took took effect in March then translate this was made the mayor that this a decision was made to stop renting out the war memorial now this was it like the owner of the gun shows said oh well you know listen that we are supposed to be in March or or you know till the end of the year\nThe summer no they haven't booked through twenty twenty five yeah he's got a book that are here to date syndrome mealtime than exactly right you won't have now or your legs are going to change it from the war memorial building to the you hurt someone's feelings memorial built and yeah\nThe Oregon Coast or the once it shows to be treated the same as boxing matches mixed martial arts events body building competitions and all these other events that are holed at the war memorial should also said city commissions itself for violating the state law or which is of the state ... in Florida which says you can't do this you can't and you can't\nHave a gun show retains the right to add additional individuals or to to shoot a and then against the law allows for many different penalties ... you're you're in Florida under the ... news kind of nonsense you can have these politicians removed from office ... and you get your attorney sees but oh you're you're in a\n... there's everybody there is a factor they can do a two and a half times ... and it's not just against the city it's against the actual individual city council members yes yeah and they're not allowed to use city funds to defend their lawsuit right some writing her right so when you're asking what Kevin why aren't you involved in this litigation\nOn conflict it out [laughter] I have a I have represented against one of these parties and the best\nSo you you're saying that the gun shop owner wants his ... legal lawful business treated like other legal lawful business ... you know and then it sits mass hysteria on ludicrous city yeah\nOh yeah so the uh\nThe now the diversity is doing all the whole well it it costs a lot to upkeep the war memorial we might just close to\n... just yeah just to you I'm sure this year so this is this is it's ... hopefully hopefully things will work out to an area for ought to\nJust do people don't let your governments boy you know what your city government or what your county government the your state and federal ... you'll get your your stand up you know don't let somebody accused you of something that uh you're not you're not guilty of ... if they do ... screaming tamp them yeah\nWho tried tried to rape her not one but for boy she said she said she was in her late teens\nAnd this is switched it back to Fifteen Years old she said it happened in the Nineteen eighties then she's towards that back to Nineteen eighty two practical everything she said turn out to be false now you got to be kind to the woman because she's a allegedly a survivor of sexual assault\nBut part of the deal is when you make certain assertions and if they're refuted as they were by Brett Kavanaugh you got to prove it supposedly she was terrified of small spaces\nTerrified of airplanes then we find out from a boyfriend that they want on John's together basically all over the globe she went to Costa Rica she went to Hawaii she went to ah\nThe south Pacific Island she went to French Polynesia she went to Israel she went to Central America she went to Europe all by being terrified of airplanes\nThe boyfriend also said during the six years that he dated her in a sworn statement to the Senate committee she never mentioned the sexual assault never mentioned the name Brett Kavanaugh she had no fear of flying in fact the flu around islands on single propeller airplanes sitting next to each other\nBut she uh the the second door theory was a bunch of crap\nBecause he came out that they want it to second door in their home in twenty eight four years before the therapy session because she wanted to provide an entrance to her therapist to conduct their business as a psychologist inside of her home\nShe also coached a friend about how to take a polygraph test she lied about that she also ah stole money from the boyfriend so all these things that she said Dr Christina forward simply fell apart and now yesterday or today\nHer lawyer Deborah cats came out to say that she doesn't want to pursue the Kavanaugh thing anymore really she's done with it so\nMedia turn out to be liars and thieves in trucks and miscreants whomever every description the second accuser Debbie ... a dusting off the memories\nPulling a Bill Clinton on her as a freshman in college no one supported her story either she gave for names the FBI they checked out the stories of ... Ramirez shaking his junk in her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either\nAnd then one of the silent heroes of this has been the porn lawyer Michael Evan ... boy he did a great job for the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous\nAntithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact to cast a light away from a weight from a from a Dr Ford and Debbie ... and put it on sweating nobody believed\nIn fact here's a quote from\nSenator Collins on Saturday quote some of the allegations Lebanon against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important I'm thinking in particular\nNone of the allegations raised by professor forward but at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls and use their weaken stayed to facilitate gang rape this outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence\nAnd simply parrot it public statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process\nIs a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote\nSo said the Senator Susan Collins and that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael ... he's doing a great job representing the Democratic party needs to keep doing it\nPlus uh as far as supporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin\n... I read some way of a expert from the independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on ... spent on my show many times\nWrote a column a sudden this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kevin all she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kevin O's line and you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury\nSitting in a rape matter my sympathy\nThe what the victim however I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late DNA testing\nRape rape is to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory counts\nAnd Van Dyke Perry who spent a combine thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from ... sure their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow student and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done\nPlus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate\nIn other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock\nOf American Jurisprudence this writer goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process and fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor Christina forward they completely fall apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement and we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down to Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports\nShe could not say that as wrongful activity she couldn't say that in fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans\nAnd show you where we are Steven ... of the Late Show has a terrible late night product I Would never watch but I read this or the Drudge Report this evening\nI have a sense that Kavanaugh's going to be a conservative maybe about along the lines of an Anthony Kennedy\nBecause that's just what is your one when Susan Collins one Saturday yesterday and spent all that time at three o'clock running over his opinions and looked at me like a pretty moderate Republican why was selected I'm not sure\nBut once they came out with his wife and his daughters and the girls basketball team then the vicious lies perpetrated a bone in by the Senate mother mainstream media I got on his side completely one hundred percent\nAnd the poor guy will not be able to coach girls basketball anymore nor teach at Harvard a lot of his life has done not because there is truthful information or corroborate information in fact it was shown to be false\nAs that goes the allegations the title nine proceedings\nBut that were held in the U.S Senate clearly demonstrated that professor Ford was factually wrong in every major point that she had including the fact that she was afraid to fly including the facts you put a second front door in our house including the fact that uh\nThere were four witnesses that were corroborate her story including our best girlfriend none of them did everything fell apart every part of it and want her boyfriend came out and laid out\nIn an affidavit to the Senate how many times that professor Ford lied and was downplayed completely of course by the Washington Post the New York times and the mainstream media because it didn't fit\nThis was all about destroying Brett Kavanaugh personally to send a message through other Trump nominees this is what waits for you Amy Coney Barrett a judge third part of the sixth circuit us court of appeals this adjust the judge hardness or wait for you\nAnd so it was about frightening and scaring the next nominee I oh Ruth Bader Ginsburg lives along live off the Supreme Court but in a Youtube video a couple of months old she couldn't identify the fourteenth amendment what it was what it said\nI mean she's obviously at the age of eighty six losing it but she wants to stick it out for the next two years hoping the Democrat wins in twenty twenty which I predict tonight is not going to happen was continuing their cause real cause some Chicago\nIndianapolis New Hampshire Nevada Delaware Wisconsin many other states coming up later in the last hour will be Julie gun lock independent women's forum and also just delete Peterson\nLive from Los Angeles in\nThe line becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three of them still hunting emigrated Mary [noise]\n[noise]\n\nLocks new samples Stevens tropical storm Michael currently in the Caribbean strengthening into a possible hurricane this is for to governor Rick Scott also\nHave a team from FEMA here to march provide federal assistance that includes experts from homeland security BPA department of defense health and Human Services and the Army Corps\nMichael could become a hurricane by Monday Night or Tuesday local police and the NTSB now investigating the deaths of twenty people after a crash involving a limousine and the town of skull hiring New York's Saturday afternoon\nA limousine drove down the hill on route thirty through the intersection into the parking lot of the apple barrel country store the limo struck a two thousand fifteenth Toyota Highlander in a lot hitting to pedestrians killing them the limo then crashed into an embankment\nBoxers ... limo heading to a birthday party when the crash occurred this is Fox News [noise]\nReally counting on the great American I'm not I'm not felt this good in so many years I Can't stand them\nTo rely upon Susan Collins and Lindsey\nGraham to be the key voices the United States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold beginning the night she was brilliant going over for forty five minutes why she was going to support and then I I tried to listen to Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all\nIt seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not have listened to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd and maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees in the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of ah Brett Kavanaugh's wife his mom and dad his girls and what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic across the political correctness and title nine\nThat's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl up some sexual assault the most likely did not happen to get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting your accuser is all that kinda stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was a title nine case in which the allegation was made and therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything Ford said fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses including her river version of the facts from er twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapists notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was\nI'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for reelection and two years but she ought to\nBut now a clowns fools to come out of the woodwork to like Valerie Jarrett open ... fame to run against or in Maine have added\nLet's continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThank bill appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party pornography industry if you don't mind shore yeah do you know the Democrats claim to care about women but over the years\nI wanted her largest supporters has been the pornography in St I'm just wondering if they really cared about women why did they take money from these people who would like women that way\nAbout Michael ever noted the porn lawyer and I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael Lebanon that he is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nWe'd be that lucky for Michael having any run against ...\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they they didn't have one criminal prosecution against pornography and open the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this bad stuff this pilots stuff you see out there\nTurn a porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars to the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies in sub spaghetti women to lie for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women\nThan their leader would not be the U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate and Minnesota and they're really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee and joining sixteen if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and do you do but actually are doing a lot of harm to these people because uh you know the older the fact of the boy who cried wolf now nobody is going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nWell or if a woman comes forward with the probably eight or nine times out of ten it is correct\nBut every now and then you have Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UVA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges from false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time\nBut I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor forward I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow did you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me about that second door telling me about the fear of flying all these things Lewis turn out to be a lie or a misstatement or not true\nYou know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen when she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth\nAnd she said and twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a cabin all was going to be a nominee she told the therapist\nThat she was a attempted rape by four boys in her late teens and the Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kavanaugh is because he was one boy and by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he had moved to Connecticut\nSo she had to tell the fair but that it was Kevin Oh but they but the notes of the therapist clearly indicated it could not have been bred to Kevin you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when it's really your left foot\nBecause you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist and twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said and twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and the Nineteen eighties\nFor free annuity rate report has been released which reveals the annuities with the highest guaranteed rates and

different that's why in international diamond center you get straightforward prices\nYou their fault summing up a little over an hour with Julie gun laws of the independent women's forum\nAbout a woman's perspective and I made this point with her about two weeks ago then I'm of course of man you might be a woman but if you're a woman you're probably married to a man or was married to a man or want to be married to a man\nYour father was a man what kind of feelings Deb towards your husband and your dad your brothers are male what kind of feelings damp tore them and you may have male children or grandchildren doing over the world where because of your gender\nYour automatically just believed or believed in other words every now and then a woman lies and every now and then a man is not guilty of rape or sexual assault happens all the time\nSo you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because a man is charged he's got to shut up there was a line to be murdered merged between the me too movement on one hand and went on a ... percent acceptance on the other\nThe fact you want to believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do is a criminal defense attorney a take off my hat and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen or a person says my house was burglar eyes or a victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault naturally want to believe that person\nBut then if a person is charged I Want to live in a world that says that person is due process rights because that is the rigorous\nReaction of substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor forward through a any rigorous process to determine what she was saying was accurate now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago\nThat practically everything she said was false including the number of people got attacked or what had happened how it happened ... how old she was the timeframe that happened in the two front door was a kind of hard the fearing the fly was ridiculous in her boyfriend came out and said she was a safe\nAnd some of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally\nIs not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News\nAfter she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself now hold up on that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says you say if it's accurate\nThe two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and at one end not because she needed an extra way out but because a small business owner a therapist\nWant it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door that had nothing to do it cost her phobia\nAnd the boyfriend follows the affidavit saying wait for little planes all over French Polynesia and ... and uh Hawaii\nWe also went on trips to Central America South America and Europe she had no fear of flying it was a lie in fact there was nothing she said factually that turned out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about\nFinding the truth they had a ball face mitigated allegation that could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you want to get into the veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said\nShe has mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and the person with the Y chromosomes that's a liar but then the truth came out and it's like well don't don't bother me what the facts\nWhat caused a writer for the call bears CBS late night show to say quote aerial doom is said quote whatever happens I'm just ...\nAnd we ruin bread Kevin O's life unquote fat is reflective and indicative of what the Democratic Party things today about Brett Kavanaugh we ruined his life ruined his wife were ruined his mom and dad and were ruined his daughters\nSo aerial do most of this team of Kobe or show\nCalled whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin bread Kevin O's life unquote that's where they are don't care about his qualifications as constitutional principles his academic scholarship it kind of person he is they want to ruin someone's life\nAnd they're happy that he can't coach girls basketball team anymore or teach at Harvard according to Stephen Colbert Irish writer's we've ruined his life now we're feeling\nThat I'm pessimistic about America right now but\nThe way this is this mob rule mentality is living as down a path to what President Lincoln face as soon as he took office in Nineteen sixty water and that is what I Am afraid of I'm not afraid of democratic control of the house or the Senate or the presidency\nI'm afraid of civil war and we're on that path and then let these people get checked somewhere and I'm not talking about suppression of vote so I'm not talking about\nThe limitations of their First Amendment rights I'm Talking about\nThem actually getting control without any facts\nTo serve born there their case without anything else they will stop at nothing when Democrats and and we're aggressive loopholes in this day in twenty eight teams come out with a ballot box that go to the court because they can't one of the courts they go to the streets if a cat went in the streets the next thing as bloody revolution\nHere before we go to bed tonight part of the Drudge Report Michael good one who writes for New York ah newspapers has a great column about the coming second civil war read that we got to run take a look let's continue\nLet's go now to Mike in Wisconsin Mike in Wisconsin welcome to the bill Cunningham show Mike how are you\nA great really how are you good really I think we need to learn from experience and you had an earlier caller I think it was prior maybe at it that was in its firing from ... because he like he was a traditional Democrat and he's now come over to our side\nHow are we going to get more people to come over our side I think there are three ways number three I think people like Brian who saw\nOn only dishonest they are downright evil they will do nothing to get a power number two that Democrats\nLooks socialists progress is incapable of analyzing back whether it be about climate change whether it be the lives that that Dr Ford presented in front of the Senate tradition\nProvable lies that we still are ignored by the mainstream media provable line\nI Want to be ... say they're misconceptions but damn it they were alive because she lied about flying\nShe lied about that second front door she lied about them for boys became one she lied about her late teens now it's Fifteen she lied about in fact it was the mid Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty two because Greg Kavanaugh in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nAnd and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that\nWe Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to fight them is by\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yeah I talked to Collins hats off to Lindsey Graham about that route political forces the only way that we're going to eat them and we can avoid a civil war as your last guest said how can we do that by Bruce waiting for my beat him in at the ballot\nGot away and you got to vote you gotta you know Schumer said one thing Saturday and that was correct you got to vote it down or if you take away the Democratic party from the coast and about seven or eight major cities\nThere is no Democrats hardly anywhere there's this sea of red from seed a shining city it say irrelevant minimalist party but the problem is the mainstream media is there a megaphone and the major media will not cover objectively this president nor any Republican president they didn't cover Alito correctly that didn't cover Roberts\nAnd looked like they did a cabin all look what's next to Amy Coney Barrett ought to be the next Supreme Court justice\nAnd from Notre Dame and when that happens all hell is going to break loose and Barbie gene ... meets her maker you watch that fight\nReally didn't get a thank you today to hear Eric Holder who still contempt of Congress said that now we have to call into question the legitimacy of the of the Supreme Court let me see Billy for the last forty years since Nineteen thirty seven says conservatives had a majority on the Supreme Court we never questioned malignancy of a prominent us\nBut now all of a sudden when we go through a legitimate process of confirmation\nAll of a sudden they stand up and say we've got to question the whole legitimate process do you recall outrageous\nDo recall in the third debate that Trump made a Trump was asked whether or not if he lost the election if he would accept it\nAnd the media has a meltdown one Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept the results in November elections if he felt it was rigged against him and the media Hillary Clinton the New York times jumped on top of Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone's out of course Hillary was going to win\nMen Trump won and up to this point Hillary and the major media has not accepted the outcome of the election and so they'd be came with it criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said\nI may not accept the outcome of the election because it looked like it it's rigged however the media went after him Hillary one after him Hillary said let's be clear about what are you saying and and that means he's\nTalking down American democracy and I'm appalled that someone is the nominee of one of the two major parties would take that position quote unquote Mallory Clinton\nBut then Trump won and Hillary never considered the election she never accepted the ballot box\nNew York times never accepted the fact that Trump won\nSo they became what they criticize it was nothing but nothing short of a ... and thank you for your call let's continue now with a show in New Hampshire it's been there for about an hour show in New Hampshire welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joe go ahead\nThat could Mr Cunningham thank you for taking my call um agree with everything that's been said prior to ... and some nation of everything so there's no need for me to repeat any of that but what I'm calling you about tonight is so important have you ever heard of Jonathan\nSigning his book code red about a ... vote and Russia encouraged in America actually in the cities\nYeah I I think that there is a bind him example in the city of Cleveland there were more votes cast for Obama than citizens registered in certain words and and it's because the because Cleveland's in an important state my home state of Ohio I'm sure there's massive voter fraud in Chicago New York\nAnd whatever but Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there's hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast because of the tabulation system and there's no check and balance 'cause there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're a code red China concern would be an excellent guess for your show before the terms but here's the thing\nThe way it works with the algorithm and the companies that are only three or four the entire country and it's done in the cities\nAnd what you would have is a situation where the machine as program where the Democrat as a as an actual votes cast Republican has an actual votes cast the machine's gonna say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance\nAnd the person that runs the city the Democrats in most cases they're the ones that oversee the installation of the ballots for the terms who's on the ballot what have you on the machine can be corrupted and the algorithm or like the\nWay from the Republican the end of the Democrats\nOr give me the name of the guy in the book again I'm going to talk to my producer\nJonathan Simon and the book is code red and he was a guest on coast to coast a month ago when I was ... he was on three hours and it was really riveting and it's been happening for a

are you\nA great bill great to be with you and I have three things that I think we all my keep in mind as we go to the polls in November one is that just like you mentioned this woman who says that she doesn't care what happened she is glad she room Brett Kavanaugh's life when awful what\nThe left and the Democrats have indeed done to others they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh what they tried to do to break capital they will try and do to us if they can the second\nThing is is that all mind this entirely destructive behavior of attacking institutions people the people of constructive in ten of these things about our society\nIt really to me bill is nothing less than the continued some version of our nation beginning in Nineteen twenties [laughter]\nWith the communist and their attempt to undermine us from within and I don't think we see that but I think if we do it will provide a great context for the situation that we're in your Catholic as my are you aware of this terrible a present state of revelations\nIn the sex abuse is and the official cover up that that was actually very much started by the communists\nWell whatever it was it's all those laws and we should be able to do
