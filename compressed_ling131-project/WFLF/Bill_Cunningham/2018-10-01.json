perspective I ... I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kind of look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and ah after a doctor forwarded testified the the subtle Mike Wallace Chris Wallace said\nForce testimony is extremely emotional extremely Raul extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listen to our delivery delivery of those words and talk about the is sold in the impact it out on her life and not have your heart grow up to her this is a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon judge ended up ... generally I respect that I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible\nKarl Rove the great political theorist said forward as the credible and believable\nSo when when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and the silliness the Democrats show Jordan Thursday Afternoon and everything flipped completely ... but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have Andrew Nepal a ton of and Karl Rove saying that a woman is credible\nWho provided witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all\nWhen you have a Christine Ford straight up lying about her in capability of flying which you flew everywhere\nBut every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering and the woman who once the anonymity to testify turn down the opportunity to be questioned in private then we find out her lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all so every time I Try to test her credibility\nMaking bart that turns out to be great grossly lacking so when conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't and we completely lost our way\n[laughter] right I think we have ... to Karl Rove yeah completely lost our way because he went went telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning\nThe people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to your testimony that the ...\nI found Brett Kavanaugh to people even though there was such a notion from both the accused innocent man\nIn a in a court of public opinion in the current day up to this quote unquote hearing yet life with completely turned upside down his wife with getting that threat\nAnd his career with looking to be entirely sabotage and destroyed as well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I do believe that something happened to her\nOr she obviously has been in therapy for that age I she sat her so she has two front doors you know anybody that has to climb doorbell no there's no snow\nSo obviously she had issues\nNow it just because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples that or that it just because she sounds Brett Kavanaugh raped or maybe not but all the evidence that she'd for that so far all started being additives\nIn fact if you present it as sort of Cornwall in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith Leyland Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in God's or\nWho would have no motivation to lie under a light all who said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly what the what would spread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did now they'll get discount Marts judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine ... said they did then wheeling Kaiser her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know\nI don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that well I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the president being twenty sixteen but the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't happen till November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about Brett Kavanaugh getting the Supreme Court what his name one on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Christopher Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know because\n... ... exactly what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case that fell short of being an assault case [laughter] however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility to order a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to be the Post's let me tell you something\nI wasn't given lawyers from the defensive side that treated me with kid gloves no okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing solved it talks about the call right on gender equality will you know what I was treated not as a woman not as bad as a person bringing bringing forward charges against another person\nTo watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as though she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily Hong Kong and the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly and then we find out she lives all over the world\nI and also just the whole story said thank thank God for people thank God for Brett Kavanaugh and thank God for Lindsey Graham", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year":
