the student gun violence summit this will be students gun violence ... and they they've ah they've created their own bill of rights the student gun violence have created their own a bill of rights and I want to give you a couple of highlights here on the bill of rights it's got such thing as Fifteen or these bill writes it says\nA number one is a ... school safety committee open to the public at each site equally composed of students' parents and faculty are and listen to kids one of the kids want to be involved and there's a couple in here that are now you know it would either don't forget about don't forget about us we're the ones that are getting protected we want to say on this\nBut there's a couple of them in here that um are not so what would you say I'm I'm I'm\nLegitimate\nOkay then they don't make they don't make sense at all you know they don't make sense to kind of the kind of cracking the kind of they're kinda wacky or or what's the what's the one that the jumps out here at you when you look at this\nThey want to ban the sale of weapons that fire velocity rounds I ... ... is there a new ... new animal manufacture I don't know about\nA lost city around\nIs is this is this the this is from the plasma rifle the forty ... and if we do what you see in the case of it as much seeing the cases is this about this one\nThat's um they're they're they're taking it apart they're you know they're looking at well we can't you know the the\nThe American public won't let us all a allow us to ban guns so we're just going to\nBan the bullets that go a certain velocity\nThis says in their bill of rights here they've they've got a bunch from here but it says uh make guns harder to get by requiring a minimum mandatory waiting period of ten days to purchase a firearm\nRequire universal background checks you know what the ruling universal back well good on Mars and Jupiter exactly right it's different than every other background check yeah uh that you have to give up where you have to with a universal background check I did find out what the difference is\nYou have to do a stool and urine sample also do uh uh that's that's a you know there's a Jimmy dishes and embrace background check yeah and a fingerprint based a\nUniversal background check it must be completely but the ... it has to be while you're on Mars that's OK okay\nA marsh poop is one of those universal background checks it must be completed and includes the database information state database affirmation you know you don't just basically against\nThe second amendment you know to be the the ability to keep and bear arms and then they want a database of you\nYeah uh and raise the age brush fire from Eighteen to Twenty one with exceptions for responsible training like military service so responsible training you can have a good response will train here you're Eighteen or Nineteen years old you wanted to find yourself you can get a responsible training\nYou know that's great no and we met the military you know that's that was the only reason why the whole trading it listed I got to tell you I've been in the middle as in the military for very long time we did a lot of stuff it was hours\nLong [laughter] I Know you don't need to do very well you're not going to repeat on air done all this stuff\nWas all I won't incriminate the guilty yeah yeah thank you uh they have to require the this is what the other one of those things we regulate the gun industry by requiring dealers and owners report stolen guns which they already do\nExpand regulations of innovative including military style weapons and military style what does that mean style is that where my where my stock the same way they do you know I get it as a ... by ... the ... of it or is it is that so that means the brown guns as long as well as the black gun break\nA bump stocks and other assess or he's that alter the original firing capacity of a firearm ... you miss it in here to the military style weapons that fire again this yeah ... I got to be around velocity rounds what ... what's the velocity ... Iran it's around that has the velocity\nAll hell Hyundai make of velocity at the velociraptor velociraptor they make a boss wrapped okay they have the so it's not a honey so it's not you know the Hyundai news that the Hyundai velociraptor be\nDon't I don't know what a blessing round is I I use is is this some sort of\nAir cannon round [laughter] I don't know of that sort of is this a is a black powder but can we say black on her anymore we're allowed to say look on her I'm good how are of color or say powder still say black ... or ... or ah the ... just in case of our listeners don't know\nI I I'm not PC so I don't I don't care no your uh your apple [laughter] well no that that's due to the gym you know you're correct but I'm not politically correct or where\nAre you know I don't I don't know what you're talking about I mean I think this is\nI think this was somebody sitting around going um ... is is this flammable you're using words what what is what some may be protections character say in the end and fathered abroad is it the I don't think there were things which you think advantage [laughter]\nThat's the princess ... threw it off as like Brazil supposedly learning that word means what you think\nI like this one here we're there you know they want to ban accessories the alter the original firing capacity of a firearm in other words if a gun came from the factory with a ten round magazine\nThe doom gun violence summit wants to ban using a Fifteen twenty or thirty round magazine in that far\nI have a question for what about if the gun was designed originally to utilize from the factory thirty round magazine so so what they're saying is if it comes with a ... round magazine\nYou get most standard ones do you do want only use thirty romantic you can't put a general magazine or news it alters the FARC ... yeah what if I Want to have a\nFive round magazine and it and I want to go hunting nope no have you got to use thirty six thirty out that there are those hogs don't stand a chance oh I Wish we could get the whole game here who could have a conversation with a bomb at the do the feral hogs the animal have you know you have to go up and where they would get bacon out I was a feral hog\nAnd those kind of ...\nOf the debate that give you a ... year but it's it's it'd be like a\nLike fighting the puppy [laughter] it was just going so cute look up and coming up the words that don't exist and he has no clue like talking about the loss of the bullets and a ... you're watching you taking taking him in a in the section of a topic you know that he hasn't been trained or yeah\nYeah ... ... you know and you know it doesn't know how to react off of this no cards you know\nAnd they had on the ... the doctor who understands saved his life from the emergency room in Pittsburgh Allegheny General Hospital and not a doctor is Jewish\nAnd the two nurses who first arrived at the scene to save the rotten filthy life for Robert Bowers are Jewish how serendipitous the Jews save the life of Robert Bowers\nAnd if I was in charge I Would a deal with all the other ones first to deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor\nMy God and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months that I like to know where are the people\nCommunicated with was he a friend that was ... who else knew what he ... he was saying the things he was saying and and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great\nFriend of Israel and Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history Jeb Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka has become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner\nIs a ah Orthodox Jews the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish religious functions as I have\nAnd so this guy who\nAh hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post won out exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo one headline Saturday yesterday and the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump\nTo put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post that are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not\nIn fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ... the New York times ran\nA progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help it's unbelievable on that day\nAnd in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat stimulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd ah one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that stimulated the stabbing the vicious murder upper rock Hussein Obama\nI Want to know the media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt to the masses fascination of Republican members of Congress resulting in a motor wounds to Stephen ...\nThe Washington Post the next day\nRan a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow\nSo instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles so decapitated the leadership of the house of representatives and he was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter of frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio over the last several weeks\nMuch like the ah the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people there have been at least twenty examples of left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder so many many Republicans in fact all Republicans\nPeople like secretary defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice and like substance was sent to the home\nOf Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it because all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there is a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an ID cruise chased out of restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant a Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor brick Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote andme word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence\nBut win largely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist\nAnd sell them on the right committing acts of violence that is covered it completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion it's Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up as Trump stabbed to death and people plug\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam began the anti Semite sat at a large rally that Jews are termites in thousands in attendance applauded and cheered coding Jews termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and Brock Hussein Obama stood next to had pictures taken with\nAt the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency in a way not to allow the public to know that it was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago\nAnd ... that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically\nSo this whole thing disgusts me\nI Hope soon very soon but a powers is killed either a by lethal injection ... heading electric chair shooting whatever it takes powers has got to go the way Timothy McVeigh for violence and Bowers\nWas a Trump hater but the Washington Post has somehow implicitly tied Trump to the murder\nOf God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh the whole thing is disgusting\nWhen you get your reaction plus we're going to have later on David Wray affair to talk about what's happening on the southern border is anyone thought about the public health crisis caused\nBut because that charges not explosive enough the left in the media keeps saying that the president said there's good people on both sides he was not referring to the white nationalist\nHe was referring to those who wanted to keep Confederate monuments now from bill ... perspective I\nI don't like the idea of Confederate monuments cause they declared war in my country the United states of America and killed something the range of six hundred thousand Americans by the way those Confederate who did that road Democrats\nThey you know the Ku Klux Klan and the Democrats lynching Democrats they're all Democrats so please can the media set the record straight\nWhen the president said there's good people on both sides the one thought he was referring to\nWear those southerners who wanted to keep southern monuments\nAnd the other side where those protesting he was not referring to the white nationalist carrying tiki torches shouting racial and ethnic slurs at night in Charlottesville there's no good people among that group you cannot be a good man or a good woman shouting racial or Jewish lawyers\nAnd the southern city at night carrying torches there is no good coming from that that is blatant racism and that's wrong\nLet's continue we'll get your calls ... cause in Wisconsin Ohio Indiana Illinois Nevada Florida New York and California by the way the\n[noise] the Boston Red Sox are bottom of the seventh inning of four to one [noise] so uh that's\nBecause Andrew ... a friend of mine who plays left field for the red Sox I'm rooting for the red Sox\nDoes continue with more [noise] still counting hand the great American your calls her next live with you [noise]\n\n\nFox News I'm like the opposite the world's\nMost clean our corporate twenty four from prefer something one of my family's from falling\nFor for seven seven foreigners are hard to find nothing hours ... from Austin muscles in the proper were from time\nTo probably hurt him from running around for first of all hanging from harmful\nFor recognition of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting tragedy\nShows go to the grieving coming\nCool the French government to hold the government to across Europe because the U.S [noise]\nStay strong I read again try the Sarah\nSasha goes beyond the president of the union Jewish students of France calling for solidarity to honor the eleven victims who lost their lives at the hands with accused forty six year old shooter Robert Bowers is\nDoing in the\n\nBack home the Pittsburgh Steelers with a moment of silence to honor the eleven tree of life synagogue shooting victims before the started their game against the Cleveland Browns sound provided by CBS Sports this because Fox News [noise]\nHow often do fast approaching aerobic something I don't register online and only [noise]\nWere from a ... a lesson for all of them from fat or ... percent of our minds of our coverage [laughter] ... I Hope I'm ... [noise]\nAre you better off today than you or two years ago\nBecause America better off today than it was two years ago\nAs a Foreign Relations better off today than it was two years ago is the judiciary better off today than it was two years ago in fact what's going wrong is the unemployment rate better now than it was two years ago or more people working today than two years ago is the American military stronger today than it was two years ago\nIn fact everything it could go writes gone right and not much has gone wrong and that that's gone wrong largely has not been Trump's doing but other forces he's the president but he's not the ... he's not the dictator is not the czar\nContinue their calls will go right to go to Robert know Utah Robin Utah welcome to the bill Cunningham show Rob go ahead\nThanks for taking my call ... thank you\nWell yeah in the middle of the shooting Al Sharpton on MSNBC\nAgain and I doubt and then again and they had a\nFriend [noise]\n[noise] you know\nWell I'm already is ... how about the riots that Al Sharpton started in New York City are based upon the death of a Jewish person what about ... furniture Mart\nMean it Al Sharpton life is filled with anti Semitism any run around with Louis Farrakhan who called ...\nAnd I I watched it going [noise] a year [laughter]\nHere so [noise] not with the people of all\nI Know I just I just Google this December Thirteen Nineteen Ninety five the Reverend Al Sharpton apparently referred to the Jewish shown or a ... fashion martyrs they're white interlopers in a rally three months before the Harlem massacre\nNewly revealed tapes show Sharpton is not named Fridays but mentions the least disputing calls out his audience Nineteen years ago Al Sharpton inside the massacre at Freddie's furniture Mart because a Jewish a\nBusiness owner moved into the black community and so I I just Google it and how how does he get away with it\nThat's what I'm saying I got away with it you know just going on and on its people for this crap\nAnd [noise] you know the other thing is that the guy who sent right to the White House and it was right and he actually got the castor bean made rice and\nMrs you're calling from Utah and this is the guy who's now when they're an indictment now this was in a large media stories that fair to say in other words maybe\nEven a larger story hair in it and say hey it's below the fold\nAnd and all the white powder sent to the Trump children not much of the story at All right now I don't know just being concoction would've actually cause any damage but it was like a fake pipe bomb in other words it was intended to cause fear\nAnd if someone would get that and you open an envelope and you get white powder all over your hands impose on your lap believe me and it's a fearful tear filled event and this is a regular event that the left does to Republicans and the media doesn't cover it do they\nNobody cover it and you can make rice and I don't care if they're being real\nOh well can you imagine if a bunch of Republicans have done similar things to the Democrats when Obama was in the White House\n[noise] [laughter] oh no you couldn't even bring up but you can bring up anything they couldn't say a word\nWell Time Warner did this the Trump well what if the parent company of Fox sponsored a play in Central Park\nThat depicted the murder through repeated stabbing of Iraq Hussein Obama look alike saying twenty ten what would the me I'm number number one Fox's parent company never do it\nBut Time Warner sponsored a play in Central Park Shakespeare is Julius Caesar ... character looking like Trump being shot to death on stage and the and the media loved it and the audience cheered every night\nNow what did the same thing that happened to Obama sponsored by Fox\nFavorite comedian who had a car bomb and held his head to head on stage\nBut Cathy Griffin now is touring the country to sold out audiences\nBy explained to me Rob why the media\nDoesn't respond to these obvious\nDiscrepancies in disparities between the way they treat different acts the same actors committed it kinda depends against humans conducted thank you for your call let's continue we have ray in South Carolina ran South Carolina welcome to the bill Cunningham show right go ahead\nYou're great American bank you thank you I can tell you to read [laughter] you got people get caught so that you got people that have shown media have merged show they're all going to help\nHim well ... all over you know ... re there's one institution one company\nIn the country protected by the U.S constitution as the media because the first amendment all other businesses do not have First Amendment protections with extra rights go extra responsibilities\nAnd so you know one can watch CNN for day or two without without not hearing someone calling or the president a Nazi or hit or like or a fascist at a minimum\nAre you considering a

rhino safe dot com oh that's all [noise]\nPlease remember that America is the most uh\nPro Israel less ah anti Semitic country on the face of the earth Jews have done magnificently here because of family and faith in academics and hard work the Israeli ambassador to America has said that this afternoon on CNN is the best place for you to be in anywhere in the world\nAnd so what happened to them yesterday morning cuts at the soul of every Jewish American my boss is a Jewish carpenter an amount of what happens in political discourse in America that brings violence\nAnd the American media depressed CNN and their allies always lecture Trump Republicans and conservatives about our anger our rhetoric in our violence but one progressive explode\nWhich happens on a regular basis like stabbing Republicans setting the trucks on fire that say I support Trump sending a share is sending a rice and in the mail to numerous Republicans including Senator Susan Collins\nOr the children to the president whenever that goes on at no point or progressive ever lectured by the press somehow it's twisted in turned in the Trump Republicans conservatism even when the president is the only\nOne in American history to have Jewish grandchildren and even though the murder in Pittsburgh had postings saying how much he hated Trump because Trump is Jewish grandchildren and Trump supported Israel somehow CNN is still twisted this thing and if something's wrong with Trump\nNever mentioned in the hatred the radicalism of the left which exceeds what happens on the right the whole Ferguson and Baltimore all of the race riots the shooting a cops in Dallas in Baton Rouge all came from black lives matter from the left\nNever any connections river may\nBetween the cop killers in Dallas\nDuring a rally a black lives matter and then meeting and the White House with those same leadership a black lives matter saying what a great job they're doing and civil rights by the president Brock Hussein Obama and the media never said when the wait a minute Mr Mr President\nHow do you mean with the leaders of a group advocating the killing of cops what are we went dead cops when he won them now pegs in a blanket from like bacon there's never a connection made it doesn't exist\nBut Republicans and Trump are lectured constantly whenever violence takes place it's always Trump's fault Trump's rhetoric Trump's tweets the Republican Party conservatism wonder where Republicans speak up\nHave you ever heard about the guy from Utah who sent rice in to the president to kill him\n... have you heard about the white powder the rice and attack\nOn the home of Senator Susan Collins by a left is after she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh nor all the attacks on Trump's children\nHow big of a story would it have been if if the Republicans had attacked the children up or Iraq Hussein Obama oh my oh my lord ... the world would end as we know it\nThey are ... too much for me to take\nLet's continue thousands on old millions millions are listening let's go to chat and the great state of Indiana chatting Indiana welcome to the bill Cunningham show Chad go ahead\nYou're on the phone from under the security then yes I Am not\nThis they're winning five to one in the eighth\n[noise] good good for Donald Trump make America greater get every day\nWhere do they bronze gonna win and beat Donnelly in Indiana I don't know right now the polling as as the Republican up by about three points of Joe Donnelly can one in Indiana that were remind me and twenty away when you and Indiana voted for Brock Hussein Obama\nI didn't vote for him it's unbelievable I mean one thing I didn't vote for him give me an accomplishment and objective accomplishment upper Iraq Hussein Obama give me one now what is it Obamacare which has gone they attack ad on Israel\nAnd in fact I settled up next door on the fact that allowed ISIS to proliferate the fact that North Korea sent missiles over Japan\nI mean give me something Obama dead that has stuck anything\nNot to not ...

and a very knowledgeable about these situations whether it's an attempt to mass murder or whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this\nUh on Saturday today a has been along the lines that uh this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy the NBC News this morning at on a neighbor lived next door to him a\nVery sad woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that a saint Thomas Russian former NYPD officer investigator\nDetective and Thomas Redskin welcome again to the bill Cunningham shown Thomas are you\nGoing to be very tough situation an awful um but when I watch\nSome of the morning and afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all\nAnd they had menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet kinda shy and he said oh goodbye no difficulties\nHe had posted online for quite a while and I ... and rabies including hatred for Donald Trump the president because he thought Trump was too uh too nice on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren are Jewish and why he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless\nUh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's responsible the Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon it today did ugly reporting\nSaying that ah that in fact the Syrian Sanders put out something a few hours you go to the set is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit do\nAttack President Trump the evil active anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump is such a on a public defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective ... said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying the Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should have known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nI not as of yet I've seen you know there's always twenty twenty especially in the long horn spin or the investigative world when I Can't believe [laughter] no one else was honoring his social media\nIs other things that he was hosting couldn't have alerted only what the one we always say is a few things see something\n[laughter] you know one at this seemed\nI could've alerted the police on only see if we find out that the police or some law enforcement agency was told about Bowers and do something or in a while to see this guy does have guns or actually follow him we criticize the police but until that time\nPolice law enforcement agencies even intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the man\nTo be able to every single person thinking a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting Broward County there was a woman or call FBI numerous people had caught about at Eighteen year old a punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even no call in or the FBI people called in it wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nThere's no law enforcement you're only as good a shift today was on course very easy to after Washington is fun show [laughter] I Know my experience with the way we look back we always did\nThat review of what happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing with this case the bombings\nThe bombs that were sent 'em they're looking back and figuring out what we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure in Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a ... said a posted just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media somebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating\nAnd and I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said because I'm sure there's several thousand individuals sadly in the country like ours\nWaiting for a trigger moment that social media exacerbates highlights these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate before social media ten twelve years ago\nYou sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people\nOf like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against ah against Jews and against African Americans there were several hundred who did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump\nHe he he'd previously road I never voted for Trump nor have I ever owned Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\nBut the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so well when you went and then why do you go back right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nAnd I I don't know I like the president I loved the guy spent time with him we speak now and then he's a great political character I look at his results\nMore than look at his words but I I don't recall words being used by him along the lines of the words at least as president then I hear on the left but the media covers\nThe Trump words differently and then they covered get democratic words\nAnd uh and I I Wish there was a quality between the two but as you said the election now is only a little more than a week away and at this point it would behoove all of us to lower down the ready rhetoric a little bit because there's hundreds of thousands on the left and on the right\nNow they're waiting it'd be triggered by some event in many are mentally ill and many have guns now that doesn't mean any of us Tom Russ get needs to stop exercising or free speech rights on their constitution but it does mean\nThat that that the media also plays a role in this one I've been watching CNN the past two days all I hear about is Trump and the Republicans responsible for almost a mass murder of two former presidents plus the killing of twelve or fourteen others along with the attempts to the tide Donald Trump to what happened in Pittsburgh\nEven though he's the only president in American history Deb Jewish\nGrandchildren the only one in today's CNN tried to tee up to us a Israeli ambassador the as the Israeli ambassador to the u._s. I'm Sorry\nAnd he said that the best friend Israel's ever had\nHas been Donald J Trump and that he's been wonderful for Israel and Trump is not responsible for what happened there the president's going to go to Pittsburgh and the next couple of days\nTo meet with those that have been wounded summer mortally wounded not likely to survive the number eleven is likely to go up and the president has said that it's time to lower the writer rhetoric just a little bit but the other side doesn't want to accept that in fact CNN and the Washington Post or indirectly accusing the president\nOf the murders in Pittsburgh and that is despicable man we we've got to come this down and they look as if that ... a little overweight for now we're going to have an election may want to gin up the numbers to hurt the president hurt Republicans I Hope it doesn't work\nBut by the time what you said about calming down relaxing a little bit when you're in New York City when I had my TV show there for five years completely different I live now in Cincinnati completely different culture a completely different things are going on\nBut one thing that unites is when you talk about a hurricane I Love what you said when a hurricane happens there is no one on the other side of the fence to argue in favor of the hurricane right now we're in a political hurricane and Americans need to be not red or blue or red white and blue would you agree\nYes I totally agree and take what you said even further this as a son in law who is orthodox and a very religious Jewish guy has a daughter who converted to Judaism\nAnd as you said his grandchildren or Jewish so you know I I don't think it's a matter of\nYou know what is said it's a matter of how we're saying it doesn't matter for law enforcement standpoint of it has to be held back because you're pressing police departments and agree right they have to be ready\nTo respond to a ... a guy goes into Times Square but no one of the reason that he wants to kill innocent people going to the theater in New York City on me [laughter] a bunch of years ago and thank God he failed terrorism school\nAnd couldn't blow up his own car because he would have killed if not injured hundreds if not thousands of people but there are not like this around the country it's what keeps law enforcement people up at night worrying about this lone wolf the guy who's not really talking to someone the guy who was\nSort of a loner a guy who's pretty well thought of in this neighborhood who is capable of grabbing his guns\nAnd go into a place in killing innocent people for no other reason than his ideology or his private jeeze\nThomas is out there all the way but Thomas Rosekind former NPD NYPD officer thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham show and all of us need to lower the rhetoric just a little bit because there's nuts everywhere Thomas thank you very much\nAnd everyone stays safe God Bless Charlotte's continue\nWith more blind becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven they'll counting on line with you every Sunday night [noise]\nDave Ramsey wine tasting Rachel six PM on news radio not even remotely one [noise]\n\nMessaging ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text market to seven nine six four or five\n...

activists who got this together and explained that the mainstream media will deal with\nWell you know build a thanks for highlighting this and this is is the other example of a you know weaponized migration if he recalled Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill ah Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize and disrupt a you know competing country and once again we have here\nWhere we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress\nA who's a\nAccording to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states\nWho has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many as Thirteen thousand people some of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a gang members deportees there's also\nA man of working age from Asia and from a a East Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they tried to say oh this is you know people are just are coming along and doing it on their own\nMeals are suddenly appearing tents are suddenly appearing medical care is suddenly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me why don't you take your wife and kids and try walking the Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the\nPre hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here\nIs it a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election in your in my lifetime I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo me now because the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone at the Democratic party explained why here we are getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place at the same time with ... million marching together along with food and I'm an army marches on his belly along with water and ... all of these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will cover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate uh\nCaravans that have formed the largest one that we are talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that hasn't even left yet but I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen\nA pictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies and so on they are you know trying to\nUh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift uh not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably\nTwo or Jimmy Carter's a election down fall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by left this government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "29"}
