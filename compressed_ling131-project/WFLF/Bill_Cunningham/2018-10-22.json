don't don't worry about that my ... ever voted or in a corner and looked like a full meal [laughter] I put my birthday and thanks so [laughter] so there there there was that was funny I shamed by cell phones Twitter who just and didn't get it for\nHas made an Enron this afternoon around Mexican agents who briefly stopped them the numbers have swelled to about ten thousand and every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them they talk about a gentleman by talking about what Trump wants you to do\nAnd the F. word all these things are shouted against our president they're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn and offer them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop to let them clamor board to go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals from the most violent place\nOn Mother Earth make their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically the media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico\nThere's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice\nSouth American Central Americans and Mexicans somebody like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million what would that do to our government to our welfare spending door schools draw hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million want to come here\nAnd because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they will permit\nThat because if you're from other than Mexico too you know the words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic card that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins a legal process it will take years\nIn the meantime you're inside of America waiting for hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled they have enough camps\nThey have enough judicial officers driven up floors are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who not been heard yet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats is extremely serious\nIf you're from Mexico here legally you're going to take and right back immediately\nIf you're from Central America you have the right to hearing that goes on and on and on and never stops so uh I I'm interested to see\nWhen and if the media will change their coverage to provide objective information\nThe damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminals societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals\nAnd the rest there is no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California Texas ... New Mexico through legal migration that there is no coverage it doesn't exist the murders of rapes et cetera it does not exist remember\nThat nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border sixteen of the twenty most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI said in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration\nFederal judges and the economy right now\nWith Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable\nTrump has everyone from North Korea\nTo Russia believing we're about to bust up every new treaty necessary to keep to get America back on the even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip here's an economy exceeding five percent GDP the unemployment numbers are not just the ... the lowest they ever could be the or the other three\nYou point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head the terrorists are on the run\nISIS is destroyed Iran is on notice in marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individuals here with a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak at the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them according to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe\nBecause according to CNN this is the issue of unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan their vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way\nThrough the magic wand\nThat we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have where only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through press says these we take in legally one point one million\nForeigners to come into America take the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together we already do that one point one million\nBut I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here\nAnd watch hordes of young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five to ten years from now that will never happen this has fundamentally changed our country that is far and it's going to be much worse\nIf in twenty Eighteen one and two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens\nThe country we live and will cease to exist do we have the do we have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion other hospitals ready to go or other bridges the roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible\nThat the most violent places on earth is sending its largely young males to come into America\nGot a Kevin Jackson coming up later an African American leader of great note there is no race or a group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they\nHave figured out that this is not benefit them at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit American public education doesn't benefit the hospital systems that we have this benefit any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million\nAs a cudgel against the Trump stir that's what's going on\nI guarantee you he his life as no more value than a truck drivers lied for cops life a soldier's life or waitresses lied for coal miners life a taxi drivers live all the might be murdered brutally tortured happens all the time in American elsewhere so why is the death\nOf a Saudi Arabian in Turkey big news\nBecause the media wants to use that as a club against the president and his Middle East policy and I think there's those at CNN and mainstream media that do not do not like the fact that Israel now has a friend in Saudi Arabia they don't like that\nAnd I bought the half million Syrians killed by Iran and by Russia by barrel bombs any of those lives have meaning to CNN no because they cannot be used as a weapon against this president they want to act as if\nWhen Trump says bad things about journalist some alley indirectly cause the death of democracy Yogi in Turkey who believes this crap\nIt's unbelievable but let's continue\nBlonde becomes available it never does one eight six six six or seven seven three three seven the thing\nIs tonight if we can focus on illegal migrants swelling to ten thousand found to reach the U.S supported by the Democratic party incentivize rather an eastern media and the fact that ... if he was my father if he was my brother\nI'd be outrage at his death it was ... it should not have died\nSaudi Arabians do this all the time Syrians Iranians Iraqis inside of America there are several hundred black guys killed every year in Chicago and one hundred dead cops can you name one cop killed in America this year give me the name and your mind ... give me the name of one cup right now\nI bet you can't because the media doesn't cover it you mean Jamal could show a Saudi Arabian killed in Turkey is more important to us that a brave police officer who gave his life\nIs that what CNN believes the answer is yes they want to use ... as a cudgel against Trump and why I have no idea\nThey must have nothing else to talk about\nThose concerns [noise] we do is go right to the ...\nOne becomes available you know the routine go hunting and the great American\nLive with you every summer [noise]\n[noise]\n\nFox News ... Stevens Jacksonville, Florida police investigating a multiple shooting just a half mile away from T I Am a bank field on Sunday\nAt this point we're investigating what may have led after the shootings including the possibility that this may be gang related based on information obtained in the early stages of the investigation\nJ.

I think it was a lie at a maximum misstatement at the other side but nonetheless has continued their calls let's go to a fill in Connecticut an ad in Las Vegas and filling Connecticut Welcome to the bill Cunningham show and Phil how are you\nOr Mr Cunningham her you're correct Mr Phil I'm doing well please go ahead\nWell here's the thing is it character booming economic require the cabin out here and granted I Know for a fact he's working on this caravan with a lot of other Democrats cross country\nAnd he's probably going to be down at the border and a week or so they're trying to get over a hundred thousand of why should you know by the time string them\nFor the Trump is already said he's not used for the reserves and he's a real army and I think the planners they want to be like another ... ... hours [laughter] our troops from the border\nThe immigrants are being told oh don't worry [laughter] orbits like storm the Mexican border a few days ago I Would put in a a token effort to hold the batter twenty four hours for [laughter] for us and deal with Mexico because Trump has got to Mexico are true at all these people on our border\nTroops are going to be there they got to be colder stormed the truth [laughter]\nI think there's got to be a lot of gunfire a lot of Democrats are going to be there they're oh maybe we're here to coordinate\nOffend them and that's why you're from a Dick Blumenthal he's the war hero a state of Connecticut but in Connecticut which is a deep blue state in financial difficulty\nI does this play well with residents of Connecticut because when I watch CNN or NBC News I'm thinking they're thinking this was playing horribly for Trump\nWhere I live in Ohio we don't want ... will happily take one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together as legal citizen to take the oath and go through the process we don't want ...\nIt was coming from the most violent places on earth we don't want that is this playing well in Connecticut\nIn ... in Connecticut there's so many people fleeing the state because of the high taxes I think the typical person in Connecticut has been a legal immigrant there's tens of thousands of them here thanks to Governor Malloy enter into the past year and a half\nThe Blumenthal every time you see ... ... immigrants ISIS about the court room they hold up Richard\nBlumenthal shows up at the true for other Congress people from Connecticut in front of the TV cameras and they plead their case these people should be allowed to stay blah blah blah and eventually\nIce a suspense their case you know for future here he's in front of the few the cameras all all the\nTime trying to see the eagles illegal immigrants here in Connecticut\nAnd you know it's disgusting and remember\nRemember here's the deal if you're from Mexico and get your send back immediately because of the law if you're from Central America and you say the magical words I'm a refugee and I want to hearing you get in line with a couple of million others and you never ever hearing\nThen you released back into American emotion can be held is fourteen days there's not we're not scale to handle this invasion for the most violent places on earth Central American we're not able to do it\nContinuing ed and know Los Vegas Nevada and ... and welcome to the bill Cunningham show ed please go ahead\nYes first of all the FBI and the U.S national security establishment should investigate and find out who's funding the current a con boys or that\nOr whatever they are called uh they can't have that capability and they should find out who's doing it also kind of Obama drone American citizens like this hour we eat guy kill and blow 'em up you know ... and then the media doesn't saying you know about that they really do much later they killed as a sixteen year old son\nWell and it's because you know you could ... in in the view of CNN 'cause she'll get can be used as they\nCall begins Trump they'll do it but ... out of whack he's being killed by Obama's no big deal the Iowa college kid raped and killed by not a legal immigrant\nOn that was quickly dropped she's gone a cop that are killed on a regular basis no big deal in fact that ... that kind of behavior in that part of the world\nIs regular that's what goes on there and I don't like it much but I think CNN doesn't like the fact that Israel is become friendly with Saudi Arabia I mean when I heard Trump and somehow I hear Trump's comments about journalists\nAnd then I hear about can show again is the Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN get do and why why did why more valuable than a cubs life\nNPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayer says the same I end up\nLook at the head of the past ... who's backed us they under the oil as political opponents ...\nPortion of Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the other way at that guy because we needed the base third to supply Afghanistan\nPlus services African Business conference that Obama held for fifty African leaders and I think the daily mail newspaper looked at it and it was the ...\nGallery of human rights violators and corrupt officials but you know the media like CNN and MSNBC and NPR they just fall under over how the great Obama was reaching out to Africa not looking at the human rights back round of the best part\nOr tourists African leaders so the whole thing is sick\nOr not and and you went over that quickly but use backers than had a leader\nWho would boil alive his political opponents and while that was going on Obama and Hillary replacing floating around with this guy and the media that that was no big deal right to boil alive your political opponents that's okay\nI'd probably say oh all of them [laughter] president forty million right that would come [noise]\nBut you know it's it's funny because there's also a lot of there's a lot of a love for American hunter stores like research you'll see the American flag you'll sit on the wall she lays\nThere are so they're at a fact I was even that does is getting off the site or a little bit I was thinking it would be good to ... the first date of like oh my God [laughter]\nThe reason why is because people if we if we can come and run their country and give it a local government it would people would jump to that and they would be more patriotic\nThan it is a gym thank you but here's some factories\nThe violent death writing on doors is Ninety five per one hundred thousand nine of the ten most violent countries on earth or south of us border sixteen of the twenty most violent or sell

that upon arrival\nFrom Central America or any other place here send back to your country of origin immediately that's not federal all federal law says Mexicans yes\nOther countries you know so if you're from El Salvador Nicaragua Guatemala or Honduras or Venezuela and you show up on the southern border instead of ... and running away from the cops border patrol these individuals run toward the

from now that never transpires were not scaled to do it\nGuantanamo is too small\nMilitary bases are too small we're talking about tens of thousands a month coming into America we don't have the money it doesn't work what needs to happen\nIs the federal law needs to be changed with the cooperation of the Democratic party that says when you arrived here illegally you're mainly sent back to your country of origin without a hearing that's it no due process because you're not an American\nThe Democrats tend Democrats in the Senate\nIt will not allow that to happen they will not allow got change Trump wanted to get those so called dreamers might be twenty million dreamers don't know how many citizenship on the path to an exchange with a border wall to stop it but I can put a cork in a bottle\nBut Democrats wouldn't agree Democrats right now we're not agree they'd rather destroy the country and get political power they keep the country the way it is in Cape out\nOh I'd be just like

Sunday night thing I'm going to have to call your producers if if you guys ever do podcasts for your regular show during the week\nOkay anyway um yeah my comment is that I think\nThere is something beyond that the state a deeper steak beyond a shadow government probably the dark shadow\nI don't know what it is is it the one world government is at the door to burgers or the child or or whoever\nYou know on that point in about an hour and twenty minutes I'm gonna call Peter Wallison he's written a book about the bureaucracy the so called deep state how\nThat continues it continues today three thousand new rules and regulations a year hundreds every month it never stops is going on right now Trump's trying to stop but he's going to make that he made the point in his book that I read\nThat that uh it cannot be stopped that there's a deep state in Washington that will continue even assuming Trump is there for eight years it will not be stopped that's his point him I Would agree with\nI Would agree with that completely and I I Want to tell you you know ... ... these people that protested against a governor governor I mean judge Kavanaugh right they were led by the Democratic party for a specific reason they don't want constitutional judges\nOn the Supreme Court oh no they don't\nThey don't want a super legislature they they won judges\nTo impose rules and regulations on us that cannot be passed through the Democratic process and so they've done that the last thirty or forty years and when you got course itching Kevin ... who ... oh I Hope become constitutional judges they're going to say wait a minute if you want to convince your fellow citizens have abortion or gay marriage or something else\nGo convince them in the legislature passed a law it's OK don't come to us to services second legislature\nAnd I hope that that Kevin ... Roberts and Alito and and not Thomas I I Hope that's what\nThat's what they do in the future is don't come to us to impose new rules and the American people go to the legislature go to the Congress go to the states go to the city is going to the county that's where it belongs\n[laughter] you know the Democratic party bill\n... one ... in a ... a sure experiment and create this over here is my state

coming up in about five minutes from Corey Lewandowski top of the next hour we have Kevin Jackson near the blacks here\nTo talk about why he was like oh by Fox and the impact in the black community of

the lumber survey this is Fox News\nCorey Lewandowski welcome again to the bill Cunningham so Corey how are you I'm doing great how are you today\nDoing well you know about a week ago I spent some time with the president to privately it was wonderful you spent like hundreds or thousands of hours with the guy and I sit on the air the other day that uh\nThere there's a differential between what I see in the media sometimes with the president and how he truly is before we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that kind of stuff the idea of the American people a measure of the man himself\nWell you know I've spent so much time with a then candidate Trump and now President Trump and a truly cares about other people he's extremely\nUh magnanimous and private he is funny he's gracious he's always asking about how my family is doing and what he can do to help me that just who he is and if you listen to the media you know they tell you he's the worst human being on the planet help but the truth is he's exceptionally gracious I've seen\nIn so many times helping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help when every cat and\nWhy is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong ... Research Center ... well ... all one of my buddies\nEvery few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad and not the good\nWell they only report the bad and miss it ministry under the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working in any other time in our nation's history they'd conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about\nI here's a great example just last week I think it was a President Trump did an interview with Lesley Stahl for sixty minutes interrupted him sixty five times during that interview had to put that in comparison\nWhen sixty minutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him more times have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad\nNot to give him the credit that he deserves for the successes that he's had because they no longer in the business of reporting the news they're now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night in Montana framed it as mobs versus jobs the only difference is the Edmond J and I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh\nAlong about a trucks that ever trumps sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at the Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with tens\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose him there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the head\nOf the the cost of violence\nBy the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's a Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break you know that can not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember\nRepublicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with\nSarah Huckabee Sanders we found was secretary Nielsen ... we've seen with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life because the mob violence say antifa is so\nOut of control your goal on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better this president has created I think\nOver for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want this president if he didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences\nThat Democrats I hate to say this hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue that culturally it is acceptable didn't mean to fame and to make fun of an industry or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper that I Will watch nonetheless I saw it on\nYou see I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump was stripping nude in the oval office performing sex acts in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure you might sell a lot of lot of his songs and records not can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad depicted Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office in performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\nIt wouldn't be front page news for a week on and that wrap that the the country artist would have had his life\nProbably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back and just again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her\nI mean do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was no it was appropriate because she was an adult [noise] even if the president of the United states and leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior\nSee this in Texas and we've seen in other places that they're targeting individuals not us citizens and asking them to go and vote they are\nBought and sold by the Democratic party was illegal immigrants coming in here and they want to keep that flow to continue it doesn't make sense to me is our first obligation to the people in this country to make sure they are safe and secure and we\nAbsolutely need immigration there are jobs\nThat we need them to come and fill on a temporary basis but you're exactly right it come through the system your check you are authorized to come and you pay whatever fair share it is there is either vacation and then when your job is done you go back to your country how it works that that was always work and we just need to know better job enforcing that\nCorey Lewandowski Leslie there's been some speculation that a\nHillary Clinton is making Iran and twenty twenty you know I think Hillary Clinton did a great job as first lady\nShe was a wonderful United States senator she was a fabulous secretary's day and she was a wonderful candidate for the Democratic party\nIn twenty sixteen I Would encourage her to run I Would help her get signatures maybe raise the money for would you encourage Hillary Clinton to become the Democratic party's standard bearer standard bearer and twenty twenty when you do a great job\nWe love this look hundred and thirty two electoral votes two years ago that number is only going down she wouldn't be for the greatest loss of an election since Ronald Reagan's reelection effort when he destroyed his opponent and I think Donald Trump would end up with north of four hundred\n[laughter] after he beat Donald Trump\nBeat her by Seventy four electoral votes and what your listeners remember and when they woke up on a lecture at twenty sixteen times in mainstream media outlets said Hillary Clinton as a Ninety nine percent\nChance of winning today Ninety nine percent when we get to more than that only two people on the ballot so I Want her to run I run we want to\nGo back through all of her email scandal all the money that she's gotten from foreign governments when she was secretary of state in the Clinton Foundation and the fact that she's lost her security clearance political re litigated all let's put it back in front of the Democratic party\nNo car she'd be a wonderful candidate I mean I could not thinking of any one more qualified to represent the Democratic party than Hillary Rodham Clinton that would be a beautiful thing\nWell look if if if you have my help I think you and I can encourage her to clear the field a critic Sally this thing called the superdelegates maybe you've heard of these yeah that's\nHow she sold her last election from Bernie Sanders right we'll put back in place she'll ringing system just like she did it last time and she'll lose worse\nShe did a great job great job by Corey Lewandowski will do it again give me your production in about two weeks house in the Senate give me your production\n[noise] ah I think in the Senate Republicans gained four or five seats increasing the majority and in the house I'm going to say that it's a prediction the Republicans are going to hang on by two or three seats to retain the majority and keep the Trump Pence agenda moving forward\nGod Bless America Corey Lewandowski Trump campaign manager thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham showing my friend will do it again\nYou have a great day God Bless America let's

including Chuck Schumer and for the record gang for me and not just a a girl it's a guy to and Chuck Schumer the gang\nBecause he's a guy who was complicit in this later\nI'm from New York they're all people they just want to watch somebody be destroyed over a thick ideology known as left as him and I think it's pathetic and the far reaching ramifications impact the guys like Bill Cosby\nWho sits in the prison at the age of Eighteen years old and American icon\nSits in prison in his eighties over allegations that date back four or five decades meanwhile a guy who vowed then and I mean you know denial sex abuser Bill Clinton runs around here campaigning\nI tell you it was amazing ... you had a situation where he actually raped a woman who told us that Juanita Broderick\nWhen Clinton raped her what what's a bloody lamp told her a roommate what happened the roommate solved the blood on her lap saw her pantyhose was torn she actually had four or five corroborating witnesses as the event took place and then they also had the so called uh Arkansas state troopers confirming the fact\nThat the one eight abroad ... was actually raped and then you have while he's in the White House says president sexually groping and molesting Kathleen Willie in the White House\nAnd that was well known and corroborated but the media completely ignored both of those events because it didn't fit did it but it did go to go there Brett Kavanaugh\nAbsolutely and so that that's the double standard in in the bigger double than it has to do more with men\n... me too movement and trying to to I Love how the left tries to migrate thing how they try to get us to take ownership so the ownership of me too because a bunch of left us led truth Hollywood left these okay it's the Harvey Weinstein of the world with all these young on your news and he's\nOh school actresses and all these political feminist taking pictures at Harvey going to his party's extending its virtues that awards dinners and so on while enabling him to do exactly what he's been doing for women for decades\nDating back decades and all the trail of women who did exactly what Harvey ask them to do getting their butts ...\nOut and then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but then what's interesting to me to a ends up being\nA bill\nEnds up being part of a\nWoman being used against Kavanaugh being used against a high powered CEOs of companies [noise] this movement is born\nOf the lectures activities of left us in Hollywood\nThat and and and the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy and suddenly a guy like Kavanaugh they want to make him the poster child I mean it just it bores me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters on summer in terms positions with somebody ah Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama is elected Harvey Weinstein\nTo to take their daughters end of the Hollywood scene when they knew or should have known exactly what was going on from all their connections but they couldn't care less about Harvey Weinstein was a star\nOr rewind CNN access Harvey Weinstein was uh making millions of dollars and giving millions the Democratic party including the Obamas so they sent their own daughters end of the carrot custody in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nKnow they didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are untouchable but you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people there and a daughter that you don't that you got to be concerned about cause harm it will take advantage of them but the the what the what rock Obama's selling us\nI have so much power I Know that this guy that Electra is left is who will take advantage of women and every time but I could put my daughters with him but don't you dare put yours that's exactly how the left stacks up I can do it you can't because I'm covered but you're not\nAnd and look at it the less than it is a precautionary tale [noise] for many many boys I've said many times what harmless thing as your kid your son going to do at the age of Fifteen some woman's gonna come back twenty five thirty years later and say oh look at what you did to me more if he's not even going to remember it\nBeing like it's going to be insignificant to him and her but\nBecause something may be important in life she decide I'll take him down for what\nWell you know it was hanging by a thread two weeks ago and now he's on the court and I think the other issue I Want to get your perspective on this Kevin Jackson and the black sphere which is the what's happening now with the Honduran migrants\nComing through a Guatemala into Mexico there right now is three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward the Texas border this was a terrible event for the Democrats\nOver the next two weeks before the election they have the video and the pictures of thousands of migrants\nWhenever I watch MSNBC all I hear about is women and children then I see the video of these migrants coming to urban areas in America and they're almost always young males and the young women tend to be raped or sexually molested the men are drug meals and I'm sure there's good family members among them\nAnd Kevin Jackson of you and your wife and your children were in a\nOr in Honduras in a bill Cunningham and my wife and kids were in\nAnd we're in Honduras living the horrors of socialistic left wing military hunter regime\nThe first thing I Would want to do would be to get to America I understand that completely but along the process it gives billions of dollars damage Thirteen other gang bangers to provide a passage Everytime you go through some other drug infested area Mexico you got to pay\nHomage you gotta pay either sex or money or didn't pass through and and live by the time you get to the northern part of Mexico according to sixty minutes about two months ago there was hundreds of dead bodies because some men did not want to participate and becoming drug meals to give drugs into America\nSome women were killed because they did not want to be ritual is typically raped on a regular basis this is a horrible journey I watch MSNBC this is about refugee status of desperate people I watch other news outlets and this is terrible Trump's going to send supposedly\nOur soldiers to the southern border to stop it and all of this is playing out during an election that the Democrats supposedly have in the bag because hundreds of millions of dollars up to a billion and it's been pumped into these campaign or buy a Tom Styron by Bloomberg and others\nIn order to uh to me are Republicans all over the counter and get get get me over the next two weeks ... how's this going to play out at like ... or early on November the sect\nBut Democrats have missed every fine they no longer have their finger on the polls for the American electorate people want our border protected so they and they also get that this is fake news that's contrived it started as a hundred and sixty people now it's up to four thousand now\nAnd so what time did it the right thing he said under as these people show up losing their aid Mexico I guarantee he made the same call to the\nNew president of Mexico and say look if these people get where you were going to renegotiate our trade agreements we're going to look at the age that we're able to send you to Mexico to the polling military on the southern border that is heard this literally today\nGood so Mexico's going at it on doors I bet you will send buses the say you've got to you're going to get back to our country or else ... and ... what the lid how's it going to play out to Democrats again overplay their hand\n[noise] they think that there's some issue that is going to be the guy the you know the ... the division point\nWith Americans and Americans overwhelmingly want our borders protect that we don't want these migrating horns to think that they can just come anytime they want so whether whether it's the kind you back\nOr whether it's the

Brett Kavanaugh having been\nConfirmed for the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the road of the five of the five member majority who would be interested in raining in the administrative state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they are able to make\nCan you give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think the FCC I think the IRS\nBut you're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats about about one point two million strong new every day meeting offices mainly in Washington about our little all over the country\nAnd then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they started not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers\nAnd then they issue these three thousand new rules that day that must be complied with how much harm is not causing us\nI think it's causing a lot of harm in the center for businesses of course it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with\nCompliance activities are very extensive for business is one of the estimates that I have in the book is that each near it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nThough that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on through all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that these businesses so\nThat an important factor in the fact that ... trillion dollars this more than the government actually ... ah either from businesses are from individuals each year\nThey very significant thing but it can be turned back towel and be reduced give me\nThe idea here and described in the book is that the court can step in and begin to review carefully the legislation under which all of these rules are made and very frequently\nUm the rules are based on laws that were passed years ago or ... generations ago and they are perpetrated by the administrative agency to get it and the authority to all these new rules\nAnd the court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you're gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority that make this rule\nAnd there are a number of examples in the book where um you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so if the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude as necessary that's why the book is called a quarter to they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations\nOf um of administrative agency and we can actually beginning to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "22"}
