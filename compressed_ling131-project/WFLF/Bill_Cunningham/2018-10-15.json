said that the employees statement during their investigation was not consistent with what transpired on the video and he is no longer associated with the mold\nYeah it's almost as if the employees didn't realize there were video cameras in their own store\nRented it was pretty close yeah they\nAlways said this is a one time incident and this is a you know this has been a corporate store is a franchise but we still went ahead and took action uh because we know how quickly something like this can blow up a you see what happened with McDonalds and pay a fee and all the other stories that

say ready and we'll never ... [noise]\n[noise]\n... dirty is new run of the mill twenty two American light we restore [noise]\nWhich is unique hybrid blowback system\nDirty round magazine\nSo uh I was oh shut off to the side and I waited there about a half an hour\nForty five minutes wonder if it's going to happen or not I have the equipment with me so a a nice woman comes as the president's ready to see you now and I said well thank you so I walked ... walk back around came around the corner presidents like twenty feet away says bill hold on I'll be right with you\nI said I'm not going anywhere [laughter] I'm a I'm not going anywhere I'm right here\nSo he came up with some nice days he says he listens to me casually on Sunday night and thanks for what I Do on television for him I said no problem I Believe in what you're doing and I said this to him I said look either concerning twenty sixteen\nNow when you got elected you're going to be like in New York Republican kind of a moderate Republican you've turned out to be well beyond my expectations I said you make Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal Democrat what you're doing is that is fabulous so we exchanged more nicer these small talk and said you ready for it I said let's go\nI handed him a Mike and I took a Mike and I talk to him for like Thirteen minutes talked a little bit about the rally\nHappening a couple of hours later friday night we talked about the tariffs about Canada and Mexico talked about the show he talked about South Korea whenever the issues Kevin all whatever it was talking about Thirteen minutes and I said I'm going to run it Sunday night is that I may be listening\nAs Mr President thank you very much so we're going to play that interview and about a twenty twenty five minutes at the bottom\nAnd then later on we have a Bill O'Reilly coming up and also a diamond in silk or I think fabulous and diamond in silk reminded me\nHit 'em on two or three months ago about how dangerous it is for an African American to step out of line and not to be a liberal Democrat\nThere is no more loyal partisan voting bloc in America than African Americans especially African American women they vote like Ninety six percent democratic African American men vote about Ninety percent but there's no more loyal part isn't good for the Democratic party\nThan African Americans especially for American women some as diamond in silk about that but what happened Tuesday and Wednesday I think a ... was in the White House I might have been Tuesday or Wednesday\nAnd CNN hundreds Jeff Zucker viciously and racially using pejorative racial terms racism a tactic Kanye West\nBut courage sellers is a former Democratic office holder and South Carolina now he's a paid contributor to CNN said about Kanye West quote Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nSo he's you know he said he's illiterate stupid he went on to say quote Donald Trump is going to use it in pervert it and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures but then it gets worse CNN said terrorists set Meier\nWho's I coins herself as a former Republican said quote this ... this is an African American woman talking quote\nBlack folks are about to trade Kanye and the racial draft they've had it with him he's an attention whore like the president he's the token negro of the Trump Administration unquote\nSo you have an African American paid commentator saying number one she is speaking for all black Americans black folks are about to trade Tanya the racial draft they had it with him as she spoken to thirty five million blacks and that's what they tell her\nAnd and it really couldn't it got much worse so racism was used by CNN\nShe went on to say quote no one should take Conyers seriously he clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized unquote\nJimmy Kimble\nSaid that he's irrational and the madman snoop doggy dog a doggy citizen\nUncle Tom and so entertainers\nComics late night comics have gone after in the past Clarence Thomas\nAnd Jessie Molly Peterson in Colin Powell and Benjamin Carson in ... and others for being disloyal to the Democratic party when the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them practically every chance they have\n... it's incredible to watch what's going on\nBack for the past half century Ninety percent of black voters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest the Democrats have consistently opposed school choice trapping kids and failing public schools\nFor generations they've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which is destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's pro NAFTA policies\nWhich have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities they've also Democrats who crippled a black families by embracing welfare writes the penalize married couples to get married it goes on and on and on\nAnd this was all set in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon who laughed with venomous ... and what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr you sell the racial pejorative against them they would be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history\nWhich CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south headed control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners had to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan\nAs a terrorist arm of the Democratic party\nTo intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy any political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard\nLater on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy test\nAnd other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats\nBecause the sample shouldn't media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control way of what I watch free thinking African American men and women be partially destroyed\nBy CNN and the mainstream media Democratic Party\nAnd so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low criminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter of black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity\nAnd so what happened and Kanye West\nIs the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas to Jesse ... Peterson the Congolese arise to any black who steps out of line they're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill\nBy Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed against a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints\nThat is why CNN working with the Democratic party much destroy Kanye West and and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks\nWe'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party\nHas done to them and not for them the truth is\nJust take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee the schools are completely dysfunctional that black family is completely broken there's no job creation\nThe average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West steps out of line and begins to express support\nFor a different political outlook he has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book\nBecause it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in law and they want to dissuade other African American men from thinking an acting independently of the Democratic party that is cause such harm can you think a worst cities to live in\nOne control by crime\nPoverty single mothers academic failure racial inequality that is the result whether whatever black city it is controlled by Democrats what occurs\nOne last thought before we hear from President Trump is the media\nUses cut jewels in weapons\nTo hit politically Trump every chance they get and once they wear out that person you don't hear from 'em anymore right now it is ... shows you a good show ... who's the Saudi Arabian citizen\nWho was in Turkey in order to get like a permission to marry some uh some Turkish woman he goes to the Saudi Arabian Amazon and could show he has not been seen since October the second now this happen in Turkey is Dan both turkey and it appears probable\nA Saudi Arabian citizen was killed\nIn Istanbul, Turkey somehow Trump was responsible for this they want the president to respond to see the media used Julie sweating it for awhile dispose of her when\nThe allegations of gang rape and Michael ... whose father Michael Evan Eddie is doing a great job speaking for the Democratic party\nIt'd be wonderful that guy would stay in the media for the next couple of years it'd be great if he was a nominated the Democratic party the porn lawyer fits the modern Democratic Party that guy's done a great job you take Julie sweating ache\nOr Deborah Ramirez or Christine forward I haven't heard from them in a while I have you because the media is done using them to attack Trump or Stormy Daniels was the last time you heard from her\nOr Karen McDougal in love with the president fourteen years ago Access Hollywood tape but Billy Bush\nThe comments on John McCain the Khan family Kanye West Jim Brown whatever it is right now it's all about Jamal could show ... somehow media want you to think the president's not responding correctly to the murder maybe I'm a Saudi Arabian ...\nAs if to six or seven hundred blacks killed in Chicago every year can't be used at all by the mainstream media against Trump's the big north or the four thousand shot they can't be used\nIn Chicago to attack the president so they ignore it but whatever the media can find some ... some club to hit the president what they're going to do it\nLet's continue with more coming up next as my interview with the president doesn't know the top of the last to our Web Bill O'Reilly factor is on tonight also in about an hour or so we\nHave diamond in Sacramento going to call in from the Carolinas to talk about how black women support someone like Donald Trump when the media attacks blacks who get jump out of line but it's like a southern slave owners would keep blacks are dumb down and illiterate that's the goal of the modern Democratic Party to keep them in line [noise]\nContinue thirty minutes after they are do counting under great American live with you [noise] every something [noise]\n\n\nFox News I might be awesome mounting tensions between the United states and Saudi Arabia Fox has grown all Scott\nVaries by partners in sentiment against allowing a multibillion dollar arms deal if the disappearance and possible death of Jamal cause show geek is linked to Saudi leaders Saudi Arabia has threatened to retaliate against any sanctions with that statement said an even stronger measure\nChris Yogi was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Turkey October second the president got some help from his director of the national economic council explaining his feelings about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates\nIs not telling them or mandating them to change their strategy is not found them to change their policy\nLarry Kudlow on ABC's This week this is Fox News [noise]\n[noise]\nOkay here's the deal Monday Night I got a call from the White House president would like to see you friday night when he's in Cincinnati I said of course\nI wanted to go watch a high school football game where the relative playing but I thought well this is pretty important so on Wednesday I made a request to the White House to do a short interview\nWhich of the White House should said should be kept to about five minutes if it's granted I said okay actually turned out to be almost Fifteen minutes because the president and I had so much fun so I met the president in a hanger on friday evening\nAnd about an hour later he was going to go speak in ah north of Cincinnati about thirty miles north of Cincinnati and Warren County and they are at a Republican gathering of which twenty thousand people show up and little Warren County while standing in a field with a light rain and cold dark\nAnd the sun was down it must have been forty forty five degrees the president let 'em up\nSo well on friday night the White House said no problem I met with the president\nDid like a Thirteen fourteen minutes interview and the references to about an hour from our relate to the what was going on in orange county\nAnd then yesterday Saturday he was in Kentucky and ah and beautiful and I think he did he told me off the off air is going to be doing this three or four nights and the next three weeks and he said I got more energy about this than I've ever had\nSo here's my talk with the president that uh was approximately seven pm on friday night tater headed\nFirst of all Mr President welcome to Cincinnati thank you you have a long distance relationship here I Do I have had ... ships I had swift in\nWith my father a long time ago and we uh we did a good job we fix it up [noise]\nWe uh eleven hundred and sixty four year underserved remember the exact we fix it if I worked here for two summers sick if I ... that's right right by since I don't even know if it's still there are no and knocked down about six months ago all really yellow and gone the whole thing including ... everything's on what's going to happen\nWith the backing of housing development oh okay good but it was great for us we fixed it\nAnd sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city was talking about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWill he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it it's like just seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama said one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd we got him back and he's going to be safer shortly he's in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll in the in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted it back\nHappened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure as very happy right now about\nYour wife is a good chance to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal and what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise] but uh and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty a\nIt was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and I know the kids were beautiful they loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they need it it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just that one of the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat is that why what did you do with the trade deal\nAnd we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because there was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominee you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were taken so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make and I said we're going to tax you cars coming in then what happened and they made a deal made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just had to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much are much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so\nHow many jobs and talking to my every time I can or Mexico will be talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff to make a big deal if they have three hundred\nBut we had it in Pennsylvania the other night with twenty five thousand people outside of a twelve thousand it already and it's been amazing and if that kind of you know action shows up in three weeks and you imagine it's just a little more than\nThree we got the energy for the next three weeks because you're like Elvis lower and that Nineteen sixty eight yeah I Know is that good old I got three more weeks loved ... three weeks and while I have\nTwenty five days and twenty five days I'm Out campaigning for many

Leslie solved it on the president\nAnd it's amazing plus the interview with a millennia Trump on friday and I thought was ridiculous about our hat\nAnd a jacket that she wore and a fashion statement she was making it's just ridiculous how the media covers that you know media Research Center and my friend Brent ... says that Ninety three percent of the media coverage of Trump is negative I think it's higher than that I don't recall\nWith all these great things happening the media objectively covering the Trump Administration give me fifty fifty somebody's talking the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC\nOr the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper Hollywood movies too late night comics are all one way and and I said I I guess it's group think because they all live in either Hollywood or New York\nBut but it can you imagine if CBS or ABC would say you know what we're going to go a different direction we're going to start covering the news objectively we're going to have conservatives from top to bottom in America is a conservative country right thirty two states are controlled by ... or a Republican governors\nHouse the Senate Supreme Court we are basically a moderate to right wing or conservative\nOne of CBS would say from top to bottom organ or is that what we're going to reflect conservative values and cover the news objectively\nI think those of us who are normal would flock to CBS News and the ABC and NBC and CNN would take one alibi hit the only one that is conservative more or less right now is Fox you know if they're leaning left quite often were Shepard Smith and people like that\nAnd you see what the ratings have Hannity are every night Sean draws about four million viewers every night so those kinds of interviews I just conducted was their regular event on CBS Evening news or ABC I give up any hope for NBC\nThose ratings would double and triple\nAnd it would become the dominant evening newscast if somehow one of the other ones would say you know what from top to bottom we're going to reflect the values of people in this country that that are pro God pro family pro military pro police and we're going to reflect that\nAll you gotta do is look at Newsmax TV or a one American network and you find conservative values in the news that reflects the American people so let's continue\nWhenever calls from California Texas North Carolina Louisiana and Ohio\nHave long becomes available number to call his eight six six six four seven seven three ... three seven in about thirty minutes ... those questions in about an hour from now Bill O'Reilly will be able to rally factor will be on tonight we're killing the ss and I'm going to get a bill ... take on the events of the day including the\nSo called murder or Saudi Arabian and turkey is if that's the dominant story all world the media wants Trump to do something about it\nHow about the media demanding that Rahm Emanuel do something about seven hundred black Americans killed this year in Chicago wouldn't it be great if CNN one after Rahm Emanuel the way they go after Donald J drop would that be great\nPlus I Want to get your reaction to the extent of the interview\nThank you let me say I'm a black senior citizen grandmother um a few months shy of eighty six years old and the Democrat Party have used blacks for that boat for fifty sixty Seventy years and what do we have to show for it\nWhen I left the Democratic party though and I have not regret it leading not one second and I and I want to really talk to to to the black community me a major city\nThat under that liberal room that has passed which to me [noise] academically\nAnd economically you cannot show me what and let me tell my sisters and brothers what the

deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with south Chris ...\nHow many jobs and talking to my every time I can or Mexico we're talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab to make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall\nBecause if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they uh they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries they have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and onions and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even know like that", "year":
