{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "Yeah oh well first of all welcome it is great to have you here thank you I thought it might be interesting if we would get to know a little bit about your family so is there anything that you'd like to to share\nWe enjoy each other [laughter] yeah yeah yeah our house is a lot of fun my uh wife Amy and I we've been married for\nSeventeen years and we have four children uh the oldest is Fifteen youngest is\nEight and yeah we just we have a lot of fun we have for chickens than a dog and I and we live in the city of St Louis so you're allowed to have chickens in the city and just to give you a view and our our family life we had a Fox\nAttack our chickens a couple of nights ago and my Fifteen year old son and I drug ourselves after our daughter woke us up and said the chickens are screaming the my son and I had to go out with flashlights and few off the Fox and\nUm I didn't get a great night sleep at night but that's just kind of our house and a lot of energy an action and my wife is always make things fun and the kids do as well\nLet's talk about the your work uh Lutheran our speaker each speaker that we've had has spoken to a particular context and its issues you represent now a different generation of Luther and our speaker what do you see as the great challenge of our context\nOr as I understand the organization we are an outreach organization and I think the challenge that we have is the same challenge that everyone in the church has that our our culture at least in North America has shifted and there's some church hurt and some\nSkepticism and I'll often\nApathy towards what we have to say and of course I Want to share Jesus and I want to share the word of God and so I think that's the challenge is how to bridge into that that apathy and sometimes a anger towards the church\nAnd our listeners might be interested to know that besides being the river and Dr Michael Vick or you're also lieutenant colonel\nMichael Ziegler in the United States Air force reserve tell us a little bit about your military background and maybe get into the transition that you made from air force to the seminary years ago\nMy dad served in the military for Twenty one years in the air force\nAnd for one of those assignments we were stationed in Colorado Springs which is the home of the air force academy and we had season tickets to the football games\nAnd when I saw all the kid that's in their service dress run to the end zone and do push-ups whenever the falcons would scored a touchdown I knew that I wanted to do that I didn't know what did it all but it just looked at like ... really cool and so that had been my lifelong dream is to go to the air force academy and\nThanks be to God it happened I almost didn't get in I actually got rejected and then a month later he got a call from a the ... the senator who got me my er my nomination and and said hey you still want to go to the air force academy and I fell on the ground it was so excited that my my dream was coming through\nAnd I served a five years on active duty I wasn't a chaplain actually a lot of people ask me that\nI I served as an aircraft maintenance officer in a air mobility command which is all the big plane's cargo planes and the arrow medical evacuation and air air refueling those planes you\nOne of the things when we were going through all the candidates I'm a for the new speaker one of the things that stood out to me was that you have a a distinctly different style in preaching\nYou talk just a little bit about how you develop your your preaching style\nMy desire is to be conversational and I think it relates back to the question mark asked about the challenges that we use preachers face today there's a there's a book you probably know the title as as one without authority or I don't remember who wrote it but that's we we can't\nAs preachers or the gospel it doesn't work as well the lead with our story and so how else can we lead to connect with people connect them to Jesus and so that was part of it is just a desire to be conversational to the desire for me to be interested in what I'm saying and to become a\nA student of the Bible anew every time I go back to the text\nYeah this is a unique opportunity now that you're just starting out and people listening getting to know you a little bit more ... if there was one goal that you had in mind for what you hope God would do through your time here oh what would that be what drew me to this organization is that\nThe love of the last and to focus on outreach and that's what my goal\nRight now as I can imagine it is to help that effort to be a small part of that larger effort Lutheran our ministries is much bigger than just a loser now or were reaching out all over the globe but if I can be a small\nPart of that to to speak to people who are on the on the fringe of the Christian faith or outside of the skeptics send the half believers\nAnd that's a lot of us who go to church every week and took to try to speak to wear those to come together where a someone who goes to church but it's not quite sure if they really believe all this and and then to some someone who's completely skeptical about at all how can we\nReached them and saw what I Hope from from the listeners is that we'd be able to create something that they could share\nYou know you you send send this to the the pod cast linked to your grandson to your granddaughter your niece or nephew and say hey listen to this and let's talk about me for coffee\nTo learn how you can support the world wide outrage moved to run our ministries Goto Lutheran our dot org\nOh\n\n\nOh\n\n\nOh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh\nOh\n\nOh\nOh oh oh\nOh\nSo oh\n\n\nOh\nOh\nOh\nNo doctors

Orlando news radio not even remotely\nWFL Larry\nWorship under fire I'm Pam who sounds Fox News gunfire out of kindergarten in Pittsburgh\n[noise]\nThe bottom line is is that you can do a lot better buying than you would if you uh were renting in my opinion yeah and I didn't agree more of it I mean plus too when you go into an apartment they're running your credit half of the time you have to have decent credit anyways if not they're going to charge you an extra deposit\nSo that same credit that you're getting you know with the rental is probably the same credit that you could use to purchase a home\nAnd like you mentioned I mean you know two three months is usually what they require to move in that's almost the same you would qualify with a down payment if you needed or there's so many programs you know that they could qualify for ... right that could possibly help with that\nUm so I mean to me it's a no brainer yeah\nIf so if you're just joining us You're listening to news radio Ninety three point one WFL a than his talk station in Orlando\nI'm your hosts Laura Peterson Frank it real cheap your homes sold guaranteed her I'll buy it this is central Florida real estate radio with you every Sunday at eight o'clock joining me today as Daniel who may one of my teammate Frankie royalty and Chris urban with butler mortgage remember if you want to reach any of us you can call for seven five six six\nTo five five five or pound to fifty on your cell and the key word is real estate\nSo another thing that um I think is that that is a big thing that comes up on we're talking about what ranchers thinking in regards to homeownership and it costing more\nIs the rental satisfaction because a lot of times when you're actually renting a home you know if you're renting a home first of all you can't do anything with it you can't pay the wild usually or mhm do any of those things that you want to make it your ... your own it used to be that they'd have a problem with you\nPutting stuff on the walls but if you use command you can probably put stuff on the walls today that you weren't necessarily able to do before but um you know it's like if you are in a complex and\nThere's people above you below you you know everywhere\nAround you you know sometimes when they built those those rental units they're a they're a coup steaks or whatever shall we say are not as good as if even if it were a condo yet you can hear your neighbors and everything that's going on I saw it was a commercial that I saw on TV but I thought it was pretty funny that\nYou know somebody within they're looking at a rental unit and the guy on one side said\nOh you can hear everything and then the other guy from the other side heard the other guy said something about yeah I can hear your jobs you know like through the it's\nLike well I guess this is not the place for me [laughter] but usually when you're looking at those places you know you definitely don't know um you know what's going on or what you can hear and not here because when you're looking at it nobody usually there so you don't necessarily know what the situation is exactly what thank goodness\nThey were having a conversation amongst [laughter] right [laughter] exactly yeah but um and that doesn't exist\nIn up places ... [laughter] but the thing is is that you know when you look at the tax benefits for most people and everything like that um that that a dead again\nReduces your cost of homeownership when it comes down to it mhm and so there's there's great tax incentives that are out there with being able to write off your mortgage insurance or not insurance your interests\nAnd your interest is the bulk of what your payment is so you get a tax deduction you know for that I mean most people do I mean everybody's cases a little bit different\nBut um you know you can talk to your account and about it and you you could probably find that not only are you gaining an asset as the years go on because your um building equity in paying it off but then you've got the appreciation and everything that comes on top of it and everything like that as well\nAnd the appreciation is such a huge thing that has continued to be um over the last ten years very prevalent here in central Florida well\nSince two thousand ten thousand ten with when everything kinda hit bottom and as a result of that you know we've had a steady increase pretty much from there and nothing you know overwhelming but we've had a consistent increase year over year\nNot saying that it's going to continue forever because there's always ... up and down but when it's your home you know if you're living there it doesn't matter if the price goes down a few thousand or up a few thousand it's not really going to affect you today but over the long term it definitely is\nSo um so basically you know when it comes down to it you know that that um\nYou know owning is better than renting so in order to get in touch with his four seven five six six\nFive five five or ... pounds to fit the key word real estate\nI find this on line at Central Florida real estate radio dot com\nBeginning of selling your home but want it so fast and for top dollar Hi this is W.

heard it front gate um your homes sold guaranteed or will buy it to discuss the sale of your home you can call for a seven five six six she five five five or on your cell hit pound to fifty and the key word is real estate\nSo um we were talking about before the break that you know it goes to underwriting you've got some conditions those conditions get cleared and then when the conditions are cleared then you have a clear to close so what happens with your loan at that point\nYes so the the all the heavy lifting is pretty much done at this point we've cleared under writing and\nAnd now there's some certain federal regulations we have to meet 'em there the ... the final settlements day Mitt today's called causing disclosure if you purchase homes years ago you probably heard it called a HUD right um so today we call it a closing disclosure\nUm now the new law's record that causing the schools are to be signed by you as a buyer three days before closing\nUm or if if they mail it for whatever reason than that that when we have to wait seven days so we do at the most lenders are banks have a system at least I Know we do where we sent it to electronically like we do pretty much any other documents\nYou each sign it and once that's done we can official close three days after that date now typically a an get and everyone is a little different we liked to have your final numbers established between us and the title company so what happens is or me or my clothes in the ... and the title company or making sure that all the numbers are right down to the penny\nUm if people can only charged for what they charge for the service were in it and of course\nCertain things between you and the seller everything's made were making sure that they're one hundred percent exact\nOnce that's done then we'll send you that causes disclosure for signature and at that point once you've signed that we're all set for closing will will will talk to you about wiring your funds typically most political parties require you to water the amount of money you need\nDirectly to the company and then obviously we're between ah usually one of us were sabotaging a date and in in the time for closing\nWhich is awesome and so I'm so from that clear to close to closing what how much time is that is that the three day period than ...\nThree days and what happens a lot um is typically because may agree with me I think most contracts are typically thirty day contract right uh-huh I'm In which is\nProbably more time than we need most of the time now days I'm usually done about twenty twenty five days and so if the title can do is prepared we're we're getting a quote un quote un disclosure to you before maybe even a week of closing but as long as we've met a three day requirement doesn't matter at any point in time after that through the day we can close\nSo it just gives you a peace of mind because you're done in advancing they don't have to worry and again there's no last minute headaches or anything like that exactly so um so a new thing that I saw this week that it was just release 'em and Las Vegas with experience and\nAnd then the ... and the city um that they announced a new\nCredit score that's gonna be coming out in two thousand Nineteen that's called an ultra psycho score so\nAnd it's supposedly going to be easier for the consumer to get\nA more clear picture and higher score and that kind of thing and what it does is that it is also going to include consumer um contributed data such as checking savings and money market account data\nThat reflects consumers financial management responsibilities so with that so have you heard anything about that\nSo for the basis for the know about it as like you said if I'm if you've gotten if you had your credit pulled and let's say in a well six hundreds you can at that point asked\nFor an ultra credit score poll I'm In at that point that's when they're going to corporate you're you're pretty much a liquid assets um and so then it can utilize that maybe give you a higher score um it kind of reminds me of just like about a year ago or so maybe it's been about a year and a half when I'm training data came out on credit\nUm and what that was supposed to do is if you have someone who knew credit it was a predictor of okay you're training in a in this kind of odd way way and so they give you a better score\nSo being that this is a new program from understand it's like a soft launch and Jerry next year yeah I'm always curious about how the the loan programs are going to treat this because they can end up setting up the guidelines for no matter what happens here [laughter] yeah\nNo and and it's so it's it's something that they're going to test it says at the beginning of twenty Nineteen and then as the year progress is and if everything goes well then they're gonna do a hard line shove it like mid twenty Nineteen\nSo that's a lot of testing and everything that has to ... it has to be done and I'm you know so you don't know if it's going to be a good or bad thing or whatever and but it's not something that's going to be required it sounds like it sounds like something that's going to be if you want to boost like you said as opposed to something that's going to be required at least at this\nTime reading it so far as well yes yeah\nSo if you're just joining us You're listening to news radio Ninety three point one WFL a news taxation and our land do I'm your hosts Laura Peterson Frank ... we're home so guaranteed by it\nThis is central Florida real estate radio with your every Sunday at eight o'clock joining me today is Danielle who may one of my teammates that Frank ... real cheap and Chris urban with butler mortgage\nRemember if you want to reach any of us you can call for seven five six six\nShe five five five or on your cell you can hit\nDoesn't even entice them and that's enough to come in on the inside and so you know one of things that we offer\nIs that we offer that we're willing to come and you know point out things to you the little things that you can do because it's usually about the little things that you have to do it's usually not\nBig things that you have to do but little things that you have to do in order to\nYou know improve your house to the point where it's going to make the the um best impression and what we like to do is actually give like a honey do list of things that would put your house and the best foot forward in order to get the house sold fast in for top dollar mhm because that's\nThat's basically what it comes down to and you know a lot of times you know the things that can be done and and it's like you just are when you look at it your house you think oh yeah this is my house and you don't really see\nYou know the little things that have maybe happened to it you know it's it's like like for example I went into the guest bathroom at my house the other day\nAnd it had cracked walled plate and I'm like going how in the heck is wildly correct you know but there there are those little plastic well plates that costs like sixty cents yeah and so all of the sudden they crack I mean how they can be one day not cracked and the next day correct I have no idea\nBut um you know I probably should by the more expensive ones but um you know that white when that looks really white I think it looks nice and so anyway so but it's like things like that that it's like you just don't even notice as you're going through your house and looking at it yourself\nAnd so with a trained eye and knowing what people like because we're with fires all the time ... to see what the buyers are looking for and what turns them off and they walk into a house\nAnd the kids you cannot take it personal no like do not you know take offense if I come in like you said you know cracked walled played I mean if I'm just going to point out something to you like don't take offense to it because we did have one um client one time you know she had a lot of um\nYou know artifacts from her culture and then a lot of like um godly things and stuff it was great I mean it was really nice it was pretty\nSome of the stuff from her culture I mean the colors are so vibrant but it was so overpowering that when people would come in they got turned off right away because that was like the first thing that they would look at you know\nAnd I had to explain to her you know if you could please pasta maybe just tone it down a little bit boy she was so offensive of it I understand because you know obviously it's her culture it's are bringing up you know things like that but she was very upset with me that I mentioned that to her but that was just from the feedback that I'd gotten from numerous clients you know like oh and we walked in and you know I felt\nThat the you know the the people are looking at me or something but it was just the way that they were that it was there so it's like you just don't want to take offense to you know we're trying to get your household like lord said for top dollar\nYou know make it his ... you know smooth transition for both people for both the sellers into buyers and sometimes that's a little bit over overwhelming for some people like you mentioned you know you you went into a house or I think it's a family member that has a bear collection and the thing it's like you know you don't think of it because it's something that you just keep you know\nBringing in bringing in but there's another ... come in and then you're ... oh my God this other stuff on the line you know are the ones that are you know your your teddy bear it exactly so\nYou know but it's again some people say hone in on that so they're going to lose hindsight of your house because there are so focused on what you have going on and it\nProbably important from the remember that you know people have different opinions and exact into if you you really like if you didn't want top dollar for so you've got some crime sometimes cater a little bit yeah\nAnd when ... ... you know it's like you have to remember that when you are selling your house that it's not your home anymore because you've already you're moving on\nAnd so it's going to be somebody else's effect and so in order to get the top dollar you know it's like you have to kind of ignore what somebody else is saying because it and to take offense to it either again not taking it personally because\nThey're going to do what they want to do to it and um you know you're going to be able to do what you want to and unfortunately they're probably going to do a lot of things that you did or do the things that you did and it's just a matter of personal preference and style\nWell we just bought a house or two weeks ago and\nAnd um the new owner we didn't meet him you know haven't met him one time so he came over on Saturday to show my husband a couple of things because there's some things that my husband just can't figure out so\nThe guy comes over oh my gosh like he started to cry because we have taken out like all the bushes and the friend were not Bush people like bushes or not our thing trees or not our thing we're just not into any of that and so my husband took all the bushes down all the plants from the front\nAnd the guy was so upset because he lived in that home for like thirty something years and he's like I just can't believe that you would take those down you know and I felt so bad for him but it's like you said like you know they're selling it so you got to ...\nAnd we've already close I mean the bottom of their money we put our money so it was like you know but he was so upset\nAnd then he said to me why can't even remember my wife by because I think she would be so upset that you took that out but and I'm like well we did not do it in any way shape or form like the mess anybody up or make anybody mad we're just not up keeping type of political\nYou know what I mean they're making the home your own ... and then we painted it and he was like I Can't believe it and I'm like oh my gosh you know what I mean so I said well what are we don't drive down the street or because I don't want to do that but\nIt's just like you said I mean you know you gotta let it go and you know but yeah he was so upset with me I was\nLike oh my God I feel about the man and he's already mad at me [laughter]\nSo if you're just joining us You're listening to news radio Ninety three point when WFL a than effect station in Orlando I'm your hosts Laura Peterson Frank it real t._v. you're home filled guaranteed her I'll buy it this is central Florida real estate radio with you every Sunday at eight o'clock\nJoining me today is Daniel who may win and my teammates at Frank it real tea and Chris urban with butler mortgage remember if you want to reach any of us call for oh seven five six six to five five or on your cell pound to fifty and the key word is real estate\nNow one of the things that I was thinking of when you were to when you were talking about that is you know and there might be weird things that we might say hey you know do this and all that kind of stuff\nYou know if you can I mean a lot of the neighborhoods obviously in central Florida and homeowners' associations they can't do this but um you know this is that when I got this chip actually from a customer\nThat he was saying that where he moved is\nThat they painted the door yellow like bright yellow\nAnd you think you know why in the world which a paint your dirt bike bright yellow but when people would go away from that has that where they were that's what they remember if the yellow door house so whatever their impression was that yellow door house it was going to stand out and be different than all the other houses that people saw because nobody had that\nSun shine bright yellow door and it really does drive home the point that it is something that that home is going to belong to somebody else and they're going to do different things to you know we have gotten\nUm offers accepted because the people were loved everything that the homeowner had done yeah and they weren't going to change anything and\nSo they are they're offer was less money and a lot more hassle and all that kind of stuff but they didn't care because they were going to keep everything the way that it was and so that you know it's like it's an emotional thing

I wanted to talk to you if I wait hold on I just got a text there's another wow\n... ... they may so anyway I just kind of keep comic comic\nAnd plug\nTake your family to the force\nThere's nothing in the world like experiencing nature first hand\nTrees NASA liver\nScreams getting closer to nature\nTo find the forest nearest you go to discover the forest [noise] dot org\nToo by the U.S Forest Service and the\nThis is Bob Edgar you know you can drop to Joel ... financial planning right now on dollars in San ... about anything to do with your money why falling into seven nine one six and fix the four hundred and give them a call in the times that make sense if your dollar\nWelcome back to the program ladies and gentlemen dollars and cents\nHere on news radio Ninety three point one WFL a this is Joel garrison of Nelson financial planning we're talking a little bit about some important concepts particularly given the markets recent behavior staying calm staying cool and most importantly\nStaying invested we started the conversation off with a very simple concept it's a simple concept of inflation\nInflation that means that I have to spend six times as many dollars to get the same amount of gas that I as I did back in Nineteen Seventy I have to spend three times as many dollars as I did today as I did back in Nineteen Seventy to get a gallon of milk if we look\nAt the\nAt those returns are those costs over an extended period of time we fine that over the course of the past forty odd years inflation has run out and about three and a half percent that\nBecomes your bogey if you will your threshold that you've got to be making otherwise you're losing I don't care how secure you think your money is or how guaranteed your money is effectively it's generating only a two or three percent return now\nThen you're losing money you're\nNot guaranteeing any thing not preserving anything 'cause it's getting eroded every single day by the power of inflation so now if you start to look at the\nDifferences in returns as we go up inflation and cash and then we looked at bonds bonds\nOver the course of the past forty years delivered about us six seven percent return\nHey that's starting to get a little bit better okay if I'm\nGoing to be diversified certainly want to own some portion of that I Would count soul folks of course over the course of the past ten years hasn't been anywhere near that\nSo that would suggest that I certainly\nDon't want to be over loaded on that side of the equation again what's my bogey three and a half that's inflation and I got at least be doing better than that\nBecause just to stay ahead of inflation let alone a guy trying to generate out some income and and that ultimately increases over time as\nThings get more expensive and the last child to\nGory courses that category we believe in the most you can tell you why do we believe in them the most because it's hard to argue with long term results than doing this for Twenty years seen a lot of ups and downs of the market and guess what\nThere is no better alternative to invest\nYour money and achieving long term investment results than having a portfolio that is in fact or owns\nThe majority of which in that portfolio is\nStocks [noise] yeah\nSorry you're gonna have to be a shareholder of Amazon you're going to have to be a shareholder of Microsoft you're going to have to be a shareholder of Home Depot you're going to have to be a shareholder of Coca Cola\nRight wait a minute\nWhen I own stocks it see I think far too often people forget what it is\nWhen they have an investment portfolios because it is not in any way shape or form what\nThose Yahoo's on CNBC or a year yeah burn about twenty four hours a day seven days a week\nThat's not it folks\nThat's a company whose businesses advertising that's how they make their money by selling ads\n\nGot nothing to do with the quality of the financial guidance that they are a spouse or\nIt's\nA circus it's\nAkin to watching a sports program that's what they've done to it\nRight if you watch it it's got the screen thing going on at the bottom just like ESPN they've got the latest score the latest look in the breaking news alert the time to to win the next fed right decision is the bitcoin little box I mean\nCome on that's got nothing to do with helping you\nPlan a retirement and achieving investment results over it's it's not it's got nothing the furthest thing from that\nBut yet\nThat's what we gravitate to that's what we fix on by the way the return of socks over the course of the past forty odd years right around about eleven percent\nThat's where allocation comes into play owning large companies owning maybe some mid in small maybe owning some bonds maybe owning some international those types of concepts when you look\nAre the way to achieving a well diversified well balanced allocation\nNow what's\nThe single biggest limitation of diversification the single biggest limitation of diversification [noise]\nThat would be that not everything in your portfolio is going to be performing as good as everything out\nThat's the reality right being diversified means at any given point in time you have stuff that's doing well and stuff that's not doing as well as the stuff that's doing well\nThat's the reality and and when you look at your account if you're looking for the if you get too busy looking at the trees and not the forest you start to say my goodness\nWhy do I own this particular tree right now because it's not generating as much as that particular tree\nThe tourist example of that particularly\nSo far this year it would be this notion of large kept growth versus large ... value large cab growth companies like Amazon Facebook Netflix those types of companies large ... value being companies\nLike BP and ... Proctor and gamble a you know the companies that generally pay a dividend are not as exciting as a Netflix or Amazon and certainly don't get\nThe kind of conversation in the financial media as Proctor and gamble on the uh the main Home Depot I mean they still hammering next in would mean\nA boring it's that Amazon they deliver stuffed at my doorstep and like two hours at a really exciting\nBut guess what when you look\nAt the performance since October first of those two particular asset classes you may be curious to ...\nI Know that that more boring asset class has only gone down about sixty percent of what that more exciting asset class has gone down\nCheck it out if you look at your if your investments that finally you'll you should see that pattern\nWhereby the large gross stuff might have gone down eight of the large value stuff done only went down fine Mm diversification spreads my risk around\nAnd at the end of the day that certainly helps to produce a much more consistent return because when you look at how that plays out in terms of the numbers after all when you are retired and here's the fundamental concept\nWhen you are retired your the single biggest issue\nIs consistency of performance\nYou really don't want to be hitting a home run one year and striking out the next you really want\nA diversified portfolio singles ... maybe a double or two every now and then that's the way to ultimately reduced down the volatility in your portfolio and achieve that investment\nResult overtime allocation diverse vacation and and uh uh from time to time doing some rebalancing along the way also works as well\nOr rebalancing is if I've got stocks bonds stocks at Seventy five bonds at twenty five and then all of a sudden my stocks are now at sixty five and my sons are at thirty five you would rebalance take ten percent out of the bonds shifted over to the stocks are the benefits\nOf rebalancing cannot be under state it\nYou've got to watch the numbers in terms of when that rebalancing means to be done usually that rebalancing is good to do some folks like to do it every year\nWe like to give it a little bit more time than that but the reality is that that concept of re allocating assets along the way\nMakes a an awful lot\nMore sense now for those folks that are just starting out\nRemember it is time in the market not timing I think one of the biggest issues that that that new investors have is they always wonder what's the best time to invest\n[noise] ... and the and the hard part of that is\nThat you're never going to be able to predict that\nBut understand how the rates of return work and the power of that time and how that plays into ... into account so there's a very simple math rule that's the rule of Seventy two he takes Seventy two and you divide it by the ... the rate of return and that tells you\nHow quickly\nThat amount is going to double in value okay so we'll play a little example going back to inflation three percent three percent divided by Seventy two that's about or Seventy divided by three percent three percent that's about twenty four\n[noise] every twenty four years\nInflation is basically going to a road fifty percent of your dollars if you think about those analogies of gas and milk that we were talking about the being in in the program it's about what that's a\nOut what it looks like if you've got a bond portfolio that's six percent return overtime than six Seventy two is about twelve twelve years\nIf you've got to stock portfolio\nYou do that math then that's about six or seven years you get the draft it's really more when you're trying to build wealth over time it's really more about time in ... and certainly not\nTiming because the power of that compound in the power of that math\nPlays out dramatically over a period of time it it really really is a pretty\nIt's significant difference and a pretty significant power of compounding\nThat occurs over that extended period of time now hopefully\nYou've enjoyed a lot of the stats and figures and and I will get to the punch line\nWhich is why should I stick to the plane why should I stick to the plan when every other media person is saying and K uh all\nHope is law [laughter]\nI'm here's why\nAnd it's pretty important and it deals with the mountain\nHeron volatility of the market\nWill tell you that right after these messages here on dollars and cents with Joel Garrett's of notes and financial planning news radio Ninety three point one WFL [noise]\nFrom the Airflow designs heating and air conditioning traffic center\nSays that morning to you from the ... pretty good shape on our inner state so far this morning don't have any they ... or ... can get into an out of ... city attractions areas as yet\nWe don't have they

from Jimmy Johnson three three grains I've read read and I don't know if I buy for ordering who wouldn't want or grain Jimmy ... let's do\nFive five six seven eight one of my rainy Granger John Still All right what about nine ...\nWill take it that Jimmy Johnson knew nine green we the only one going five so\nDry our new nine green we give me ...\nOr what color they produce\nVariant orchestra live in San\nDiego so and more by hallmark channel\nJust some ripping CDs to show really be a waste of\nWho's inspired generations\nAnd Google volatility\nYou'll find that it means up and down\nNot down only but up as well your show those numbers translate\nIf you look at the course of the past Twenty years through December thirty one two thousand Seventeen and\nIf you'd invested ten thousand dollars in the broad base market measured by the U.S and the five hundred if you invested ten thousand\nIn\nThe broad base market Twenty years ago today that ten thousand dollar investment you'd have forty thousand dollars a pretty good double the twice right Twenty years doubled it twice yeah it hasn't been a perfect scenario over the course of the particularly the past ten years including two thousand and eight but are you still\nGot seven percent that's doing better than inflation better than bonds better than a better than any other asset class\nOut there okay now Twenty years what's helped me with the math I got Twenty years it was about two hundred and fifty trading days per year and make sure I I'm actually doing this out by hand zero zero\nZero so that is five thousand trading days in a twenty year period of time if you missed just\nThe and the ten best days and hope folks here's the point of volatility it up and it's down and it's up\nTo forget about the apart miss the best ten days guess what\nYou're ten thousand dollars over a twenty year period of time when it turns into twenty thousand\nThat is half\nIt's half\nSo when you hear these studies of how the average investor doesn't do more than a third or maybe a forty percent of what the overall market done\nDoes that's why\nBecause they get too caught up in the volatility of the down days and sort of ignore the volatility of the updates\nAnd guess what usually clustered together they usually come along clustered together\nThat's typically the pattern\nEvery my buddy remembers the single worst day in the market and K A black Monday October Nineteen Nineteen eighty seven but they forget is the single best day was the next day\nBut\nThere you have a missing only ten days out of five thousand year returning gets cut in half\nMissed the best thirty days\nBoth civil go to twenty missed about twenty days and your ten thousand only turns into twelve thousand five or six twenty days out of five thousand days that when you look at these numbers\nIt is shocking how significant volatility works\nOr or or the effect of volatility can have both on the down side and on the upside I missed the best twenty days over a twenty year period of time you're ten thousand dollars only turns into twelve thousand five hundred and Seventy\nMiss thirty days thirty ... thirty three zero out of five thousand I guess what you lose money ten thousand terms of the eight thousand three hundred and thirty two votes\nThat's the reason why you stay invest\nStay calm stay\nCool and most importantly [noise]\nInvest in the numbers are squarely against you don't forget the concept of volatility works both ways because if you only get fixated on the negative your shirt them is one of those positive days and those positive phase make up a huge\nPart of the overall\nHopefully found the program useful or if you want to listen to it again will posted on social media tomorrow so you've got all of that to catch up

door Orlando news radio nutty three point one WFL a and I heard radio\nStation [noise]\n... you said thirty eight a minute ago yeah\nWell I'm just trying to do a quick math uh\nAll right here's the thing I don't want your house payment to be much more than a force of your take home pay is about a third of your take on by today but I think when I had my four oh one K. back and you're pretty helpful a jam on on those four O. one K. it sounds like\nSo I'm going to temporarily stop the four oh one K. your house is not the problem you're toys or your problem and your student loan is you're probably\nA hundred thousand dollars worth of toys when you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year as backward guy because they're all going down in value you shouldn't have toys stuff with wheels and motors that add up to more than about fifty percent of your take on by or fifty percent of your income now you did just cut your income down\nSubstantially one mama came home I got that part but still you are over you were at a hundred percent even when she was working\nSo you got too much tied up and things going down in value that's a bigger problem than your houses and you're staring down the barrel of a fifty thousand dollar debt that you need to clear I Would say you ought to clear that and\nIt's probably going to take your three years in the setting if you stop everything vacations eating out and for one gays and sell a toy or to it's probably still going to take a well depend on which toy you sell but um you know I'm getting out of this debt\nBecause it hasn't benefitted you\nNumber one number two I'm getting out of it even if it had benefitted you even if you've got a fifty thousand dollar you're raised because of it I usually have fifty thousand declare that that the first thing first order of business but I really\nI think your house was the problem I probably would sell some toys or no I Know I Would sell some toys I shouldn't say that so lightly um that's where your problem is you've got too much invested in depreciating assets\nAnd on your houses it's generally okay I'll temporarily would stop my four oh one K. and I would beat on this debt with a hammer\nUntil it's gone but I Want you to do what you're rolling stock and stuff with motors and it to be less than half your annual income now if you say your income coming up very dramatically in a very short order and you want to hold a couple of these toys or something that's fine but still you need to keep it around fifty percent or less\nA because you just got too much juice taught up and stuff that's going the wrong way it's all going down you look up and that hundred thousand dollars were stuff can be worth fifty thousand about a blink of an eye\nAnd then scratch your head and wonder why you're broke you know you got stuff going the wrong way so\nYeah I I think you I'm probably got a pass on something that you thought we were going to show which was the house\nAnd you got surprised by me showing your toys but uh you know whatever you want their toys but that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes and oh by the way I Am a boat on a car guy I like anything with a motor and it just about but that but the problem with all of it is it goes down in value\nAnd so it needs to be a small percentage of your world\nRob is with us in Bend Oregon Hi Rob how are you\n... thank you so much for all the stuff you and your organization view um I've got a question I have traveled the pound boy of employment I've gone from jobs where I had to wear named tang to jobs that were\nPossible careers to owning my own job and now I'm at a point where I'm starting a business and I wanted to be employee base [laughter] but my question is for that new one is an employee based business\n[noise] well that that's one where I don't do all the work I have people have people doing the work for me\nCool that's better than you are just doing all the work and honing your job I got ya okay Rick Berg great so now I'm In Atlanta now I Hope to work on air but it's not just in it okay good right\nAnd so when it comes to compensation for the employees is it better to give them more money or or benefits or how do you balance that\n[noise] well when your brand new and small you don't have a lot of choices the benefits of are ridiculously expensive\nAnd so um\nYou know like for instance health insurance when when you have less than ten people you can buy health insurance cheaper than you can for them so I'd rather just get more money and let them do what they want to wear this for they buy health insurance through their spouses work\nThat kind of like ... different benefits are very difficult for the business without that are twenty people are less but you can give them other benefits that are not corporate tied benefits like treating them good\nA tree in my family being there when the baby is\nOr send them flowers for their grandma screener all\nYou can treat 'em like human beings they don't get treated that way with\nThis was Ramsey [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families litter of very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two
