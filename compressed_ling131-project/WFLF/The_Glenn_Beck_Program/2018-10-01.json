Detroit\nAnd ... ...\n... ... ... here in Grand Rapids\nI got something last night have you seen the copy by the way hello soup have you seen the a copy of um of a\nRachel ... memo yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser Christine afford\nShe was the she was a woman that ah was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend\nShe well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years experience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by by Iraq Obama's head of homeland security as the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year let me say that again\nThe woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was bird rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nSo she's not a democratic hack\nAnd also\nNot a defense attorney Rashid a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true she goes in her expertise is on old crimes to be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win\nAll right\nBefore I continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this we're not going to see any it's CNN sock it to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats\nLeft wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating to you\nI Want you to know if you're easily triggered\nMight want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\n\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them\nShe then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court\nNot for prosecution [laughter] but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and quote\nIt's pretty significant do you think and\nAgain like she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this uh this poor woman because she was a girl you mean ... yeah I ... as a homeland security prosecutor sex crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility in with a left yes\nSo she's saying that it's it's it won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee\nThis explains in my opinion why\nIt was leaked in the final hour\nBecause every one who saw this knew exactly what it was\nNow she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute it may look like she's credible\nAre based on what she said not how she looked\n\nIf you're looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this is this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session list the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six\nBut then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein office the date of attack changed to the early\nEighties now you might say what difference does it make well if you say you're in your late teens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen\nIn Nineteen year in high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years it\nIt gets better this is the again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report\nIt gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged hack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties but then something strange happens\nIf you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out\nThe early Nineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was falls and it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post Ford narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks\nThis report is sponsored by Orlando job dot com job fair friday October fifth stimulus and heavy traffic less than an eye for him statement for thirty four and make a ton of

say okay so why why why wouldn't we just do the FBI thing in a reasonable world you're you're absolutely right in a reasonable world you're right but this is not about Ford\nAnd this is not about making sure that these charges stick its why as soon as this happened\nAs soon as Jeff Flake said no no wait a minute hang on we want an FBI or investigation as soon as that happened the narrative changed\nNow they're going after and saying he lied about drinking beer\n[laughter] okay he was for the love of Pete people\nSo this is how do you look at how the accusations that he wasn't by out drunk but I Know how would you confirm he well I Know I Know\nIt's ridiculous I Know so uh we're getting to that later because I as an alcoholic I got a lot to say on that one [laughter] um but ah\nThey've changed the narrative and they are playing the American people and here's an here's how it's working what they've done is they've turn this into something that is more than Kavanaugh look if Kavanaugh is a guy who did this I don't want him on the Supreme Court none of us\nDo nobody does that's a bad thing but you can't just smear somebody you have to have some evidence so because of the lack of evidence what they've done is they've not made this about Kavanaugh they've instead made this about victims\nEvidence play the elevator encounter with Jeff Flake\nSorry on my ... my mind goes right now that you might you know\nThey they don't want my heart is not alone\nCan dump\nThis woman has obviously a horrible experience in her life\nSo when she hears an accuser she immediately believes the accuser well that's not reasonable she's obviously very very upset because of what happened to her and she wants to send a message that that's not right I agree with that\nBut that's not the standard of justice or the way we get justice let me take you to a real life scenario\nI didn't understand America when OJ was let go but didn't understand it I I Know what is happening how can the African American community be cheering this guy well it's very easy once you're away from it emotionally and you actually look into it it's easy\nWhat was happening was African Americans were feeling that there was no justice in America it's always the black guy that gets blamed and then he goes to court and the white system puts them behind bars\nAnd so they weren't rooting for him they wanted anyone to beat the system they wanted anyone to prove that a black guy couldn't ... could go to court\nNot be guilty that's what they wanted they wanted a victory against\nThe system totally

Orlando news radio Ninety three point one WFL a and I heard radio\nIt for Monday October first integrity program\nIs Monday\nAnd we're so glad that you're here\nJohn Carlos elbow is uh on the phone with us as young Carlo is uh\nDemocrat you still consider yourself a Democrat John colonel\nYeah I I I mean I have remained the same I haven't changed actually take these these political quizzes every now and then and my ideology has stayed the same with what's happening though is that the the party itself has gone absolutely and saying oh this is not this is not what I signed up for\nRight um I've been watching you on Twitter and you've been um you know one of the only Democrats that have come out and said this is nuts gimme gimme are viewing the lay of the land from a democratic point of view from your point of view [noise]\nSure I think it's perfectly legitimate to oppose break Kavanaugh's nomination on the basis of differences and judicial philosophy or you know if you believe certain things that he doesn't align with those beliefs let's find that's what the Democratic process as for\n'em now that being said you you leave it at that rate you don't go ahead and try to chop off someone's head and promote these outrageous accusations against him a specifically the the one by this this woman Julie sweat Nick who just don't even ask the snow is I mean\nWe're there they are so absurd I I actually attended an all boys Catholic school too so I could kind of speak to the culture and how how those communities operate I mean the thought that a group of Fifteen year olds would be running a gang rape cartel all throughout high school and nobody would know anything about it\nUp until now is just ludicrous and then that eight edit goal this woman must have been like Twenty years old at the time that this happened achievers frequenting parties with high school ...\nYears [laughter] I Know I Know is high school sophomore myself oh man oh all me and my buddies\nWe were [laughter] the college chicks were all over [laughter] you know women women usually look for a young man you know especially those in high school that never happens that never happens\nEspecially Brett Kavanaugh who what should be clear the guy sounds like he was a complete torque when he was ... when he was in high school this is somebody who kept\n... you can see on his calendar he literally has notes on his parents would ground him I mean this guy was a complete ... in high school and he's like the kind of guy who if he comes home with your daughter or your sister you'd say she really did well first off this is great I'm really happy\nSo the thought that this guy was running a gang rape cartel in the suburbs of Maryland is just asinine on his face but you're saying is that we have entered I think that we abandon a traditional forms of religion and now we're in the church of the social justice right\nWhere we just believe things based on a matter of faith based on historical pattern of injustices notions and that's what's happening here late but they want to believe that this guy did all these horrible things\nOr because you know women have had it rough for many years and there there there has been a lot of sexism in there it's still exists therefore he's guilty right it's a it's very similar to the rationale we saw in the OJ Simpson trial but almost in reverse this is like reliving the O. J. case again\nWhere OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he wasn't guilty\nBecause the LAPD is allegedly racist\nRight so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago\nThat ... that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black men for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life\nAnd they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believed he was a was innocent more than they wanted a black man to beat the system you go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community\nAnd they all know that he killed the un Nicole\nAll know it so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and and let me tell you I think a\nDoctor's poured who testified she's a serious person cheated as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt her testimony or I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws a just a it's\nA series of inconsistencies that would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right so\nThe fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications and political communication so\nI understand how talking points are circulated and how people get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized to support look the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucified someone with zero evidence\nAnd then what they're doing now is that they're moving the goalposts right I\nSaw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about a well you know he must have drank when he was in in college or whatever I mean who cares\nIt's completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like pleading Adam hey Lawrence those goalpost seemed kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo John Carlin we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat\nOr who are has not lost his footing ah with with reason [noise] um\nSo the address people\nAddress people who are let's say a twenty something female that says you know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes then there's also a a a chance that he was db Cooper write me ... you have to go by the evidence that case you have to evaluate a case it based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular\nSituation other people that are justice qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he he's essentially being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system short of murder\nSo the question now is the economist is right\nAnd there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion they in fact all of the evidence that has been presented is the scope of tore right that the guys calendar clear is that right it's testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also clear as him so you you you have to\nCast that aside and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely fine that's the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic\nWhere we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nTheirs is in the court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but ... you're you're you you were asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because you have here\nIs a series of of accusations that have been made with zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back this up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nChurch testable she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline of when this happens four times so I think people need to cast this aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nHe is going to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is to plead guilty by association ride mark judge I I've never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of this country has never met met right so we're ...\nIt's going up here stay right now and based off is they'll memoirs of somebody who was a very quotable person who had\nA serious drinking issues it stop Brett Cabot but we're not nominating mark judge of the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with a judicial philosophy that's fine\nBut we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family has like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud right we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations just because we disagree with them with a clear ideologically\nAt state and that's what they do and and and banana republic than a third world countries that's not what we are in the United states of America\nJohn Carlos ... a Democrat when when we\nCome back I I I Want to ask you if you don't mind holding on for a second generally do you have to I'm I actually have to run the meeting about okay All right well run to be able to talk we'll talk some other time thank you so much [noise] I really want to I really want to hear from people\nAh they can respond to what I'm hearing from the Democrats now which is a\nWe just have to stop all of these people the people all the people on the all the people on

common in many areas right near New York state is so very we have\nIs as good as Colorado and go online and\nGood as the mid west we have lakes we have rivers we have we have Niagara Falls we have New York city the biggest city in the entire nation we have an old in my state how in the world can that be run by one city it's impossible I Want to allow county has to be counties and regions to be regions and people to meet people and it's totally fine the issue becomes\nWhy do I want to enforce my will upon you I Want you to be as conservative or liberal as you want to be\nPeople tease me and say Larry you're from queens how do you know you know what's right for upstate\nI don't that's the point and guess what you don't know what's right for me in Queens either\nWere even how would you be you you let me me me and we can all be free to gather\nOne of the times had work it has words\nAre original idea we just haven't done it in a long time so so Larry tell me your day one you're governor of New York where do you do\nThere are several things that have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so the vote 'cause it's a five way race in New York state and we are plurality state not a majority says we don't require fifty one percent there's a runoff go\nWhoever has the most that's how New York state works so I could actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing\nI'm going to happen in ... percent but every time the vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be with you when this is the most important single\nElection in the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more boring as a whole but as one single election if I come in first it changes the entire nation overnight\nWho does not just the Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is this ... this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nAbsolutely it is that important even coming in second\nWould shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it would make better Democrats them better Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our protection the Democrat\nThey don't have to worry about small business they don't have to about smaller government they will have to worry about lower taxes it's an important it's just I'll protect you from the evil left and all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties that's supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right\nBut when there's a third party that will libertarians can point the finger and say\nDemocrats what happened what happened to civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government\nNow they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\n[laughter] there will be a massive\nA massive culture shock within within the uh the state of the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back\nI don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire for years as my assumption and I'm fine with that but I have to focus on several things one a complete re board of education to a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay\nFor things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and Washington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government I next that the credit culture of transparency but it's a problem with those governments now is they're enforcing the kings will\nSo they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied and I don't want the government to be I'm the king and I and force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nLike do you read the constitution or what does that I don't know I Know\nI Know it's I'm not sure it's an old the theology to document\nTheir ego yes anyway I think we sort of the way it while ago yeah [laughter] but yes that's my point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families met or individual businesses but individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs growth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value\nTo each community we don't do that well in New York said it all we have things called regional economic economic development ... corporations\nWhich Albany which is the capital and decides where the money is spent and opened his eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county how buttons that the county's can start to budget to zero\nSo they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas of volunteerism\nHow about the concept I'll give you to an interesting concepts one instead of me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation and through lowering spending here's one idea that those both of those we have a bridges right now in New York state\nAnd one of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial Britain named after our well family that's embarrassing how 'bout instead that Britain's named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights for the bridge we retain the asset I got no business gotten that giving my ass at up\nI'm going to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime straight contractual that's all these companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year on marketing they dropped twenty million dollars on a stadium name that she was on the weekends I got a bridge you can name and that bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times\nOn every single day during rush hour and a sixteen person ... uh sixteen million person metro area\nAnd a hundred thousand cars pass it every single day you will easily dropped the million dollars and that if not more\nOn a law that taxes hang on just like a Texas New York ... Scott Texas you listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\nAbsolutely but here's the best part now we have them do maintenance again we own it so we still we still inspect it so damages though our responsibility\nTheir job is just repair it right they begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lower spending\nNot just that contracts don't come through Albany less corruption someone else's spending and spending it so guess what lassie fix bridges bridges right now in New York state collapse we don't have enough money these guys do will have to have safer bridge is less money and guess what we can start with holes\nIn New York and New York city some bridges costs Fifteen dollars an hour if you're a truck driver I Know a truck driver\nYou pay by the axle you're dropping Seventy five two hundred bucks to cross the bridge less money less corruption safer better service boom we raised billions of dollars this is just one idea and there are many of them no one else talks about them this is what we have to work on a New York state\nWe can do that so there you are you ... it's amazing to me how we\nAre running headlong just willing to give up everything that we have already ... the freedoms that we have and embrace democratic socialism yes\nBut we won't embrace this very American idea how do you how do you get the common sense Democrat and Republican\nWho has been raised in New York so their mentality is I mean this would sell in Texas\nHow do you get them in New York to see guys this this that it's already selling\nThe forward the Republicans in New York have given up I mean they don't show up or the Democrats I think I'm afraid so let's just vote Democrat the reality is again Seventy percent New Yorkers don't vote those who do vote vote because of fear we can't have fear but the reason why people vote it's simply the wrong answer [noise]\nMan but I Would say that in\nI'm trying to change just to make it so that people stop voting for the last of two evils and instead vote for someone\nAnd it is working I Am actually using if you've noticed I'm using non traditional media traditionally it does not want to cover me and polls don't want to do with me but not through the media is working and I'm getting out there and people are seeing me they're responding to me and this is what's working the way to make this happen is through non traditional media and believe it or not\nPeople are getting it they actually like it I hear all the time people say\nLarry I don't agree with everything you're saying but you actually answer questions you actually have a plan and they love it and that's what I say and look\nThey plan may be faulty maybe they well we can't leave all the bridges maybe we can't raise fifty billion maybe going rate thirty million\nThat when you do okay tell me what that ... and let me ask you can I hold you over for one more break yes okay a oldie over and and tell me how we fix education and higher education\nIt's out of control its its post modernist it's indoctrinate ing and its inflaming our children to debt when we come\nBack to Larry sharp I have to tell you if I was living in New York [noise] and I was a Republican I Can't I cannot imagine a reason\nWhy I Would not vote for him [noise] the demo or the ... the Democrat is going to win against the Republican why would you not
