so\nI'm Jason is a guy who watches a international affairs for us and I am fascinated by this story of ... a from a from Saudi Arabia\nA and I want you to bring me I Want you to bring me the news that no one in the news is reporting on this but let me bring everybody up to speed if you haven't been following this guy in a nutshell he worked for the Washington Post he's a revered ribs veered reporter which makes me ... suspicious immediately\nBut he's a revered ... a a reporter Washington Post he is a Saudi citizen\nHe was over in Turkey he's going to get married and so he's like I Need my divorce papers from the embassy and so he goes over to the Saudi embassy he tells his fiance weight in the car I'll be right back she waits right in front of the embassy\nHours and hours and hours going by she's calling his phone no answer on his phone he's not coming out she calls the embassy and they say oh\nNo he left he left just the oh he came here and we gave him the papers and he went and she's like I've been sitting outside I'm not sure if he went out time bill did he go out the front door\nYes so bill and the other guy mock mood says yes he went out the front door well CCTV cameras show that he didn't ever leave the Saudi embassy at least by the front door [noise]\nSo [noise] the next thing we find out this was yesterday as the Saudis um the Saudi prince\nLands the gulfstream his Gulf Stream it at the airport there I'm\nIn Turkey about an hour or so after the guy goes into the into the embassy\nThese guys get off the plane with what appeared to be a lot of empty suitcases they piled up in the back of the vans they're driving to the embassy they decide for some reason or another they need more empty suitcases\nThey buy some more empty suitcases they also stop just a real quick you know I don't know maybe the chef needed at the embassy but they needed a bones saw\nBy your boat saw Oh thank you so much now we can have soup and uh so they get the bones saw\nGod only knows what they do in the embassy but they're seen leaving about an hour later with really heavy suitcases they throw them into the back of the van they throw them on the jet and the jet takes off\nMeantime the United states says we do have a we do have\nA an encrypted a messages showing that the Saudi prince was trying to in trapping more tried to trap and get him into the embassy or get him back to Saudi Arabia\nA and today and I don't know if I Believe this because it's turkey but turkey says that they have either given to the United states or shown the United states this video and audio they say they have surveillance in the embassy of him being questioned\nAnd then tortured and then murdered we don't know if that is true but that's the latest today so ... we're going to find out who this guy is and was possibly ah when we come back because this is the part of the story that no one surely\nFrench fries and they do [laughter] and then you have no credibility millennia Trump is the McDonald's French fry I'm shocked you brought it to fast food yeah OK lane got we got to talk about 'cause it's a good soggy uh tell me about this guy this Saudi citizens been disappeared [noise] I'm always I'm always amazed how the media\nJust all the stops doing any kind of journalism like like I see the stories are riding and I'm like this is not what I Would be writing about at all for one yes this is like a ... style movie tomatoes and really is yeah I absolutely think the Saudis are guilty on this I think turkey is probably over playing what they do have probably just a little bit ...\nBut um but everyone's framing this this this uh this journalist shaggy as this great guy Nobel Prize winning oh yeah you've got to be he'll be a Nobel Peace prize winner soon he came out so surprise surprise he really came in the problem is the ... the media loved him the west loved him during the Obama administration\nUh why was that because well he was one of these one's advocating for democracy and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other places when the Arab Spring was breaking ... now that lines of exactly what the Obama administration was wanting to do and also who were they in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood and places like Egypt will surprise surprise ... is Muslim Brotherhood\nHe's actually that's the reason why he's not in the people in the media have said oh well he spoke out against you know the uh the kingdom the Saudi kingdom and that's probably why they don't like him no kitten but it goes way beyond that like he they support a political Islam group\nThat wants to overthrow the monarchy it's a lot goes a lot further than ... spoke out against them yet he is a Republican I was a public enemy number one but he's right up in that group with them\nUm and they was friends with the crown prince thought was he not um\nI don't know how they're framing it he was friends he was he was ... he loved the crown prince they got along and and he said a lot of great things about the crown prince now he disagrees with some of the crown princes policies and that's where they want us to take the Saudi out of\nSaudi Arabia basically that's the best way to put it for this guy\nBut he's a he's not a good guy he wants political Islam he wants political Islam to invade countries all over the world and take it over and he was living here for quite a while before he went to work in Washington Post yeah no no issues there whatsoever\nI'm I'm On the other hand you have this one guy that it's not that great of a guy even on the other hand you have a Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince who ever want to send this is this great reformer he he he's a great guy is a great leader is going to modernize Saudi Arabia women can drive now all these social is all these tackling\nHe they dug plain and simple he is a\nThug they go after he's doing this to tons and tons of people thousands of people in his own country people just disappear they go to jail for the rest of their lives he has a thug and the only reason he's tackling social issues is because they have a lot of young people in Saudi Arabia\nAnd social unrest about to hit the streets have you want to see the place where the next uh Arab Spring might happen Saudi Arabia\nThey the demographics point to it I Would not be surprised right all\nSo how do you keep Saudi Arabia under control do without a thug\nYou can't I mean it's like Russia really either bright groups like countries like that you really can't here's a disturbing part ... most likely most likely this guy was killed by Saudi Arabia yeah um it just it just feels like a man and maybe all of a sudden he pops up and I'm like\nNo I was a chick fillet and nobody in the news media wants to look at chick fillet so I was invisible\nFor a while maybe doubtful here's the problem\nWe are we are pushing through a major arms deal with Saudi Arabia we should not be doing that now we should not be doing that that should it be canceled today I can tell you however what is being what is happening is\nYou know the United states was supporting the Muslim Brotherhood\nNow we have some people who know exactly what's going on in that part of the world\nAnd they're probably being talked to by Saudi Arabia go and look look guys guys yeah I Know you don't like what we're doing here but uh it's the Muslim Brotherhood and its a caliphate you what you want the whole region to be in the Muslim Brotherhood caliphate have at it you know and that's the decision our president is is having to make\nIt's why we should stay out of other people's businesses payments stay out of their\nBusiness chemical production yeah so I think that Saudi Arabia will eventually own up to this because I think the evidence will come after them I think they'll build blame of very familiar a photo and they'll say it's the deep state the beep say did this no shelter salmon get him out of their [noise]\nDo weight is news Adam point they're talking about her

there is a a interview with ah our first lady a today and I believe our first lady has a display the grace and a great composure\nA and I don't care how you feel about the president I think enough is enough with Melania Trump\nI mean I don't see her I'm In a position where she's being vilified on a daily basis by the prospect sniping her\nFor a long time I'm very charming woman a very intelligent um loves shoulder and um I think she's done a very good job as first lady and there's really no reason to disparage malaria Trump you\nKnow it it it my breaking point was last week when she was over in Egypt and she was over in Africa yeah and the the photos coming back of her were beautiful I mean it was a Ralph Lauren photo spread and all the press could do was if they published any of those photos\nAh they just tore her down for colonialism and all this crap\nRomeo I Know uh and then here she is where the hang on the most beautiful woman in the oval office with the with the greatest style since Jackie oh they love Camelot and her style she was on the cover of every fashion magazine\nBut no fashion magazine will put millennia Trump\nOn you know of course she couldn't go out to their cocktail parties and all that\nIt it it there you do your commentary on the political correctness the eight percent but ... you left out some really big things could never have happened without the ... in support of the media\nYes I think the media in at eight percent directors\nHey let me just tell you a quick story okay All right so this week I've been doing a lot of a promotion for killing the ss which came out on Tuesday\nAnd in that promotion I'm basically saying that\nWe in America are seeing a rise of hate and evil and I tie it in a number of ways\nOne of the ways that are tied it in\nWas that George Soros at his crew have bought up about twenty packs political action committees and they sent the they send them out on missions and one of those missions was Senator Flake in the elevator with the CNN camera right behind a woman's screaming at him\nBecause she was a victim of something and he was an idiot for not the siding with her who's the woman the woman is an activist and the Soros pack making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year [noise] All right so I tell that story which is a tire early accurate a hundred percent correct and media matters\nWithin a half an hour says I compared the woman\nTo the third Reich okay no that's what's going on here that that's what's in play so the eight percent progressive zealots fanatics couldn't never\nHaving pose any thing on this country without the media taking up their cause and actually doing the dirty work\nI put the media in that eight percent it's the it is the reason why it has swept the country it is you're right because of the media but they are part of that eight percent\nLook what happened to Kanye West's my favorite guy of all time [laughter]\nOkay yeah so Kanye West who I I I didn't really made him I was an elevator with him at Madison Square garden ... short pants on and he was brooding right okay so he goes on Saturday Night live which has staked out territory to destroy Donald Trump because it's good for Saturday Night lives ratings\nThat's why they do it All right so ...\nGoes gets invited to go anywhere is to make America great again hat and and no one likes him and he ... he he's he's brooding again 'cause he's being bullied by Saturday Night live okay fine um then\nBecause of that Trump invites them to the oval office work ... walks in with the hat and and ... with the president or whatever they\nDid mhm okay now why isn't anyone chair\n[laughter] thank you for sale CNN on his whole day yeah I Know he's talking about what he was the guy\nKind here west right now Taylor Swift she comes out against Trump All right and she's telling everybody in Tennessee\nTo get them so Taylor Swift and Kanye West do I care what they think about geopolitics in any regard back the answer is no I don't and no one else does either this is a tremendous example a political correctness\nThat tiny tiny it was just going against the PC so he must be vilified\nSo I Want to go I Want to I Want to come back because you I Need to you maybe you should get a cup of coffee in or something I Need you to get a little a little more animated here ... ah but when we when we come back I Want to ask you about cars you follow ratings\nThe ratings are falling apart let's look at the numbers of you know from like Beto uh and and others that are running in the Senate the numbers seem to be falling apart I think that there is a change of foot and the Democrats don't see it\nAnd when they get their head handed to them or by the people I think they're going to double down yet again we'll get Bill O'Reilly's comment on that coming up and just a second Bill O'Reilly\nFrom Bill O'Reilly dot com his new book is out it is a killing the S. S. and it is really good it's worth or read a pick it up and uh and read it it's really really good\nAlright zipper critter [noise] zipper critter is smart technology and um it is it's really brilliant what they've done they have a really brilliant CEO\nA and he's a high tech guy and it's you know when when separate could it first came out it was a way for you to not have to have an HR department or you could you could post a job on all of the different websites well since that point a zipper critter has become the number one website\nSo now they not only post everything there but they have all of this internal data\nAnd they really listen to the smart technology really tries to find out exactly what you're what you're looking for so if if you have you know a big job open up and you know PR director or whatever it is you don't mind finding you know seeing the right person if they're in California and you're in New York\nBut if you're you know a Starbucks and you're looking for a brief the you don't care that you know you're in New York in somebody's in Santa Monica you need the first right across the street\nSo they don't just dump everybody a onto your onto your plate\nThe smart technology goes through and really looks forward also they look for the people that are not necessarily out there a scene you know your ad or reading your post they go out and invite heat is really amazing it is why they have ... uh turned 'em turned out now that you get it\nAnd they uh they ... around the said going there's them up there to serve all look at the mob but now you can't\nDo that of course it's a mop um that that Kavanaugh thing was a there was no better example in modern ... political history than than a mob in that no better example\nAre the numbers quickly I've got about twenty five seconds are the numbers in cable news still going down our people waking up to this [noise]\nI'm going to have to talk about that we come back from the break because uh they\nThey're not going down in the wake of a cabin or the wake\nOf a hurricane story what there is a Roche and I'll tell you why it's happening okay\nBack with Bill O'Reilly has his new book out came this week make sure you pick it up killing the really good\nUse your smart speaker to Google Home the plain news radio Ninety three point one WFL I\nPoint one [noise]\n\nYou're on the means to be blamed on command [noise] limit dot com slash tour the places you go if you feel like I Do that the only thing we can do right now with all the nonsense from the Democratic party is to laugh at them\nOr you want to be part of this tour it's going all around the country can get all the dates that Glenn Beck dot com slash tore a there's lots of cool packages with books involved and everything else that the addicted to outrage tour going around America you should come you should come we should we do anything you know\nA B a camp follower I'll probably go from town to town\nNow than it used to using the city and you should come and we'll do one together\n[noise] um yeah I mean is that um\nBut I I'd I'd rather kind of like stand outside and now you in the San Francisco [laughter] and you're just kind of go out and Medicare every now and then do go on [laughter]\nAll right to bill O'Riley a last question here on on this stuff tell me about the press and the numbers\n[noise] okay so what's happening is not just in cable news but it's in all kinds of TV watching is that the machines are now overwhelmed the American public your device so whatever you call it the church and started it they don't watch television anymore um my kids used to they don't anymore\nAnd NOW News consumption is following in that regard so people are getting used to the\nFact that Bill O'Reilly dot com is there the blazes there they can get whatever they want twenty four seven I'm so why do I have to sit there and wait for some show to come on that's the under fifty five set in America over fifty five they still like their martinis they liked\nThe quicker and say like eight o'clock knowing that somebody's on right and they had then but they're starting to get bored with it back\nBecause if you watch it it's not being the same thing said over and over how many times can human being said the phrase\nAt the end of the day we're now at fifty two million times on cable news alright just in sip it or to the day and sip it um and you you want information you want\nA vibrant opinion that perhaps is a little bit different you never get it\nAnd so it's the gas rather than the hosts the host or ... who they are and you like them or you don't but the gas I mean it's just impossible along possible it really is the result\nThe regime can see in the demographics it's there on the page every night on the overnight ratings the younger people are going away that's the first sign and then the cracks a once Trump gets off the stage 'cause he drives everything now under ... percent in the in the media once he gets off the stage it'll collapse\nSo bill it's been a few minutes on your on your book thank you let's let's talk about um you know I Know why you wrote this book to two parallel and show the parallel of evil and how that can happen um but I'm I'm I'm fascinated by the stories that that you tell in this\n[noise] let me tell you to know so your listeners will understand what we're doing here and there was a concentration camp name ravens book\nIt was for women just women and it was north of Berlin and nobody ever heard of it\nOf course the concentration camps were kept away from the German people they weren't spotlight it it was known a news report Taj and the third Reich you did what they said or they put a bullet in your head or you went to the concentration camp [noise] so anyway I there's concentration care was a young woman named ... half H. U. T. H.\nAnd she had a German Shepherd dog as most of the ss gorge did and she terrorized women\nAre and participated in heinous crimes against it\nBefore the war she was a seamstress and went to work and came home and had a ... or whatever you do in Germany okay\nAnd then all of a sudden she's in a black uniform\nI'm killing and maiming and torturing other people are free off after the war ends up free comes to San Francisco alright gifts to San Francisco on a refugee visa in Nineteen fifty nine\nAlright settles marries a Jew\nEverybody in the neighborhood loves her freezer nicest woman fifty years later they get to\nThe state department finally tracked her down sends her back to Germany where she's still alive Beck and every month gets to the United states Social Security check\nWhat happened with his son and how it affected him\nI'll add one more to that I lost my faith that day to go and um I had gone to church five days a week during the week and every Sunday\nUh September eighth it's twenty Seventeen was the last night they went to church um\nEarly in the day it's been through a long time going back and forth with Fox with lawyers trying to figure out where it's going to go forward what was going to happen and we we came upon an idea that we're going to separate oh separating from Fox they said the amicably separating bowling and Fox are ethnically separating\nUm and I looked at it on that\nDay as a as a new beginning go start and go find another job somewhere and life is going to be great and you were going to sue\nI didn't know what it was going to do and Clinton I I Will tell you that I ate\nWhatever was written about me was false patently false ... who is a lie it never happened in ... no one has ever ever\nCome forward it was all in on them as a source in\nThe long story short my lawyer said it's probably time to just cut ties with Fox and move on and go find another job this could discover on forever and like there was going to be my family is going to be dragged through the mine for a long time so I decided that that was the thing to do we cut ties around three o'clock in the afternoon it was a friday before long weekend\nFor Labor Day uh I took my wife out to dinner that night and we didn't celebrate the\nOwner of the restaurant came over and say hey you know congratulations his new start pending I drink on\nThe way home [noise] we got the call or we're driving home and uh\nThe the my phone rang it was a young man on the other side of the phone saying Mr boy and call her son call Eric right away so what's wrong is just cleric right away I called over there and I'm a girl answered and her name was Kayla he'd been seeing her on and off she was crying and it and for some reason I just went right to them is he alive\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] she said no [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] that that was a that was a rough day the next state went to Colorado\n[noise] and uh the president called me\nAs anything we can do for you [noise]\nI said no thank you [laughter] and put it that day and realized that he cared and I'm so for the next few months I made it my mission to create awareness round a opioids\nAmerican bought his antics on campus [noise]\n[laughter] waste with ... ... so yeah so that was that day [laughter]\nAnd so now we are a year and two days after that\nAnd it's been Roscoe\nYou we can stop and any time if you don't want to talk about anything so [noise] um [noise] but I think it's just important story to tell 'em when you said is he alive\nWhy we're there indications or was it just to dad's feelings of feeling out who gets called ten thirty at night and stole the call your son right away without explaining why I had a hunch and sure enough knowledge turned out to be true so\nUm\nOut he was a he bought his antics on campus that was laced with fat and all it wasn't a prescriptive antics he didn't know he he passed it was an accidental overdose [noise] um so the question you asked me was I going to sue socks\nAt that moment I had no fight need to do anything [noise] so um we spent my wife and I just got very close we spent the better part of next year\nJust talking to other parents talking to any opportunity we could um do you get the word out that it's an epidemic excuse me\nAnd a and a ... parents need to know that that their children are at risk and it's a it's a\nMassive epidemic in the in the country young kids need to know that one pill can kill you and not sure what you're taking the parents need to know that your child isn't too smart to popular to Atlanta to be exposed to potentially dying from an overdose\n\nIt's a very emotional and I think important um interview\nThere\nThere are places that I Want to go and Eric has promised to come back but I didn't want to dog pile we recorded this on uh September I think tend 'em and it was just a few days after the one year anniversary and he was very very very raw\nUm it's the first time that he is really spoken out about it um and what his thoughts are and I think everybody\nNo matter what side you're on the opioid thing I mean I I um\nI got an emotional whole yesterday from somebody on the TV show that said thank you for speaking up for opioids because there are those of us who\nWe cannot live without them we can't pay for this woman said because of her disease she can't even sit up in bed and she's bed written\nWithout the opioid there are you know\nAll of these things they're double edged swords they're they're good when they're used\nProperly and they are deadly when they are abused\nAnd uh it's up to each of us uh to to know what we're dealing with and they are deadly um that podcast also goes into his relationship with the president and what he\nIs seen as the president and uh it's a very fascinating interview\nWith Eric bowling you can find that pod cast wherever you download our podcast on iTunes now and modify but everywhere or the Glenn Beck podcast they come out every Saturday and different interview with somebody who is truly fascinating\nThen to replace a path grey who is very hard to replace because he is not only funny and entertaining but he also has a great intellect and a truly\nUnderstands a our founding and the founding principles so we wanted somebody with some a real uh meat on the bones\nAnd a guy who I have really grown to love but he already had another job or is Steve days\nSteve works for see our TV uh but we have convinced the our TV too also kind of it's kind of like a Warner Brothers and ah you know the old uh paramount studios deal\nWhere we're like okay well you can use our star for this movie and we've convince them to ah let us use Steve\nTo uh do a program immediately after this and welcome to the program now Steve\nDay so are you I'm doing well get to see guys that were really really excited about this starts on Monday\nYeah starts on Monday he's still going to be on the our TV's still gonna be doing it see our TV thing but he's doing a\nTwo hours of for us every day if anybody if they don't know who you are explain who you are [noise]\nI I think you know we have a slightly different way of doing things uh than what you were probably typically here in conservative talk radio a wine is we're mindful of the things we're actually trying to conserve is kind of nowadays conservative means I'm not a communist\n[laughter] are\nYou living in ... when you say the second best why here's we did have had it he's number one and in space by our space butter space by your number\nTo help move into why this is why he is a genius [laughter] do you\nKnow we actually talk about the things we're trying to conserve the values and virtues that made America exceptional and where they came from in the first place it we we like to start arguments even more than we like to win them because we think that one of the big problems in our country you know there's this idea that we're really divided in were arguing all the time 'cause we're not argument at all\nWhat we're doing is we're grabbing Seventeen burner accounts on social media calling each other anonymous names\nAre returning to the uh uh the ... factory uh of of the the smell that we prefer of our own tribe and uh and didn't never retreat from our own native sweat lodge convince for right about absolutely everything over logging verbal bombs at our neighbor over there we never talk to and we're calling that an argument okay\nI I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out\nAh you know I kind of I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend and I am perfectly fine having a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them by myself I had a doctor or a Denver so ah in Studio this weekend or this last week um we had Dave Ruben who else a stew here recently Michael reckon walled\nThat Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter and we don't agree on everything [laughter] but\nI'm looking for the people who you can't have a conversation with somebody\nWho is who's goal it is to say rights apply to certain people right and not to others is there isn't there a there is a line of who you can have a Congress\nAreas and you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentleman we need to understand that distinction between an opponent and enemy\nAnd a liberal and a leftist an opponent is someone who disagrees either maybe even Vietnam and will do whatever they can within the boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas and new arena of ideas\nAnd enemy is somebody who wants to end you in any somebody has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with you literally game with you or an office building with you uh and then you look at what's the difference between a liberal and the left is that you know liberal is somebody that wants to government to permit you to do things God says are immoral and dumb\nLondon is somebody that wants to government to compel you to do those things\nAnd if you will not do those things that God says or immoral and dumb than us Erick Erickson likes to say you will be made to care the full course of power of government will be brought down upon me ah because you it it's you know resistance as few tile and you're watching this existential transition happening on the left in our culture\nAnd we're we're there aren't really too many liberals anymore and the reason why you're struggling to find people to have these conversations with in the media arena where we work is there's not too many of them left\nI think there are the outside of\nWhat side of the Haiti arena I agree that there are you know I see\nPeople people think that I Want to have conversations with you know I Want to your you're going to bring in so and so and they're going to have a conversation with them you can't\nTalk to them no Nancy Pelosi I Can't talk ... she has no interest into she has no interest he wants to end you want to share a country where the best it's the best thing is\nIs that you could possibly say the most charitable thing on both sides is they just want to win so they'll do anything to win and some of them will go so far as when they leave the room go that guy's got to be stopped\nUm and that's a dangerous but that's not who I'm Talking about\nNot talking about my mom a lot because she had me at Fifteen share pregnant with me at fourteen she found out she was pregnant with me Christmas break Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd wrote the way it happens a month later\nAnd she decides not to have an abortion and so my mom and I literally grew up together and you know I become this Alex ... cheating wannabe kid of the eighties and she's your typical single mom government should do for people that they can't do for themselves you know and and and it has a different view of politics than me and for many years we couldn't talk about politics\nAnd so as I started growing more and conservative media we disagreed with and bring it up when we got together as a family has it gotten away with everything funny things happened the last few years they'll guys she's bringing it up now to me\nAnd she semi retired now because of medical disability and so she watched a lot of what's on your screens I don't watch any cable news at all rank later I Can't I Can't and\n... do you watch them never except when I'm On the year ... India it unless it's ... hang on just a second I Want the audience to know that's unheard of in our business that you could not have done this job agreed without watching cable news you know three years ago\nRight and I mean I keep up on clips that go viral and ... feet long form it's just toxic ingestion and the vast yeah and my mom watches a lot more of that she actually likes your show quite a bit actually and he's a brilliant woman but one of the things she came to me one day before the twenty twelve election\nAnd she brought it up she started bringing politics up to me um you know unprovoked and she said you know I was so happy when Brock Obama won in a way that we had shattered the racial ceiling and out of the blue she said to me she goes I I Wonder sometimes when I watched the things he says and he does if he's actually a communist [laughter]\nMe away while I'm and I watched the way you know my mom is one of those people that is find mice Obamacare\nThinks that Medicare for all his okay we need to be up to provide things like health care for ... she's not find with if you don't change your religion for the government we shut you down and put you in jail and she's not fight we we get five hundred million dollars a year your money to Planned Parenthood so he's not fine with that ...\nSo I've I've recently come to this feeling that we have caused problems of communication\nBecause we have seen Obamacare and we know what the we know those who designed it we know they want single payer health care okay we know that they are socialist that are ... drawing this up\nBut the people who like your mom and the regular people on the on the liberal side on the Democratic side\nThey're not for communism they're not for the end of capitalism they just believe in more welfare they just believe in a bigger hand to help\nAnd so when we say this is socialism they hear that as you're a communist and they're like we're not communist right and so we have we have put a giant blanket over the entire voting public of Democrats\nAnd made them feel like we're calling them communist they don't feel like they're communist and they're not communist but it is provide that cover has provided cover if you will for the actual Marxist communists that are that are trying to say and of capitalism\nWe when you look at you know for the last twenty five years I've been involved in full time a political advocacy either as a host or an activist or I worked on numerous campaigns are run the gamut I've done everything in our movement other than run for office basically myself\nAnd I'm ... when you look at the for the last for all the course of our careers that GOP consultancy industry has has designed a strategy to chase a voter that does not exist and this is filtered down into the talking points we and conservative media get from these people\nAnd that is that the average GOP consultant believes America wants a wants limited government like the Koch brothers and Saddam and get more at the same time it actually totally in reverse the majority of a ... and you know it's fascinating is if you did a huge study on this breaking\nIt down into twenty sixteen electorate at the the libertarian the myth of the libertarian voter minutes how they define them that voter largely does not exist it's a unicorn okay the reality is and I've seen this on every GOP campaign for every candidate from state house to president I've ever worked on\nThe amount of pushback we get on our social beliefs compared to here the party of big business who wants to lay me off and doesn't care about me guys tend to one at minimum it's not even close and and the reality is most voters are in favor of bigger government\nWith better moral values and this is the secret sauce that Trump tapped into in the last election the irony is that the ultimate he missed\nDo you remember when you were dating\nAnd he used to do really special things then we're at the point where like our anniversary yes I knew that it was tomorrow trust one eight hundred flowers dot com they have you've covered in right now when you order a dozen red or multi colored roses for only twenty nine Ninety nine one eight hundred flowers will give you another dozen plus a vase absolutely\nFree one eight hundred flowers dot com click on the radio icon and type in the ... code back hurry

... gray a stew steeper gear or executive producer and of\nCourse my charming self um we're talking about uh the Democrats in what they have done this week just with Hillary Clinton coming out and saying you can't have a civil conversation with these people\nI don't know who these people are that these people used to be a sign of racism uh but you can't talk about these people are and then Eric Holder in the week that we have a video of somebody actually kicking a protester ... um we have ever called her saying a kick 'em when they're down\nIs is that is this the\nOr is this the beginning of the end for the Democrats or is this the end of the beginning\nUm I I Hope it's the beginning of the end because um I I think most Americans with the ... with Benny sensibility left in them\nOr are being turned off by the Democrats right now I I think they've you know we talked about this many times I think maybe now they have overplay their hand we thought maybe that would have happened a year or two or three or four a bill but um I think after the Kavanaugh hearings and all that's going on now with disability thing\nThat they're completely uh uh issuing I think I think people have had enough of them\nSo is it important for us to change those say I think people have had enough of the Democrats because of that blanket people who vote Democrat think wait I'm a Democrat or is it better to say I think people have enough of this\nLeftist movement I I think it's the latter mhm and I think that um\nYou're you're watching I Know it's a popular term in another context these days but you're watching a transition happen\nAnd you know we kind of pretended as if on the right that just surrendering I'm America's youth ministry known as our education system to cultural Marxist for forty years um wasn't good to have any repercussions whatsoever\nAnd now you're watching the first fruits of that harvest are coming home to roost at the moment\nI and we're we're we're not even I don't even think we're polarized anymore I think we're ...\nTo get the referenced I'm making here so okay let's let's pick it up there\nHow do we um how do we come come back and how do we start reaching out to the people who actually do have much more in common with us because they do believe in the bill of rights even though the people in Washington may not be that could imminent\nUse your

member\nGlad that probably\nTalked about this a little bit on the news and why it matters last night uh\nAnd I and I asked the group\nIt\nWas a turning point for the Democratic party the leadership I think it was there was a spiritual turning point and it was when they denied God three\nTimes in their platform I mean I just I find it incredible that they actually did it three times I mean it's just so biblical mhm and you are you are seeing\nA in here seeing the things that I talked about in my in my novel the eye of ... people don't know that they are repeating rituals they don't know what's really going on but there we are repeating the Old Testament stuff from the Democrats really are\nProgressive as him and I think this is why the churches on the defensive collectively in the culture it's because\nIt is it it looked at the clown show that we often see on right wing cable news of\nGuys who pretend to be ministers but really they're just ministers of the church or wherever the GOP guy that gives them on the table at the moment is\nOr a Democrat or the Democrat on the other side you write in but I mean in terms of people have a discerning spirituality which would tend to lean more conservative and so there's a lot of a discerning people in our ... that had decided they don't want to be the next Ralph Reed clown show on cable news basically they're just going to vacate the public sphere altogether which is kind of a false choice really yeah\nBut and it's because they don't understand that progressive isn't isn't a political ideology it's a religion\nIt is it's the it's the and I say this on our show all the time Glenn it's the it's the area is Marcy on ... you know great heritage throughout the course of the history of the church that's what this is a this era it has its own Herman nuke\nIt has its own creation myth dosing Darwinism it has its own in ... where the state essentially replaces the church and government is the becomes God like chest hurts him said when the government removes the God the government will become the God\nAnd that's what you're dealing with here the same reaction you're getting from leftist when you trigger them on their on their state isn't\nIt the same reaction that you would get with your beliefs if you walk down the walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan a quote unquote moderate Arab nation walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan where they're queen is Seventy five on a scale of one to ten and became seems to be a modern her mind in his right walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan and say this okay say\nI'm Christians and Muslims worship the same God makes sure where in ... and find out first that they have a Second Amendment in ... in Amman, Jordan because your life will be in danger\nAnd that's what you're witnessing here this is religious fervor you're you're attacking their idol this is not near political disagreement this isn't even just fundamental existential philosophical disagreement vicious religious fervor you're dealing with the loose it sanity that coach predicts\nI just want to say the first part of that a dissertation idling with understood about ten\nPercent [laughter] they couldn't short race\nThen translate that into human language\nAnd I I I think\nWe see that with global warming with a with their reaction to abortion was loose Robie weighed thing that means absolutely everything they worship at the altar of these things it it really is a religious fervor\nThat you see with them and and this is kind of the the point of the ... ... ... is\nThis is pale as his\nYeah they if they don't necessarily know they don't know but that doesn't change the fact that what they're doing it was the worship of the environment and the sacrifice of your children he wanted your children to be sacrificed on an idle\nYou would have permit skew is sex at a celebration of bail you could do anything in the woods and the groves in the groves and then when you got pregnant he would call you back and they would slaughter the newborn baby right I I mean it is exactly the worship of bail\nThere's nothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period who himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows this history very well when he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in a New Testament world and Romans one\nVoice when he when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff that would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around I I think we do bad stuff\nBecause we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of been forces itself and so you're dealing with people that with the wind and the and the New Testament there when you exchange the truth for a lie so there's
