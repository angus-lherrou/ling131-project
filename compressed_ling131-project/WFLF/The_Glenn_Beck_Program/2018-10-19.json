industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute of maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician severe of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technical\nTo to a border reforming immigration reform yeah it's just a weird tactic and do it\nThree weeks before an election it's almost like Donald Trump was like hey guys would you know creating a caravan and just sending it this way and I what I Will do is I Will talk about it and it will help us win this election and then afterwards you guys can go back home will pay for your boss\nI was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right out in that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what time for you to walk to the United states and I want you to walk in that group of people and here's a guy and paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group with you and he'd get you across the border is that what you're\nDoing or you just hear in trusting your children to who knows what where's the personal responsibility of the parents here yeah I mean there's got to be some there is and I think their case would\nBe or at least the case to left would make on their behalf would be a these things are so\nSo bad in Honduras Guatemala I mean they can get a lot worse she can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so many things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's\nHow much the opposite like want to say that we talked about this yesterday\nI you know letting my kid walk who step and walking at the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI've told this story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block in there there's there's a giant bond there in a green area because it's a common to the everybody in the neighborhood and\nWhen my daughter was sixteen she said hey that I'm just I'm going to walk down to the pond like alone [laughter]\nWithout your brother [laughter] no [laughter]\n\nWhat do you stop and think about how you know pretty protective ... ... exactly I I don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey why don't you walk to Honduras\nWith a group of people that I don't know [laughter] look there are situations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there's certain level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people in these situations are like this\nOr is there probably are some but it it's just ... you try to it's the same thing\nWith the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of everyone is a four year old who came across the border and in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old that this is a different it's a different story\nOr and you just want her first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about ... hardening the borders\nThis is an easy way to get people together to do that ... when people hear a story like this if it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa this it you know because the word invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from people who oppose it uh you know in a hawkish matter Mm right\nAnd you know like I mean for a thousand people are kinda qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion\nRight it feels like waiting does there just top the top of the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right look over running the security\nThat they're there you're coming in or the right way or the overriding security and you see that Mexico does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location\nSo they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course they're just gonna keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this and yet or the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a\nFairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful a war on carrying were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy of\nCourse if somebody's snakes from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they're going to work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with them back then\nThey ... they send back them they'd send back if they do it without permissions they sent back them but we can't\nUh were expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to U.S Mexico has\nA pretty stiff immigration law they've got to streamline law that insurers foreign visitors and immigrants are in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves\nEconomically they're not destined to be burdens on society\nThey are of economic and social benefit to society\nWeight you're you expect your immigrants to contribute their own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation or they make sure that they don't have any sort of a\nCriminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants protests have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they're demanding rights or that they think they have coming to them\nIn Mexico you can't even go can't interfere in their in internal politics plus\nIf they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics may deport you know I mean that's a [noise]\nA daily racist right I mean like that is not yes there's an argument there\nWe would never know you can't do that you know you can't do that and nor should you you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans and the ... percent we want to make sure we're still keep Seventy or eighty percent I mean I think I Would you I wouldn't ... I Can't I Can't think of a warden Trump supporter\nWho would have a ... a supportive policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages of white people versus other races\nYou wonder if people who are productive who are here because they want to be here and be part of the society or going to add\nSomething to our community instead of taking things from it\nI mean right now that is what you want the hypocrisy is mind by that really is incredible lying to buy it really is it ... ... security for me but not for me\nAnd that is not a a that is not a ... that's incredible I mean that's an incredible it is a line there that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and and it and it's politically wanting to split the bottom line is we are we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten up\nThat is a completely let the larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to a mid term election there's no like this is a complete gift\nTo the Republicans to people who care about the border yeah people who have any uh did Donald Trump and the people he's supporting the gift\nIt is and and he's telling Republicans that yeah saying hey use their use it in the ... election campaign start talking about immigration because I haven't heard any of them doing that are any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe some warm someone somewhere is\nBut it doesn't seem to be a general theme for the party I did hear at all talking\nAbout it in the debate and I don't think I don't know that he mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security I mean there's a really close race in Arizona a race or where I'm at Sally has I think a great chance of winning or\nPeople do to get because her opponent there is like if you took Michael Moore and put him in his brain into a female body of a congresswoman you\nWould have all of these tapes that they've been finding about her where she saying you know she's bashing Arizona oh yeah hang in the lab of democracy she saying people are crazy in Arizona she's talking about how I mean she's on nine eleven truther shows I mean she is\nAs it's incredible that they decided to run her and just thought that this stuff would not come out\nAnd and ... you know you're talking about a one of the first female pilots are in history and the air the air force are incredibly accomplished yeah had a great chance of winning in in a tough environment uh in Arizona adding on this situation where\nAre you know your he makes gives a code pink worker a coat pink staffer is running for Senate in Arizona\nAnd it was a huge mistake I think\nFor her to be they're not really with code picker denied that socializing her views I don't know exactly she yeah she's been with a lot of these uh left wing extreme groups or some maize any early to thousands to the point where again\nLike she like coal hosted a show with someone who's the nine eleven truther Wilder awhile that's like it's crazy bonkers over the line right and and the fact that you have a really solid candidate\nIn Arizona and it's a border state it's a big deal there ... is another on the cruise cruise has got to leave there but I mean he's always been talking about ...\nNo I'm not going to sit here and tell you what the thing I think it's a ridiculous thing but I'm sure bet I would\nTell us it's a thing [noise] yes [noise] yes he would [noise]\nAll right and in the meantime we'd love to hear from Roberts in El Paso near Allentown morals dean El Paso argue Beto ...\nDo weddings news Adam pointed to talk about

I called myself and American an excellent dissent first of all my name\nMy name is bad but I like to be called burger or get this Sunday\nMm wow see okay so\nYou're going to the other way you're going from ... to Bobby which is interesting to me is\nThat name for forty years and ah I don't like to be called Bertha which is that natural inclination from people ... and I know that do personally oh you do I where I used to work for the NBA no Paso as the secretary to the\nDirector and assistant director when he first started at a time in Congress he's very adamant about helping veterans and we were overjoyed because we needed help getting the message out about the veterans\nMhm [noise] well\nIt was and then when I came on the a lot of my information 'cause I knew what was going on and stuff the casting my desk and everything when I found out that\nBad though was\nRunning for Senate I knew he had used the veterans as a launching point and they need to them under the bus while to get his name to get his name nationally known by the way my call him personally myself I call in ... [laughter]\nAttractive [laughter] gang late he's got that way Adam's apple and it sticks out for a long time um\nWhen it seemed like an angry Hispanic female mhm I Am just an angry conservative and oh I forgot to tell you I had my best friend and she stayed in Albert she goes embed them but he never agent ... and ...\n... ... and it's like an ... and thank you for the call it does seem like that there is a a a there was an effort made when you when you prioritize identity politics over everything else\nThese things are sensible right like a sensible that Barry Obama both ... ... it's ... in that world it sensible if you're Elizabeth Warren to claim you have Native American heritage and\nIn in your school and and submit to a ... recipes the powwow chow like that makes sense in that world because that's all you prioritize it's the only thing that matters right if the only thing that matters is your identity as a victim\nThen classifying yourself a as associated with a victimized population of evil conservatives\nDoes a lot of good for you there is a real incentive and motivation to do it and we keep we seem to see it over and over and over again\nAnd you know look maybe he was called but it was a guy I don't know uh it's possible I haven't seen a ton of evidence that it's accurate nor that it makes any sense but beyond that ... the idea that he has put on every single sign solely\nBefore letters B. E. T. oh\nThis is not like that might be a nickname and it might be that it's okay to call him back home but it's not he's not doing it because that the uh the case he's doing it because he's trying to fool a bunch of people\nEspecially back you know when he was trying to get to this level at this point I don't know I think everybody knows but it helped him climb to this level and it's it's\nThe name that appears on the ballot too which is interesting very strange very strange ... a lot of times if it's a nickname\nThey'll put like Robert Francis and then in parentheses [noise] Beto O'Rourke so you can identify him from his campaign ... stuff that kind of makes sense although I I don't even love that all that in my only Beto O'Rourke on the ballot so that I mean the guy has gone to great lengths\nNot to use Robert Francis not to be identified as Irish American now people pressed him on it he's obviously going to admit I'm Irish American and I am from a long line of Irish Americans right but that's not what you get from him when you just watch his uh\nHis campaign ads or you see I'm In a debate he doesn't know he doesn't identify like that at all\nTrying to be a Kennedy right he like he wants to be a Kennedy and a plot you know a appeal to the Hispanic community and it's like you're ... you're not be F. K. okay we all know who B. S. K. was he's been gone for a long time [laughter] we all know that you're not the F. K. and just stop trying to be be if you're not that\nHe's working on it though it's dry and these these dry and I mean battle is Beto Fitzgerald Kennedy was an incredible\nPerson will [laughter]\nAnd it was terrible tragedy and yeah I mean it really was an amazing or\nTurn of events there and it's good to see it's good to see a that this has gone on I I I just I don't\nI don't see how people don't

think you're missing a very important point and that is that over ... identifies as Hispanic I'm there for ... you must be believe\nWow there's a great point here is again we're learning today yeah I forgot that was the standard\nHow insensitive of us mhm how hateful and are dumber and ugly that is that we haven't spoken about how he does identify yeah and it must be as Hispanic\nJak bags it's it's interesting that that sort of talk it's like you know the the Elizabeth Warren is of essentially identifying as Native American without real evidence that she is she's getting beat up I mean this has been one of the biggest political disasters of all time\nHer coming out and trying to say that she actually is Hispanic Native American short approved it by going back try to ... generation trying to prove it one one thousand twenty fours yeah that's a ... a left hates it through like this is this is playing into the worst of our\nUh beliefs about blood being the determining factor in these things and they they hate their\nThey have destroyed or over the she handled it terribly I mean it's almost like one of those things I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out and doing this this is amazing ah but the identifying thing there's two parts of that\nLike I said as they say that you know the libertarian side of me right now I don't care what people say they are right like no difference to me if she says she's Native American or not I don't care\nBut beyond that there is an actual truth\nYou know if if we do all those all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean King was to come out and say he's black when they're not black and does that matter to me I don't care what they're doing there I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason but that doesn't mean it effects me in any way\nHowever we have to be able to stand up for the truth the truth is that Sean King is white but the truth is that Rachel does all is white\nAnd the truth is Beto O'Rourke as white\nAs white and you know I that's okay [noise] you know\nPeople are supposed to be able to be you know we're not supposed to care so much about these identifying factors but we're in a world in which the left only embraces identity politics it's a thick world we need to cure it\nUse your

in the world some people say it's the highest in the most difficult to climb and we probably should have spent more time on this I Know Glen Glen does not want to bring it up because you know he you know it feels like it's bragging or whatever but yeah ... ... to this weekend you can follow his progress I I I Know there's a website I don't remember what the name of it is but if you kind of go on the search for\nA Glenn Beck climbing K. two it'll probably pop up\nProduct 'cause I think they're doing this on the dark Web yeah a lot of ... last time you do some really put stuff in the dark Web uh so I don't I don't know maybe you'll have to find it there are but we're we're ah we're here talking about a Beto O'Rourke at Ted Cruz and the Texas Senate battle a lot of people calling in and saying that they\nKnew a lot of people who are white and not named Beto in the communities that he talked about on CNN last night and they look there's ... it is it could be a regional thing I Know there's a lot of differences between north and south I mean people look at you know figures like a Abraham Lincoln and better we leave and all these people who are uh you know from the\nDifferent cultures differently from where they are so I think that that's something that we can kind of look into as a possible cause for bed does a confusion here um\nThere are issues however when you try to appropriate culture that\nWhen you try to reach into some other uh cultural group and and and speak to them sometimes there are issues\nThere is a case it is that the media it's like ... is is like liking to highlight today are and it's just it's a commercial run on behalf of congressmen in Arkansas a French Hill now he had nothing to do with us at all although surely if you watch CNN Today he will be\nYou know blamed for it excoriated as a it's just some unrelated group running an ad in support of French ... which is part of our ridiculous campaign finance law situation\nUm where people when they want to donate more money than the the maximum which is completely unconstitutional to have in this country\nOr when people want to do that they give it to super PACs and they run ads on the behalf of the candidate that has no control over those ads so this is a bad being run in Arkansas\nIt's up it's related to Brett Kavanaugh and it's being criticized I don't know if you can detect anything here pat I Would like to get your call and whether you can detect anything seems a little odd here here's the ad from the group supporting French ...\nWhy do you think about what's happening in Washington Congress may bring and the Republican noticed dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt if they actually put black me\nDemocrats can do that to a white justice of the Supreme Court with no ... no cooperation and witnesses including her best friend so it didn't happen\nWhen white girl lives on them why Democrats will meet electing black poker game turnout always told my son don't mess around with that if you get she will crime rate\nTo keep Congress let banks here and the Republican because we have to protect our men and boys\nCan't afford to

authorized by any candidate for candidates\nKhamenei first of all I usually watch his show with ... I Would do that [laughter] sounds fantastic and these are obviously ... they're making yeah right like the point of\nAnd this is a fascinating thing from the left who thinks that\nYou know we we one of the biggest reasons Beto is you know in the public eye in the in the United states and not just the Texas figure is because of this video he made about it's ... it's a great idea to Neal or for the national anthem\nAnd what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick stating that black people are being unfairly accused without evidence and being shot in the streets for no reason because for crimes they didn't commit\nAt the same time we're supposed to get on board if you're on the left are supposed to get on board with\n... with the with a new standard in which any white woman can accuse a man of rape and we're just supposed to believer that is not going to work out well for African Americans or any ... any race of mail but this is the type of thing that makes no sense I mean there are real cases of this this isn't a\nKnow what the\nTrainer of you [noise]\nSo I mean the accident that almost an exact\nMission uh-huh he murdered somebody that we could we killed met a man of your business though we don't follow your white men law now wait not murdering somebody is white\nAnd I hope that that's true no I don't think it is either and by the way his Twitter account still active in case you are if you have a conservative that recently had his account of removed you could still get Lewis\nLewis could still keep potent posting these are the video the Jewish term I think it was posted on Twitter shut them down to the absolute Hitler sunburn talking about what this is Hitler stuff this is she they said the third Reich stuff this is you know the architect of the third Reich Beto ... spears\nStuff [laughter] it's just not right now [laughter]\nThey're getting deep [laughter] getting deep down here [laughter] but I think it's important to point out this is I'm not very it is that is the mayor and the fact that he can to get away with it with no repercussions still no I mean like yeah the yes if you ask the Democrat or even publicly\nWill you distance yourself from this guy up most of them will say yes they will distance himself I have nothing to do with how they will they will attempt that then you find pictures of them together right by like ... Iraq Obama comes out later ... but at least there at the point the only real repercussions this guy has has faced for any of this anti Semitism\nIs you know basically that he occasionally get they public denial from a public source and remember he he was a he said that very early on with Obama saying that he he said he would say this yeah he's going to distance himself from me but that's okay as long as he does the right thing\nRight you know I mean that's all right it's a it's a terrifying thing and the idea that I mean certainly the the you know you remember the million Man March right which was not million but it was a lot of people are you the nation of Islam is not a a group of of twenty here yet will find the Jews will not replace\nThose guys from Charlottesville gosh that's a national story and we talked for years and years and years and years the biggest story of all time yeah I mean these guys you know it's a much larger contingency here much Tripoli Seventy seven be easy [noise]\nRussia Limbaugh we knew until three on news radio not even ... one [noise]\nEvery day it seems like we turn on the news and you have absolutely no idea what's going to go on its war in Syria another mass shooting a terrorist attack another indictment and the Mueller investigation a mudslide an earthquake an inexplicable drop in the stock\nMarket it's crazy that's why you need to prepare\nThat because you're paranoid or pessimistic because every day sunrise can bring a beautiful day or a terrible nightmare the difference between people who are going to lead and survive and the people who are going to get lost\nOr whether or not they're prepared since ... eleven we'd been partnered with the folks at my patriots supply their the people I trust for my family's preparedness needs and from their line of emergency food storage that last up to twenty five years revolutionary\nElectric pure water filtration systems\nOr dozens of other products their preparedness specialist can help you make the right choice for your family\nCall a hundred two hundred Seventy one sixty three get started now or go to prepare with Glenn dot com for their latest special offer eight hundred two hundred Seventy one sixty three or prepare with Glenn dot com my patriots supply the first roses bottom have\nFinally arrive from one eight hundred flowers dot com these are beautiful roses in warm shades of red and orange and yellow they're the most vibrant that you're going to see all year round right now one eight hundred flowers is giving you an exclusive thirty six for thirty six off for thirty six autumn roses for thirty six bucks that's a dollar per rose to order thirty\nSix autumn roses for thirty six bucks to go to one eight hundred flowers dot com flick on the radio icon and enter the code back that's one eight hundred flowers dot com code back hurry offer ends friday\nBill O'Reilly here my new book and the killing series is killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals on earth\nIt's about Nazi evil and those who enabled it the book will stun you as Nazi hunters risk their lives to track down mass killers like Adolf Eichmann were protected by ruthless forces there is a reason why the killing books have sold more than twelve million copies\nSo I Hope you check out killing the ss it's well worth your time\nOffers that are too good to be true never allow anyone to force you to sign something and never give personal information to people you don't know get estimates and never pay in advance if you suspect fraud get the contractors license plate number and called the police immediately if something doesn't seem right\nIt's probably not protect yourself\nIs it N.

mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JT\nOr however this goes back to Nineteen Ninety eight here are are the percentages of democratic fundraising in Nineteen Ninety eight they had forty three percent of all fundraising okay uh in Nineteen Ninety eight in the house two thousand it was forty seven percent two thousand two forty seven percent two thousand four forty six percent\nYou've got to see a pattern and have their little been Republican slightly out raising them they're kind of changes in two thousand six where it goes to fifty percent Democrat than fifty six percent\nFor credit two thousand eight that's brought up on his first election\nUh it's been hanging around a fifty percent ever since two thousand ten was forty eight percent doesn't twelve forty four percent doesn't fourteen forty seven percent doesn't sixteen fifty percent so you get that there's a range from about forty three to fifty six percent that is broken and I'm fifty six was outlier most of the time it's right between forty seven fifty fifty one\nSo far in ... in two thousand Eighteen Democrats have raised sixty five percent of the money going to the house well again they've never been higher than fifty six sixty five percent a sixty five thirty five split against Republicans\nThey are out there was a congressman who came out the other day he raised eight hundred thousand dollars in his district thought he did a good job his opponent announced two point six million shoes and this is like it's unheard of when it comes to money and the disparity going on now\nThat we're ... the Democrats are favored to take the house I don't know how much it has to do with money\nBut if they were to lose this race with these ah with this sort of a climate it would be not complete destruction\nOf any argument that money can buy elections I mean this is they're they're gonna complain I mean Beto O'Rourke was on the stage complaining with Ted Cruz about money and how Ted Cruz is influenced by your ... made a hundred thousand dollar donation to him like I like this is a big a big deal in today's world\nUm but I mean he's he's raised this isn't even close Beto he's thirty eight million dollars more than any Senate candidate himself is in history yeah for a quarter or which is incredible you said it was it compares to bronco bottom was raising and what's your what he wants more\nIn the in the uh if you compare quarter to last quarter of the campaign in two thousand eight he raised more than ... Obama during his presidential\nCandidate that that's a presidential election emphasizing this is the Texas Senate ... Senate race where he barely have any chance to win uh-huh\nNow it's funny in the Senate race record he broke\nWas the what was the ... record set by Rick lousy oh of course you remember senator lousy oh from New York running a children's Hillary he did not win that race and it was not a close race\nEven though Rick loggia wasn't a bad candidate was not a close race it was Hillary right in New York [noise] expect her to win again ear to ear around fifty and almost every it's almost fifty fifty split every year and it's you're sixty five thirty five\nThat's a big she is um and the other thing that's kind of interesting on the and the bad side if you want to get\nScare mongering for awhile and why not cleanse out we haven't had enough scare mongering lately um we haven't set it always ends with a bullet to the head all we all week on well now in the last two days with knowing how we just you know we have a\nGoing back in history looking at\nTwo hundred and thirty eight seats with a democratic incumbent only eight percent of them are getting knocked off when you have a democratic incumbent running for Republicans the ... the rate is twice as high sixteen percent now is that a big difference I mean sixteen percent it's still not high\nBut it does show that Republicans wind up losing these incumbency races a little bit more often if you're worried about\nThe Senate it was a little bit of there was a little bit of something there to be worried about I think they're going to win the Senate I think you're in a sea of fifty three fifty four seat majority I think they may pick up a couple of states oh I'm I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Arizona I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Texas are those who were in question\n... I I think to winds up winning by maybe ten points or more I think it'll be a double digit\nI think that's a good chance of that um I wouldn't be surprised to see six to ten\n... you know um I wouldn't be surprised I think it'll be much closer to barely comfortable yeah for I think that's where he stands right now yeah uh Arizona is razor thin margin is right now but it's I think is trending well for the Republican they're like Sally I think a you've got toss ups in states like Nevada\nAnd Missouri and Florida in ... Montana seems to be leaning a little bit to the Democrat but I wouldn't you put that on the top and something like ... yeah well I saw it's close but um they pretty much a toss up race but\nThose other I mean Florida is a complete ... reason for the Democrats to continually when in Montana I don't understand it I don't know how to do a rifle junior I mean I'm Talking about West Virginia here\nI think Joe mansion ah probably sealed his reelection with his cabinet vote which was for Kavanaugh the only Democrat who did that brand they're all bumped up up the system when I have to\nUm I don't believe it I mean you look at his voting record he's worse than every single Republican thing about this he complain about Mitch McConnell you complain about a Susan Collins you complain about a summer cold Lisa Murkowski\nJoe mansions voting record is much worse than all of them\nAll of them yeah it's not even close I mean Mitch McConnell is like the biggest conservative of all time I mean for a Democrat he's he's moderate he's the most moderate Democrat yeah but I mean that's not saying much because Democrats are now communist stuck in the social listening communists yeah\nI mean the most part you think about Jeff Flake here's a guy who's getting ...\nBlood so so much by the White House and by the conservative media that he is resigning and not even trying to fight for head for that seat that the seat and Mick Sally is running for\nA well he votes with the president and more often than Joe Manchin it's not even close yeah you know again a West Virginia is a state is probably the most pro trumped state in the union\nHe won in West Virginia by almost thirty ... thirty I think yeah and you know this is like it was czar they would go for I mean I imagine it's got a big name in West Virginia again if you want to pick a Democrat in the Senate\nOr you know you probably mentioned would be the guy you'd be most optimistic for he voted even more I mean high capable almost certainly is going to lose now in North Dakota\nBut I mean in in\nWest Virginia got mad he got his cabinet vote you have a couple of it but again this is a guy who voted for Obama carries he's uh he's he is a Democrat and this is not a\nHe's a moderate Democrat as compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez but if that was West Virginia actually once you wouldn't think so apparently cell though he seems to be leading in the polls it is an interesting development there\nAre but it is a winnable she'll be winnable seat in this environment uh right now mentions leading that won fairly comfortable but even without the mentioned seat your ear at a I think you can get to fifty three fifty four without going crazy and I think you can get two fifty to fifty one it would be a real surprise if\nThey lost the Senate at this point I mean I think there is a good you know eighty percent chance that there I mean the most models are showing about an eighty percent chance they hold it and I think that's I think that's safe assumption\nYeah interestingly I you know when you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota or she's gone by eight point seven now yeah the average is eight point seven point a to the Republican Kevin Cramer so yeah that is looking pretty good yeah my pursuit\nThere I think honestly you had two races decided by the cabinet vote one was mentioned Joe ... high camp her vote against that sealed it I think I don't think she's ... I don't think she can win that race though\nI don't think she can win that race I think she's going to lose it I think she's going to lose a pretty big I would not be surprised as you said that double digits situation happens there yeah look again North Dakota as a conservative state ... are they are looking at high camp and\nI think a lot of people like to say well we've got this one Democrat this is what we've got the one good Democrat I think people like to say that you know I think states in general like to say well we're not partisan we've got in a democratic governor we've got a democratic senator and there's something there's some level of pride there to say like we're not only voting one way\nWhen you vote against Brett Kavanaugh in those circumstances would the arguments she used this is not someone who is a borderline Democrat this is someone who is embracing the same sort of standards you're seeing from Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi\nAnd all of these far left figures and good for North Dakota in ... for Jetta sing her as a a as a result of that it looks that way good yeah it looks that way yeah yeah there's some uh optimistic things\nThere but the dangers there as well I mean is this is going to be an interesting one and ... and the thing that's really unfortunate is if\nIf that happens is let's say the result is and I think this will be a good result for Republicans right now\nWhich is you get fifty three or fifty four senators in there and you lose the house but you lose it narrowly you lose it let's say by eight or ten a seat you have a minority you might be able to get some stuff through in certain circumstances but it's going to be difficult\nPlaying back Taliban but that still we'd be joined by Jesse [noise]\nHosted I issue in the fat with Jeff Haiti a incredibly explosive\nPot cat I don't think it changes that though why who joined the fat with ... I don't really like oh yeah [laughter] that's great yeah I like it here you can now buy like get the podcast every day every day Monday through\nFriday [laughter] but uh for pm central five pm eastern drops in or you can give it wherever ...\nYeah I'm just chewing the fat with Jeff Fisher is how you find it\nUh and uh you should do that a and Jeff you have the I think that's a casual story for you today okay or just because we talked about it I'm just yesterday but this could be the most Jaffe headline of on time though Nevada brothel owner expected to win the election despite death [noise]\nA man that a man a fair amount of still on that he was still going to win on the on the ballot they have to put a red where they have to put a sign up where in the voting hall that he was still on the ballot but he's dead he's still on the ballot but he's dead but people are still\nSo if he wins or who serves they will nominate a Republican to replace him I guess so this is your weight and this has happened in previous races as well where are candidate passes away and then people still get them what's it\nMissouri where there he had nothing to do it inside and his wife\nYeah a served in instead yeah yeah so I mean\nThat's all they won't be one of his hookers though it will be someone else so I don't know we don't know\nWell you I mean we do a business partner or you know ... yeah of can be I mean who\nKnows it could be I mean we don't know how many Republican hookers he has it could be on a high percentage we don't know we don't know [laughter] I find out but I think that's got to be interesting you're voting for someone who's who's dead and and the NFL self described him [laughter]\nOh yeah that was just I mean he was that was the deal that Republican morals 'cause he's ... he's a Republican big a big ... he ... he ran one other time in almost won the last ... and they have is actually going to win it looks like well\nI'm I noticed that you are still talking about Glenn and his canoe trip but I look for the go pro video online and\nI did you check the dark Web it's on the dark Web no yeah that's weird oh yeah oh uh it's interesting because we I just got an email here it says ah this is ... is doing pat I may be your only listener who's actually staring at the Mediterranean Sea\nAnd say listen [laughter] I can ... that Glenn is nowhere to be seen rowing near and mountain the\nOkay I Will anyway that was his departure pulled that's where he left from there so he'd be a long way from there now yeah\nYeah you're not gonna be able to hear\nOf ocean good to be there at ... yesterday or the day before probably or yeah or they're yeah I'll be back on Monday though we think well he's he he he's already done the canoe thing across the Mediterranean and now he is uh he's climbing\nA cake too as we speak and all that training is done is paying off man it's paying off it sure is and you can tell when you look at him also by the way I got a lot of us that work out like that now they are when you're you're ... yet put you guys in the same category\n[laughter]\nSo do the effort [laughter] good news good news coming I Know that ah you know where everybody was concerned about a carbon taxes but they're going to be here the Exxon Mobil is announced that they're going to give a million dollars to the Americans for carbon dividends and that means that uh the carbon carbon taxes out its way\nStreet gang San ExxonMobil is doing this that's where they're giving their unbelievable why are they why are they ... like the ...\nNow there's some belief that out actually caving we're just giving ... million to pretend right there for it and they're not really so so that's very possible that was the lead to\nGet people off their back and get nobody off your back they know just to leave then you're ... you're just re ... just said they were faking it yes I think ... you don't get the credit for this and of course you know it is an interesting thing\nWhen it comes to a new government regulation all these companies that go through in and want free enterprise when they're coming up in the world right when they get to be the biggest boys they light and some of these new taxes regularly do because it winds up punishing upstart competitors\nYou know Exxon can swallow a little bit of a stroke or regulation and not not deal with it\nAnd it's like Google writes things you know they're they're heavily involved in in a lot of the net neutrality stuff and I got her Google ... like they can take a little bit of it they deal with it and if the you know if the guy down who's starting up something new that winds up getting punished listen", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "19"}
