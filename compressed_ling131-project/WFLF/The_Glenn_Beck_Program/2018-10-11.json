Native Americans how they're supposed to feel when they don't feel that way in poll after poll after poll\nOne part of the standard narrative of the data partially affirmed is that African Americans are most likely to support political correctness but the difference between them and other groups is much smaller than generally supposed\nThree quarters of African Americans oppose political

just about politics and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump that can be about ... the national anthem\nThat can be about something that a celebrity status and an amplified in sort of turned up to eleven so that people get really heated about it Star Wars is in that category too and there might be some evidence to show that this is actually happening every day\nGives me the evidence this is incredible\nYeah so it's it's circumstantial in many ways but that's by nature of what we're dealing with here when you're talking about foreign influence and particularly\nMalicious activity coming from the Russian ... or ... or ... puppet accounts you were talking about a moving target people who are deleting their accounts changing their information making new accounts\nStaying active so that they can't actually be attracted to it and given location and if Morton bay the ... the researcher at USC could prove definitively that these are Russian agents that he should be working at the CIA but he's not he's just a researcher at USC and what you look at is you look at the characteristics of\nSocial media accounts on line conduit to I what I just mentioned is what behavior is due to engage in to speak in all caps what words they use and then as they are out there the next week when you look them up again\nThese are sort of things that you look for when you're talking about foreign influence on line and it might be Russian that might be the Chinese it might be Iranians or it might be some Floridian with a bone to pick with the rest of the country\nBut that so what did they landed live at one time they plan to into our society\nWell in this case what they planted 'em there was evidence that there were sixteen account that could specifically be rushing linked\nA

twenty twenty candidates have as you mentioned bones so I have a long way to go pay\nSo maybe that could be you know I I don't know Spartacus his campaign slogan\nBold first Spartacus\nI Know where to buy a bone song\nIt yes I mean I I ... than it is to say to which I don't see it going to be in a cage detail because they just say it but\nIt comes out of the loudest countering lighten the philosophy it comes out this then as I said it's a it's a kind of coming together as as an artistic and and hit us a call last night and\nThe artistic side of it is actually really fun we we don't have to worry about and a ... and may not it went it without being applied to\nSociety and we're starting to understand society as and they'd be constructed in systems of power and knowledge is a construct of the power that it comes from language the language\nIs dangerous because it constructs that reality that and that sort of the key ideas which are underlying the problem with that we're seeing now\nYou say that it doesn't have a ... that it's not raining worrisome in orange but I Would consider literature art as well\nAnd this is this is now how we are being taught that we have to read literature that uh we read it through the lens of oppression white male European oppression\nUm even if the even if the author is saying no no that's not what the story is about but not the author is not even the the last word on this is the the post modernist they can take and read that tax any way they want direct\nAbsolutely yes I mean I think that there's a slight confusion because that approach to protest it out if the cultural philosophical problem but\nA lot and look for example would be a very different thing it would be something that had made clear that it has an unending ... which is just the beginning of last histories which doesn't add up so that is a style that is oh\nOkay completely separate from okay moralistic thing\nAll right so you're saying as an artist you could create something that has no meaning um but it is only when it's used as a critique that it starts to get into trouble\nThan it's wonderful to die on and you say about ... than not political said than not the same purpose\nGreat okay um so tell me how it where it grew and and how it grabbed us by the throat or university systems\nAt the uh the original slugging it they're just sitting at a smoker because they think rises in the late sixties including as you all for Farley atop shack day or a ... and and they can help because\nAnd they can't get that or some potatoes an old saying that the same time at the same message\nThat they would ... with the mother period they would disillusioned with locks and David deflation with religion and institutions and they they thought that these what can I just think comfortable understanding of the things that had just food in the top ... comments\nOff to the well was that the forces empire\nOh these ... were crumbling and and there's a shift in society to try to understand all the things that we saw with trade actually trade the London is and I it took this to a new set of stuff they ... and he said\nThe reality is not something we find it something that we make and make it in the status of law so it is powerful great which has decided for us what he's trained and they understood to be a white heterosexual\nMen and they should they should be um pick the best London is when they think it has taken a and political go they sat and he left it to but they what they what they claim that\nThey wanted to sort of thing with the power shed problems with it\nIt wasn't until the late eighties early nineties when I lost of and feminist and a critical a serious cliff David ... said taking everything up these is good and well yes we need to be construct pay yes we need to see that everything is socially constructed\nBut we have to have some kind of reality if we're going to address anything we cannot fix on poll address and it's actually going to get winning unless we agree that women are saying that the experience that and things and certain kinds of places\nThere was a change to bring back some kind of attack could reality and that was of privilege and power that could then they analyze that steady subjectively from\nThe perspective of experience and with the assumption that we're looking at a power imbalance in any interaction between great\nSo let me let me let me go back and because I think people might be thinking why are we talking about post modernism how does it relate to my life\nThis I Believe is critical in it too if you don't understand this or at least have a basic handle on it you don't know what you're fighting you don't know what's really happening you don't know who's behind a lot of his or what the series are behind it\nSo let me let me first say post modernism the modern world is the world that was created that chased out\nDark ages it was the it's the world created by the enlightenment of of science and reason them period the empirical evidence\nUh and and even I mean the ... when you hear people say mathematics is racist this is because we're there trying to deconstruct anything that holds\nThe modern world together is that correct\nThat they they felt that it has been constructed on any that a lot of Boy Scouts and this relates somehow toilet 'cause I I I think they have the problems with\nThe idea that then it ... ... and you know nature that the public have window or ran\nAt white people\nThat that is that is that\nOkay I'm going to take you hum before we move forward or I Want to take you back one more a step\nI'm a I'm going to take a break and then we come back the I'm like you to help me on this because it's my understanding that uh dared on fur coat or came over\nTo the United states that this was really kind of shaped in frustration from the Nineteen sixty eight Paris a riots\nAnd in frustration that they're not going to be able to take this whole thing down unless they take it all that and they got to take all the system's down they're not going to win through culture\nUm and that it was that it was actually a much more strategic in its I'm planting of a virus if you will and I'd love to hear your take on that if that's true or not when we come back we're with Helen ... road\nAnd we also have to ask her about\nThe

been really\nGood for Republicans in the ... uh it looked really positive we don't there hasn't been enough of it to necessarily know that the two two are tied but it does seem like\nI'm a real positive things have happened in red states where Republicans were a little bit on the ropes at one point um for example give you a Ted Cruz Chevy Cruze going up against Robert Francis O'Rourke he's an Irishman\nYou may you know bad oh yeah oh yeah they go into most Irish people are called better so point that out but Robert Francis O'Rourke is running against Ted Cruz some of the polls there's one poll that had him tied at one point\nUm uh uh several polls showed cruise only up by one or two New York times doing something really really interesting in which you know normally you kind of see\nThe ... news no well I didn't say that they're doing something interesting in that like normally see polls and you see it like if you think of it as a as a sporting event like the ... a football game happens and then you will score after right like you're not seeing the play by play the game with a poll you're only seeing the results that in\nNew York times is trying something this cycle that's different which is there actually showing you as they make the calls\nWho's voting for who when you see the whole build slowly as you watch it it's addicting to watch uh and uh\nIt's kind of interesting 'cause one of the things you'll notice is how many calls they have to make to get anybody to agree I at one point a yesterday um the Texas Senate poll they had made Seventeen thousand seven hundred phone calls\nAnd had two hundred and eighty five people who ... that's how hard it is for them to get people on the phone anymore to take these polls which is a is part of that and why it's hard to read you know 'cause I mean who's going to answer yeah who's going to do that but Cruz in that poll wound up up a nine points\nIn that one and he seems to be honest when their eyes are open up a lead there again and I'm not surprised by it either a surprise that will get into all the details coming up [noise]\nRush Limbaugh we ... knew until three on news radio not every point

let the fundamentals of the U.S economy with the tax cuts the deregulation is that high employment I I'm Still I'm Still really high on the U.S economy I'm Still I on the stock market especially at these low low prices right\nNow so what happened yesterday what what what spooked it\nWork good question where I'll scratch your head wondering what it was I mean Donald Trump seems to think it was ... and there's no question that the fed interest rate hike a and their announcement that they're going to continue to raise interest rates certainly more people out of stocks and bonds because why not just rates rise than\nBonds are more attractive relatively than shocks I'm usually those effects of of a pet ...\nJust our short term so I don't I don't think you're going to see a long term effect from out although I tend to\nAgree with Donald Trump that here we've got this blooming economy we don't see real science of inflation although energy prices are rising but you know bother commodities are are pretty stable or or actually falling and price so I don't see a big inflation gain and ... I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth to this\nTo the fed and and a ... journal Jerome Powell why you've taken a punch bowl away from this already just when it's getting boring and I tend to I tend to think\nThat he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but just because the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that that job is to squash shows a stock market rally and pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm an inflation watcher and uh and hyperinflation novel evolution watcher guy I was I was really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and the tax break\nWe haven't seen it\nWe're showing inflation I mean look I Would I ... I have to admit you know I I admit when I'm wrong I'm a I'm a conservative that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but\nI did predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we are international trade we have um [noise]\nYou know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and that trade and technology are two things that really keep prices down and affordable and so I ... my only point is I just think the fed acted preemptively and prematurely and raising rates\nIn in a in a way that was and that's where I Am a little concerned by the way I go on about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like equivalent of four dollar a gallon\nGas I why that's why hasn't gone up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nBe there soon soon are you there yeah maybe not near where you just said okay why I'm a why did why is oil going up\n[laughter] that's a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the um [noise] in the middle east with respect Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off as a result I mean a big rise in the price because people are really concerned about the um\nYou know about the price of the global reduction in supply as a result\nOf having sex out back online bring Texans Becca bring Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think\nWe'll probably still going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it when I mean I don't know where you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick stick on the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next\nYear or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again so [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now it's just fear you know this the stock market is driven by fear and greed\n[laughter] that's true isn't for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and then by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred I said to my wife funny let's let's take some of these profits and and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nEven the let me [noise] um let me ask you this I don't know if this is true\nOr this is an old wives' tale but the last president that I heard really take on the bed [laughter]\nWas Ronald Reagan and uh we had Nineteen percent interest rates right certainly after that until you stop talking about the fed\nWhen her and the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lot of people say it's it's it's a\nA you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week on why the president as his chief executive officer of the country right he's the one who was supposed to help manage our economy if he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't they speak out\nI'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fat correct type I\nI think there's a lot of one of the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years that these are not some kind of or uncles on high at the fed they act as if there was a temple with all of the knowledge and all of the intelligence but they've made so many mistakes so you're going to mention I remember the seventies as you do when we had\nLiterally twenty percent mortgage interest rates\nThat was all because of fed mistake and ah you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know what's the one that built up this bubble that led to the housing crisis in\nTwo thousand seven and they said we keep thinking these people are somehow like God like\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know [laughter] let me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement uh and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with China\nI I fear that Donald Trump really likes the trade wars are and we're not that this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is you know great but do you think isn't Steven [noise] that's what he really fundamentally believes that terrorists are good\n[noise] here's my view I and I've talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at his Rose Garden ceremony last week when he announced the new trade agreement and he basically said look\nI Will um I Will I'm I'm using these tariffs as a\nTool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I never trade strategy but I gotta say so far you know the\nThe kind of apocalyptic view has not happened Trump is getting some good deals he got to deal with Mexico he played candidate like a federal or where he basically said you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on the night before the\nThe deal had to be seal candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe and then that leads to Canada I mean to China and this is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with that I don't know how you and I haven't talked about this plan but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheating\nStealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an electoral property they're building up their military they're like you know the old Soviet Union in terms of a lot of the tactics they're using on so I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nAh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction or when it comes to China let\nMe challenge beyond that one or a you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way Trump looks at it and I think he's right about that like if we can't trade with China we sneak if they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia\nAnd I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't they were ... their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets mean damn near everything you buy in Walmart is made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that card and saying look we're not gonna give you an unfettered access to our markets if you're not going to play by the rules\nI talked to company CEOs all the time if one who basically say it's almost impossible to penetrate the China market you got to give up ownership of your company has to give up your trade secrets ... I mean we can't live with that in his right eye when he says look I didn't start this trade deal this trade war they started at ten years ago\nI Would feel better if we also weren't big they also weren't or bank at the same time I would feel better about it\nHey Stephen quickly one quick question for you and you probably have a real impact on the ah the we were kind of talked about the steel tariffs and these things going on allies are ... like Canada and ... as a way of\nNegotiating to bring these contracts at the table for what was kind of like a ... a NAFTA to point out type of situation well that happened but the steel tariffs are still on Canada do you have any idea why or is this going to change in any point\nWell this is one of the issues that I find my you know as you know I'm a big fan of Donald Trump I helped write the tax plan with my buddy Larry Kudlow so but I I just disagree with this policy I don't see the wisdom and steal an auto and all that\nBut I still had to install them so I called my defined consulting Carla she talked me through it all from picking the right blind to installing ... class online defined consultation\nWas free samples were free shipping was free my home looks perfect valet\nFor a\nCrime back led you here let me go to Jerome in Ohio Hello John you're on the Glenn Beck program\nGoing how's it going good well um the uh I don't want to say but the the gentleman that you got into with it yesterday yes I'm\nAt stuff that was me three years ago I was I was ready to I was ready to fight I was ready to punch ready to stop you know the the whole nine yards at\nThat ah I'm I [noise] sorry I found hope\nAnd uh my uh sorry\nMy uh my daughter was born she was born a four month thoroughly and uh I uh my focus away from everything going on around the world to what was going on in my house by household\nAnd uh it was a\nSorry it was a challenging um we were\nShe was she was born member first and she was at the hospital on so until Easter and she came home and she had a G. tube and uh she was on oxygen and stuff like that but she was home\nUm I Am remarried\nAnd a B and my wife we have between us we had three three daughters and we try for about ten years and thought that ever happened and that are out of the blue wife calls me and says a weed out of conversation and uh she told me that uh\nThat she was pregnant and uh it's I don't know I I sympathize with the the the gentleman you you were talking with um\nBecause I I still have moments where I Want to get angry and stuff but then I'd stop and take a step back and brave at this bank of like of a daughter you know\nSo did you think did you get that gain hope or do you do gain perspective\nYes [laughter] up both again both a ... it's just I I had hoped because I Want I Want a better world for my daughter you know a a\n... drum thank you for sharing that and thank you for um thanks for your honesty of emotion there um the the good thing is this what I tried to impress upon our caller yesterday after um hung up unfortunately was\nWe're weaning we're winning commonsense is winning it doesn't feel like it but that's just because the power structure that you're used to\nIs no more and when you look at what's happened and you look\nAt the Democrats saying the things that they're saying now that you know Eric\nEric Holder today the latest is you know when they go low we can come\nAt that's that's not\nAn American principle that's not the way we should be have I don't want that from our side I don't think people want from their side new research shows eighty percent of the American people feel the same way\nA good thing when we're when they're\nThan I ever imagined the parade longer hand to enter from on NPR hundred dollars to hand

free salon polity color for under twenty five dollars and joined the hundreds of thousands of women who have tried and lumped Madison ...\nFind your perfect shape [noise] [noise]\nWe're more on Florida coming up in just a second can we take a look at a also the uh\nUh the election numbers I think it's about time we started getting a you know your analysis do because I Know you love stats and there's nobody better looking at the numbers than you\nThank you the polls are heading and they're coming in fast and Ah yes there's a lot to ah to understand about where that's going to get into that I'm sure we start there or do you want to start with some of the hurricane stuff\nUh well I don't know if I Want to talk to somebody who cannot agree with NBC News that are not natural disasters these are man made disasters now\nSo it was a man made that we want an entire decade basically without getting one hurricane hitting me let me ask you something about that sir yes ah\nWhich you would agree with me that over the last ten years in the last ten years ... we have seen a dramatic increase in hurricanes here in the United states since we dropped out of the Paris accords\nYes sir no sir is a yes or no answer\n... you're saying has it gone from zero to two and the time that\nI mean since he's been out of that a crease Tyler I mean the trend is not increasing that we we have one year they had more than another year is that what you're trying because I'm asking\nYou in the last ten years have we seen a cup of these ... these so called natural disasters I Want to just in the last couple of years\nThank you for your question NBC there has been an increase from all over the years ... very much [laughter] that journalism these days it is here's what the PCC says remember this is\nAl Gore's a favorite place to go for information okay this is what they say about hurricanes numerous studies toward the end beyond the fifth assessment report of the Irish ... ah PCC have reported a\nDi di di di di\nGreasing trend in the global number of tropical cyclones\nAnd or the global globally accumulated psychotic energy there's low confidence regarding changes in global tropical cycle numbers under global warming over the past four decades there's consequently low confidence in the larger number of studies reporting increasing trend in the global number of very intense cyclists the view\nAnd I pay cc reports the latest the latest update\nTo bring out of a boring un talk what they're saying is total number of a hurricane's going down\nAnd there is low confidence in any change in the I'm In ... like what they say it's like well because they used to say there's going to be more frequent intense hurricanes then they realized the frequency thing wasn't happening there it's going to be more intense they don't even have evidence of that and so\nThat gives me Mr ... here is this not the strongest storm a ... on record did that is hit to value the Florida Panhandle\nThat is the report thank you sir I rest now here's the summary [laughter] uh the PCC once\nAgain reports that there is little basis for claiming that drought floods hurricanes and tornadoes have increased much less increased due to a greenhouse gases that exactly the story you're getting on the media when they're trying to say it would have tenure so today's renewed\nThis they've they've they've up to their commitment and in response I tell them\nUp yours [laughter] so [laughter] ah [laughter] it is a pretty remarkable\nOkay let me let me ask\nYou this as we get into the poll numbers\nI Believe there's a chance we see a red wave because of Kavanaugh\nThan we were concerned that there would be this massive blue blue wave in both the house and the Senate I think we see a red wave not a tidal wave but a red\nWave it's possible first of all I Would say Kavanaugh if\nIf the last two years have been any indication Kavanaugh will be ancient history by the time this election happens it's like three weeks from now I like these things go away for example uh the the Access Hollywood tape happened right about this time in two thousand sixteen\nRight about now Tobar eighth or ninth ...\nUh and that by the time the election came as we saw had basically no impact all time news stuff goes away fast and I think there will I don't think this is because because it's not just Kavanaugh if they would've yeah
