ninth our radio by afterwards I live in Los Angeles\nFriday January or casting your on your favorite holiday and I are not catch towards the dot com the road\nAnd Republicans got smoked two thousand ten or you had a sixty six percent Republican\nA percentage of people who are really interesting election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked um he said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans\nAnd ... percent said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh you had the same type of thing playing out again in this time in favor\nOf the Democrats it started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats highest levels of interest in the election\nWas only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Senate and lose the house or at least makes it possible since Kavanaugh that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance of very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two thousand six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy it is a a a ...\nThere's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nRelatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of seats um there is a you know if you look at kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that that it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if they were able to sweep all of the races their favorite and\nUh and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point\nSo all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is the idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happened the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where the down by five in the polls don't want him winning some of those races\nSo the split it's going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that than losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote\nAgainst the president so it's an interesting way of looking at it and it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance\nThat the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power and have subpoena power are going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from\nUm you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation of ... ... yeah well we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh saying a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again I just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had\nA legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that look like leaning Republican we're all toss up or in some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat they had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh saying now I mean I think it's a real ... gonna\nCome ... to the independents how are the independence feeling\nAt the ... they're in an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten or fifty percent independents are\nAlmost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that type of course a blanket role but it's typical um and she doesn't fourteen was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until Kevin I was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with it and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo yeah but I Wonder\nBecause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls and so I'm Wondering you know where that four percent jump was\nIt a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever being right higher likelihood that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats like yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that that is growing and has been\nGrowing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in ... or\n... could come down to the independence ... this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah ... ... ... ... I mean I Would think they\nAre discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything\nOr they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting boost outta here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters\nSo ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... come Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal sense night in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen it was forty one percent very low\nOr in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped in October of two dozen itching to Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one\nLimbaugh we ...

what's new today on the free I her radio ad high check out our cat tire radio for that\nA national emergency I'm Dave Anthony Fox News President Trump tweeted that about the caravan of seven thousand migrants headed to the U.S saying he's alerted the border patrol in the military because Mexico was unable to stop it and what a mama Honduras and El Salvador code neither so the president wrote the U.S will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid\nTo um as far right as they come on the right versus left continual but it's very important to remember that the purpose of politics is to maintain a framework for ordered liberty so that you can go live in the communities of love where you're actually raising your kids and build a\nBetter mouse trap or app or where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are\nThey're anti constitution so you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics but at what point do you see good people say enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end ... what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did or to Nancy\nPelosi in California how are you aware of those did to Mitch McConnell at all a shower and Kentucky exactly ...\nBecause there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do\nBut screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off their table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet\nThat kinda stuff doesn't actually have\nPersuasion as any goal\nBe the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rant a witch headstrong pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta and taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... a phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing\nThat I I'm In I'm In the middle of a little downtown sort of restored downtown in Omaha right now and there's no way to fight here and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about anti ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media ecology in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that that basically Ninety nine per se\nOf households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it was shared content and\nThere was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with him about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two they're\nStill really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media\nAs if the people like anti ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignore them [noise]\nSo what is are\nAre we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the things that I can I continually come back to every single time is the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone\nYeah yeah is that our our even our own them\nSo yes ... ... e pluribus unum out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest\nAll of those things flow from a fundamental assumptions about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we\nBelieve Margot day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and with dignity that way bigger than their policy preferences\nAnd so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest and statistically the number one driver of happiness\nIs do you have meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if\nThose four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but\nWe're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of stick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nUm ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and what you write about what's deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this\nA and a year

[noise]\n\nLine [laughter]\nAnd welcome to the program [noise]\nGlad you're here we have a Larry sharp coming in next he is a a\nHe's a guy who is running for governor of New York and we talked to him on the phone recently and I really really liked him a thought he was just a\nThought he was a guy who didn't sound like any politician I've heard in New York a and a guy who has out of the box answers are that are the kinds of things that we should be talking about you know your fix the roads okay how about a renaming the Williamsburg Bridge\nTo the staples bridge or whatever it is [laughter] oh okay I'm good with that anybody else I mean why would you be against that I'm totally for that oh really 'cause they'll get their name on traffic updates and everything else sure yeah go for it\nI mean in a situation where in the least of our worries yet the name of the bridges yeah uh yeah ... that is interesting I you know again someone advocating for smaller government today is so rare\nTo Frisco kind of we have the free care and we're gonna bring them in in the cage and poke\nAt every once in awhile so ... she'll say smaller government poke\nI I Love that I was again I'm I've come to the point in my life I'd much rather err on that side even if there are certain things that are ... you know I might disagree with libertarians on a ... I just would rather err on the side of someone who's saying take the power away from the government to make the fish and\nA and you know I mean I'm pretty much libertarian and close to it um as you can be but still it's like it's it's bizarre how many people say they agree with the ... the principles and then the end near there and I don't either and\nIs exactly he becomes amazing they have no idea what he did they have no idea who he is but he's the rebellion guy so he becomes a symbol of her by on the left them you don't get me wrong or that people on the left or exactly who these people are of course there are but that's often the leadership I'm Talking the average everyday person who votes\nThey just know what's happening now isn't working that's why people listen to me when I should talk I talk about ways of making people better I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life\nLiberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about this I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness All right so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there are there many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI ... I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal hang on weight before it short stuff started without me I should go with ... absolutely I'm the one talking about getting rid of all standardized testing proud of high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because satirized testing is it unfair way of getting teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and it's not a case of success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across his entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests that is so stupid and to be some come successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined where you should go or you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do think that that means you are in the school prior to Nineteen eighty and it was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really wasn't a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information that way but they really do anything somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read\nWrite survive in the world without at at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school districts did a good job somehow that worked\nThey add the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nAnd they give you a quick rundown of every single time centralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some localized central and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators\nBecause here's the problem with getting ready than I've testing you will lose about we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not into the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here when we lose that four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strikes which means administrators\nGo away and then it shows what writing granted many shows were checking boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRegulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one saying these things because I cross the entire state might say that's easy to counties across all if you\nOnly get the full sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more than ... than teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminishing makes over a hundred and fifty among you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done\nWhy in the world we have K. through twelve ... K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirteenth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWest terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and when you say I Wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who would tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one uh ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is will be able to show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes or the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey gotta has a plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is they got a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and it for a new computer all day ... that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixteen let's not make some decisions\nIf I think called you right for me I go to a two year ... to ... ... is that the biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator life is good\nI don't like that no word on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves Dr tease him I talked to ...\nI'm a doctor who got back to the gate sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nStory data okay yeah I'm so that kid who's really smart that could take the SAT right away and goes off and get to a degree why should they be bored in school they should be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things now where he's going to be a trade school\nChoice could become a plumber carp and do whatever you want to be about mechanic an H ... guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I let my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old\nMy problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough in New York City doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that go get a job\nWhy not go learn ... work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people in my generation I just feel the need to go work learn what it means to have a boss lieutenant means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nA lot of these sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelve\nRight I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here is six team you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use it good luck here's what I'm his wife ... going to happen a bunch of cool prep schools will pop up\nA bunch of great trade schools will pop up get that much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars going day well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will absolute give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere's the best part when these schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year for the last two years the ... states spend twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each\nTwelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders is more than four billion dollars\nWe saved all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nFor governor in a New York and I think his ideas need to be heard and he needs to be a needs to be introduced to a larger audience how what is your organization like what's your ground game\nYeah we have we have probably the best um libertarian ground you've seen the longtime um if probably ever we have over seven or eight directors campaign manager\nAbout thirty five to fifty people who are actively working every day on every aspect of the campaign to include things like a scheduling setting up a ... a fix our calendar\nOr making sure people show of social media we have a a team on Twitter team on Instagram a team on Facebook where we have a team when everything YouTube we do video production\nWe didn't go to and you don't have but you you're lacking money you're up against people who have tens of millions\nOf tens of millions of dollars absolutely we've raised almost half a million but to be to be clear if in these last couple of weeks if we raise another fifty thousand dollars hundred thousand dollars\nThis becomes winnable I Know it sounds crazy but it is and the reason is name recognition is my only issue the last poll we put out I was at about one third name recognition and with that I pulled that Thirteen\nPercent seem to the math on that one three times to get to a hundred percent equals thirty nine percent right through time Thirteen thirty nine percent\nThis a five way race thirty percent when this thing some nine points above victory assuming I get a hundred percent\nThere is the hard part writes a math equation can I get to a hundred percent and sadly that's not my message I've got that down it's the media can I get my name out to enough people to where I cross over that barrier which gets to be over thirty per\nSe I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win\nYes what I hear it has really is as well get get remember at as third party in general the system is sacked against you and some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality could do this\nBecause every day I'm up against failure but the marine corps taught me take the hill the captain shot take the hill the machine guns broken take fail radios don't work take the hell are stopped giving excuses take fail I get it and that's what I Do I take the hill as a matter\nI get I I literally deal with sail your everyday this woman every day and when I say that that's not an exaggeration\nThat's every single day as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS and they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even do thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot\nWCBS they got him ... I think is his name he there's decided nope lottery shop dozens of beyond their he's decided that the establishment is all that matters this is what I'm up against it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that to you think should be heard than you should probably um maybe tweet storm what's his name again\nAt CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think that was Tim shelled so this is a radio debate yes well it's gonna be televised also now okay we both televised on radio ...\nSo yeah again and they're just deciding now we don't want the dummy wrong there are three other people should be made should also be the Green Party and also the same party they should all be there but this is the norm and we put up against this Web against is constantly and here's the the worst part\nStill growing and they're still going down that's that's the sad part they don't they don't they don't realize that when a sinking ship or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate how's he doing\nLarry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to get forty five thousand dollars you can't the mass among mass forty four thousand [laughter] by New York state law so if you I Know what I Want to get like forty five thousand dollars sorry you can't do it forty four you only can give forty four thousand it's all you can get a okay\nLarry sharp a dot com this with an e at the end of sharp um I Want I Want to talk to you about some of the issues of the day and and how we solve some of the things like for instance healthcare yes how do you solve healthcare will do that coming up in a just a second\nA standby on TV Tonight is tonight Michael ...\nMichael ... from uh New York university a fascinating guy if you haven't met him yet you will tonight and it will be or something you don't forget a guy who used to write white papers for the Communist Party who now says wait a minute and democratic socialist near the hell out of Maine\nAmerica's first news when Gordon Deal every day five to six AM news radio Ninety three point one Mm\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] I find that come in with Larry sharp I'm doing a story will candidate a for a for New York or\nShe is libertarian and uh is making waves in New York and he's a voice that you should hear because his\nHis policies are different than the Republican and the Democrat and I believe they're very very workable in a in an era when we are changing everything when technology has changed everything\nWhy we're still looking at a system uh you know that feels like the old Soviet\nSize styles centralized system is beyond me but\nI'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um\nYou are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo is pushing them around quite a bit\nEspecially when it comes to the second amendment a and trying to deep platform ah people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for a governor to impede business\nPeriod no ... no ... if I don't like in the industry or like something I never said if I Want to have freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief I should be the marketer and chief\nNot not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's always not only\nDoing that he's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around his edicts right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example\nJust wants to insurance force firearm now we can't get it there's no way that the individual and there are at least for me and I'm gun owners in New York state if not more\nWell how do they need insurance now\nWhen when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore\nQuit for any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yeah and that's the unethical part that's the issue\nRight and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by default matter what you do\nThat's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight and we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe act compliant\nSay fact was passing twenty Thirteen and the the fact said that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal literally what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before a complete legally totally above board you are now a violent felon it was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent tell them to\nNot joking is true story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes all the ... revamped of all because of that in other words but it now if you are retired cop once you retire when you're a felon again\nThese are not good cop this and this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad\nThe the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy mhm constantly project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a business man\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired ... that's what he's done we've lost over ... million since he's ascendant thrown over a million ... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million look they're voting with their feet\nWhen it yes it is so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and their pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent in New York state they being spent in Florida we really we literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes so let's take\nPension style true pensions are there is a ticking time bomb yes there's no\nWay to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises to people who work their whole life and were promised ally", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Pine Hills", "day":
