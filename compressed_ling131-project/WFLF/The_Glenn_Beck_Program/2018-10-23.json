five hundred people a mass with another flag to cross a border I Would\nSay would probably have to be if you were in the military crossing into Iraq from Kuwait\nNow\nDo you remember the reason why we had to wait to go into a right you just don't land in go\nBecause you need to logistics\nAnd the logistics of moving a crowd that size is a nightmare otherwise it becomes a death march\nBecause people are going to get tired they're going to fall they're going to be dehydrated you don't stop at a seven eleven with Seventy five hundred people to get some water\nWhere's just the water coming from where where is the emergency aid for those who are falling ill along the way ...\nWhere are they going to the bathroom have you ever gone to a McDonalds is you're traveling across the country and\nA

they're using where are you stopping for food nobody's controlling logistics\nWow media is is is truly spontaneous and miracle I'm expecting God apart the borders for them\nBecause God surely must be involved to keep them alive for this exodus away from pharaoh\nOn believable\nWe welcome to the program Mr pat gray hello pat\nWow the hatred I just was a party to just was\nDeluged [laughter] as as I Know I Know I Know wow what does the president do I you know ... the only thing you can do is send the military what what are you supposed to aid aid cut it all oh yeah yeah I've got it right now but it being right here if they get here the military is the only solution you\nCan't let them in no way it's Seventy five hundred people look at they they tried to handle it on the southern Mexico border yeah the ... the ... just rushed in yeah\nSo if I could ah demise CNN impersonation briefly so what you're asking for them to just start shooting and killing all the ... the guy that's what that's what they are no riot riot police ah with tear gas\nAnd yes if you have to rubber bullets\nYes sometimes those hurt I Know they'll we'll see well the well and you know I ... some people might die some people might die don't come over here you don't do it okay we have let's just say this we have Seventy five hundred people\nThat want to release people out of our prisons\nAnd so they're just going to rush the gates Seventy five hundred people want to the officers do do they try to fight them off does\nThe does the criminal justice system sending more troops and tried to fight those people from storming the gates and opening up our prisons well we wouldn't want that to I mean some people could\nGet hurt what do you what are we talking about\nWell if they're Seventy five hundred people and they want to go into a small town and Rob every single restaurant truck stop bank because they're Seventy five hundred of them and there's not enough police in these small towns\nWhere we just going to let them take all of the money or do we say no this is a mob this is a a group of Seventy five hundred people who are stating they are going to break the law\nAnd they've already done it and they're just crossing in an overwhelming where did we would never let anybody do that to any other thing why would we allow them into our country\nWe wouldn't let them into our towns just to\nJust to take over our towns we would we would never allow this to happen can you imagine W seemed just the waste and the garbage left behind you know it's amazing they are just crashing everything along the way\nWhat are we supposed to put up with that too you just come into our town and just trash it and then we have to clean up the mess after you\nAnd the question not being asked enough is why are they are so many young men known an older age ... already four year\nOld ... no no no those are just women young women and children that are forced\nTo look like usually like ... year old men yes yeah who should be defending their own country yeah who should be making their neighborhoods better\nWho should be fighting for their own country\nHave you noticed how have you noticed how the media is just calling these guys migrants yeah and knocked Marxist protestors because that's what this is this is a Marxist protest their their Marxist government which was in bed with the Castros in Cuba\nAnd manure oh in Venezuela they were ousted in a coup because they were destroying the country they were ousted\nJust as ... has done in Venezuela correct same thing\nSo they were ousted what happened\nThey get pissed off\nThey start coordinating with the door Owen Castro and the ousted president they have been disrupting their own country now they want publicity they want this to be a world stage and so they started coming up towards America They're not looking for jobs they're not looking for a better life\nThis started as three thousand people who wanted to make a Marxist point\n\nTo embarrass their own country because they got rid of a Marxist dictator\nWe're just going to we're fine with that we're just fine with these people coming in really what will they do if they did get jobs and decide to live here what kind of what kind of philosophies are they bringing with them\nSo the media doesn't care about any of that and do the Democrats don't care about any of that of course not hear about because they ... they just want them here as voters\nAlready they're sending out to all these registration forms in Texas the Democrats are in Texas some set out but

[noise]\nWe're thrilled to have a the a great governor from the great state of Texas Governor Greg Abbott on whether it's now hello governor how are you sir\nReally and I am doing terrific how's it going\nGood it's always good to talk to you I'm ... I I Want to talk to you about a couple of things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive turnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas uh ... what does this or what does this tell you and how's the turnout the rally around the rest of the state\nWell this may be frustrating because the true answer is but it's too early to tell right here's what we don't know and and that is is this a front running of what the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote for your listeners what we're seeing with regard to the turnout is a smash them records are not just for mid term elections which is what this is a but in many of these locations are the first day of voting exceeds\nThe amount of those that took place in the presidential election on the very first day and so all we know is this and that is a massive number of people are turning out to vote will know that part but do mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan that's coming up here and we want to make sure people are going to do something to stop it\nUh but here's all I can tell your audience and that is\nIf you care about the future of Texas if you care about the future of America or you could not\nSit on the sidelines this election we're because there are other people out there\nWho were casting those who might be hostile to you and your values your values must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this me to make sure you go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo a governor and a lot of times people have said this is the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I I always hated that praise\nBut in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say\nYou know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing a ... a election is it not\nHe captured the as soon as very correctly because it just to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats are either rent under do label or they would call themselves a conservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and didn't they were a progressive and now they're openly or lifting themselves as\nSocialist and and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor in Florida a isn't out and now he says as a socialist and end the Bernie Sanders style of socialism is not even further to the lab at the same things happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas\nOr some people may not be calling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as the open border policies\nThat is so stupid as a with a look at the the wealth distribution policy that is socialism and people don't realize and that is socialism is real out there that we see it in Venezuela where the reported inflation rate in Venezuela is over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nI don't I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue\nThere's ... there's only a few counties that are really a a lynchpin here and uh the you know unbeknownst to most people is Soros has dumped millions of dollars into this state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing and so many of your listeners need to understand this better choice or us has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles a two years ago he gave a hundred million dollars a directly to a candidate in Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly\nTo candidates in San Antonio on top of that you\nAs bonded these grand games to get out the vote and so he is trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and us on TALK of all this money pouring in from California for Canada's like that so uh but let's go back to the first part of your questions and listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really\nBlew cities and counties you have a Dallas you couldn't have San Antonio Austin you hit the El Paso and so you have these massive regions across the state of Texas that makes it so much harder for people who are conservative people who are Republican to be able to\nYou is your smart

I think you should all these things do you are innocent until proven yet is the same and charges against Cory Booker right one person making\nYou know and then there's people making these things about every ... every day up which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man that addiction\nBut we don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations direct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them for 'em so you know that's the way I think you're supposed to hey let's why innocent until proven guilty is facing\nA and I think with not only are Cory Booker but also also Keith Ellison I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism\nBy the time these relationships break up and there's things that and who knows there's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing what would they were talking about what capital and everyone you know half the country believes Kavanaugh's should be you know\nI don't put in prison for what happened so what's interesting here is the Democratic party\nHas completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to keep up with a they don't care about it he can do it every once they've completely ignored these allegations\nWhat's fascinating at the people of Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happen latest poll came out he now trails forty three to thirty six he's now down by seven points soda wow this is a powerful Democrat one of the top people from the DNC\nA very well known is on TV all the time and he's she's credible\nShe's a Democrat she doesn't have an axe to grind Jimmy dated him for a very long time there's video there's witnesses\nThere's Dr reports at the time uh and she again is a very reluctant witness who doesn't want to hurt to the Democratic party she'd rather have Allison on another Democrat when she doesn't write your phone into when I mean it's just crazy yeah it's an amazing wants to that one forty three thirty six is a surprise\nI mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they thought they had Alison running for the post they thought they had that wrapped up a instead it's forty three thirty six so right now we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go ah there's a if you're looking at\nRight now a forty a four feet are that are safe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have a seat at Torrey six excuse me forty effect\nIf you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you couldn't get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races that includes Tennessee which is\nStill very close to poll came out yesterday that had the Democrat up by one point though the overall it looks like a Republican is still a head there are black burn and then in Texas still leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer but then you get a few ... a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got to another six races that are toss ups that's going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can go three of six they're gonna be fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they if they can\nPull off sticks of six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things passed\nSo you know at that level of whether it's a I mean they could still lose it to they could easily still lose it impossible\nBut that level of between fifty and fifty six is is kind of what we're talking about now and that you know that is a big difference uh so could be a major thing especially if you can hold on to the house which looks a little bit better than it did a couple of weeks ago but it's still on the unlikely side [noise]\nElection by numbers\nProgress over twenty third there is there going back program\nAll right when I take a break and we'll tell you about our spots and then we come back and I'm going to tell you about\nI mean there's a real problem and you haven't even considered it to really know\nWhat you know that which is er out putting X's Donald Trump you know which is our\nI did not do that you haven't been keeping track of all the ... the the which is that are putting X's on Donald Trump and\nAnd uh Ted Cruz and others are and what are they what are the ... what are the ... actually intended to accomplish destroy them to destroy them yeah I have not seen this no oh okay well I've I've kind of brushed off myself I mean I'm up on it but I kind of brushed it off I like I which is\nNo there is something else that we now have from a credible source that I think every American especially women\nNeed to be aware of what's coming up and just saying\nYou happen to see\nStories a [noise]\nA\nIMF financial warnings and the escalation in the central bank gold buying in Hungary\n\nIs making the news ... Hungary has increased its gold reserves by one thousand percent in a due to increasing quote safety concerns this the first time since Nineteen eighty six\nThat hungry central bank is buying gold bullion and it's a lot of it up thirty one point five tons of gold\nAh they also have repatriated their gold from the bank of England to Budapest central banks in Europe are diversifying are moving in and repatriating to take possession of the gold in their own country\n... maybe talking about that for a while really ... who knows that are hungry\nIn Poland or the most recent central banks to do this but Austria the Netherlands and the\nGermans were the first to do it uh they had been repatriating their gold from the bank of England and the Federal Reserve in recent months and years just\nBought it from Goldman would've been a lot easier right why ask for it back when it doesn't really exist\nThe reason why repatriation of gold is dangerous is because of a word and write this down on no not going to do the very high path occasion thing again are you I'm just saying I read it yeah\nWhen you hear it your blood will run cold when you hear people actually talking about well the problem is ... that's when you had to the mountains [laughter]\nThat's when you know so that's the only reason why I bring this word up when you read about it in a serious way that they are now starting to discuss ...\nThat's when you run for the hills okay right now we're at the beginning of that possible wonderful thing by um you know everybody claiming their gold\nAnd I get home and I'm like\nAs a gym fallen in love with you today I tense and she's like I don't know what you're talking about um like you know what I can I can send and then I have to get the gym out over a and then I Do not do this at home please put it in a glass bottle not only a plastic bad for the environment\nBut also they burn right through those things really yeah yeah so this isn't a a an opportunity to control one of the two genders with\nNo\nNo not at ... there's no there's all of average in and Jews are real ... goals rules can do this you can do this to your goals are really really think they're very clever they're very clever so goals might come through the head and fall in love with you ... ... ... will well\nSorry genes gyms will fall in love with you ... what a genius and goals to\nWell Jeannie is I'm not really sure what a gene I thought that he is granted wishes that they're evil care I don't know I don't know I don't know if I ever see like a teapot idle rub it to the genie come out\nWhich is strange because why he's trapped when there was an opening right there in the you know in the in the lantern\nThere's an opening right there right at and I I think I Would make the same point whiz with the cloth device first of all cloth does not seem difficult to penetrate but secondly there is an opening for the eyes I mean the the genie could just go\nAhead go right through there to get into the head of the person right now they don't I mean just from a pragmatic now they do perspective you just go right through there as long as you're wearing\nGloves a full body you know are covering and then your head is rap and you're just have the eyes now your eyes can\nBe used to a a lower a man or even just if the eyes if you look at him and just write you can say you know it's not like you know look how they're dressed it's look how they were looking at me around her and so you can uh you know you can be\nBe which if you will by ... by a woman's eyes I think even in this in lightened me to era we can all come together and say if a woman looks at you you know what are you going to do right\nExactly I mean you know exactly right it's just there's virtually if she's been possessed by a gym [laughter] I mean you know this is the\nThing we were talking about this off the air a little bit because you know Donald Trump used the word nationalist yesterday when we're talking about nationalism and what the definition of nationalism in history is is at times very disturbing brain um however ... you know I don't know I'm sure that's not obviously no one is citing\nThe really bad examples of nationalism as it as where we are trying to go if you're Donald Trump you're not saying all we want to be like those terrible countries he seems to be referring to it as like look we're the best country and we were routed and we have a ... the best you know culture and he went and we should be\nA you know patriotic and and and be ... up you know sure excited about that but when you talk like this that when you when you play a clip like that it's hard to kind of argue that we don't have a superior culture and a lot of ways\nYou know like I can say that because you've probably been possessed by a gym or ...\nThis is the gym tolerated and now it's a different kind of Jane threat was founded I've had a lasagna of of didn't talk they are in my life I got to say it's travel yeah it is and if they can get you into job believe it in the bottom of it all adds up ... even ...\nSixty shots of beer on a program recently alive on the air right it'd be an issue but I think I'm OK thing that a culture that embraces women as equals is superior to a culture that that puts them but won't let them drive and and forces them to address the specific way that you can't even see their face like that it that I mean\nThey ... those are all just social construct\nMay maybe it's just a good social go sometimes things are built and they're good to know the good piece of can no you're not you're not from the west not from the west which brings me\nBack to the caravan when we come back [noise]\nIdol latest news Adam ... news radio Ninety three point one WFL Larry Mm\n[noise] [noise]\n\nYou're on the green ...\nSo let's talk about the caravan for a second because we really need to decide what we think about this and what we're going to do about it\nWhat do you think we should do about it and you need to have this conversation with all of your friends right now\nWhat do you call people Seventy five hundred who are political Marxist activists that's what they are political Marxist activist marching with the Honduran flag\nIn protest that their Marxist government was ousted in Honduras\nWhat what do you call them is they're marching towards our border they're not refugees\nThey chose to leave their country they're finding their country they were trying to get a do a political stunt so what what are these people where did they get the money who's doing the supply chain\nHow how do you even have the bathroom services all along the way who's providing medical aid so it's not a death march you can march\nTwenty five hundred miles and expect everybody to be okay and in good health when they arrive\nThings happen\nWhat who's providing medical aid who's providing the water\nWho's providing the trucks that so far we haven't seen anywhere else we aired them yesterday on the news and why it matters in fact Sarah I don't know if we have this video\nBut if we could play this a video or if you have it the the video of\nA these migrants being loaded up into giant semi trucks they're being trucked from place to place from photo opportunity to photo opportunity\nYou pointed this out there that I I didn't notice it initially but there's there's women walking with strollers\nAnd it's like well a stroller is not designed for a thousand mile walk now right like that's not how that happens in them or they're getting out there grouping up their racking for a couple of miles cameras get them then they get back in trucks and get and they ... they drive\nLook at the ... video getting role that video again please tell me how many women use spot climbing into the back of the semi truck\n[noise]\nJust count them even just count them as of right now you have to count the that well if you want all of them counted right one all of them county was counting one one and he said and by the way just to clarify you want you want me to individually point out the women that are women that are played a big crowd but the women that you can see that the one they're one and a on the um\n[noise] one Mm okay now this isn't women and children who are these people are\nWe know that MS MS Thirteen that now has embedded the people in to this group I mean style Seventy five hundred people\nAnd I want to play some audio uh this is ... let me see if I can get the right one\nUh yeah I think it's a I think it's CNN and Cuomo can you play this here on what the military is going to do\nWhat we look it's not about whether you're going to have the right to do it that's why I waved away the idea about domestic law enforcement Rick if you put military down there we know what the God Forbid is in this situation\nHow was that good for anybody if cars you know you're not going to turn away thousands and thousands of people even if people start getting\nShot ... and what message does that send who wins and\nThey're going to wind up in the country a wreck and can I don't think that it has to happen that way but I'll tell you what if you have if you have a must happen\nWhat do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be here and you have to chase them around and process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who were coming in\nWorse for America can\nYou give me your you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in at entry points and to turn them away right there it's an invasion treated as an invasion turn way\nYou say there's an invading force these people they're not going anywhere lately\n[noise] now the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor people away and I want you to listen\nYou is your smart speaker say Alexa plain news radio ... one [noise]\nPat Boone here again and I assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product not until now not until released factor came along as a one

you know my grand\nCaravan are MS MS Thirteen leadership and are members embedded in there are these are actual gang rapist\nNow I'm waiting for the left I Can't wait for the left to pounce on this how dare you say that gang rapists are in that care of him when they had absolutely no problem\nCalling someone else a gang rapist without proof just recently not a problem I thought that was okay no I yeah I thought that was fine and with him is Thirteen they are getting rapists we know they are\nCertainly some of them are for sure well I think that's part of any anger in some of them are rape is yeah I think that's part of the thing of\nGetting in you have to you have to rape to to join the rape and kill\nA pass on this year's the subscription I I don't need the member shows are getting free though all you have to do it right you know saying no thank you kill is what are they going to go a different direction okay has MS twelve available\nYou know no no they're driven out on [laughter] yeah yeah I mean that's a I mean\nYou know we've talked about this before MS Thirteen the United states constantly is is this is just the Donald Trump fever ... this is nothing [laughter] it's not a big deal where they're killing people at four times the rate as of school shootings so if you think of him is Thirteen isn't an issue you probably don't think school shootings or an issue\nWhich I tend to hear a lot of people on the left speak very loudly ... about school shootings when they go on and what exactly is that cause\nUh for them so I mean I I like ... the real issue I mean and this goes to a deeper part of this which is\nYou it's not even if let's just say we thought they were all really good people we didn't know that there are any gang members in there that's to say that again come in that way you don't come in that way that you have to have a process to be able to decide whether people should come into your country or not\nNot are not hateful save if you have a problem if you look at our if you look at you know a\nBlack Friday and say oh my gosh people are\nAnimals getting into a Walmart yeah ... that's what this was going to be Seventy five hundred people trying just to push through an opening those doors\nThat's all I'm doing and this is Black Friday Wal Mart says it going to be fascinating to watch because there was a good chance that you know as as Greg Abbott talked about that you know Mexico doesn't want to deal with the pressure from the United states and the ... issue they're gonna try to find a place to settle them within Mexico so it's a good outcome\nThat are not on our borders 'cause you know what that is that's the Palestinian people yeah but we don't we don't know I mean I think the point of doing that it's not anger us right so you would think that they would do it in a way to avoid that and Edgar than UN's going to be very helpful\nAgain I mean the governor a tech I Know I Know that so I Know I I Know dumb reason to believe it's possible but let's see if it doesn't happen\nAnd they get here and try to over on the border this thing is going to be a mess because you'll have the media making it look like our our border guard are are\nAre National Guard of the worst people on earth and are not going to stand for it and people are generally and I met him than for Seventy five hundred people trying to run over I Hope our border guard either they're not ... that is a that's going to be a real mess where he just goes way [noise] yeah that's how I deal with my problems while they go away it's really up to Mexico\nStopped them more lose all aid\nDave Ramsey ... six PM on news radio Ninety three buying one\nHolidays are coming was the last time he sat around the table and really laugh\nWith your family I

lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best\nAnd they will play and the app store but it's the twenty first century version of Drudge Report it is for conservative video content um that\nOut there that's being pushed to the side and and hidden by these tech company\nWhat platform you're keeping an eye on what do you what do you mean you're going to Google Play I mean you're going going right into the hands of the beast or what are you doing to ensure that they ... they aren't um screwing with you and gathering information on on everybody else well what we're trying to\nDo is I've heard a lot of people on our side say we need a conservative Facebook or we need a conservative Twitter yeah so what we're trying to do is find a realistic work around to the algorithm problem that's going on with ... and conservative content so we said\nYou know we can find all these great conservative publishers and say hey here's what we want to do we can all benefit from this by sharing content into one place on the video side everyone can benefit\nUm so yeah we will be at the mercy of Google Play in the apple store [laughter] but I think this is a sort of the first step to be able to counter\nThat suppression from YouTube and Facebook so who do you have on board so far so we have a conservative review we've talked to Breitbart we had a great meeting with Prager you last week they're on board and obviously the blaze I Hope you guys come aboard as well\nAs the first time hearing of it but I Can't imagine we're not\nYeah so and what we're really doing is you know we're pulling the content from your Facebook page and from your YouTube so\nAh the blaze channel benefits because the view counteract you guys\nAnd the other thing that we wanted to do I'm In this where we're already starting to be introduced to other people so we have these great young conservative filmmakers who put out an amazing video content and no one sees it on YouTube or Facebook and so we said hey will be the platform for that you go out and produce it and then we'll work with our team in our network to make sure that\nUm you know half the country that wants to see this content can actually see your contest\nSo what do you think because I've done a lot of thinking on this uh first of all congratulations thanks um uh it is um [noise] uh this is something\nThat I have wanted to do for about eight years and I think conservatives are just now starting to say\nHey wait a minute what was that idea about coming together [laughter] um because they're starting to see the writing on the wall or in many different directions\nOr so congratulations on doing that I fully support anybody who is trying to bring everybody together and protecting voices [noise] what do you say I'm to the objection that I have in my mind when people say we need a conservative Facebook\nNo we don't because that just puts us in another bubble right you know what I mean we need to be able if if it's known as a conservative thing only conservatives are going to go there\nSo how have you wrestled with that in your mind\nSo I think the first pick off for that was the Facebook documentary series that I did with the swamp so we had six members of the house Freedom Caucus and we followed them around the capital and we talked about the big issues plaguing DC\nWe had a liberal and progressive groups sharing that Facebook series So Tim Canova who ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz this as a Bernie Sanders ... light\nShared the swamp episodes and said I encourage all of my followers to see this and we did it in a way where we didn't put you know Republican or conservative next to these guys named it was all about the content\nAnd that's what a lot of these um younger conservative filmmakers are doing their libertarian leaning you know they're conservative leaning it's more about hey let's fix some of the big fundamental issues going on and then we can get into you know some of the more policy debates\nSo I think um that kind of content and then just presenting it in a really sweet mobile application makes it easier for people to interact with the ...\nHave you ah have you seen what's happening in\nBrazil with a with a young libertarians you know they they are looking at America going you know they can't sell that we can sell the libertarians two ... two older than you know all\nThis freedom and talk that they're doing is not a not appealing to the youth and they are\nHuge gains and head way because you know they're twenty somethings that have\nWho are are naturally attracted to freedom and said there is a better way to package this I think that's great and anything you're doing to encourage a you know twenty somethings to do that I think as time they take\nCharge yeah I think so I think you know having the big conservative publishers on board um and does banding together you know with this program\nWe're going to find a lot of talented people out there who are you know frustrated who are amazing videographer isn't filmmakers who can go out there and shoot this content um and let them be the bridge to reach the next a conservative or libertarian generation\nSo you're the update dot com or let me let me I'm a switch topics with you 'cause you know you of consulted a with candidates et cetera et cetera\nBut do you think is coming our way to places first blue wave red wave ... new wave\nYou might as well flip a coin so I live I it's funny I live ah three blocks behind the capital in DC so I Am I describe myself as being a spy behind enemy lines because D.C is Ninety\nFour percent Democrat so you know I talked to a lot of guys both sides of the aisle I'm In DC and you might as well flip a coin I mean there's Freedom Caucus guys who say\nRepublicans hold the house by but it's only by a couple of seats there's more people who have said all of it you know it's going to be Democrats by a few seats\nI really don't know I I think what they are doing with the election is the media is getting so excited looking at this big national view but when you break down these individual races they are going to be far more competitive than what the media's saying\nIt's always about local it as a the Kavanaugh saying coupled with\nCortez coming out and saying you know capitalism stock got to be around forever the Democratic socialist the surrounding people while they're eating and shouting them down\nThey have the ... do you think the Democrats different than the leftist do you think that Democrats are waking up to holy cow who's in our bad\nYeah I was telling somebody earlier this week the orange he just needs to put out a video of all the people clawing at the door the Supreme Court there is a big divide I think between like the old school you know Democrats all my parents' voted democratic ... can you continue to vote Democrat\nThan what's going on in D.C and people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker I mean these are radical left is when I was filming a with a swamp out in Iowa I was in ... district and these are we went to a machine shop and these are life long you know Democrats a lot of them switched over to vote for President Trump\nBut I'm Talking to him and they go oh you know I still you know identify as a Democrat voter side just rattle off a couple of issues and I'm like\nI hate to break into your man you're you're you're no longer for in this Democratic Party right so yeah it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out two weeks away\nHow do how do you think the president and ah the Republicans should respond to this caravan coming up stop it\nI mean I think the president's made it clear where their country of laws or not and you know the the ruse that they're using that this is\nUh it's amazing how well the left uses terminology to try to convey people did their side\nBecause now they're asylum seekers you know their asylum seekers or their asylum seekers you apply for asylum in the first country that you arrived to which would be Mexico so it's not about that it's about getting to the United states is about sending money back to their country uh I don't\nEven know if it's about that these guys are\nThese guys are Marxist or that are upset at the ... the the the politicians in Honduras that kicked their Marxist a guy out who had ties to Venezuela and to Castro in Cuba\nThey've been trying to do all kinds of ... in in Honduras\nThey're ... they're carrying the Honduran flag that these guys are Marxist radicals at least the leadership is\nI I Would have to imagine that if I was in a their situation if I was legitimately or refugee and I got to Mexico in Mexico was willing to hear my case or process may\nI Would wait in line for as long as it took the helm ... you know myself or my family for them to just break down the barricades and and charge the police officers in Mexico and say guys that you can't stop us we're going all the way to the United states and right you know singing Honduras national aunt\nFor his call me and tell me how I'm wrong on that but that cognitive dissidents had to
