we're working on projects now that we've already started I'm getting them wrapped up before Thanksgiving and\nUh there are some that will start in the next couple of days here that will be\nA endeavor to get wrapped up before before Christmas\nI'm just a little bit of an odd time for us we've got that going on plus we have people coming in right now that want to get started after the first of the year so if that's your plan if you had thought about uh renovating and\nYou know what happens inherently this time of years people have people uh they'll have family in gas the neighbors and friends coworkers and such over\nFor Thanksgiving at their house and everyone will be sitting around and you know we just took that wall out of the kitchen and open this up a little bit it would have better seating and we can\nUh have more people over or you know this this old range that we have just didn't work in any more we need a new range and while we're doing that let's change out the countertops and\nAnd things like that so that happens a lot during this time of year so we start seeing a lot of people in that regard and then planning to start after the first of the year so I just wanted to give just a couple of quick tips and we've talked about this on on their uh before so for for you new listeners this'll be new and for\nA for Paul could probably call in and tell me these\nThese things on how to avoid the domino effect\nUm because that's one thing that we see all the time we'll get we'll get into a project and then people will say well what about this and hey how about this or um you know especially for people that get started on projects themselves and then call us and after the fact um you know there's always things that people don't think of\nFor instance if you want to replace your your countertop it's not just as simple as replacing the countertop although it's a pretty simple process and procedure to replace you know what you do if you add to exactly right if you know what you're doing right 'cause there's a a bunch of different trades people that get involved just and replacing your countertop\nYou have your carpenter's that are gonna have to do a little bit of trim work painters opt to come in and do a little bit of touch up work you have your plumbers to disconnect and then reconnect your sink dishwasher garbage disposal an icebreaker line\nYour electricians that'll have to do a little bit of work depending on if you replace your back splash or not um and you have to um had your outlets out\nThings like that so there's there's the domino effect on these things so um there's some ways that you can avoid doing that and they're actually pretty easy or if you do these three or so things\nI'm that'll help avoid the the domino effect as your renovating whether you do it yourself or whether you you have someone a help you with it so the first one is just do do your research and and planning okay and what the amount of information that's literally available at your fingertips\nUm I mean you could spend days and days just kind of researching different\nA door styles for your cabinet tree or different countertop um materials that you can use things like that but they do some research you're sitting there watching TV or with your wife for kids after dinner and just kind of hanging out a little bit you have the ballgame on\nUm pick your eye pad out your laptop and just kind of go to some different websites go to our website you can check out there's a bunch of really great content on their ass and W. kitchens dot com spell up or down the protests on kitchens\nUm or there's also there's a really good website that a lot of interior designers and a home renovation folks use its ... houses is the website H.
