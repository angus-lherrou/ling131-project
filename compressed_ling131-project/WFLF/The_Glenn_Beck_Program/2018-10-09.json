F. L. A. [laughter]\nPretty good show for you lined up tomorrow um first of all James O'Keefe yes that and James O'Keefe I I called this guy the sixty minutes of the twenty first century and he loved that\nCame on the air with us a couple of years ago and as a communicated with some of the students ah when I was teaching at UCF\nThe mass media course and James O'Keefe will be stopping by the fifty thousand what front porch tomorrow morning\nAnd he's going to be talking about a project beret toss the investigation they just did last month into the deep state isn't a chip us a little bit a little bit of a teaser he's got another big one coming up next week so he's going to talk to us about that and also tomorrow Florida former of Florida attorney general and congressional house manager\nBill McCollum will be here we are going to talk about what it really means\nFor Kavanaugh and Trump\nAnd possible impeachment if Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats take over by the vote the house of representatives he has a very unique perspective remember he was one of the house managers that's a prosecutor who prosecuted the case against Bill Clinton Twenty years ago\nIn the U.S Senate so both of those find individuals' be joining us tomorrow so amendment three voter control of gambling\nIn Florida this amendment gives voters the exclusive rights to decide whether a new casino can open in the state it takes that right away from the Florida Legislature which has failed in recent years to reach an agreement on\nThat issue now for supports seminal tribal Florida and Disney\nBecause of the amendment would make it harder to expand gambling I'm surprised because I thought at one point I had heard that the swan and the dolphin hotel were built in with casino ready\nAnd maybe that was wrong information don't know but um Disney is says no to gambling the two groups of spent nearly forty million dollars campaigning for amendment free\nOkay so they want this they want the state out of it and voters to make those decisions opponents are the owners of dog and a horse tracks because they would need state white voter approval to add casino gambling that each track\nSo where do you stand on that it's a pretty interesting the question you know I remember back when the lottery was proposed\nAnd we were told that it would not\nSubstitute but supplement what is a supplement a supplement is in addition to so when the voters were asked shall Florida have a lottery\nWe were told that the lottery revenue would supplement education funding it would not replace it it would be in addition to it well you go back and look over the years yes what happened\nSupplement turned in to replace and you know I I I I have no apologies for this if we are going to continue to have a lottery and the state of Florida and that one that the voters approve for education\nI don't care whether we'd given over a billion dollars to education yet or not if we know that education is hurting we know that education funding is needed we know that school resource officers this is the one that just set me up over the top\nWe don't have any money for school resource officers then tap into the darn lottery that's what the lottery was supposed to be there for a well we can do that there are laws to protect the money and what what about the interest alone on that money\nSo you know I'm at the point now where if the lottery is no longer doing what it was approved by voters to do we need to remove the lottery\nOr we need checks and balances to get the lottery to fund education the way voters intended for it to be done\nI'm mixed on amendment three I'll make a decision I just haven't made it right now because you know I don't like really government making those decisions for us\nBut with all due respect their stupid people out there I mean I remember back when we gave protections for pregnant pigs and the size of the pen that they were kept in which is now part of our state constitution I guess what I'm saying is\nWhat Floridians vote on things sometimes it doesn't belong in our state constitution\nLawmakers should make those laws and if lawmakers don't feel comfortable making those Lawson is probably not a law that we need\nSo there we are on that I I'd just be I'll be I'll shoot straight up with you I don't know I don't know the answer on that one I'll figure it out\nAmendment for we talked about this yesterday a little bit more detail in the six o'clock hour voter restoration a felon writes this amendment restores voting rights to former felons who served their sentence including parole and probation with the exception of those convicted of murder and sexual offenses now here's the catch on this one\nFor the past seven years the state is required felons wait at least five years after their sentences are complete to apply to regain voting rights the current process can take a decade or more under the Scott administration's requirement I'm what I'm concerned with in this one is that there's really not a distinction\nIt says here while amendment for excludes felons convicted of murder and sex crimes it doesn't differentiate\nBetween people who committed other violent crimes and those who committed non violent tries to me this one is not well worded it is not clear and frankly I think if you're a felon\nAnd you've committed a serious crime there are consequences for your actions yes you've paid the price but when it comes to voting that is a civil right you'll get it back I don't think asking you to wait five more years after committing a felony a serious felony\nIs too much to ask that's my take on that\nTomorrow again James O'Keefe from project merit toss and I want you to always ask yourself this are you proud of this country I Am I couldn't be more proud of the United states of America she'll be proud of our country [noise] don't worry about\nJust standing by waving your finger or waving the flag as the western world burns\n\nI Do not want to be part of the problem in America and I fail on that all the time we all do\n\nBut what counts he's the effort what counts\nHe's argued prying are you crying and are you better today than you were yesterday have you found any answers or are you only shouting things down or you just out in the street directing traffic\nBecause you feel it's your right well have you even look at what your rights I mean where do your rights even come from\nToday I saw I think progress write a whole article about how the constitution has failed that was a headline the constitution has failed\n\nAnd then it goes on to explain how it is really a slavery document\nAnd the three fifths in the constitution all lives all lives\n\nNow you can argue that or we can begin to teach our children you can argue that\nAnd you can throw it back in their face with some sort of ... your\nName calling of some sort\n[noise]\nHere's a question that we all have to answer is America a force for good or a force for bad\nThat requires real thought and discussion because it is neither in my opinion it is both\nIt has been a force for bad and I warn you if we leave the bill of rights we will become the darkest force ever on earth\nWith our technology we will make the Nazis look like rookies make no mistake\n\nWe have been bad we have rounded up the Japanese we rounded up the Germans and the Italians we rounded up the blacks\nWe told people they couldn't vote including women\nBut we're also the people that freed the people\nWe free the blacks and we fought for it we fought and died\n\nWe fought to free the Japanese\n\nWe brought to free the Germans and all of Europe and the world we fought to free Russia from the tyranny of communism\n\nAnd we failed in the time of peace\n\nBar we good or are we bad is the declaration of independence that's still a viable mission statement because that's all that is the declaration of independence is a mission statement period\nDo we still hold these truths to be self evident forget about the past let's talk about the future we have never ever reached the heights demanded by our mission statement\n\nBut have we gotten better is it's still worth striving for we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that means we're born equal we all have an equal chance\nDon't judge somebody by the color of their skin but by the content of their character\nDo you have do you have everything the baby lane next to you as when you were born\n\nAs far as human rights and dignity do you still believe that\nAnd I'm not talking about well it's not the way I Am asking you as an aspirational mission statement that is the mission statement of our country\nDo you want to live in a country that's bribes and falls short but picks itself back up again\nDo you want to live in a country that says all men are created equal and they are endowed by their creator why would you have to throw God into it too I don't care what you put there\nIt just must be bigger than manned\nThe reason why the creator is important is if you don't have something bigger than man then man we'll print and take away\nRights so if you want to see them\nTurn of the ... the great cause most whatever\n\nBut he didn't ... each of us with certain on changeable rights and those rights are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness now there's a lot more and that's where the bill of rights comes in do we still believe in this\nAs an aspirational statement we're only talking about the past we are talking about the mistakes of the past you cannot fix the mistakes of the past with out saying where we're going so where are we going to fall\nYou want to terrorists down there now I read your website I read your mission statement I strongly disagree\nCapitalism is not the problem capitalism that is that has no morals sentiment is\nBut you don't fix that by a state run economy by co ops aids always fails no you\nAnd your allies in the press refused to point out that that is exactly what you're looking for\nIt's a failed system this one has been this one has failed us because it has been usurped\nThe constitution no longer means anything the bill of rights no longer means anything why because it's not talk to anymore anybody who takes the oath of office in Washington Ninety percent of them are liars not even not even intentional liars\n\nThey don't know it they don't believe in it they will tell you they do as was told to me by a very powerful individual once the look Glenn we all believe in the constitution but the you know you gotta do what you gotta do no\nNo\nYou do not to do what you have to do that the ends justify the means we either believe in this or we do not and that is the question America do you believe\nNeutral half\nAssed not sought out sitting on the sidelines\nAll of those answers I mean nothing in the end only those who know it who understand it who have done their homework who can intellectually defend it\n\nThose are the winter soldiers those will be the ones that restore freedom for all mankind everything else is lip service\nBut we the people that look to the future\nAre we the people that say I am getting better every day\nI Am part of a positive community but it's going to make a difference two million\nAmerica's first news when Gordon ... every day five to six AM news radio Ninety three point one Mm\nYou're listening to Glenn Beck command\nMany phone calls today for people who have read addicted to outrage and um want to make a a ... to illustrate a one of the points in the book or have questions I Want to further the dialogue hated eight seven to seven B. C. K. if you've read the book\nUh let me go to Greg I'm Greg ... is a contributor for the federalist wow Hi Greg how are you good morning Glenn go to a good to hear from you or a truck to you I understand that five years ago you may not have been my biggest fan [laughter]\nNo no not at all actually [laughter] I'm with you Greg on that one\nNow which they have a different reasons you were on the left\nOh yeah very much so tell me about it [noise] well uh I was\nI was raised by a far less kinda actually can't be a parent's and be known that it was just kind of pushed into me from a from a young age um and it was just a it was how I saw everything it was like a filter over the entire world and\nI walked around looking suspicious lead everybody thinking that\nYou know there's something deeply broken within them that they're out to get somebody that they don't understand where I Do or even though I I didn't understand very much at all\nUm it was pure emotion and it was wrong and you know informed\nSo what happened and well I'm I one of my close friends um\nWe're having a discussion and he he actually mentioned a Fox News and just kind of said that that's that was his his news source and I was appalled and I was furious and I\nI went on from that you know just thinking what what I thought I knew this guy where you know I all along I had no idea is some kind of monster\nLike how could how could this be and I got curious as to how how this could happen and I went home and I started watching and listening to\nSome people on the other side and it was quite a a slap in the face this was prior to a\nTrump and the whole situation now and all this flame throwing and you know what I saw were\nYou know people who celebrate what we've overcome instead of what we've had to overcome [noise] um\nAnd and it was really powerful and very restore it is uh to me and you know looking at your books through a ... through the lens of addiction uh looking at the the way that we approach\nOur politics and the way with regard one another through that lens I I think is so important I've I've gone through addiction myself\nAnd you know as an addict you you learn about about real humility 'em and you find help you find comfort in some of the most unlikely places and\nYou know it really kind of becomes clear to you that you know you can say that diversity is our greatest strength ... but you know it it it's more than that it's it's it's the cooperation between you know diverse people um\nIt's the humidity of diverse people I think one of my favorite quotes is absolutely\nWhere there is doubt there is freedom\nAnd ...\nWe we we flip that up on its head we we are now so\nI mean look at ... directing traffic they are so convinced that they are right they will bludgeon you if you disagree with them there's no freedom there where there is doubt there is freedom where there is humility there is freedom\nYeah absolutely and you know when when ... you know intellectual expiration when when curiosity I'm going against the grain in any way when that when that becomes punishable\nUm view I think I think they really risk a you know driving good people I'm Down some some unsavory roads and there's there's no good and that\nBrings it in the tradition out yeah absolutely absolutely\nThank you so much for reading the book and I'm going to send you a assigned to copy but thank you for reading and calling in I'm Daryl in Kentucky you're on the Glenn Beck program Hi Darryl\nOur rock bottom is too far down um however I Can't live in that world ah and it depends on how many people will\nWill stand and not go over the cliff how many people are there are there enough of us Republicans and Democrats in our own neighborhoods that will say\nI don't want anything to do with that I I I won't do that\nThat's not who we are as a people that's not who my neighbors are and I am not going to be pushed over the cliff by and to fire Nazis I'm not doing it\nDo we hit that Don\nWell I Would hope as a nation that we ever had that but I think you're you could be hitting on something that is a civil war and are shaped me up a physical like our last before but it was on the social media platforms\nAre we're already and the answer is yes we're already in\nThat um I Am I'm very concerned about ah violence and uh you know you have an assassination uh you you have any of these kinds of things and it could spiral the country out of control and\nUm I Would hope that we would ah we\nBless it'd be the peacemakers less it be the peacemakers and it's going to be harder and harder to be those people and that does not mean as I point out in the book over and over again does not mean surrender your principles [noise]\nAh it just it just\nMeans banned in what you've always believed banned in what you know is true\nAnd encourage others to stand with you\n\nSo how do we do it that's what they talked\nAbout in the book addicted to outrage and we're taking your calls and questions and comments on it if you have read it uh let me go to Anthony in Massachusetts hello Anthony you're on the Glenn Beck program\nI Glenn how are you good how are you\nDoing well so you know what can you you you mentioned earlier that are really that the opposition are the people leading this leadership but the Democrat Party\nOr or we'll have this right Nineteen eighty four with the inter party and out a party and what I see happening with my friends on the on the left has their own a party members they\nWork every day and not involved in politics but they get sucked in on social media and being manipulated and it's a huge chunk of the American population being being a pulled over for the left agree and I want to hear your thoughts about\nAh I think you're absolutely right and it's why we have to be a difference and unusual and ... year people I'm On uh the Internet because if they see if all they see our people on the right punching back the people on the left and both sides suck\nWhile they're they're going to stick with what they know if they are seeing their side being unreasonable violent view see and to ah\nThe way to answer and so far is not\nWith uh the militant people it will come out of the Nazis to come out and find them in the streets that is the moment before we lose our humanity that is the moment that Martin Luther king walks through and just is peaceful and gentle and\nYou don't strike back it works at this point but at this point is going to slip away quickly as we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer a A R a Judeo Christian country with those kinds of peaceful values\nYou miss the moment and then it just becomes you know either communism socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group you have to act while they're still is a Judeo Christian value and we're losing it quickly\nSo to get to the far left will never do that but get to the people like you're talking about you have to develop ways\nTo be peaceful and not part of that angry crowd it's what I've talked about for Twenty years there's going to come a point where everybody's gonna be running in a certain direction and you're gonna have to have your credibility your kindness you're gonna have to be able to stand up and say no wait don't don't go that way you're not going to stop the whole crowd\nBut you'll be able to stop enough thanks Anthony will send you a book uh let me go to a Heather in Virginia hello Heather you're on the Glenn Beck\nProgram Hi Glenn how are you I'm very good\n[noise] um I overall agree\nWith every book I think it's awesome\nAnd I want to talk about kind of a minor point I guess okay you're you're um you're talking about how am I going to come in and you know replace almost all the job then and I know you don't necessarily agree with you that you've said that we need to at least have a conversation about\n... because of it yeah and I you know I think we need to be careful about even\nI'm considering heavy I I think that there really is fear over a I to try to come in and ... that's ... yeah I think that they want to push that starts socialism\nI think the AI um well it will certainly changed everything obviously you know we've run into this in the past and all the other\nTechnical right um ... where ... you know the ... they were afraid that technology what's going to come and direct place their thoughts arid their problem correct and so\nUm I understand that hey I is definitely coming and it's going to change things but it's not going to take over everything all the jobs you know in addition obviously to the people that want to create a\nMachine thing they are running yeah there are certain things I just can't do like I'm being\nA ... a leak in or climbing in her house probably not going to do that um as far as service obviously I think McDonald's is a great example where am I yeah I don't think people are going to be upset if they go to McDonalds and not have to deal with anyone that chick\nFillet isn't known for their service and I ... that\nLet me ask you this let me ask you first of all just a ... there's ... ... I don't mean any offense or anything I just want to know um how up to speed you are on this um ah what books are you reading on a on a ... or you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general that they cannot than tape work on this um so I'm coming just for you know different perspectives are having\n... research that I Know that you have sure on that but you know just my feeling like a a I was going to absolutely they will to diagnose cancer a quicker and are accurately than a doctor but are you going to want to sit in front of a robot and have the robot tell you that you have cancer and cleaner options\nCase so have there are there is a there and I can't remember the name of it on the ... on this particular subject but I Will look for it uh there is a whole book based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in someone and being able to reflected in face the reason why\nI'm a ... that we don't connect with robots is because they cannot see our emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection um it's going to take a while but a while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world ah and I think that's a long while\nI'm so there there are those are those the ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment that no one has to work that everyone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made yes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that true a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to go through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died\nThey'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message much better and much more personal than anyone else\nThe bigger problem is on a high and doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about three four years ago\nThe uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board\nAnd what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that has seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose\nSo much better it's it's I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please\nSo you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen before\nAnd we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty\nAnd the world will not be like it is today you started your comment about the section of the book where I uh there's a chapter where I talk about ... universal basic income I Am against universal basic income I Do not think that that is the way we should go\nBut we as conservatives must be willing to listen to the debate and I'm not talking about the people who are socialist in Washington I'm Talking about the people who are studying the culture studying humans and studying technology to gather\nThat are now looking for what is it that will give people value what is it when we do hits high unemployment if your goal is one hundred percent Bain Capital says we will have thirty percent of unemployment and it will be a permanent thirty percent unemployment\nIs realistic and it only adds to\nSignificant chaos I want you to get this copy of this report right now it's free you can get it from coal and gold line at eight six six gold line eight six six gold line you need this information be informed of what our future could hold\nCold out get the Freeh report at eight six six gold line one eight six six gold line or gold line dot com [noise]\nZero ...

of communicating and communication I think there was considering remember same children\nSame goal impediment number one opinions outnumber people\nSoon realized that in this age on unlimited access to opinion that although there were seven people physically sitting around me there were many more opinions and voices brought into our conversation listened to the following exchange between two mothers Anna a progressive and Mona a Christian conservative\nAnd see how many people's opinions and perspective that brought into the mix other than their own\nFrom my side what I hear and\nOh you don't infringe on any of my right and I don't want any restrictions on myself and it's kind of and I'm not saying that you are but I think it's kind of a bank at ten in play [noise]\nKind of like come
