I mean 'cause I saw lots\nOf tea partiers going to the Supreme Court in banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the laws the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because they're both were supposed to be in a civil society\nRight I Am I trying to remember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their children\nYou know and the homemade signs how many people they chased down in restaurants and surrounded cannot think of one exam in fact if you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do during the health care bill she and a was a John Lewis\nMarched out in to the crowded\nIn to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't [laughter] do you remember where\nThey tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to\nThey were trying to get the Tea Party to become a violent mob they didn't\nCan you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington DC you would not have been pretty it would not have been pretty\nBy the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob there like ... cities and\nThey're taking over that's ... that's a riot that is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob please look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make sure we know what we're talking about\nMob mob a large crowd of people especially one that has this orderly and intent on causing trouble or violence\nOkay and and the quote is a mob of protesters that their their usage so is this not a\nDisorderly crowd of people that are trying to what ... cents on causing trouble in tenth on causing trouble\nI mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh's a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not causing trouble I mean if you're going to go down that road I guess\nIn that that doesn't does it say there and unless you're right just as intent on causing trouble right it doesn't say you know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying\nThough is that the media does not the harassing conservatives as causing trouble correct that is the issue correct they see this as a currency that that's like the you know\nThere it's basically a you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good for the people you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that [laughter] things better yeah [laughter] I mean they say the Irish guy [laughter] let me tell you the white people white people do ya [laughter]\nReally bad oh really [laughter] okay\nSo let's listen to a couple of things first we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob BS I'm going to call it a mob a now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protesters mob rule here it is\nProtest is guaranteed to a a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us about the constitution they're trying\nTo change the description of protests and call it a mob well no this president is the poster boy for what a mob a protest that looks like he\nIs a matter of fact he's the one who has been violence in his speech his wife I said things like this\nI lacked punch him in the face Trump said that at one of his rallies he said knock the crap\nOut of them are what you and say say OK tests knock the hell I mean okay alright okay we\nGot it now and that's what she's saying she's saying that Donald Trump is the one who's violence in their speech a let's go to Jennifer ... adults are at us and she's the network president and co executive director at the center for popular democracy here's what she's saying to the crowds\nLawmakers and leftist continue to push protesters guarantee to sorry\nSorry [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nSo they go anywhere we see this now here's\nHere's the problem let's ratchet things down just a bit and listen to somebody who says ... I\nThink there's real trouble on the way and has reason to say that here's Rand Paul\nWhen people like Cory Booker sake get up in their face\nHim he may think that that's okay but what he doesn't realize is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face\nOne of them is going to be an stable enough to commit violence when I was at the ball field which state's college was nearly killed the guy shooting a football field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot [noise] basically has almost killed he was showing this is for health care catalyst in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill\nYou know what I was attacked in my yard and had a my ribs broken a pneumonia lung conclusion all of that these are people that are unstable and we don't want\nTo encourage them we have to somehow ratchet down and say\nWe're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK ever reason for or a means for trying to do things\nI feel that there's going to be in a fascination I really worry that someone is going to be killed [noise] and uh that those who are ratcheting up the the the conversation those who are actually getting their face they realize that they bear some responsibility of the show they watch\n[noise] so do you remember the time when people like Rick Baldwin in CNN were lecturing us that you couldn't say you're going to target a district\nBecause that of course led to violence couldn't target the district remember the lectures of your words have power because you don't know who's listening to them and we

through they'll just go through this because they say this isn't this isn't our time\nThis is this is\nThe Nineteen thirties and forties okay\nUh the ... the u._s. isn't a massive topic each a tepid economic recovery following a catastrophic downturn millions of Americans continue to feel left behind yep that's that's been proven now we're not in a tepid recovery are we some turn their anger on corporations and Wall Street\nYes that would be the left that would be the last ... others target non white immigrant workers\nWho's doing that\nI mean I guess they would claim that like border

charismatic media personality with a populist message attacks religious minorities well who could that be [laughter]\nI I I Know I Know I went to stand with Israel if anybody's attacking religious minorities hell with that religious majorities it's the left\nConservatives denounces the president and his allies for flouting the Constitution's during the United states toward socialism yep did that one because that's what's happening that's what did happen\nI ask a Alexandria Ocasio Cortez yeah that's a it's a crazy accusations rice point\nMany on the left warn that fascism is taking root and America no socialism is taking root in America socialism\nYeah I mean people unless they fascists every time someone does something they don't like right ... ... ... ... fascism it that is it socialism that is sweeping the nation remember the headline\nWhere all socialist now that's what sleeping is sweeping the nation are parallels between the two areas aren't perfect but the late Nineteen thirties I thought oh that\nIs an understatement of the year can you say that a lot of the parallels between the two hours aren't perfect they're not perfect but I did one way to describe you've just done yeah about\nThree quarters of them are completely inaccurate but as an aide to a night late Nineteen thirties as today political rancor social division and the threat posed by alien ideologies sparked widespread unease what is the alien ideology of today yeah of today\nOr back then I mean the fact that one of the two major party has embraced democratic socialism is pretty alien to me yes the the the fear back in the thirties was communism\nOr the ... and the left said no it's fascism\nWell okay um\nI guess I mean it was Adolf Hitler and Mussolini that said that ah FDR is one of us he is a fascist so maybe it was bad but there's more hang on\nDave Ramsey maintained Rachel six PM on news radio Ninety three point one\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nAnd ... you know if you look\nAt the the civil unrest in America and you really look at the history\nYou will find that it is\nAlmost always the left and in particular the communist or Marxist left that is behind the civil unrest\nIf you look at a you know here's Seventeen eighty three to Seventeen Ninety nine and you know Eighteen twenty nine to Eighteen fifty the riots and ensue gets that's you know a a paragraph each but after the communist manifesto\nWell then you start to get some interesting riots usually called strikes\nNow some of these things are legitimate when it comes to race\nBut a lot of these\nCome from a progressive in office\nWho is doing something and stirring people up against one another for instance the greatest example is Woodrow Wilson where he's you know these practically heaping praise on the Klan\nHe shows the first to a movie ever shown in the in the White House and it's one glorifying the Klan\nThe Klan goes real resurgence and he was heavily involved in it he has made of the military and it all sorts of things so you see this all of a sudden you start to see this real uptick of race riots again\nIn the in the Nineteen you know Fifteen onward will that's because of ... segregation and all of the things that a progressive\nPlanted alright but let me just go through and see if you can find any\nPatterns here the Patterson silk strike the copper county strike the Indianapolis streetcar strike ah the Seattle general strike May Day riots read this summer the Boston police strike the steel strike\nAny of those seems a labor related I was less labor related doesn't it labor who\nI'm Sorry if you look these up almost every time you will find the international workers' of the world\nWho are the international workers' of the world that is of course are based in communist and is it is the communist army here in America the international workers' of the world unite rise up against your oppressors\nThe also had in Nineteen sixteen the preparedness day bombing in San Francisco a you had a um a you had read summer which was about twenty of them you had and May Day riots\nYou had the ... massacre was what's interesting is the preparedness day bombing\nThat was the last and communist saying you you can't get involved in the war\nBecause it's so unethical and we're going to bomb you until you stop the best way to say that were icicles with a bomb bright this trail you a massacre if I'm not mistaken was again the leftists the ... I Can't remember which one it was but it was a communist organization\nThat was against a all of the um oh love the American legion Z\nAnd they were coming home still there they they go and they protest I think it was a parade and they actually end up rioting\nAnd killing people okay good then you look in the Nineteen thirties and forties\nIt's essentially it was a an industrial workers of the\nWorld and by ... thank you okay Minneapolis or Minneapolis Teamsters strike Nineteen thirty for the auto light strike the west coast long shore strike deal even know what that one was\nThat when that happened that may ninth through October twelve that wouldn't shut down San Francisco bay or the ports in California Portland and Seattle ... and who was behind that one\nUh probably some conservative thing yeah no no the textile workers' strike of Flint sit down strike the battle of the overpass the republic steals strike almost all of these\nAnd including many of the race riots\nCommunist and Marxist fingerprints on them\n\nI mean it's it's a fundamental to the ideology right repetition is fundamental to the ideology is not surprising that this was happening again around\nSo I just I'm I'm really tired of of sharing a A R I shouldn't say it this way I'm really tired of the media and their lives\nExactly the same thing we do not want war we do not want

Florida Panhandle I'm Dave Anthony if you made the\n[noise] on your right hand wringing grant program I Want to think\nAnd a dancer he is he's a guy that we had books last hour and a guy kind of went in\nA different direction but I did it fits right in to what we have been talking about today I had a caller about an hour and a half ago who said that you know when is it time that we are going to fight back\nAnd\nWe should fight back we should fight back in the polls we should stand the true and steady we have to speak truth do not forget the things that we were all taught and we all know\nAre true to be civil and kind to one another but\nWe were not in a place where I think he grabbed the gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst ed stats are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books and outrage of a nice time to talk about outrage\nWe did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime and you know rage an outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is dance response is I mean they just said I'll just say it I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people\nFeel like I Know you are a lot of built up outrage that is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal\nSide and it's in many ways tearing our country ... from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center a well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a word\n... filled with outrage or and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world like for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again\nI I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around the world\nAnd I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's a culture of the whole\nSo tell me because I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hartford did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll do he was in the end victorious [noise]\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were\nThey wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution\nUh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture and our and our underpinnings they're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment and you know not everybody we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that we live in two in every generation has face their challenges\nBut this is our moment and it ends in the book I sort of go through I have a chart and some stats up some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now the views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe\nA better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to hum we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our\nCable news network or we don't need to be a shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is\nAnd the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables\nBut he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around to the American woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to\nGet like the world the answer for Christians at this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know well don't stand up for things don't I mean even you say your fight but you fight a you know for example you can't war at a people\nAnd reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're to use your title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nTo not participate in creating photo and falls crises and outrage well\nHere's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically\nWere winning I mean look at the Supreme Court but the Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know\nAh trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] why I think people are ... it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a there's a difference\nBetween the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life\nYou know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the ... those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life not yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much\nLike them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot in Christians in the age of outrageous\nIs to I used to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some approach and and and gun for what it's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey\nAs well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all just strategic ally you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses and Jesus and\nWe take Jesus and Moses out who are we modeling remodeling who are we striving to be we cannot forget our art type [noise] back in just a second\nFirst let me tell you about gold line a President Trump has been a warning about the risks to every American if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress this November we will see an impeachment proceedings that does not mean that they will remove him from office but they will impeach him [noise]\nAh the ... the the first chance they get if they win the house if they win the house and the Senate you're going to see gridlock you're going to see nothing really nothing good\nWe need to go out and vote now what does this mean with Kay if chaos is happening in Washington more than it is what does that mean to the economy\nWhat does that mean to security one to our enemies do\nGold line has put together a report on what you can expect if there is a democratic victory you can get the report for free all you have to do is call them I've read the report I really would advise you to get it and share it with your friends\nI buy golden uh and silver as an insurance policy against chaos and if you've been paying any attention chaos is only getting worse\nHit your copy right now by calling eight six six gold line one eight six six gold line or gold line dot com be informed of what our future may hold to get your free report now eight six six gold lie [noise]\nAnd to acknowledge that I'm only all in as a Christian in following Christ and everything else is shaped around that my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom that's kind of our motto here we can college my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom than anything else\nSo I explain this yesterday that um you know the the so called Christians of the Westboro Baptist church\nYou know they they hold up signs you know God hates this Scott hates that blah blah blah they're just despicable you don't win\nBy by holding up signs no God hates view and shouting things back you win by listening by understanding by him racing them as a soul or a brother and sister not to do what they're doing\nStanding up but people have been changes one woman in particular that actually left her own family in the Westboro Baptist church because somebody spoke to her with civil civility and said let's just reason here for a minute\nYeah that's okay I I on my desk actually right every front of me a name plate costs are they actually protested at my church we went out and serve them coffee and doughnuts and they called me and the national news\nI Can't use one of the words probably on the radio but I'll lying beep false prophet and so it's actually one of my staff made it into a name played it says it says lined Blanco false prophet\nWestboro Baptist church which by the way of Cedar Rapids he was either Baptist church but but in doing so I mean the question is how do we respond well somebody reached out actually interviewed one of the members of the family as well a Christian Today so somebody reached out and I will tell you I think that's what\nWe can do right now with people who deeply disagree with us and\nThe book is filled with examples of Christians who actually built relationships with people who radically disagreed\nAnd in the process we're able to come to maybe a better understanding of what examples for example is a is the president by all university which is a Christian university in California uh met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party in the state legislature there in California\nThat was trying to change the laws that would make it illegal for ... to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more\nWell he ended up getting to understand each other better the will of the bill was ultimately not moved forward was dropped and and and now we're at a very different place now\nI'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying that Christians need to try to do that\nAnd I do think that in doing so well act a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians historically because of the moment we're in is not time for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and and as you said earlier to your caller I'm calling people to arms\nYet that's not I mean ... that's not an uncommon of you know some of the some of the worst things I see on social media\nI I click on a link and I find go to the bio and it's the first thing to listen thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like and I think that's what we need is a change in a lot of hearts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us this right now or the\nThe victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained as slaves or you know story after story after story of these Christians\nWho I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you\nI'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're going to come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit and we're going to crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said\nWe understand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with Peter unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate because you know Victor is right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about trying to hold back the advance of Christians either pagan\nAnd he says this a while the pagan priest neglect the poor the hated galleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these in pious galleons empire ... not only feed their own poor but I was also\nWelcome them into their about by the name of the book the name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage make it a meat is well worth the read\nRush Limbaugh we ... knew until three on news radio Ninety three point one\nThat come in the lights were on late at night last night and mercury one our mercury one partners are are are are ready to provide aid and relief\nTo those who have are going to be affected it is now coming onshore alligator point Florida\nIt is a monster a category for it I mean boy did this happen fast\nDangerous storm surge the wins the flooding

[noise] All right pat gray is a joining us from pat gray unleashed and a pat welcome thank you good to be here yeah it is and what is on your mind today\nDid you ever see the the TV show continuing did you watch on yeah I loved it yeah it was a great show yeah it was all about corporations running the world in your twenties Seventy or something yeah\nAnd I you know what I thought it was kind of silly at the time I have mocked Blade Runner and everything yeah corporation ... come on all scared of corporations yeah that's the that's the one thing the left had right\nThey might they might have had it right in the right way right I mean that\nThey say yeah ... voice bad rag valley I don't know if they were they were him ever when they put the flag with all the corporate logos on it and everything else I always thought oh please give it a rest but it is I mean you could put Amazon Google Facebook on the flag and eh pretty accurate\nYeah we ... we ... we now have and those are some that you mentioned do we now have companies that are big enough to really fit fit that role I don't know that that they do no not yet but it does Amazon in particular is just getting enormous and I'm In the book the for the hidden DNA of Amazon Apple Facebook and Google\nOr the author talks about just how massive Amazon is a for instance\nFar fewer us households have a gun the Amazon Prime thirty percent of sixty four percent holding a more Americans have prime than voted in twenty sixteen only fifty five percent\nI'm more Americans have Amazon Prime then go to church a more have Amazon Prime than um\nThan or in a monogamous relationship with a spouse\nShe'll have said that about more Americans had NBC and CBS and ABC I mean\nMaybe but they're into so many other things to which you know you got to consider\nThat I'm a ... that they're they're into\nEverything else like that I think it's fifty five percent of households now are sixty five percent of households have a Alexa ...\nAnd
