{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "Yeah I in the passage that was the basis for our tax for today in many translations it's translated as a stumbling block or a scandal on\nAnd that is something that causes one to stumble or in some translations to it falls on someone in in hurts them crushes them kind of thing okay and so that is the gospel I mean it's foolishness but it but it is an offense\nAnd it's interesting because today people are very very concerned about a fence and offending others in in from our research we found that one of the main reasons why people are apprehensive when sharing their faith is the fear of a fence\nBut the the irony of it is that the message that we have is inherently offensive and stumbling block\nSo just like the Bible passage tells us we preach Jesus and Jesus crucified and it is this stumbling block it is as you said\nAn offense an offense to the Jews and a fall lead to the ... it's a it's a fence to our reason it's right in your face that says you can't understand this the only thing you can possibly do is trust\nLooking ahead to next week's program it's going to be an important day here for the Lutheran our because Dr Michael Ziegler is going to make his debut yeah the next Lutheran our speaker Tony what do you think about that I think that's great [laughter]\nUm as as one who has filled in 'em over this past year\nWhen we have been in our vacancy speaker I'm thrilled to have him come here I Am also thrill because he brings to the table\nSuch a vibrant and unique way of proclaiming the gospel and um every time I hear him preach I learn something new from it I'm engaged by it and I know that our listeners will be as\nWell so I Can't wait to have him here not only and you might not know this not only um does he preaching the Lutheran our but he's he's a member of our US ministries team\nAnd so he works with us in in the development of our programming and figuring out um the ministries that we're developing and he speaks into that that process as well so all while he's voice or on the radio he is also a valued partner in our United States uh outreach of the gospel as a whole\nI think our listeners will discover that each speaker brings their own different style and to the program in the case of doctors Ziegler I think he's going to make use of the radio medium in a special way talking about that theater of the mind and you know you can use of his voice to bring the words alive to the listener\nYeah he has experience actually in um doing the gospel of mark from memory in connection with the gospel of mark program at Concordia Seminary in St Louis\nIt's amazing to hear him recite scripture from memory and he just doesn't remember it but he embodies it and and um he presented in a very engaging way\nI remember that when we were going through and and having people record sermons and you know things like that during the ... the first time that I heard him the first thing he did was he read the Bible passage and I was like wow if the sermon is as good as him reading the Bible passages who's going to be great but he has he has a talent\nFor interpreting\nAnd he has a talent for conveying with his voice and I and I think you said the or the mind is a great way of doing that when you listen to him preaching close your eyes and you can visualize a what's going on in the message\nAnd just a heads up for our listeners I think this is going to be a case of active listening being called for on your part it's this is not going to be the sort of thing where you can have it just kind of\nGoing in the background I think Dr Siegler really captures and engages your imagination and requires you to follow along carefully because he's going to take you on a journey with his sermons\nYeah your salvation free but listen to work you know I'm no he's a he is engaging and to follow along with him and I was I was a cemetery professor for a number of years so I've you know I think I've heard a lot of things but the way that he presents the message I think okay\nI haven't thought about it like that before and my only problem is that while he's preaching I start thinking and I started going down these well okay I Wonder what that's like and then I have to remind myself to keep listening because he's brought up these topics that are so engaging\nIn presenting them in ways I haven't heard before so um he's he's a gifted preacher but as we like to say he's also in many ways challenging\nIn the fact that he's not going to say the same thing in the same way\nBut that he's presented in a in a fresh way anything gauging way in stimulating way [noise]\nTo learn how you can support the worldwide outreach a Lutheran our mentors\nThere you go to lose the run our dot org or call one eight five five John three sixteen that's one eight five five five six for six three one six our email address is in ...

are openly inviting illegal immigrants to violate our borders they as as a caravan of about two thousand migrants crosses into Mexico from Guatemala\nAnd then you've got the people that can't qualify for a mortgage due to debt to income ratio and that's fifty two percent of the people the students that are\nOut there that they feel that's true and I don't honestly feel like that's a hundred percent true and I know that you haven't found that either Danielle that in or Chris that there's generally situations where we can work through this with people and come up with a game plan\nAnd that might be your best option right there is that if you sit down with somebody and actually come up with the game plan that you know even if it's not today that you can buy a house but perhaps at six months from now that you can because you planned in advance and I think that that's the real big lesson for all of us to know and all of us to do is because\nAnything when we plan in advance we can make things happen but it's sometimes\nThat last minute oh I Want to do that that it doesn't always\nWork out the way that we planned or doesn't work out in our best option because we could have had a better situation if we'd had done something else\nSo if you're just joining us You're listening to news radio Ninety three point line WFL lay the news talk station in Orlando I'm your hosts Laura Peterson front gate realty where your homes sold guaranteed her I'll buy it\nThis essential for real estate radio with you every Sunday at eight o'clock joining me today is Daniel ... and my teammates up front gate real cheat and Chris urban with butler mortgage remember if you want to reach any of us you can call for seven five six six she five five five or on your cell hit pound to fifty and the key word is real estate [noise]\nSo um you know a couple of other things that happened with student debt is that Seventeen percent of the people are saying that they can't afford the preferred house or neighborhood that they want because of the debt\nSo they have to settle for something else and then um you know there are those people that don't have the financial know how to confidently navigate the housing market and that's where we all come in to actually help you through\nDoing that and I think that you know it comes from examples I'm working with somebody right now that did have that situation where they've got\nAn awful lot of of student debt they're getting a PHD they're working full time they're teaching fulltime as well and everything but their student debt if they had to do that one percent like you were talking about Chris\nThey would have definitely not qualified for F ha because of that one percent saying that one percent deal that existed there\nBut we were able to work around with them and to get it so that their payment like you said is only like fifty bucks on a hundred thousand dollar loan\nAnd do you think wow that's quite an unbelievable right there but they're able to you know obviously that fifty dollars does not affect their bottom line as much as a thousand dollars would if you had to take a one percent\nYeah a lot of people don't even realize that they can call to get on these these income different type plants I'm basing cut us off I called are going to make me pay four hundred five hundred dollars a month\nI'm so dinner dinner just stuck like you said they just don't feel like they can go and buy a house to reach out to someone like you are ready to get started so once they do reach out to us in and look at it I'm like okay look this is what you're going on and this is how we need to look at it\nWe can put them on that plan you can call given that little small income repayment plan and then at that point we're helping them with something that was hoping affordable to them\nWell and somebody told me and I could be completely wrong with this that it's like if you ... for the whole thing though are you put it on some kind of ... then you could be that could be a negative thing when you're getting a loan correct\nSo if you're if it's in some form of forbearance or major I was in a different uh then usually a so for example we actually just got a new memo from Freddie back on this on on their side of the convention alone in a in that instance we'd have to use half of our point five percent of whatever the balances so it's not as bad as one percent\nBut it's it's still going to be a chunk of a you know depending on what I heard your balance on her student loans or a muggy and if you know that's the the eight hundred thousand dollars in loan debt which is probably a good average and you're talking on the five hundred dollars a month um and again and what I have someone like that it's a little unique position where you can maybe pay twenty thirty fifty dollars a month\nAt that point when that reflects on your credit we can go in and use that instead of five hundred dollars and that puts you in a much more comfortable repayment situation and it was\nAbsolutely and you know obviously you can always pay more than what the minimum is but if that's your minimum then that makes life obviously a lot easier and so you know it really it it's like you can hear\nDifferent things and go out there and do something but you might have heard like eighty percent of what you needed to hear and and that other twenty percent or whatever makes the difference of you being able to follow through with your plans and so it's really important\nTo go ahead and and figure out [noise]\nYou know what you need

to five five five or hit pound to fifty on your cell phone and the key word is real estate and you can obviously get Chris there as well\nAnd one of the things because they wanted to ask you about is what's going on with interest rates 'cause everybody's always are they going up are they going down and you know it's like I Know they're changing consistently and so you know why don't you tell us a little bit as far as what you know and that kind of stuff in that\nYeah it was I could tell people that you know the would only get too much detail but generally when you have a an economy that's kind of home and along with our economy is right now I'm ... and we stayed at such a low rate for so long you started to see an increase\nWith the increase of in our economy so the big driving force lately has been the feds who will continue to increase the rates in our country um you know that they're doing things like combat inflation and things like that and again we're just homing along um and and in fact I think in December going to see another injuries\nAnd so we've seen over the past year and a half or so actually ever since the ... elections nothing but an increase in our rates um we will hopefully see that was a little bit because obviously if they increased too much it ... it gets a little bit more difficult for affordable purchases right\nRight oh yeah and you guys might you know you might be able to touch on this you might start to see a softening over prices due to that um just because the demand might fall a little bit with with buyers kind of going oh my gosh richer now you know at this and that I don't I don't know if it's a good time to buy whatever might be or you might go to touch base on a little bit more\nWhat would happen is obviously with people that are paying cash you know it's like the price is what the prices but\nWhen people are getting a loan it's not about the price of the house it's about the monthly payment and so when you're looking at that as interest rates rise\nThan the Ford ability obviously does go down and everything a little bit but when interest rates are going up it's not just like up up up there is like fluctuations like day to day where today it might be this rate and tomorrow it's a little bit higher than the next day it's a little bit lower\nAnd so you know when you come into they always talk about locking your rate in and when you're doing that you know what it's gonna be for sure but went to the right time to actually do that and and is there a strict strategy involved in that\nSo it's it's difficult right there's nobody here that has a crystal ball that's going to say here's what the rate's gonna be tomorrow and you're absolutely right they do fluctuate every single day there's uh\nOh Thursday I'm Sorry when there was not a good day for race but there is there was a better day yeah who knows what will be today um when it comes down to when we decide okay look here's one real Walker and just read a lot of times it just depends on when you find a house and when you're going to close on that\nUm I might tell people look you know there are certain data that's going to come out that much swayed one way or another um but even then sometimes we don't know what the data might be so if if let's say there's a big announcement about what our GDP is in our country or whatever something huge economically\nThen that might influence what rates might do that day and at that point I can maybe guide somebody I might be able to say what we call floating which means we're not walking you're re we're just letting it sit there or am I tell you look\nJust talking to be good with like their rate right now protected while we can so and I I tell people all the time look it's every other loan programs different you know um if you want to discuss actual rates in more detail feel free to reach out to me a four zero seven for one for six one fire for that's my cell phone I Will talk about it any time\nSo why don't you give us at number again ... ... my cell phone numbers for zero seven for one for six one five four\nOkay so if you're just joining us You're listening to news radio Ninety three point one WFL a than his taxation in Orlando I'm your hosts Laura Peterson ... reality we're home sold guaranteed her I'll buy it this is central Florida real estate radio with your every Sunday at eight o'clock\nJoining me today is Danielle who may one of my teammates that Frank it real tea and Chris urban with butler mortgage remember if you want to reach any of us costs four seven five six six she five five five or on your cell phone hit pound to fifty and the key word is real estate\nSo when we're talking about rates and all of that kind of thing you know um it's it comes down to like we said the monthly payment so when you're looking at it and you're making a determination of whether this is the right loan for use different loans have different rate sometimes to correct\nAbsolutely correct um every loan program\nI'm close to some different so to give you an ideal we spoke about the loans earlier in the nice thing about them is that is being as a government backed loan um typically become with a little bit better rates so it's it's a nice word for veterans I'm On a conventional loans your rate is always driven by your credit score\nIf you're not going to get top dollar than you know it's okay you're not you know to keep it a little bit dingy but most people want to get top dollar for their house cleaning the exterior windows and screens is the first thing\nThe next one is refreshing your gardens and walk ways you know having fresh plants and those kinds of things in there and we're always talking about power washing\nTheir power washing I think you should do I mean usually twice a year\nAnd um I mean they have so many people out there that you can hire to pressure wash or I mean a partial washers like a hundred bucks I think so\nYou know you might want to buy one I enjoyed pressure washing I Do it quite often I mean the only thing that hurts every ... every now and again I forget that I'm doing the pressure wash and I like go to like ... oh my goodness I've done that like twice of like what am I going to learn that on pressure washing now with the regular host so\nThat does not feel that greater even when I go to do it on my feet I'm like oh my gosh but\nYet pressure washing as a big thing I mean just with all the rain that we get over the summers yeah you know all this all the stuff from the roof and the trees and everything it just stays there on the driveways and why not make it look good\n[noise] yeah exactly and I've you know it's like I've thought many times that I Want to get that wet it and forget it you know stuff to put on my that it's something that you put on there and when it rains it takes everything up and I haven't tried that in all\nKinds of things I mean I was at lose this weekend for ten dollars you could buy the one that attaches to your hose\nAnd again it's like you could spray it they have one that's for the windows have all index ones that have even higher windows you know you could spray it and forget it on the green one is for like the exterior of the house\nAnd you can use it 'cause sometimes pressure washing might not take everything off but it can at least take some of the green stuff that you get and yeah it's ten dollars I mean it's a really you know minimal expense\nYeah and so we started with the gardens and the walkways and so basically you know like fresh\nAnnual ... and that kind of thing are great to put in front of the house whether it's in a pot or whether you have some kind of a bed just to make it look and warm and infighting and everything is a great thing to do and then um you know refreshing your homes\nWhat the majority of your house if it's the ... or the stucco or whatever it is most people have stuck over here in central Florida that comes down to power washing many times and that kind of thing too sometimes it needs a fresh coat of paint because you know you're going to see some hairline cracks and that kind of thing to do and that's always\nGood to do as well and the other one is to update and clean door to door fixtures and house address science I mean sometimes I mean they're out there and the elements\nAnd so they just get a little tired sometimes\nOh yeah definitely yeah and the and when I was replacing my um you know the numbers on my house\nI was surprised that you could actually by the numbers for Seventeen cents I think it was yeah and I was like going you gotta be kidding these are what are the numbers that are on your house are\nThere are those plastic ones you know if that that's what was on my house when I repainted it and I thought oh my gosh these only costs Seventeen cents apiece which I Would expect them\nTo be alive aren't going to be a lot more so if you've\nGot the good plastic ones you know or even the metal ones I'm ... now yes I Am an even sand them down and just slap him with some spray paint you know like it of course metal I think it's an empty or something like that metal to direct a metal is what it's called the ATM and so you can spray paint those things and just bring it back to life if you know\nHeaven forbid I mean you know maybe have some really nice ones that you know you spent maybe more than Seventeen cents on and on you know so you could spray painted and why not I mean that's what I did with the last house I re purpose them and I just put some new black paint on and mandate popped\nYeah so if you're just joining us You're listening to news radio Ninety three point one WFL a than his talk station in Orlando I'm your hosts Laura Peterson Frank ... homes sold guaranteed or I'll buy it\nThis is central Florida real estate radio with your every Sunday at eight joining me today is Danielle who may one of my teammates that Frank it real cheap and Chris urban with butler mortgage\nYou remember if you want to reach any of us cause for seven five six six to five five five or pound to fifty on your cell phone and the key word is real estate [noise]\nUh the end when it comes to doors like painting a door is sometimes you know easy to do you know maybe putting a riff on it or something like that you know just making it just given at that extra ...\nIs er homelessness and everything that makes it um you know pop and then the other thing that says here's to clean the furniture that's outside and probably pick up the garbage and all that kind of stuff I Know your pet peeve Danielle or the the papers that are left outside and that drives me\nNuts [laughter] like my neighbor like you know she got the same amount I mean I Would get went on Thursday I Would get one on Saturday then I went on Sunday and then every now and again I get like a special one\nAnd she would leave her is out there and I mean first off they send you give it to you in a different color package so like you know Thursday says maybe purple or whatever but then if it rained heaven forbid you know now this paper has turned to yellow and then it's all city and it's just gross and I'm like just pick it up\nYou know so that every time when I go out to do the recycled than I have to pick up her paper you know I mean it's already it's so soap or what have you and the re sprinklers are on and I'm like oh my gosh just telling me don't want it I mean you're spending money for them to deliver it you know save them a trip and just\nCancel it [laughter] yeah yeah but it's like those little things that that you can do is just getting them up and pick up that kind of stuff and you know just look around I mean it's like\nYou know there's a lot of little things that you know and I'm times people are dropping stuff off and then I you know and I don't use my front door I go in through the garage but you know when I Do occasionally open up the front door and like what's all this stuff here you know that people have dropped off\nAnd yeah it fell off the door and it's like next to it then and it's all a mess and all that kind of good stuff to exactly\nAnd not only that too but like you know if you have a lawn man I'm you know they blow usually and then next thing you know you know you might get all this stuff in your yard because they've blown you know maybe they were two streets down or something crazy but you know they've blown and the winds picking up and all this great stuff and next thing you know you've got all this stuff in your yard\nI mean I'm just one of those I mean I come in the same way through the garage and my I had a really big front porch so I never went through there but like when I Would go out there I mean I'd have all these little door hangers that we're no longer on the door and then I'd have like even packages and I'm like oh my gosh I forgot to go to that\nBut you know what I mean so it's like the same thing so you just come out and you just see it and then imagine somebody to come up see your house they're going to see the same stuff so might as well may I may already coming through the front door\n... exactly you know nine times out of ten you're not giving him the code to get in a minute or ah yeah\nSo the and you want him to come into that so it's like those little things that you know just make a difference because it is always the little things it's usually not about the big things the big things we see and all of that yeah but it's the little things that make a difference when you go to sell your house as far

on the radio when I'm Out I was on a tire radio studio victory episode with the guard me no I'm In trouble that film was leaving to talk about his new album and then of course\nSome discussion about it a little band called the Beatles refused when we were playing music or radio preserves your studio\nWFL up on ... door Orlando news radio ... one WFL a and I heard radio\n\nHeating rally is for a pair of political rivals I'm Pam who sales Fox News well accusing President Trump of shredding American values former vice president Joe Biden fired a crowd in Nevada where Democrats have a chance to flip the Senate seat in next month's midterms\nAnd while the numbers are not\nA as consistently\nGreater on the revenue side or the earnings are still a near there they're kind of historical top if you will Seventy two percent of companies that every ... reported earnings so far have topped\nForecast which is near the highest rate during the course of the past Twenty years or the revenue is the is the item that is getting looked at about fifty eight percent\nA of those companies have ... have topped revenue expectations are still the majority but that that top line number if you will of the growth of the top line number\nHas started to kind of creep down a little bit from where it was in prior quarters in terms of that growth trend and so that is a if we look at the market for example this past week which was sort of the start\nEarning season the markets respond very positively when there is a significant earnings a success or and similarly a relatively negative when\nA there are earnings disappointments so for the week the market was all over the map had a big day on Tuesday a but a ... a couple of negative days and there are so for the week the market itself was only up that was only about a hundred points are the broader base markets were\nJust basically flat I mean I think the S. and P. five hundred\nWas up like point zero two percent so barely noticeable in terms of the um in terms of the return and um for for the week as a result of kind of this this starve earnings season or to put it into perspective\nA earnings are still growing a if you are still a beating your earnings expectations and that means you're earnings are still\nA growing but uh because of the recent decline in the market the price has come down so when you look at\nUm the S. and P. and where it trades it trades right now are at about Fifteen point nine times the twelve month for word earnings Fifteen point nine which when you look at it\nUh it's down from about sixteen point nine I'm a as a about a month ago so a little bit of movement in the market combined with continued\nEarnings uh is is is pressing that number is much more than it was just even a month ago so at Fifteen point nine or you or relatively close to the long term average\nOf about Fifteen times earnings I mean that's sort of the traditional number that gets thrown around is that Fifteen times earnings so at so at\nFifteen point nine ah on the ... the ratio Stephen ... not\nA whole lot of of significant\nUpside there are significant difference there so I Would say the answer to your questions is that the stock prices haven't gotten way ahead of themselves and compared with corporate profits\nBecause corporate profits continue to be a a a shining example of of well run businesses in the earnings really are moving along pretty\nDramatically ah and ah and certainly would not suggest to me that if it's a Fifteen point nine versus a normal average of Fifteen that\nUm that it's in some type of a bottle of of a bubble um when I was misspent on chasing a bubble I'm so when you also look at it historically from I'm from a a form of\nThe kind of the struggle date on the P ratio ... you'll find that there are many times where it hovers in Fifteen to twenty range and so uh that is sort of the historical kind of\nSweet spot if you look at the the sixties and uh you know it was in that Fifteen to twenty range you look at the eighties nineties or you're looking into Fifteen to twenty range interestingly if you overlay um interest rates and um\nAnd the ratios what you'll find is that what interest rates are high generally the pie ratios driven down and ah when the interest rate is low or you can you get usually get a little bit of an upward on the P ratio so\nA price to earnings ratio for those of you don't know what Stevens referring to in his email is simply the price\nOf a company share\nDivided by the\nEarnings at that company is expected to make over the course of the next twelve months it's being because it's looks at those earnings that are expected to be made over the next twelve months it's generally viewed as sort of a forward looking type of\nOf measure and many folks look at that number and as a gauge of what the future might be if if the if the price earnings ratio gets too high like let's say it was twenty five\nThen you could certainly make the argument that uh perhaps the price of the stock was much higher relative to the earnings than what it should be but at Fifteen point nine which is where it's at right now are not that far off of sort of the historical longer term average of Fifteen\nBe careful of the in the relationship of the interest rates and P ratios as well when interest rates are high PE ratios generally get pushed down low ah with interest rates are low at sort of pushes up pie ratios a little bit too says also\nBeyond just the straight\nPrice and burning that determined the pie ratio is this a little bit of an of an overlay that you would want to do on the analysis that ah has to do with um with interest rates so\nA Steven off with that answers your question gives the rest of our listeners a little bit of perspective on what that actually means because we hear a lot about the pie ratio and uh it always good to know where that comes from the price of the company stock and share of the company's stock divided by the earnings\n... expected to her over the next twelve months making it a very forward\nLooking a type of um of of piece of a of of market information so\nA state we'll stay tuned on on the earnings part because after all we are in the midst of earnings lots of companies reporting this coming week\nUh companies like three am like caterpillar like Lockheed like McDonalds I mean this is for Boeing General Dynamics Microsoft UPS Google Amazon I mean this is a this is a big week for that earnings conversation so we will\nOr we will see how all of that\nPlays out and how that affects the the ratio of 'em and you obviously we'll be talking more about that are in the weeks ahead on the program so\nAnyway that's the story with a P ratio Steven thanks for that email we will slide to a break when we get back\nFrom the break we'll talk a little bit about Social Security and some of the things that you may want to make sure you know here on dollars and cents this is Joel here some Nelson financial

I'm In sort of that post two thousand and eight period of time when there was\nA lot of inventory but not much uh not many people borrowing money or purchasing homes still today about half of where that him and tore was back ah posed two thousand and eight so certainly\nA while we certainly see a lot of houses for sale there's not as nearly as much inventory as it was a coming out of two thousand two thousand nine so the human tore anytime inventories small that are sort of self creates demand because you don't have a whole lot of\nOf options out there to choose from\nSo a along those same lines another number to look at is housing stats or ... housing starts gives me a and housing starts are basically\nYou know ... Newhouse new home construction when you look at those numbers are those numbers are also nowhere near where the peak was going in to uh to two thousand and\nEight a and in fact it by some measures are are still at about fifty percent meaning that the housing a peaked at about fifty percent of the peak of that occurred\nUh prior to two thousand and eight so she wasn't interesting numbers are perspective if you will on this housing conversation a lot of folks in the media saying oh my goodness it's a housing\nBubble and you have to look at it in comparison to what uh the the the real bubble if you will of that was um a prior\nTo two thousand and eight and then the aftermath\nOf that inventories are jumped dramatically in the aftermath of that today those inventories stand at\nA less than half of what they were previously and then most importantly housing starts housing starts even today a peaking at less than half\nOf what they Pete that going in to two thousand and eight so so again be careful in a lot of the information that you hear out there uh we think that the the story on housing and those statistics is just one of many\nNumbers or um conversations out there in the media that uh are intended to be um excite you I guess would be the best way to say and and\nBecause they're intended to excite you then ah what happens is uh they certainly do get your attention but they create sort of a false sense\nAnd certainly that's true when you start looking at the housing [noise] uh and I guess for for the ... for for for the most part a that was kind of how we started the show a little perspective on the PE ratio as well a lot of conversation about that\nBut if you look at it in terms of those longer term historical trends you will find a little bit more perspective than simply what the folks in the media are talking their heads about\nAnyway uh we're about done with our talking a cause that mean when the music means is playing that means we got to wrap this up so we will\nWrap it all up thank you all for listening to the program this has been dollars and cents with your host Joel Garrett's of notes and financial planning on news radio Ninety three point one WFL I [noise]\nThese commissions expenses investment costs come in all shapes and sizes do you know how much your investments are really costing you at Nelson financial planning we believe that cost should be a major consideration and your financial plan\nAfter all the lower your costs are the more you get to keep for yourself this is Joel garrison I invite you to get educated about your investment cos\nVisit Nelson financial planning dot com or call us today at four zero seven six to nine six four seven seven to set up a personal conversation to review your investment cos that's\nNelson financial planning dot com or for oh seven six to nine six four seven seven to set up that conversation\nA plus better Business Bureau accredited nails in financial planning offers security is through Nelson I best real quick services member as IPC at F.
