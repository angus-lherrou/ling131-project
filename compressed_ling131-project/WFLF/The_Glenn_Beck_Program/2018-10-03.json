just mean counter measures but I mean just any sort of tips or anything like that [noise]\nKnow scared the test itself she scared of the kind of struggle that\nTell the information\nThat has to

we know somebody is lying here\nWe know we know someone is lying right do we do because we have somebody we have somebody who has accused her of teaching someone else about a polygraph\nWell she's innocent until proven accused I think that's important that we keep it any better she now that you moved accused she is accused she's guilty so if we're going to use the same standard that the left is applying she is a lawyer\nShe has perjured herself\nCertainly shouldn't be a professor anymore she should not be a professor even be allowed to work at a fast food restaurant I don't think so how can you how can you possibly believe a liar on anything she says\nYou want this standard because this is the standard that's coming this is the standard\nThat we are now running to embrace this is the standard that our children this is the standard that we ran from this is why we're America\nBecause in every other country this was a new idea\nYou can always come into my house and just take me you can't just throw me in jail you have to have an accuser\nI have to know what the charges are I have a right to defend myself I have a right to know who my accuser is and address my accuser\nI have a right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty [laughter] this is what America was founded on is this is an a uniquely American idea\nThis was the genius of our founders you want to flush it away\nGo ahead [noise] but I Will not to be part of it this is the American idea\nNow listen\nIt is so imperative that you understand what this is if you do not understand what you're fighting [laughter] do you think we could have won World War two\nWithout naming the Nazis [noise]\nDo you think we will ever win this war on terror without naming what it is about what is driving people to the terror\nV. is la ... id is not Muslim ideas Islam is ideas that for real law is the prevailing law and if you are not under surreal law you're an infidel which means I can kill you I can rape you I can turn you into a slave\nThat is what the war on terror is all about and we will never win it unless we name our enemy\nWe would have never won World War two if we were fighting the Germans we we're not fighting the Germans we were fighting the Nazis\nWe would not have one in the in the civil war had we been fighting the south\nWe were fighting people who didn't believe in the constitution we were fighting for the freedom of\nAll men that's why we won and by the way if you don't think that's true we lost every single battle up until the point that Abraham Lincoln said this is about slavery look it up\nWe wouldn't have won the the American Revolution if it wasn't against tyranny it wasn't against the king it was against tyranny and it was for certain ideas like the idea\nThat you were innocent until proven guilty\n\nWe are fighting post modernism and until the American people understand what post modern ism is you will lose\nYou will lose every battle because you will only grow frustrated and angry\nWhich will play directly into what they want to happen they want us at each other's throats they want us to be irrational they want us to be angry they want us to just to start swinging and blind rage\nThat's their plan\nAnd until you understand what they're doing until you will understand that this isn't really about Ford this isn't about the charges\nThis isn't about anything\nAnd this is all about the patriarchy this is all about white men have put together in this case a rape culture and they have kept people down and it doesn't matter if he really did it because other white men have it doesn't\nMatter if she was really a victim because other women\nHave been victims this is about collective justice currently entitled social justice but make no mistake

[laughter]\nThey say for me to ask them to tell me how he feels name\nIt's present a ski present a ski how there was a lot easier than it than at low we can't pronounce easy word yeah it was going to be together as a more than one film that allowed him there's a lot of confidence there and I know how you doing there and I'm doing well how are you\nGood I'm I'm a I'm I'm really fascinated by how we make the turns in our society for the future\nAnd a ownership is a big part of this because in the future I don't know how many people leaving on cars I mean it's just it's just all changing\nBut do we really own things when we buy them online\nSo I think there's a real concern here that consumers go into transactions when they're buying things and digital goods are especially digital books movies music\nThey go into the transactions assuming they work the same way they do in the in the world of tangible goods where if you buy a book\nYou can give it away to a friend you can lend it to someone you can leave it in your will or in the future and you know a leave your book collection or to or your loved ones\nAnd the rules that control these digital transactions when you buy something on your Kindle or if my ... are very different from the rules that we expect in the physical world\nAnd consumers don't really understand that distinction and I think that causes a real disconnect between what we all expect to happen and what happens in fact so to give you a quick example I'm just [noise] um\nA couple of weeks ago I'm a\nConsumer uh a customer of the apple eyes gyms a movie store she found that three movies purchased had that we had been deleted from his account there were no longer accessible and I think that shocked a lot of people\nUm those of us have been following these issues closely for years would remember ten years ago when Amazon remotely deleted\n... off of people's candles and including a ironically George Orwell Nineteen eighty four [laughter] so these these issues have been happening for a long time but I think people are are are now starting to have a sit up and take notice\nOkay so I I remember it gives us that it's easier for me to read everything on Kendall um but I and I have a a large collection uh in my library of of of hardcover books\nUh and I read so much I read it all on tend to but I have recently really been concerned ... not just because I don't actually own it and I can't have it in my library and I can't pass it on\nBut also because he watch things like that happening in China if you're ... if you're in China in the first they wouldn't sell the book but if they did sell the book\nThe government can just deem that that book is and you don't need to burn books you could just overnight just take all of that\nEvery copy of that book out of circulation if it's only digital that's really disturbing to me\nI think it's a real concern um it's a concern I'm from the perspective of censorship when you've just described it but it's also real concern\nOr from the perspective of preservation and sort of archiving our cultural history if these books are ... are are stored on these centralized servers\nAnd only the hands of you know the the the two or three companies um that dominate these markets\nThen there's a real risk that um we are going to be able to ensure a cab to widespread distribution of copies that will allow us to uh to to to archive and preserves [noise] um do these works\nIn an air and it was the movie it wasn't because they founded objectionable or anything else is because that particular provider they lost the rights to that movie right and so they they had to pull it from people's libraries because their rights that expired\nTo their number of ways that this can happen this most recent example I don't know the facts are totally clear on exactly what went on so one way this can happen is that as you described\nUm the deal between the digital retailer apple or Amazon and the copyright holder expires may no longer have the rights to sell that product\nIt can also happen when a record label or a movie studio decide that they want to put out the new updated re mastered the director's cut edition of the movie and when they do that they pulled the old version\nTo hell home I Do [noise] um\n[noise] oh my gosh so they almost force you to I mean 'cause they they've always done this where you know it's the masterpiece collection and it's you know additional footage and and the you know fully restored but you still had the old copy\nNow that's right you can't ... I mean even for I mean think of this even just for comparison you can't if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed our war huh well I Want to see what it was like\nWhen they were originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that what'd you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and the and the problem is most recent case in part was that the consumer did will have a local copy stored on their computer or their device\nUm and and this is this a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you can do the locally when these services are often trying to\nEncourage consumers to rely on their own on the on the company's own sort of cloud storage solution and sometimes I'm for with the Apple TV for example\nThe Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of a movie you have to access it through their ... servers\nExactly I'm\nSorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship if those\nIf I downloaded of something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\n... so\nThat allows you to store those files locally on your own device\nCars that Kendall is tethered through soft where right where connections to Amazon Amazon has the ability as as they showed ten years ago to block it move those files strong\nMuslim apple ... you're talking about or go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years do two and a very different way I Am sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way they've forced everybody to have it exactly [laughter]\nIt's bizarre you write about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce\nThere is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making for my tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\nYou it's a it's sort of an open ended thing where they're constantly knowing what you do with that product and you have that ongoing relationship\nWhere they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk of but a little bit about the change their cars that either but they're real change I don't think people have considered an air and before you answer that we're going to take a quick break and they will come back and get you to answer that question a and just the change\nIn capitalism change what does it mean to enter a world where\nThere's really no ownership of anything\nFor years now relief factor has been helping my team here in the studio\nYeah a pain late last year um oh school mine well I Want to tell you about really factor really factor take it it's really good\n... and you can buy really factor with gold one thing you can I don't think he can mount a case I Want to tell you a little bit about the goal line the new silver maple flex allows you to break off a smaller pieces are for barter Andrade of sub silver\nUm there's a really I mean we just talked about the debt\nI don't know what's going to happen to the dollar nobody does nobody does nobody knows what's gonna happen bitcoin what's it going I mean there if there ever is a time of of catastrophic change there's got to be a time when we're all going to have to kind of work together and figure things out or because of the things aren't going to work the same with with dollars\nMay I suggest that the world always returns to gold um and for a barter a ... they have the maple flex going which is this\nThis bar of of a silver that it's about the size of a credit card that you can carry it around it has a maximum flexibility you just break off pieces and are you going to have you know one tenth one quarter of an ounce of silver\nBut they also do it in gold and it's all made by the royal Canadian meant the only people that carry this is gold line\nJust look at the numbers find out for yourself is the world\nLean towards the fiscal sanity or insanity\nAs soon as the stars start rolling the other direction I'll stop talking about this but I don't trust that we have anything that's going to go into um bring us back into sanity

I don't I have a heap of junk I Can't do anything with it because I don't own the software that runs it\nI think the cars a great example um we see this issue come up in the motor vehicle context of the ... the way it come up um uh most most recently in most often is actually not with cars but with tractors or John Deere\nUm the long running American farm equipment company makes exactly this argument that they own the software and the tractors that say they sell to American farmers and that means that farmers can only get their tractors repaired I authorized John Deere a dealers\nThey can't do it themselves they can't go to their local mom and pop a you know farming repair shop [noise] um I think those kinds of changes are really troubling\nBecause they go to this sense of independence in the sense of autonomy that we're all independent actors in the world who can make our own decisions who can decide what's best for us do we want to keep this tractor as it is do we want to modify it do you want to repair it\nThose decisions are being taken away from individual consumers and you're doing forced to play by a set of rules dictated by the company to quote unquote sell you these products\nAnd doesn't that also doesn't also stop innovation I mean sometimes the guy who take something and then tinkers with it comes up with a better system but if I'm if I'm locked out of tinkering\nOn my own property uh it it ... it it almost creates this uh this feeling of oh well that's just the way it is and that's the way it always is going to be it just runs that way and it stops innovation doesn't it\n[noise] I I think it has the real risk of doing that it it discourages people from being creative that discourages people from um from as he said ... with the same as it they are and we have a lot of ah incredible innovations that have been made a over the centuries in this country\nThat didn't come from giant ... departments they can for individuals messing around with things down in their garage and there is a risk that were for closing those kinds of opportunities but even even more broadly that um\nThat's real estate agents I trust dot com pressure headaches\nLinda's has suffered for years with chronic sinus infections\nYou don't feel like doing anything when when you feel like your head is completely clogged oh you want to do is just lay down fleet and the pressure or if it's not fun always walking around the headache\nNow for issues are gone\nA minimally invasive procedure done in the office called the clear sinus procedure\nI really did not know what it is I feel like you're really breathing and not being sent pond out I Would do it again in a heartbeat and\nYou suffer with chronic sinus infections facial pain pressure headaches congestion by noticed the clear scientists procedure is the solution for you sit and employment today with clear sinus\nCalled for oh seven nine eight to one for two zero four o seven nine eight to one for two zero that's four o seven Ninety eight to one for two zero\nJesus a name that is uniquely above every night\nScript for teachers that one day the whole world would bow down and worshipping [noise]\nGet the name of Jesus as more and more forbidden in the public square\nOne may use God or higher\nDon't you push your religion on me [noise] mentioned the name of Jesus at the office or in a public school and I'm from the forties will try to shut you down like about what that says NO NAME and all the world creates more powerful positive or negative response than Jesus\nCame to save us from sin death and hell and to give us eternal life [noise]\nBut to admit we need a savior\nIs to admit we're centers and that is very offensive to those who don't understand who Jesus really is [noise] yes there is something about that now you know name is more powerful loving or more offensive\nThis is Brian dry speaking right from my heart\nI'm a fire fighter to check on a farm and I'm a barber\nPie in the community every day in anatomy tethers on the line and you\nHave to take for granted on alert on them and make up our everyday some good others not so much\nNear the Syrian ...\nLike ...\nThese are the moments take up homes\nParanoia or being a free\nStanding out there protecting our community one detail on time because a lot of little detail can become an arena we we trust I think just like\nHas only now now for printing in your everyday\nTo protect your everyday living the from ... from ... to signing\nThe news you need and the place to talk about is W.

will do nothing for you because we cannot do anything for you if you haven't gone to the police and reported it\nIf you believe that we live in a rape culture then you have a responsibility to go to the police and document everything that has been done\nThen we as a society need to do everything we can to make sure that justice is served not on a collective basis but judging it by the individual case\nThat is a just society that is America\n[noise]\nCan't turn here listening to the Glenn Beck program one\nOf my favorite guys or because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves gay looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line and that is exactly the right name for it [laughter]\nIt is and it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google game it was an interview in fact where he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go\nAnd then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and here's Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and ah and I think it's his background as an engineer or ... or and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film is saying is that Google has and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company and make money or they have a certain the east coast and the world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlands are using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the Kavanaugh case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a ... there is this overwhelming ah understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seem that\nRight yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past ah in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... Stein have signs of very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and there's a very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\n... is a Google is a verb now yeah I'm not an down yes it's a verb\nI don't know Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary that will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes that's real problems\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly well because it's occurring in real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was linked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about\nUh about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the point that we tried to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put up my fake news story appointees it's out in the open you have combat and by the way have fake news\nDoesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add that the Russians ran of Jesus and\nAnd and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you voted a different way that wasn't that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter] but you know\nThe point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because the confirmation bias you know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why will you know I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back do you have an answer their answer on why they won't make a transparent yes and it's not very\nGood at it is not\nThe name of the documentary is the creepy line the ... dot com Peter ... with it and we have a lot to discuss because of the platform Ming\nA and kind of a role in from our last conversation about information how do you know that it's
