I I Am hoping do and you and your ... this week that you're filling in for but if you can go over all the amendment that would help a lot of people I think\n... and I were just talking about that we're going to probably take about four for about three days so yes we intend to do that but go ahead to\nSeparate where where did you feel on for I I'm against it I I don't feel that uh I mean I I I just don't I I'm not for for lots of different ways I'm just curious what your position as well\nYou know I think that the the amendment stated it says the amendment restores voting rights to former felons who served their sentence including parole and probation with the exception of those convicted of murder and sexual offenses\nCurrently former felons must wait at least five years after completing their sentences to ask the former Florida clemency board made up by the governor and cabinet to restore their rights\nYou know I I'm a firm believer that a felony is something that is extremely important it is it is a very it is something that carries more than a year\nAnd a stiffer fine and I just believe that if you are going to be someone who commits a felony yes you've served your time yes that you know you should be getting your restoration of voting rights back but I don't think there's anything wrong with waiting an additional five years\nI I just don't have a problem with that and and you know that's why we have fifty different states fifty different state constitutions and Florida says look we want to be sure and there is a process you expunged the record you go through this commission this clemency commission\nAnd you get your uh your your voting rights restored but you know when you when you've committed a felony and yes you've paid your price\nI I just believe that we we have got to instill the importance of our laws and abiding by those laws and I think and you know really I I just I don't support for\nWhat do you know I Do not I I I agree ... of a whole heartedly actions have consequences and uh I personally don't think they should get him back at all but at least at least the way the system works now there's a set of eyes goes into looking at each each individual situation\n... and like it or doing it so All right\nJohn you're very welcome thanks for your call from Titusville Bobby we're going to squeeze in here from used as you want to

results I just published a big article a called a can of ways\nBig tech can shift\nMillions of votes in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA that's just one of ten ways uh that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment\nAh that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh and they they they are I mean some of these the effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd they're ... or ... years\nAnd there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\nWell into thousands sixteen early two thousand sixteen or working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people are seeing while they were using the Google bang\nAnd Yahoo search engines that was the election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system and so it was a first ever created and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nAnd we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton who am I favored by the way as you mention\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty blatant that's pretty extreme flowers these leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nA you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them and uh I don't think we should be surprised\nUh that we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually\nBe able to see what these

they run them every single service they provide as just another surveillance platform\n[laughter] uh I Do have a little bit more good news though which is that film that you mentioned the creepy lie has\nA when ... when you had a my ... one of my new very good friends Peter Schweitzer on your show recently though he's a he's the one who would who really got that film running a\n... surely wasn't available but now as of right now it is available both on Amazon and on I ... for for rental or sale and it's it and it really is a fabulous film\nAnd builds Google it just go to the freebie lying dot com when you came out about some of this stuff and again you were a Hillary supporter when you came out about this ... were you you were blocked by Google for a time where you not\n[noise] well when I when my research\nA first hit the news and the Washington Post a you know I found that starting the next day I couldn't access any Google products I couldn't even access to Google dot com so [laughter] I have these amazing screen shots that\nThey're just shocking to people because you can't even imagine not being able to access Google yeah but I have three and shot showing getting these time out saying no you know you can't get their sorry\nAmazing okay let's go through some of the uh ... some of the uh affects that you are monitoring we have about\nAbout a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there was ...\nSeven ten ... ten of these that you're following there's\nTen altogether okay out and altogether okay so let's take on one real quick begin\nVery good when ... okay here we go this is called the er the search suggestion effect when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you typed so if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon\nRight away they'll start slashing suggestion that you and Amazon it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source\nBut beyond that we've learned through our experiments that Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you\nTo turn a fifty fifty vote among\nA fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety\nTen split with all my one having any idea they're being manipulated\nOh gosh oh my gosh\nOkay we're gonna come back and uh and go through the others if we have time he'll talk about some of the other things Google is doing and what we're supposed to\nDo about it and you need to know about it you can see it in the creepy line\nIt's a new documentary the creepy line dot com the freebie line dot com\nDave Ramsey ... six PM on news radio

behavioral research and technology he is I'm In a new documentary called the creepy line we talked about it last week I saw it last week and it is indeed very creepy it is\nUm it's it's\nIs it too much to say it's\nMore on the we were at mind control or the threshold of mind control doctor\n[noise] [noise] uh well we've been there for a long time ... there's a you know ah there's no question about it there's there's literally right now more than\nTwo point five billion people soon to be over four billion a whose whose thoughts and purchases and beliefs and attitudes and voting preferences are are affected a dramatically uh every single day by a some manipulations that big\nTech companies are perpetrating on them and that's happening now so that that's already going full steam or it's just getting worse every day\nSo I I just I I Want to reset that you did a study during the last presidential election\nYou are a Hillary Clinton supporter but you're a truth teller and you were doing a a a a study on Google Search results and found that they were trying to manipulate it in favor of Hillary Clinton now you say that's the only one way\nWe then have the surge suggestion effect now target\nMessaging affect what is the target heart that\nSure targeted messaging T Emmy we call that is a these are all things that we study and that where you were you know were quantifying and you know very precisely a targeted messing effect\nIs really scary ah this this means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to but if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November\nTwo thousand sixteen is is that morning mark sucker bird had chosen to just you know\nHit the anarchy and send out go out and vote reminders\nUh mainly just supporters of Hillary Clinton\nOr exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that was even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others\nBut if it went justice supporters of Hillary Clinton that would have given her that day and additional\nFour hundred and fifty thousand votes now gosh I don't I\nI don't think he did that because you know he was very over confident or you know as as we're Democrats or I'm not a Democrat or not I'm I'm a ... a moderate and independent but at the point is everyone thought Hillary was gonna win so\nI'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is well you know from Facebook's own published data that that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifts boats and think about it no one knows if if something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day or they were targeted messages going out to some people but not others and of course isn't what\nTargeted advertising is all about\nShe targeted advertising though it's competitive but I'm Talking about what happens if the platform its shelves\nDoes something that's not competitive as completely invisible and it's not competitive\nSo can I mean this is so dangerous um\nAnd it is I mean it's everything that aside by you know a writer has invasion forever\nUh and I mean can can\nEspecially when we get two artificial intelligence couldn't a system like Google be used to identify unstable individuals and wind them up\n[noise] [noise] Oh yes they can they in fact they know who's an unstable they know who's undecided they know who is Republican and who is gay and you name it they know far more about it\nI mean ... I mean on the table mentally\nYeah yeah yeah oh no you're absolutely right they have\nLiterally unprecedented power or to ...\n... is shifts to people yes shift unstable people's shifts anybody uh and and they know they have this power uh one of the leaks from Google was a a a ... a little internal film their eight minute film called the selfish\nA and a lot of people are talking about block chain and so on but I mean the reality is you know we're talking about Ninety percent of search around the world is done on Google\nUh these two companies are serving right now more than two point five billion people battled the past four billion within the next three years they're just growing and growing and\nGrowing by leaps and bounds so it's concerning what they're doing in China but I mean I mean I don't know how I don't know how they sleep at night\n[noise] [noise] well that's outrageous that is ... so they cause they're actually\nThey're actually partnering with the Chinese government to participate in the Chinese governments are aggressive a program to control all of its citizens and Google is ... ... and that I mean literally making it easier and better\nMaking that kind of system easier and better that's ... that's s outrageous\nDodger I Would I Would love to fly you in and spend a couple of hours with you and and have you on regularly to to be able to monitor and help in any way that we can to get the word out this is this is the thing that I think America and the world\nShould be concentrating on and no one's talking about it the world is being redesigned by a handful\nAnd we're just not aware of it and it's going to change overnight a doctor thank you so much\nI really appreciate absolutely you bet it's been an honor true at our Glenn\nThanks very much Dr Robert ...

talking about for years I mean since since we you know we're working together just the two of us in the nineties and I said someday it's going to be that you won't believe your eyes because they'll be able to create a video of anybody doing anything and you won't be able to believe your eyes\nWhile we're there I've been talking about the coming of AI why did last hour why did that affect you so much um\nCouple of things uh one I think like we all\nThere's a lot of people who claim that that these big tech companies and stuff have biases and I think that there's some evidence that they do um you know but I think a lot of people are motivated by politics when they ... like that and we've seen a lot of I think that's true in a lot of case\nUm you know the fact that Hillary Clinton supporter would do a test of the two thousand sixteen election and find the results that shocking is really a major thing this is a ... you know he went through an actual process here this is not just some guy it's not just some blogger who thinks they've known in all this is like a lot of it as a leader\nIn in in psychology yeah it's I mean he was the head of Psychology Today these are the head of a couple of ah research centers it's Harvard I mean this guy is the real deal with\nSome real credibility again comes from the left part of it because he comes out it kind of from the moderate to as he describes Hillary as voter\nRight right um but beyond that uh ... seems incredibly hopeless\nTo me to stop it I mean just you know because we talk about this all the time how do we move how do we how do we convince people had to persuade people to look at the world and a slightly different way or at least challenge their beliefs you know someone who might be a long term you know left wing voter why wouldn't they consider a conservative approach right\nAh and we talk about that stuff all the time\nBut I Know that I can easily supporter you know a a candidate that I like right like I can vote my principles easily because I just do it right it but it's harder to make other people change with the Google thing I don't know even how in my life I Would be able to an might wind myself from Google I honestly have no idea how I Would do that\nAnd I'm In I'm not even use an Android app me so if you're in an Android which is the largest operating as you know a platform used shocked by how clear he was on that no yeah it was like you're nuts if you're using any of those\nYeah he's like do not use any go Google device yeah not use them I mean he's like it is a what did he say a surveillance\nApparatus only\nYeah ... yeah it's like a designed to just watch you all the time I mean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know and one of the reasons they do is it's the best what right like this is a problem because the the part of the reason why it's the best one\nIs because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right\nUm you know a search engine obviously we all know Google is is the best one chrome is the best browser\nIt is it's better than the other ones I've ever used as it's been a you know I'm ... I mean you know it's you get into deep stuff and you but I don't even know how to unwind myself from the basic there how it would even do it that they mentioned the stuff that you know what you talked about with\nUm certain browsers or use other uh you know at all apple products right use Google\nFor the injured search and it's a you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah we talked about in a lot of every time we talk about this someone will will say hey what about duct duct go duck duck goes a a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principle\nUm and when it comes to the sort of stuff but I was like you know maybe I should start using and I went to go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser crap what the hell is going to make the difference if I'm searching for all this stuff in duct duct go on chrome\nSo now I've got ... I gotta switch emails I gotta switch phones I gotta switch browsers I like my whole life is turned upside down and I can't I Can't come up with enough personal\nCost to what Google is doing right now to justify a life altering move like that what did he say\nThree hundred million word\nYet documentary million ... is like a ... of of\nData on you and that ... million pages and pages of data and again like but I I don't know\nWhat it's a personal cost to me in that data\nWell there's several things there are some things that could turn into I think there are several things that could turn into that are really negative for society he talked about how you could take a fifty fifty proposition\nAnd just by Google suggesting one way or the other can move people to Ninety ten Ninety percent go the way that Google wants them to go that since that's incredible it's a great argument to have real principals right make sure you actually know what you're a ... or what your feelings are on an issue before\nYou are you are influenced like this because we can see how voters do that but I mean the other part of that too is you go to a place with no cookies and no none of these things tracking you well they don't know your preferences and they don't know the things that you like and there are negatives to that it is a real struggle I don't even know how it would do it if I Want it to the problem is not\nToday this is not today it's just\nTechnology is now starting to a compound upon itself exponential growth\nIn ways that we will not be able to understand I mean as the book I write about this in addicted outrage\nAnd you know use it you said when you read the uh chapters on a technology I remember you came in and ... okay well that's a little bleak\nOh yeah but I mean they fail in their right right\nIt's it's it I mean it ... you just heard that from a guy who's been studying Google for ten years and he's a he's a Clinton supporter ... is he saying anything less than I Am saying\nNo I mean I think if anything it back that up and that's that was terrifying because we can all look at the potential future of some sort of series of events that could go negatively and you know you've talked about that you've talked we've discussed openly sometimes you think as a catastrophe pissed right like you think of the worst case scenarios\nBut these are measured results these aren't worst case scenarios\nThe fact that the top ten Google risk a rare search results are returning things favorable to Hillary Clinton is not some wild crazy theory it's something that's already happened in his over where are they now\nWhat are they doing with this now and imagine if they get over more overt we talk about you know Trump pushes a lot of buttons of people you saw how they acted with Kavanaugh\nRight you saw how the left really active ... active crazily towards the Supreme Court justice when they feel so justified\nIn the way they act they get crazier and crazier and crazier and that this stuff escalates they're gonna feel justified to take more overt action and got only knows where that ends up I I I I ... I mean it could go in really bad directions [laughter] this is um uh\nWe we are entering a ten year period now where our lives\nYou really will not recognize your country the world or our lives by twenty thirty you just will not\nIf you when you see the rage on the faces of the leaders of of the left and the Democrats and they're saying we have to get more radical remember you're already talking about a group of people that believe the ends justify the means\nYou're already talking about a group of people and let's make\nOf outage news radio Ninety three point one WFL Ari Mm\nNot smart then I went to the\nThey figured out hiring recruiter did the work for me\nMatching technology scam thousands of residents to identify people with the right skills education and experience for my job and actively invited Ventura five so I go to qualified candidates fast\nThe waist hip recruiters rated number one by employers in the U.S tries to preclude her now for free at ... dot com slash free at ... dot com slash free once against the recruiter dot com slash free zip recruiter\nThe smartest way to hire based on trust pilot rating of hiring side to that were once has reviews\nWorkplace injury downtown five to nine on your cell\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd\nSo the left and the New York times and the media don't seem to really have a problem with this or the left believes they need to become more radical uh and they need to turn things up a notch now\nI don't know how you do that\nI mean now I did recommend\nYou know get teams I guess they could start using ... I Do like the old uh you know gang is ... take the leadership roles women carpets and then just have horses trample them but that might hurt her horse you know in the left would not want to do that you know you I guess you could get a smart car or you know a Chevy Volt\nBut and set on fire and then you'd die screaming or could be a win win there anyway um oh my gosh did you just threaten yeah what are we talking about here\nHow do you turn this up pat how do you turn this off without violence\nBut I think the only ... level up is revolution isn't it that's about the only thing they haven't done so far there screaming and people's faces a they're showing up at restaurants and department stores and everywhere in Mexican waters told them to their homes their clawing at the door of the U.S Supreme Court it's\nThey're threatening online yeah\nThey're they're scaring people they're charging them with with crimes they didn't commit I mean I think we're all pretty sure he's not a gamer gang rape is right now I'm pretty sure he didn't Michael ... yeah I mean you know there were five\nPeople five people only one charge was Ford Ford was one the other for ... they weren't real now why do we say well no woman would do that well I Know you've got four people over here who did ...\nMultiple huge stories of fake accusations of sexual assault that have happened over the past few months so this happens all the time because women are people right people in order to do bad things just like men do bad things\nBig story ah I think it was in California of a high school kid and I was accused by these high school girls they called them demean girls ... yeah it was in the same city where\nAre the movie supposedly took place um and so these girls all got together because they didn't like this guy and decided to accused him of sexual assault he went through all kinds of hell over it\nAnd uh after six months or a year they finally admitted nano we made that up why 'cause we didn't like to listen to him and I like to look at him\n... oh Mm wow amazing so did you hear the credible stuff did you hear make them scared the website make them scared ... does he was from the University of Washington\nA and a a\nIt's a website where you can just um you know put your allegation out about how you been raped or whatever you just include that person's name you know where they are what class cetera et cetera and just we're going to make them scared\nWow yeah my university students on the University of Washington and campus\nUh I mean what what else what else\nI mean this is the world the left is is increasingly embracing mhm legitimizing and calling for and what are those the normal\nCivilized way to escalate a situation when you're not getting what you want right you can do things like you could escalate your language it's hard to escalate past gang rape accusations it's kinda hard to go past that with your language I guess you can go to murder and go to genocide as a couple of other things I guess you could accuse U.S Supreme court justice up to get your way\nUh then you have a like a they already they already say the United states is a genocidal ... I mean there's there's no way you can increase the language against America were men so then you can go to structural or procedural type of things but I mean look what they did here they they pulled out every stop they tried to get\nA they delayed until late and delayed they tried to get an FBI investigation that they said that wasn't enough that were seven at the end he said seven FBI back riding with no\nEvidence and all of these zero thousands and thousands of people show up screaming we believe we we believe the survivor well\nSurvivor of why why I mean until it's confirmed that survivor ran right like I mean at least to us she may if something happened to her and she's telling the truth like having a yes she's a survivor to herself but as a society we have to judge it based on the facts\nRight and I own condemn her I don't wish ill towards her nothing nothing I don't know I wasn't there no but we don't destroy either life there's got\nTo be some evidence against the guy it's not up to him to prove he didn't do it no", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "08"}
