that's not may you live in interesting times is not a Chinese in fact the first place that we can really find it being sad is in the Yorkshire Post that's in England in Nineteen thirty six\nA guy stood up in parliament his name was a sir Austin Chamberlain and he was um uh he was a meeting with union is\nAnd uh he spoke of the grave injury to collective security by Germany's violation of of

have all of us are honest and we really look at our situation we all know we all see the same symptoms we\nAll know that we as a nation or sick were really really sick\nAnd we have we have each of us have and they're each prescribing the opposite medicine\nAnd each of us as patients are also desperate to cure or what is killing us killing our society\n\nThat we will follow these doctors directions because they know better they know better they know more than we do that they've got the answer and we become more and more vested in their cure as our friends and family said that's not the cure\nBecause we're taking this medicine and we believe we just become more vested in our doctor are doctors write yours is wrong\nThat was the same time the doctor is not going to get more humble\nBecause the doctor will know he or she has everything to lose if his or her patients begin to seek another opinion another diagnosis another remedy it's in their best interest to keep patients busy looking at the other side\nSo they're not questioning what he's doing\nAnd while we're all fighting over the cure none of us even if stop to ask if the diagnosis is even correct were just too busy fighting what our doctor said\n\nI don't know about you but I Know you know we're sick I Know you know there's just\nSidey is sick we are sick and we are in pain and and when I Am sick or in pain I'm usually at my worst inner personally I usually am not good at making friends at that point\nI don't think you are either we snap at each other we act as our lesser selves because when I'm sick I'm I hurt\nAnd I am full of despair or I'm fearful\nOr I just don't have the patience and Everytime I'm really sick or in real pain it usually is followed by a time where I have to begin conversations with I'm really so sorry I I was just in really bad pain or I was really sick I was having a really bad day\nAnd I know I'm not alone\nAnd judging by our society today we're having a really very bad most difficult day every day it seems and it gets worse every day\n\nI Want to those doctors to know I Want those\nI don't want those to know that actually do just want to watch the world to burn I Want you to know\nThat it's true\nWe know there are dangers in difficulties\nCrisis that lie ahead of us but don't just assume that we're just going to\nLie down and watch our country burned down\nIt's not\nIn fact many if not most of us who voted for Democrats and those who voted for Republicans\nHave a ton in common and I found in common with those who voted for neither\nWhile the parties and the politicians tried to convince as otherwise and many of us may have believed for a while or even engaged in this warfare it's becoming more and more clear to more and more Americans

to but\nI'm not really critiqued in a way that most people would I'm just quickly go through some of them are\nGoing in through the back door which is not something we are going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out of the violence of object to vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive\nStack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal was inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just said this is this are packed says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nOnce they're determined how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means they\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to the degree privileged classroom learning environment and\nThe problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to ... I think we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign Ames\nAnd they used to watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being comforted and so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what already exist in a great deal of the a feminist and race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah first yeah and then later they were a bit concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly papers they claim for example that we grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter and so on\nBut um but the idea that they're giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over\nHim interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\nWhat if this were\nPublished and they were real if this were published what what would that mean to the university system would would send me and\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm there would be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom he got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting\nIn classrooms and so there would have been some ... some ... uh educators primarily working and social justice\nSize field topics courses I guess that's the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general at stuff that would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to [noise]\nWhat we're seeing in the middle though when these purple districts in the house is moving towards the Democrats are so far on the ah there's a lot of moving in the generic sort of congressional a poll where you see what we know generically what party do you prefer right now there's been a movement about six or seven points\nIn that area towards Democrats so what it looks like right now and again these things can change with large developments obviously we know something like a ... a war were to break out these will change completely uh you know individual scandals can change these things as well but the Republicans look like as of this moment there in really good shape\nTo control the Senate and really bad shape to continue their control of the

care free college\nI'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for an even bigger\nA infrastructure package than what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero he was the only one who publicly supported now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten or ... democratic candidates which by the way it will not be enough to ... to cover the field there's gonna be a lot more than I think\nUh but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and\nIt does endorse Medicare for all\nThe all the big names are for it already there but many of them were cosponsors of the bill uh it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer and now here they are\n... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYeah we were scare mongers in races for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stories will go through this tomorrow but I just I just\nWant to throw these at ya I'm Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college\nYou know that is a fundamental um a a a fundamental aspect of what brought the states together in the first
