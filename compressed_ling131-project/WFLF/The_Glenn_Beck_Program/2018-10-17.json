{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "If Gillum gets draw them this is going to kill even further to the left the Florida Supreme Court is going to make a huge difference which is why this governor's race is so important because the scientists would be inclined I think\nTo a point if not the same justices those or a similar conservative philosophy you'd expect from Rick Scott\nI Want a judge in there will follow the rule of law I don't want them to go with their emotions I don't want them to choose while I feel this way and my wife's like there's no I I Want you to choose based on the law that exists\nAnd a lotta times conservative judges I Try to stay down that line now when we have an issue with this and I and I would hate to see a Gillum put three guys and because he's you know this uh this is a terrible guy out of Tallahassee I mean he shouldn't he shouldn't even be in this race somehow he won the primary I don't get it\nWhile he's better debate or then the rest of the lame field of Democrats went up there he just shiny silver tongue these are great communicate\nThis guy's barely making it in his own setting much less trying to run the whole state of yesterday\nI after amount of corruption probe here and he's way off the scale of ... these are Bernie Sanders candidate\nBut if I had to ask you this I said let's say this guy gets elected governor and let's say you know four years from now he's right about to get booted out\nAnd on the last day he says I'm going to a point three\nOf the other justices you would say now that's not right no you shouldn't be able to do it and that's exactly what happened now this has been done in the past where everyone had an agreement and they chose a judge that was kind of middle of the road and it all worked out this way but this is not the way it was going to happen this was going to be a fire sale at the last minute and you shouldn't do things like that how should\nThe system in Florida be changed you say the way we bought in Florida Supreme Court justices so critically important is among the worst systems in the country how would you change\nYou gotta have hearings you got to have the guy come forward you got to have people say for example right now there was a judge a couple of years ago and this was the most painful thing they wanted a specific type a judge to be sitting there so the Florida bar went out and found two hundred fantastic tourists\nThat covered all the different issues race or ability everything else like that and the judge in charge at the time goes a screw it I'm going to put this guy and completely didn't listen to it and I think at a minimum\nYou should have a hearing on a minimum the here and I think the public should be involved I think people should know who's going to be making these huge decisions for us I mean we elect the county court guy who was in charge of of you know silly a small claims cases but the guy is going to make a decision on who the next president's going to be we're going to let us on Yahoo Go in that job no it doesn't work like that\nIt should write like crazy it seems to me that across party lines people shouldn't want the system changed and yet it is never change nobody\nWant people loved the power that you love the idea that my guy is going to be able to arbitrarily choose whoever they want and no matter what changed people want they love the idea of maybe being able to get that ultimate power and it's a disgusting concept but it's the one we live with right now\nYeah absolutely right I Want you to talk

going to be in the pretty powerful Hispanic caucus so trite but joined it they're like Mm no the nicknames not enough [laughter]\nReally I mean if we go through the intersection analogy of a Beto

out and about we're coming to a city near you and it's going to be a lot of fun it's going to be happening right around election\nTime and we have some uh twenty twenty um you know elections suggestions I'm just I'm just 'cause I'm a helper I'm a helper stew you're a helper and we just want to help the Democratic socialist out\nAh we've got some extra spending maybe that they could consider some slogans necessarily think extra spending as possible or what their support of them had a thing I'm going to do math I don't think they've taken every dime true I yeah I mean\nDifficult to find more to spend arrived at ways to spend them ever ... millions remember the classic documentary or from the Nineteen eighties and would share Richard Pryor was forced to spend thirty million dollars and thirty days\nAnd if he did so successfully from a from a inheritance even received the full inherent it's a three hundred um this is an important moment uh in our culture\nUm but it was difficult because he couldn't take any assets I couldn't buy thirty million dollar car right hit at zero after it's at the end of it and the idea was kind of like the thing we do with your kids were you\nUh you know they don't actually do this but like in the legend of like you have your kids smoked three packs of cigarettes you get sick and never wants to smoke another cigarette right around that kind of make sure you get sick of spending money so you're good with money from then on was the idea in in a documentary\nUm but how did he wind up actually and it's just a spoiler alert for Nineteen eighty three but how did he\nA wind up spending all the money he decided to run a political campaign it was the easiest way to get rid of all of a buddy at ... uh so I think ah you know this is kind of that the aspect where the uh the the Democrats are which is can they figure out another way to spend\nMoney we may even do a little roosters millions or where you come up on stage and you are a democratic socialist [laughter] and you have\nTo spend sixty trillion dollars\nTo do it harder than you think it is harder than giving can you do it\nBut the the socialist already have like can you do it\nVery difficult right it's very difficult to do yeah when you go over that I don't think we're going back dot com slash tours place to go by the way to get to grab your tickets\nBill O'Reilly is coming up in just a few minutes and we have a lot to ah to talk to him about um I I\nI don't know if you've seen this but uh Minnesota's democratic former ah or sorry farmer labor party a vis a vis this weekend to this last weekend said Republicans should be brought to the guillotine on November So\nThat's a that's okay that's that's a that's not as bad a thing you want a targeted districts to take her right right yeah yeah ...\n... ... is I mean you know that's common language people always say that I bring a good team we get ... but those you\nKnow whoever into a gear team\nNow I assume I hate to say this but I assume they're not actually building teens about Republicans and I'm not sure I'm not a hundred I'm not sure it anymore I I think I Do think that the ... you know could be talked into it pretty quick all yeah\nAnd if I probably could be a Roger Williams the congressman pointed this out in an op ed he wrote for the Dallas Morning news talking about how he was a I don't know on a baseball field being shot at 'em and kind of remembers that and and it's maybe not so a positive on this new\nDemocratic um a way of thinking where they're saying ah Eric Holder when Republicans go low we kick them\nI'm Cory Booker says get up in the face of Congress people Maxine Waters a harassed members of the Trump Administration Hillary Clinton we cannot be civil uh all these things are are are maybe a little bit more impactful to someone who was being shot at by a Bernie Sanders volunteer on a baseball field and then watching the skull east almost be\nKilled but what's worse but what's worth those things the guillotine or horse face seriously what's worse wow that's a great I mean one of those things deserves twenty four seven coverage\nAll I Know which

question is what's horse horse face or the Rwandan genocide I'm On the fence on that part of it I'm not sure there are so close right and deserved an equal amount of coverage by the way cars face will

I Know I Know\nThat make her picture here is this the Democratic party\nIs confused now they don't know what to do All right I'm a white Broderick claim that Bill Clinton tried to rape depression never in a million years is going to give that allegation\nAny exposure at all non stop going to happen so you can talk about it I can talk about whatever\nShe had much more I mean she was credible she was okay it's\nJust not gonna happen than not going to get back into it and they didn't report it when it happened\nOr cattle why are they then getting into the Monica Lewinsky thing\nBecause they have to at least acknowledge that Hillary Clinton beyond all rationality is that is putting herself out there in these positions where she asked the\nRe litigate this stuff now the reason she's doing it is she wants to remain relevant so she can run again for president [laughter] no I'm Serious come\nOn come on\nBack I'm I'm really you you know that I'm the most brilliant political analysts in the country now I don't I Am telling you that she wants to run again for president and\nTo you know I Know she wants to run and do you really think she will\nIt depends a lot on Biden it depends a lot on um whether she feels that the field against terror is weak which it is absolutely week but the bigger picture is that the Democratic party doesn't know what to do\nWith Bill and Hillary Clinton they don't know what to do with that All right so Bill Clinton and Hillary going on a road in there and and talk to their\nDevoted supporters this isn't an accident [noise] this is a is a trial I mean to see how many people show up how enthusiastic they are a below say look when I was president we did all this and Hillary was a great a first lady and she did all this and then she was a great senator and she was great secretary of state that's what this is\nIs it ... it up across the country to see how it's going to fly but if you think Hillary Clinton is just going to go away quietly into the night she's not she wants to be president\nAnd she realizes that the Democratic field as it stands now is extremely weak who's going to vote for Elizabeth Warren I mean that a non\nAmerican ... know that rushed her yeah horrible\nCrushed to the Boston Globe thought it was doing a favor by saying oh yeah we actually got a little bit ah blood on average and then the Cherokee Nation the Cherokees themselves given us a knock it off where she's not Cherokee um this is a total Rosen fraud knock it off the chair and ends themselves\nCrazy OK and war and you use that ruse as I say and my message of the day I'm Bill O'Reilly does gone today [noise] use the rose to advance their current and academia so\nAnd this is a woman who think she's going to win an election she's not only in Massachusetts and maybe at Oregon you know these days that she can get in to the Senate but as a national viable candidate no way\nBelow as in the ... the number one political strategist ... uh do you ... how could she come out with this whole thing Elizabeth Warren without having someone on record from the Cherokee Nation to support or I mean I she ...\nShe has her grandmother who once told her when she was three\nThat she had high cheekbones and that's because way way way way back um uh she was a chair or as a mother or you know was a source of all of\nThis but look I'm getting back to to backs a Hillary Clinton scenario um Hillary Clinton is a woman who is a ... oh yeah\nAll right Joe shut didn't fit in to the me too movement obviously she doesn't fit in there because she has her husband\nUm and she doesn't fit in to the far left even though she pander to them all the time because\nHe didn't receive Scully she's\nYeah she's a system\nA Paul what they call in New York She's a Paul so but she she and her husband and I spent um I was at the Yankee game and I talked to Bill Clinton about twenty minutes or so I mentioned to you last time I was on um she and her husband say you know what\nThey may not like us they being the Democratic voters but we're so much better than what it was up there now I mean Michael Bloomberg\nIs going to run for president of the Democratic ticket and you know outside of New York nobody knows who Bloomberg very smart guy by the way stream Lee intelligent alright but he doesn't really have much of a chance but he's got a lot to do that a lot of money and he'll be in there\nBut other than that you tell me if Biden doesn't go and buy and I think it's going to be Ninety eight years old next year\nI'm On an ... an older senior citizen\nI I Will tell you this bill you know who I think is positioning for run and I don't think in twenty twenty ... twenty four I don't think it's going to be Hillary Clinton there will be the first first lady that becomes president I think it could be Michelle Obama\n[noise] maybe I I'm not sure whether Michelle Obama has the drive but certainly she would be formidable and then there's the rock and it's\nThe it's the reverse you know ... they're they\nDon't have the resume I mean the Obama is if you even if you don't like 'em I mean NATO conducted themselves pretty well\nPersians near to the you know I'm not sure you need the uh the resume I mean I heard I heard the rock say you know if I'm going to seriously do this I I you know I've got a I've got actually runs something or can't just be in movies and I I thought to myself I'm not sure that matters really doesn't matter any more\nJobs to smash that but it's certainly a plus for Michelle Obama because she doesn't have any little attachments and and so that you know that's not going to be a diversion so you might be right there I mean I I don't know that well I met her a few times um I Know she was very powerful in the White House\n... extremely powerful and that was kept very quiet and and I think you're right\nYou might you know this was in her time the next time around you don't want to go up against Trump or are they just want to do that put into twenty four absolutely she could uh if she wanted it I think the Democratic party would rally around her\nYeah All right when we come back I Want to talk to about ... ... and what

interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates stays locked\nThat's the blueprint right okay so here's the story I used to work in Portland, Oregon I worked a channel to there and a beautiful place beautiful state\nBut mold DOMA county where Portland is located a is a far left hip replaced and hasn't been that for many many years where they are permissive\nUh they want the father's left politicians they can get and they have it so now he had a guy will or the mayor the town Rosa police bureau that's what they call it there\nAre basically says I'm not going to force the law not going to do it and that poor woman uh is going to be a salted verbally and not allowed to walk where she wants and that's okay with me mayor Ted Wheeler that's fine\nAnd I'm going to tell my officers don't help that women don't interfere there\nAnd also I'm going to lead antifa a surround the ice headquarters\nAnd I'm going to let them do pretty much whatever they want to do including fighting on the street using masks over their faces carrying weapons they can do whatever they want to do\nNow this is America you would think the people Portland, Oregon would rise up right that they would go out in the rose city which signs condemning the mayor and antifa and mass tens of thousands of them\nThey gather by that while I'm at river with their signs this is not the city we want you got anybody out there doing that nobody so this is the problem the problem is that wheeler the problem is that in ... the problem is the people in Portland, Oregon\nAnd that's why I wrote killing the ss 'cause I'm saying we better wake up here in America we better wake up and confront evil antifa is evil\nSo I get my ... I think you did and I've got a lot to ask you about on this but let me let me start with this\n[noise] [noise] why do you suppose that there isn't a an uprising or in Portland or they are the\nBlind to it for some reason or do they actually supported are they afraid to come out what is the what's the real readership\nAnd they ended in Montgomery County so\nIf I were still working on channel two I'd be doing commentaries going okay I'm going to be out uh on the banks of the ... wherever I'm going to be there at the turn in the morning on a Saturday I Want y'all come out and support\nWhat I'm doing okay nobody's going to do that there's nobody in town going to do that with any visibility it'll it'll be two um unfortunately\nBecause there are many many many good people in Portland in ... county and I have friends there most people are selfish\nAll right they're into their own pursuits they're doing whatever they want to do and you know what this is the New Orleans but I don't really want to spend time on this and then maybe that a lot like me\nAnd maybe people hit me or I'm not going to do it\nIt's a selfish thing and it's not just in Portland, Oregon I\nMean we have to really as as a people we really have to start to rise up and say hey you know what we want to process we want a presumption of innocence we don't want subs on the streets and mass beating people up and telling women that there has been should rotten a grave it we don't want that\nOkay so important when do we have any democratic 'cause it's all Democrats a hundred percent got any politicians ... the governor of Oregon doing anything about this saying anything about it and oh no no no ... and that's how far we've come that's how far we've declined\nSo bill I Want to talk to you a little bit more about this and just one thing on and when you say we've got to stand up and fight this I'd like to hear your opinion on on what exactly that means a but also when we come back I Want to take you to Saudi Arabia\nThings have gotten even more bizarre and now now now they're saying that the ... was alive and aware as they were\nDismembered ring him a it is just an amazing story I'd love to hear your take on it and also if you were the president or advising the president what would you do when we come back [noise]\nAmerica's first news when Gordon Deal every day five 'til six AM news radio Ninety three point one\nYou're listening to climb down combat\nBill the frustration is growing in America the press is excusing or antifa they are excusing everything the Democrats are saying uh than other Democrat up in ah Minnesota came out over the weekend and said it's time to bring the gear teams out for the Republicans\nI'm I mean it's it's it's remarkable what is being said and dismissed when there is actual violence on the streets you um you said in a minute ago you know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\nWhy do it peacefully number one and I think that uh various ah people have to say you know let's get a little group together and um maybe we'd go out and and stand in the park with some signs saying whatever\nOr maybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper ah with five hundred signatures are attached to it so the Oregonian for example a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have\nUm some space for not bad we have a community group and this is the way we feel about it\nThere are things you can do to be visible in your local community it doesn't have to be a big national thing because that's almost ... but I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in America which is you know what killing the show is really essentially about and and a lot of people still want to look away at it\nThey they don't want to engage\nAnd um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive\nThe most ... elements in our society the pressure sympathizes with all of them\nThey sympathize with open borders they sympathize with legalized narcotics they sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes and there's the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive causes\nSo ... that's a big difference we didn't have that what was it a left wing press but we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's what we have now\nLet me let me ask you this um\n... uh I beg to differ with you on the on the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties those some of them we don't have it that we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say you know some group with standing in the community uh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... for justice and non violence or whatever right\nUm and they followed the king um the rules where you just never swing back\nAh that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties the press played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody else\nWill take a cell phone video and throw it out there\nJust would hand into that and over the weekend is that in ... he grew up\nDoing that would have to hire security\nThey'd have to hire people to protect them um you can do this it just takes it takes leadership it takes organization but but on the press thing look let's let's segue into Saudi Arabia now because the press is\nActively trying to go you saw it on sixty minutes solidly stole tried to do with\nTrump into basically dismissing Saudi Arabia alright well ... they want to not trade with them they want to crush that nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad okay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad\nBut Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran and the middle east it's the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt it runs terrorism\nAnd destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading that charge so why on earth is the American laugh wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we allied or so which style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good\nBut the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that and then not trade with them the sanction them boycott them all that and then you turn around and go the unintended consequence of that\nI when it comes to something big like the grapes and stuff I just I that's one step that I I just I'm like I don't I don't know I don't know yeah the\n... you can take pictures and send them to them and they they'll actually look at them and help you design yeah and there do you\nThink would look good right and then they'll put the drapes in the picture and you had any like okay that's great that with the blinds and they'll show you and when you see it it's it's totally different\nI mean it really if you don't have the imagination or the ... to do that which most people don't\nThey'll do it in a free right now you can order through October thirtieth and

I think actually we should start a team of some sort and we should come up with a Native American name ourselves really yeah yeah I'm a you know people seem to be going the other way that they're all yeah\nAnd I do think it's about time that we go the other way [laughter] I think it's about ... I had enough\nOf it so I you know\nYou have a if you have a name a for something you know that we started baseball team or you know something you know just\nInside the blaze with that'd be cool you can send us the the team name and the mascot and we'll get together and have a mowing about it and see what we can do\nYou lose your smart speaker to say\nThe most grotesque terrible thing you can do this why why were all these people executed in these people were executed because they were leaving the caliphate these were people who had been wet and do are more than likely the full three years of the ISIS occupation in Mosul and they were done they wanted to leave they wanted to get out of there\nBecause as the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS\nYou know supplies and food and water we're becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so living behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul would absolutely health for these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nThese people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacred I think that there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by ISIS\nHounded um ... the ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of society is that true [noise]\nWe we did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there um and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground\nYou know and and it's it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWe were seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens\nAnd things like that ... and the reason for that is good they they have no choice but to fight and die they can't assimilate back into decided they can't run away because they you know they looked like me are white guys read beard and ... and they can't they can't get away so those guys\nHad to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care and so\nYeah so you went from that um to say and I I've got to do\nI've got to keep doing this ... um and that brought you to\nBurma mhm right yes and now you're working with an as rain fun yes in Burma yes and last week talk you were the only one in Burma and you started telling us about what was really happening ... and you have an update\nFor us yes absolutely so ah also to clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from than as arraigned fund\nFor getting out of the early ... you were telling me that you were trying to organize a mattress people yes and you were going to bring them all\nTogether slowly and I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago and met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border\nAnd they they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to how the ... marine funds help okay now this is a group of Christians yes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist because all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe\n'em and they are all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning and at the end and it's it's it's really really good thing\n[noise] and so I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in there or done several trips with the ... fund in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to how this because\nWhen I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the um civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with the ...\nAnd then the the Burma Army moved all those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people alive so\nWhy why are they doing this why are they doing this to these\nTribes [noise] it's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic burns who control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma they want to control all the high lands they want to control the entire\nRegion and so if you're a different ethnicity you can ... they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject a surf class you have to basically serve departments and also\nThe for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus they don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just as a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because where there's ... there's liberty right and these and so because of that\nThe Burma Army attacked them even more tell me what you wrote me so I brought ths abroad with me several photos as I got to have somebody I'm over his mercy just pass their apologize and things are getting so I brought with me [noise] several photos\nOf\nOf what I see all the time when I go to these places [noise]\nAnd these are ... I bought I brought with me photos [noise] sorry\n[noise] of of one particular um attack that happened um this is actually only from this is from two thousand ten writes it seems like a long time ago but this is these are the only photos that they were able to get out to me I was asking you handy photos of what's happening and what's going on and in these photos you see\nDead civilians you see kids dead a baby and these are not accidental collateral damage is their intentional executions of these people\nThese are some of these are it's that's a that's a baby that's a baby\nIntentionally and killed and that baby didn't die right away\nI'd survived for about twenty four hours and then died and this just looks like it's in the woods yeah they're out in the jungle these people have nothing and ... still wants to attack them and take more from them and so every time I go there every time the ... shows up\nWe're stopping that from happening and I'll I'll tell you I'll tell you a quick story back in back in may I was there and I can't I Can't divulge exactly what we were exactly the artist for security operations exactly what was happening\nSuffice it to say we save a lot of people's lives\nAnd a villager who had been pushed out of his home by the army him and his family had fled the army and they and they had built they built a a a new hot out in the ... out in the jungle in the middle of nowhere um\nHe he heard that than as rain fun was there and he came and found me and said hey I Want to I Want to I Want to thank you please come to my house for dinner tonight so they gave me on a motorcycle and I drive at this man's house in the middle of nowhere\nWhen I get in there his wife is cooking pigs that for me to eat because that's the big fat and rice and ... and ... leaves and so we're sitting there and he's like hey I I when I was like I Wish I had more to give you a he's like this is all I have for a snack and he pulls out a bag and it's literally tree bark\nBark from a tree and he's like this is all we have a snack on while my wife prepares food and he gave me tree bark to eat I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark with this guy and he has nothing is literally nothing and he wanted to give me ...\nBecause that was the best that he had and so I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark but this man and\nI I was I was so overcome was just like in his gratitude is the level of gratitude he showed for us for that for the ... being there it was it was unbelievable it was so touching and then later on as I was leaving as I was leaving the jungle another man barely speak any English\nUm he's um I'm On a motorcycle he is driving me out of the jungle and he ... he as he's driving he turns me he says thank you and I said oh like oh good English uh what I'm trying to him and talk more about um\nLiving rent free inside someone else's head I mean is so on display with CNN right now they\nCan't talk about anything else even when they're talking about other things\nSaudi Arabia Trump Saudi Arabia now Saudi Arabia he's in trouble you know ... does Trump have ties to Saudi Arabia he's talked about his ties to Saudi Arabia\nI don't think they caught somebody up alive alive they portrayed him alive caught him up and\nPut them in a suitcase and you're looking for a way an angle to get Trump\nWhat is wrong with you people as wrong with\nThe is like legitimately like a sickness for some of them I thought everybody on CNN but I mean it is it as a network\nAs a whole they can't\nFigure out a way to discuss any other topic is really incredible I mean he really doesn't dominate to their lives every aspect or at least is at least they're public life I don't know maybe they go home and don't talk about it I don't know but when they're on TV they're talking about it all the time it's like there's got to be something else interesting in the world there's got to be\nWell just looked at the headline and Fox they're talking about Elizabeth Warren and you know are Cherokee heritage\nReally\nMy again like all of these stories like the Elizabeth Warren thing is is interesting because you can be running for president it's a day or two story um I think it's at this point I'm I'm done with it but it was interesting to see her I mean real flop here we're talking about when the all time political flops yes she's tried\nTo come out and get ahead of this or again it is a ... it's an important political story for somebody who is going to run for president too but really with Saudi Arabia [noise]\nGoing on right now with that and what that possibly means should we take a pause and we'll get some of the stock market anybody know why yeah and I and he but he talked about that\nGround zero glide Louis we Nineteen ten news radio Ninety three point one\nLove the program so glad that you are here um we're going on tour here soon and we would love to see you grab your tickets now to Glenn Beck dot com tour were coming to a theater near you it's Richmond Hershey Pittsburgh Cleveland Kansas City\nUh Tulsa Tampa Orlando and other cities around you make sure that you grab your tickets or you can do to Glenn Beck dot com slash tour or we're going to see if you can spend as much\nAs a democratic socialist\nA game show that I don't think you can win no I think we all lose in the end and you know the sad part of the sometimes do Democrats can be very positive for Republicans sometimes democratic candidates are big wins for Republican really\nAnd we're seeing a case of this here it appears in Texas where Beto O'Rourke or Robert Francis or you know as his parents wanted him to be known 'em\nIs going by as he used to call themselves going right when it was cool when it when it's beneficial to be called Bobby called themself Bob yeah now he calls himself that's all right so Beto is running here in Texas and if you don't have a new haven't seen that you haven't been watching\nA any national media as far as not just politics I'm playing outside of that Ellen and coal bare hands free where CNN town hall coming up tonight just him um again it's bizarre the reason why it's helpful for a Republican is\nBeto O'Rourke has drained the Democratic donor base out of thirty eight million dollars\nAnd go and I would have gone to close races and you know it all seems like Cruz is a winning here and winning by significant margin though we don't we obviously we still have a few weeks ago we noticed could change but\nWell they could produce the pictures of his father actually pulling the trigger on JFK and that may need to be actually may need that yeah well they might have never know they might\nUm they're talking now about a a fifty to forty three margin is the so seven point or sees me fifty two forty five is the\nIs the margin now with cruise leading by seven points to visit from by the way the same company that is hosting the town hall with better tonight CNN their poll thinks you forty five\nI think he wins by twelve and maybe as high as a team I mean that would\nBe a real surprise uh no it would be but you know that's when I mean is what really what happened last time Ted Cruz ran but I mean the polls are are hard in Texas I I don't necessarily believe believe the polls here in Texas\nYou know it'd be great if he won it'd be won by three but I I just think that there is this something\nThat ah you know when you get when you when you get right down to it Texans are going to say yeah I think Ted Ted Cruz I tend to\nThink he's going to win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think they think tens possible though I mean nine or ten is definitely possible um interesting in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for governor here and this\nIs winning by a much larger margin a usually is there I don't have the one in right in front of me but it's it's over twenty points every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here it is yeah I Know there's so much he's up uh eight Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were avid is up by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results of\nThe St Paul is it the same people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of\nWhere people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for\nA great guy but that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um ... you think of this bright red country right in Texas ... however are the poll shows that fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance in forty one percent approve\nThat gets closer among likely voters words or forty nine forty eight\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas at it this way try this on for size\nAh a Donald\nTrump is everywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like ... was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh it luckily not talking about today and I don't want to talk about the ...\nYou know so she is such a
