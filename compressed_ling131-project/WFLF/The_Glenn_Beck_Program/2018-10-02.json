October or going back program [noise] All right\nSo [noise] I'm going to do [noise]\nI'm a little disturbed but [noise] I I Know I Know ah the ah the goalposts man they just they just keep moving I'm [laughter] I mean they must be tired but I think\nIt's their with their heavy the goalposts are getting heavier than having having because there's a lot of the farther you move the harder it is to justify or is it this is incredible um uh though I Am very disturbed course by these new allegations against Brett Brett Kavanaugh that he ... through frozen water at someone\nPrism on her first of all or can it can be heavy um you know what it means people are like oh it's not a big deal so what do you through ice frozen water can be dangerous tell that to the people of Peru were twenty two thousand people were killed in an avalanche in Nineteen Seventy to those people that I'd like to\nSee this is why he's done on the Supreme Court look at look at his temperament you don't have the temperament to be anywhere near that microphone\nMr ... I Do have the um the temperament to be on the ... a team however all you know ... I can jump right into that role oh you're dead dogs have that\nThey spent clean seas teen minutes on this bar fight on CNN this morning Fifteen minutes where they talked about how they look it's it's certainly on its own this is their fairness on its own it would not be disqualifying\nOh really is a bar fight in which he's not charged or arrested with anything and his the accusation is he threw ice on someone wouldn't disqualify him forty years later for the Supreme Court said for all the wonderful ah the room you're giving him what leeway but here's the situation where they're just like\nWell what it what it does say when it does is it plays into a larger picture of this man he was in his anger\nWhen he was drinking and this shows the he's capable of doing these things so if I Know what I mean anyone reached further\nI Know if he would have come on and he would not have been angry\nI would've thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to me my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges and smear my name without me at least responding forcefully and then if you don't like the anger\nI Want you to hear me clearly\nI did not have sexual relations with that well aimed thing yeah he looked and they praised him for being angry about it they praised him for his forceful as\nYou can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the American people\nSo no matter what he did it would have been a problem\n[noise] they keep\nMoving the goalposts now here is here's my levy Donald Trump\nFirst of all\nI don't believe any other president in my lifetime was an exception of Reagan and I'm not even sure Reagan would have done it\nNo other president in my lifetime would have stuck stuck with Kavanaugh all the way through those hearings\nThere's no way they would have said the cost is too high they just wouldn't have done it so hey points for Donald Trump for having\nUs fine and go and this is garbage\n[noise] be\n\nWe're in this situation now and if there is nothing if there's ice fights\nDon't give up the ship do not move because if you move now they're going to do this every single time and you cannot cannot give any ground\nWith that being said and I don't think this is a chance at all if Ford\nIs those those charges turned out to be right you noticed you notice the media is not furthering the Ford and testimony\nThey're no longer on that yeah nobody in like she's been abandoned already right she's done she's done she served her purpose she bought time they used her as a pivot to something new\nOkay so there there there's nothing new there there is nothing new or the press would be saying well you you watch what's going to come out this FBI there they're not saying that they're not nobody has come out and said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was\nAnd I wasn't going to say anything but I Know that that happened\nNone of that is happening\nWhat is happening is people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything but in [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\nI remember him drinking so that's what's coming now and they're going to go after perjury\nYou watch that it by the end of the week that's what they will be talking about\n\nIf Donald Trump please please Donald Trump meat only chance you have and the only chance the Republicans have if this thing goes awry in any way\nYou have to have a plan and announce it in the same press conference that you say you know he he\nYou know quit or vote went downhill went down in ... down whatever it is whatever it is whatever it is that press conference you must say and here's my next nominee and we're going to have it done before the election\nNow the only in my opinion the only one that can stand that is likely because you don't need how long did they do take the due to the ... sessions\nOf ah ah I mean he was he brought in January ... he was inaugurated and then a February eighty was the vote went down so let it for weeks and three or four weeks for an hour we could have probably could have fast read other things going on um case so you have four weeks to do it\nIt's what you have now for the election you have four weeks the one who can get that the the one who doesn't need all the FBI checks and all of that is likely it's already been done he's the only under get done that quickly yeah he's the only one that can be done that quickly or another senator but Mike Lee is the guy and Michael is the only senator on the list\nTs so so you've got you've got Michaeline you could select him let's just say Brett Kavanaugh's hit by a plane tomorrow which I wouldn't\nChange accident but it could happen and it happened in Indiana Jones a and and and ... one of them are the guy who they were fighting on the ...\nYeah I mean was turning on if that happens to Kevin well this one they won't be delivering the arc in that plane they'll be delivering a the New York times are playing but anyway so let's just say\nAnd it makes them into sausage ...\nUh you need to announce that Mike Lee is the candidate we're

in in commerce\nAnnie and in just the individual lives of Americans and how important it was and how that is in our DNA and that's why we talk about guns the way we do so because I grew up in New York and country sort of alien to my\nYou know neighborhood and place I grew up in West criminals had them or I thought it was important to try to figure out what that was about and ah you know that's what the books about\nWhile still so how did you I mean what did you find I I didn't know that you were you know not part of the gun culture I grew up in the gun culture if you will my grandfather my

for Thursday I'd like to hear from you Thursday on radio and we'll take calls on Thursday ... a ... just about the book\nYou know given people enough time to actually read it which is nice yeah I think you wanted to do this like the day after it came I did not everybody reads that fast so [laughter] so it's been out for a week now and if you've read it or let's talk about it on because there's all there's a ton a ton in there\nWell I I think it explains so much about what we're seeing with a capital case right now I think it's\nI think it's absolutely in line with the cat was like well it's amazing because I think a lot of people if you're trying to look at it and you're and you're just playing teams a lot of people would just be like the Democrats are the worst and they're insane but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats\nAnd they sound completely insane about this happen often yeah completely off the rocker these are people that I Know people who I'm friendly with\nAnd the extent that they'll go to here to try to take all male crime in in the last twenty five years and apply it to this one guy where there's no evidence that he committed any sort of crime\nAnd that sort of jump is not ... not just hey they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade\nThere is a different part of this it's about throwing\nThe entire um the entire effort of logic off base it's based in post modernism huh it's explained in the book and you'll see the times I look at it sound like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things just to make any sense and it's easy political explanations for all that but it's not real\nThe real basics of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nMean it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book because I think it is the perfect example maybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories in the book and just show exactly\nWhy everything is happening point by point yeah uh you can find it in the book addicted outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting and why you must not fight that way\nA and the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels uh and the the upper echelons of politics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe\nWhat they're saying they're doing it because they have a goal and their goal is to disrupt the hierarchy and the patriarchy\nAnd to collapse the system that we have\nYeah and if you've ever had someone who has an addiction problem in your life ... or ... you see them acting or radically and there's some reason and you don't understand why would they do this they blow their job why they did is they blew their marriage all those things why would the left act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just how how and why this is going on but how to push back against that and how to defeat it\nYeah it is not a a it's not a book about surrender it is a book about stand and fight just fight to the right way\nJust know who your enemy is the tactics that they're using and fight the right way it's called addicted to outrage we'll talk about it on

okay the expansion of the FBI background check on Capitol which ...\nI'm so we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned although yeah we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist\nOh thank you that's up in the area important it's so important is very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold a rule that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr or or or um uh\nAttorney general general attorney general and ready to go one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's cause for certain candidates or who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nA by a woman or he was dating now there is an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this as a separation between the capital case in the aisles the case of the cabinet case happens ah thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but I saw in different bug a professor Ford\nShe had a spotty memory issued a very spotty memory\nNow the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even than that there was a relationship of any sort between ... and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that really got both of those little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay and so does\nShe ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of\nCourse well yeah well in their words case they both have a notes from their donor who around those cases yeah the the Ford case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which he referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now and never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison teeth Allison's I'm a former girlfriend a doctor new name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice this slight distinction between those two things\nOne has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you\nThey'll using meeting me yeah and she and you know and in one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident and has photos of bruising ... on her the other one of course does not um being forward she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with the of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening then people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nOr the dolphins a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down\nUm including things like tax I'm writing um the pictures and are those are things that she showed two co workers\nIn real time real time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve\nWhere it does not appear she actually he had to Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at that time yeah but ... and I mean you\nI mean you don't have video tape ... tape now we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the\nWith the bail us with a friend and we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a a ton of evidence in fact I don't know\nHundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the forties so we as I Am out more we have a preponderance of evidence in in the Alison case do however", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "02"}
