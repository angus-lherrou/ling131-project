this may seem in the weeds but if the Judiciary Committee and I I Believe ... may do this I Hope so he could hall\nMonitor Monica ... uh and uh others in affords camp in front of the committee\nAnd he could bring back for it and say you lied to us about the lie detector test if that happens for it could be prosecuted\nNow I don't think it will I think it should it should should to here's here's the anybody\nCapital allied or for allied anybody they should be held to account\nYeah here's here's the thing I don't care if it is mark judge or if it is a professor Ford right you lied yeah ... to go to jail right that this this is too serious this tour the country apart and a little what\nIf this was coordinated if it and I mean Chuck Schumer is well if Chuck Schumer lead to this\nHe should also stand some sort of penalty but anybody who was involved you know there was one guy who or what was it su he came out and he said oh I Know I have this evidence I saw this happening and as soon as he I'm Sorry to ask do he's been drinking this morning bill [laughter] wouldn't believe\nThe IRA yeah [laughter]\nOh you have him arrested Yeah Bill I like to be drunk for all of your interviews with us okay the rights to land is a\nBetter state for you because you can't understand them sober\n[laughter] that's true that's fair so I'm a ... there's there's one guy who came out and level the accusations and then immediately retracted them and admitted that he was lying everyone likes to focus on four but there's been five accusers\nYeah yeah this was the Newport Harbor guy yes but look when you get when you get into a situation um and and this goes right back to the need to think here we're talking about did you see a ... yes this week a day\nIt doesn't matter if individual men get crushed\nIt doesn't matter because women have been abused for so many years and I have no sympathy for men innocent men who get crushed I mean or insurance in that zone and we've discussed this before your interest\nAllen is you are no we don't care you know if some guy didn't do something like ... whoever it may be and and and you get it and your career and family and everything else was destroyed you know that's the price you got to pay because of the past injustices a against women but that is that now\nThat is the ... bill that's the combination\nOf post modernism and social justice social justice now is the vehicle for post modernism and the idea is it doesn't matter if she was telling the truth because others have been in her situation doesn't matter if he did it because others have been in his situation\nIt what matters is is communal justice\n[laughter] that it it is that other people are talking about in the media will never report on is it the same\nPeople that organized a sponsor boycott against me when I was on Fox News are now paying people to go to the capital to scream and yell at senators about cabin on the same outfits\nAre doing it move on leaves the league right they've got the mailing\nList they've got all the information I mean I'm sitting there going\nDeja vu yeah\nSame people so now in addition to insanity like Alissa mulatto individual insanity then you have an organized coordinated effort with tens of millions of dollars courtesy of George Soros and others okay\nOr organizing sending people paying people to go in and disrupt sometimes physically\nThe process and Americans are basically in a dark they don't know what's happening back because this report it\nWill I Will tell you I listen to that stupid New York times podcast and listen to it every day just to hear what\nYou know what spin they're putting on it\nUh and it it it was a it might it made my eyes bleed today I couldn't take the hypocrisy\nA ... but one of the things that we're talking about is you know I'm really concerned because things in the capital are becoming very scary they're very scary for reporters and for you know for the senators and and things are getting out of control the dude you know\nFor X chair ex chair comes with a thirty day no questions asked guarantee just go to ... back dot com use the promos go back to be easy K. and get a free

through or killing the ss what's the only wanted to get drunk first yeah now that's how this works [laughter]\nThat they will come at what does it come out though is that a Tuesday or a really good at\nWorst war criminals and history Tuesday advance a\nAnd a books already sold Seventy five thousand in advance a sales\nAnd you'll have that and you only have Seventy one thousand in the trunk of your car which is not yeah I Know a\nTen you know the gas is going up it's really\nYou know it's actually a really good book bill ... four minutes or to the vote senator Collins has just voted yes on the advancement she said will announce her final decision at three PM ... again\nI mean because everyone thinks this vote is going to be consistent with the vote that would happen this weekend or are we really thinking that she's going to change this\nThem no no no show for it all the Republicans\nWill vote for a cabinet because if they don't they're out of the Republican Party\nWell not only cuts it like and he's already out of it you know he's leaving easily that's\nTrue but I don't think flake wants to go out on that note remember flake wants to get a job as a lobbyist she wants to go around and give speeches maybe write a book if he's got the machine against him that's going to hurt him in retirement as far\nAs they're good burnings are concerned you know where he is still\nI Want to ask you honestly Danes is if for Montana's leaving to go to his daughter's wedding and I was ... there's this is really important vote and who knows what happened in twelve hours even\nIf something goes wrong but I thought that my daughter and I was like you know what I I Would totally leave oh I Will be my daughters I leave my daughter's wedding none of the right choice yes\nYeah I mean I'm I'm I don't know why they can't work out something on that um you know there are ways\nTo vote 'em but I you look you know if your daughter's getting married daughters get married um maybe they could move the ceremony later and they could but I don't know I don't know but you're right you gotta you gotta family first\nAnd there's no reason why these guys have to be there why are we using Seventeen hundreds technology out of the euro some reason he could be on a phone\nHigh right right and they could make an exception I think but you're right okay what else\nI'm All right we'll she's believe me I Know on that I thought were going that says if you want me to give you so now we got to\nGive us two minutes on on killing the ss\nI look at the book is about evil and and my contention is that most Americans don't understand evil my mother didn't she lived a very I I\nRead your life yeah she's on me which is obviously but she loved me and thought I was good so they didn't understand evil right right\nSo we're seeing so much evil in America are we not um you know people walking into schools and gunning down kids uh clerics abusing children um Chicago where thousands of people are shot by drug gangs and nothing's done opioid epidemic through the roof\nThis is all evil it centered on evil\nAnd so I wrote it says with an eye on explaining to the reader that these concentration camp guards and the people who kill babies and gassed innocent people were farmers merchants and and bankers they were in anything trained to do this they weren't as Saxons\nThey were regular people and once the war started they put on the black uniform with the debt said insignia and went into the most horrible things that history has ever seen\nThe book is better than his explanation or\nYou can get them done Tuesday\nRush Limbaugh we ... knew until three on news radio Ninety three point one\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAll right we have a Bill O'Reilly we have Mitch McConnell still ... can we keep him in the background just a little bit\nOf a post oh attract just take\nThe vote ... yeah I've been a long freaking Iran yeah I mean who wants to believe this vote apparently Mitch McConnell now\nUh just about I agree but this is the first time I've ever seen McConnell have holes in it you know this was about as as crazy as Mitch McConnell get\nForeign hatch behind him sleeping I'm not kidding on as I say um yeah he is leaving\nNow but he's now he's the he's doing his mantra he just looked up\nI mean you ... it might have been he might have been praying auction a guy or an hour and ... is I Want to go home yeah\nBylines bully\nOrrin Hatch in a really funny uh uh and now for a nation where they\nProtest or in the elevator and does all they did you see that bill yeah I thought yeah I mean like you know and it's interesting to see on the poll how the protesters didn't care you already said they were looking for running an opportunity to yell at him they'd had nothing to do with with the kind of what he said\nWell the more you yell louder you are the more you get paid there is a scale of of yelling and if you reach a crescendo you get more money for move on\nHey let me let me ask you this and we're ... on by the way created to move on from sexual assault allegation ought to remember that that was Bill Clinton move on from the Monica Lewinsky thing Italy yeah it's an amazing still around at this point in the me too movement right bill me\nWell what about cats are the main lawyer for Christine toward she's she uh exonerated Al Franken it come on and he's a comedian and I'm\nFrom ... everybody any buddy rule of law anybody and honoring the Amish knows what this is an knows what's going on that very\nSame standard it'll do you think this will play out this way at the voting booth you think there are whom do you think there are I think Democrats Democrats not talking political players I'm Talking about regular Democrats who are seen this now and go and you know I was for you know for it and I wanted a fair thing but this is ridiculous\nThey're asking for people to um\nBasically changed their opinions that's very rare all scientific studies on politics show that people loads to\nChange their opinion they don't like to admit they were wrong in twenty two alright it's just human nature but what is going to do is give the Republicans I'm a real long point one two\nPunch with the economy the economy and then you have this corruption on the other side that I Would frame it\nAll right hang on we're getting ready to take the vote let's just listen just in for just a second wave question is is it the census\nThe Senate that debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court shall be brought to close\nThe ... the nays are mandatory under the rule the clerk will call the roam\nAround and oh my God how\n...\nBennett finished you Mr Blumenthal [noise]\nYour book or\nNotice they didn't say so we used to be around yeah\nWith Cantwell the\nCandle man in American history is this a pivot point just record what does this mean the bill for history district case either direction\n[noise] the cat um\nI don't know yet I mean I Can't speculate on that I can just I Know I'm pretty good at at a value aiding the mood of the country\nThey may remember that five days before the election two thousand sixteen I predicted Trump would win and I predict it because people didn't like Hillary Clinton would stay home I mean that was my best that I ever did in ...\nRight now I Am feeling it everywhere I go I Know a lot of people and I'm Around okay that the regular folks know this was a sham jak were and they know the cabin on his family were damaged very badly by people who didn't care to see the truth they know that\nThat I think will play out at all politics but you got to remember is a powerful powerful corrupt lobby that is driving me to thing and the media is like\nIsolates her and puts her as a poli a word of the day poli\nA and the Republican Party and came that\nThat's an amazing situation I didn't think because he was put her entire career risk ... over this early she as\nShe could vote yes demar\nHow how though if she's voting not to advance the nomination to the floor\nWill now she voted yes I Want to confirm it\nBecause I didn't think that it should go forward but now it's gone forward and so now I'm going to because a lot of people are calling my office and I'm afraid I'm afraid for my career I Do I Am going to vote yes\nMaybe but a a that's a pretty tough line um\nYeah I don't think he's going to do it but it is interesting point him in that one of the most shocking vote\nResults of that I can remember my entire lifetime was Lisa Murkowski beating Joe Miller on a write in ballots are in that Senate campaign in several years ago does Alaska reward Murkowski after this with another election I mean I I don't think so I think so\nThey are very independent they are

dad's a pastor I was home schooled one of eight kids can probably guess\nMedically where we fall there either I still like I don't but like if you if you're let's say if somebody's like John write a joke about smoking pot yeah I don't know\nOf that world so it's not going to be the the\nInstead of my knowledge is really like smoke pot and then went to Taco Bell like that's all I\nI Know the ... eighty thousand foot view of that life but even talking about like Christian culture growing up in church just south of sports like these are kind of area where I live like\nRight after this bit of this was like a lady that has a Bible verse for every type of situation and people are like how did you memorize all those versus like\nThat in my head that's just I I've lived that life which is in my head I run them memorized ... so you're going to be a great comic you stick to what and you know a lot of people say you should like when I went I Lived in Hollywood for four or five years and they were like hey you need to get rid of this like Christian\nAngles because it doesn't appeal to everybody\nReally you're ... you cannot get tickets to any of your show\nYeah well I apparently somebody's coming down right yeah\nBut I don't think it's you don't think like you in today they're so used to be when like Johnny Carson could put you on the Tonight Show and you could be famous forever and that would make your career if he invited me over to the couch as it can mean yeah you're Shandling was is that right now I mean you could do or\nThe United states for the rest of your life and now

I was at a in Cleveland the there's the theater right across the county club and it was sold out there's a line around the block and I go who\nWho's performing you would think like the Beatles yes I Want to like some kid I never heard of yeah no it's it's it's amazing to me that's I ... I was amazed me where you don't have to just go see\nIt in comedy is very subjective so you could love someone it'd be like Glenn check this guy out and you could be like not for me yeah right yeah because comedy is very ... subject you can't tell them and you can tell him it's not funny right what this guy's funny to me yeah so that's that's what I've what I've experienced the harvest if\nSo uh you know one of the things that when I when I uh\nWas I feel like do they tell you the he looked like somebody\nYou don't want to do they do know that you know how bad it is somewhere colonel Sanders is like I I look like Glenn Beck I Know he's [laughter]\nThat was going to go into a different direction I don't know if\nYou heard this bill like the look like Dave Ramsey with hair [laughter]\nDavid actually really good looking man [laughter]\nAll right this is making me a little uncomfortable I might have a new world better than us [laughter] I go to ... that has now this isn't helping because those three I'm going into what's going on what I propose to my wife yeah she said no and uh and these new Dell\n... ... what year was a isn't the nineties okay yeah okay [laughter] they're rational respond to write the nineteenth alright yeah I'm just trying to get an ... out here you have those\nSo she said no and she said the reason why is because we don't have God in common and I said I'm you know I I Believe in God among everything she said you don't go to church and I said I see you every Sunday after church right and every time you come home talking about\nThe people who were honking at each other and yelling yeah they're running the park and oh why oh yeah yeah I Know it yeah it's crazy yeah it's crazy how\nPeople are in church and they're finding that but they're ... they're looking at their watch like nobody was\nOn ... ... ... yeah yeah yeah they want out which of these ... these video mountain road rage and the church parking lot is because I make all these ...\nThat make two videos a week and some of them connect and some of them don't just probably like your content of your books yeah sometimes when people are like\nYes thank you we needed a sometimes you put your heart and soul into something like ... what was that one that connected or not that one that connected ... yeah 'cause I don't think you'd have to be a Christian too or a church going person to\nYou've heard about that mhm from your why are they like yeah I Know how it goes and they're like yeah and it's just a\nWhat's funny is the juxtaposition of a ... you know God first survivors [laughter]\n... yeah yeah how did you lose the twenty steps away the human spirit wouldn't you say like if you like\nYou see someone on TV and they're given a run down and you just go that's not right it doesn't seem right that guy's lion mhm you just know because everyone is a human like you can spot in sincerity\nAnd why the everybody loves that is because everyone when people get mad at my jokes at the live show because you're going to come and the whole crew is going to come tonight\nSo to get to come and yet or bring up on the ... people people are like stabbing each other we have a ticket to that's what I that's what our goal right yeah I mean it's a good comedy show you won a few good asset to pick out people the people\nAre like ...\nWhenever I tell a joke it's like a cross the line I go oh stop I I Know you guys text each other this personally your ... and I I Know like right when the radio when the ... of you and they like if there's an interview there like come on it would be real this guy\nLike because that's how he generally said on the ground or they don't yeah ... that's on humans [noise]\nAnd I feel like I've connected with you because you like to sew somebody's like talent somebody's like telling us the truth out here you know what I'm saying and that's what people I think comedy is comedy\nHard in two thousand Eighteen I go I think it's way easier because you don't to to cross the line you\nKnow what to say anything right\nMhm it used to be in the nineties you had to say that most profane disgusting I never even I Can't believe this is coming out of someone's mouth but in in two thousand anything we heard everything we've seen everything ... so it's kind of coming back to like a Jimmy Fallon type\nI I I said years ago that I thought the only thing left shocking\nWas what up the individual actually felt\nYeah that's the only thing left shocking you really are feeling and want to say\nBut you don't as I I Can't believe you said that yeah but why I have a joke in my act about uh like everyone like we're all good Christians in here we're driving down the road and seen that cyclists on the side of the road I Wonder if I just like [laughter]\nLike why is that why does why why it really happened in vet that\nJoke has stayed in my show for about four years because it every button yeah once you have what's at the bottom of that you're a ... you want to be the person in church that and then the real human yeah is the guy and we all have a\nDark side yeah ... is the guy now might be something might be better or worse than others some ... some might be against the law and some ...\nSome might actually have to learn that we [laughter] the reason why\nThe the reason why the outrage and the culture and people were coming after cabin\nAre because you were like if if if we can notch him down\nI feel like that's why the tabloids exist that's why when we are the outrage exist because you'd think these people are above view the people listening that are ... are like Glenn Beck is up here\nYou know the people listening now okay how are you [laughter] you know they they're like I'm Better than that [laughter] much better when everybody started kind of an even\nPlaying field and then you get you know that's what you get rich or famous or successful or the c._e._o.\nTo ... you'd be down here and him be up here is not sit well with people so if we can somehow\nExpose them as a human and that's what I I've studied my act for a long to every scandal that ever comes out past their politics athlete that headline she'll be person acts like human Mm right\nYeah well about ... ... well some of them [laughter] some of them are like oh yeah yeah oh you he was drinking after long day other cook yeah\nYeah I get that yeah that makes sense yeah or like our he you know is the kind of the thing I don't want to get into politics our guys but on the thing with Kavanaugh was agree or disagree on how it\nGoes or whatever I people who said I Can't believe he was angry you know\nLike a gang rape and you know there's no human on the planet now but you wouldn't go okay enough\nOkay yeah we were like ... there's

'cause my still would say I I go to my daughter's wedding but I don't know how I could reconcile that\nOh well it depends on\nDo they still want to vote without his they may not or if they're fifty fifty I say go to your daughter's wedding yeah if it's ... let's play the game though yeah forty nine forty nine essentially you'd have to be pets\nWell no well yeah I mean it but again let's say mentioned switches right now he's a Democrat one Democrat voted for the Republican so let's say ... signifies today or that he can go and and vote for the Republican but let's say he he changes that tomorrow\nSo it's instead it forty nine forty now that it's not a sure thing you need Danes\nI've got to say like my it into a hardware that your gun was titled what my daughter but in ... and the end you you really think that I kind of had the other opposite thought which was my initial thought was this is really important\nI think if my actual daughter not like a you know now own daughter but like my daughter ... she's getting married screwed this country I Am they're like that's like the most important thing in my life I did sign up for that job but I did not sign up to a band in my family\nNo you didn't put your family can that can be move for instance if the vote is it you know two o'clock\nA that is still what a Montana time noon or eleven o'clock you could say hey move that I'm going to vote at two o'clock eastern time that's eleven o'clock if the the ceremony was supposed to start at noon started it's sick started at three and I'll be there\nBut the ... vote right like move the vote you know what they're planning on doing by the way if they need ... they're going to delay the holy until he comes back oh Gees delayed the vote\nWell only if they need them right now he doesn't look like they need it we should be clear about that um it looks like it would be fifty to forty nine easy thing to do you could just ... it doesn't have to be tomorrow it to no\nNo they can relate to the Sunday yeah or easily yeah or Monday but there's a risk of like you know some new accusation during a crazy thing that happens you know what the Democrats will try right yeah a ... there is a risk there there is a risk there [noise] but I mean I Am I missing my daughter's wedding", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "05"}
