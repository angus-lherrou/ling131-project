[noise]\n\nI got to\nTell you it was one of the most spirited ceremonies that reaction here because a lot of the of his fellow Marines were they're the ones whose lives saved when the north Vietnamese initiated the Tet Offensive in early Nineteen sixty eight and ... he was the leader\nOf this group of Marines and he took 'em right into the teeth of a North Vietnamese ambush and this went on for a solid week according to state been submitted by his men\nSergeant major candidly repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire to pull his fellow wounded Marines to safety and he was being injured by shrapnel and cut to pieces the hallway and he never stopped\nI witnesses say\nHe pulled at least ten wounded Marines to safety you charged a machine gun messed that had the pin down he deliberately exposed himself to fire in order to pinpoint enemy locations\nCan lose eighty years old hale and hardy looks like he could do it all again in his uniform yesterday he was\nAbsolutely stunning he's humble he says he hates being singled out from all the Marines who did their time in Vietnam he says you know what my troops would follow me to death so if they're in a position where they might die or am I supposed to do\nKnowing they were behind me one hundred percent fear never existed and then he talked about all the other Vietnam veterans never so honored never honor do respect\nIt at all when they came back from the war and many of you can\nThey do that and you're listening to me right now to all of you can only said in an interview when you look at what type of a war on what type of recognition they all received nothing that really offends me\nOh you don't keep track of every single time something like that happens to me why would not I mean I Would just is why I subscribe to a suitcase deliveries [laughter]\nDrops off you know a few dozen a day [laughter]\nBecause you know you never know hearts in a suit gamble didn't deliver it to a private plane that books off maybe on the bad guy here okay maybe on the bad guy I happen to run around a lot with my bones thought hey\nGuys make sure bad guy I don't think I I don't think it does occasionally wrong on that one or two individuals your mom probably suggest stew don't be running around the house or the bones saw you know she did but I'm going to someone's eye out she also said donate sugary cereal and I do that now do\nYou know we go up we get responsibility for our lives and you start making decisions as an adult in my decision is I'm going to carry my phone's all around [laughter] I think [laughter]\nAnd occasionally my ... is is isn't so severe assuming system right right exactly yeah at least I'm I'm going through the right steps of the cutting them up into little pieces and put them in a suitcase and then I think that's your clean up after yourself yeah that's all you can do is clean up the mess afterwards huh\n[laughter] it's interesting too that the media is making a big deal out of every single time they talk about this guy they talk about him as if he's an American because they always say Washington Post reporter I ... I think he just\nHe contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff member of the Washington Post columnist was an error\nHe's written it's relatively new yeah because he had left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness was going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new\nAnd you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean an important that we are able to air those things are but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main\nUh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it for nine eleven was a feeling he's made like he's tried to capitalize on that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one with the biggest political documentary of all time up in that was just a giant\nConspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like they've got to go all out of it and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven um right so this is not a new\nAccusation and when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about for the business\nOur allies since Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to the FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a\nFriendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Obama was plenty friendly with them to exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there was no way the bronco Obama would've done\nAnything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point the author and it wouldn't have done anything about this it's a great point and it shows\nThe problem with Ninety percent of the media coverage today the difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker who is expensive right remember good I'm bringing Fahrenheit nine eleven again\nThe big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished a book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the\nRoom remembered this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like\nBut they saw Bush as this bad guy who ... who was who's incompetent Brock Obama wait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything\nAnd it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years since the lower than me so it was a decision you made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worse criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision and in the minds of people who want to praise the zoo and\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand to kill the guy right\nYou know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risking their mission like that but these are this is risk being talked to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options and and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump\nYou know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on let's investigate this before we act irrationally if for rock Obama was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's\nNot being reactionary with Trump that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just the you know\nThe the the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who is a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's ... I'm a or Donald Trump but the CNN I think they made a decision and MSNBC certainly on the sport in and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nA potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your phone submit something happened there ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't fair and more of a story here maybe that's the story run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIsn't the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still in the age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now um Chicago Tribune his reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nUh actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ... um Saudi Arabia publicly pledged\nPayment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into oh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paint us a hundred million dollars\nOf course there are always paying a hundred million dollars that our relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that is kinda I mean look at it it's not completely in significant to the relationship right I mean that there there are these considerations\nAnd that is why when you're making a decision of the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do\nRight like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day of American interests are harmed long term\nI'm by a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration has to be your top priority for top priority is not a Jew ... murders in Turkey\nRight like the beginning I don't know if anybody knows this but we ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the pre anymore so she studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things\nAnd they just said no no no no it's a new it's a you know the guy went from like mid range pick in kick ball so last pick [laughter] like ... when this happened ... the guy is dead and\nYou know ... you know no one ever said you know Osama's wrong it's it shouldn't be Usama Osama why no no it just started and if people just started\nUsing it very strange it's it is very strange uh it and like some of it I I guess they understand like for example are here we say the tiny little country that James Bond goes to the casinos Monaco\nRight mhm and if you're over there they call it ... ... everyone calls it Morocco now I've never heard that I was ... here's another one here we say Mazda for the car ... if you listen uh as as as a Canadian sports celebrity I Do quite often to Toronto blue jays games on the radio they seem as though it's\nMad stuff Toronto that's really irritating I wouldn't get us into that I Would say I mean would you be pissed off of ... you don't call us ... that were not as\nWe are I've also noticed the jaguars are being called jak you are you are on the commercial\nOn a jaguar what it's like they like if you come up with a name on your own\nYou can describe to us what how how it's pronounced\nBut what is a word we already know and why is that you were a hundred years it stop it ... it's an animal yes and they're not just a car it's an animal to write a buddy ever says jak you are\n[laughter] the Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that yeah I think that's jak you are trying to seem refined\nRight like it was like um there's something a little snooty about the way they pronounce ... a jaguar is like at the that that stupid animal over they're ripping up my dog and this is Jackie water [laughter] would you\nBe gone [laughter] 'cause I was over there ripping up by a painter and into my dog is a terrible I'd but luckily I felt with my bones on top of it though everything's gonna

the updates when we get them um we need to warn you about something that's incredibly dangerous and our society and all too prevalent in that's a Disney Princess is um we're being worn by ah some Hollywood actresses\nThat there is some danger there Karen nightly is promoting a her upcoming movie which was produced by Disney by the way the nutcracker the four realms\nBut she told Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday that she's not a fan of every movie the studios produce because Disney Princess is don't uphold her feminist values ... so she is forbidden her three year old daughter ET from watching certain movies like Cinderella which is\nA been banned in her household because she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her\nAnd she says don't rescue yourself\nObviously and this is the one I'm ... mad because Cinderella waits to be rescued and there's not really as a self yes she did in ... out of that situation\nShe's also quite annoyed by the Little Mermaid she's banned that as well she says the songs are great but they don't give but don't give your voice up for a man\nOr a man yeah thank you ... there's a lot of women are doing that today the main ... or ... of really they'll tire movie is to give up all of your rights to bed and wait for them to rescue a ... especially a rash of rich guy\nThat's the message you should be taking from those movies I'm Christian bell is also fearful that Disney princes are sending the wrong message to her children she's actually the voice of the Disney Princess uh Anna and frozen wasn't that done by Christian Bale yes\n[laughter] so she tells her daughter's Lincoln and delta that ah when she ... when she read Snow White del taco bell yes and Lincoln bell yes and when she read Snow White two inch closes up the book and she says every time we close no white I look at my girls and ask\nDon't you think it's weird that Snow White didn't ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple or where she got that apple\nI say I would never take food from a stranger would you and my kids are like no and I'm like okay I'm doing something right yeah you've proved it\nA while you nailed that one there did wrist and then she'll also say and girls don't you think it's weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her\nPermission well no because she's in a coma mom [laughter] can't give her permission and she'll stay in a coma if he doesn't\nCancer right I mean she's advocating for the camera can to continue right the kids what gangs are out of it right\nAnd bell says uh because you can't kill someone if they're sleeping on the how do I mean in my circumstances\nThat's true however this is a notable circumstance which is why it's a movie in a book right the reason why you know about it is because it's different than everyday life right ... you know there there's a magical apple\nThere's a a a print or with a magical spell the princess yeah and she's sleeping because she can't wake up right unless the prince kisses her that's kind of the premise that\nYeah so it's a it's a unique circumstance that pressure lessons don't apply to [laughter] so silly so weird I even get yourself so worked up about that I you know what I Hope happens every day it every day when she brings breakfast to them they ask are aware that this\nI think just torture her with the rest of her life [laughter] 'cause I can understand this you know sometimes I think even you know like the conservatives get made fun of when they do these types of things\nAre like when you watch uh you know that there's a there's one cartoon because we're watching at one point that was and it was just it was just like a nonstop commercial for recycling and it was like I was a captain planet or whatever and all of that that is an

like a this was this happened\nThat that that the terrible direction to go and lead you don't awful road\nWhere you're trying to judge things that you can't possibly judge correctly yeah and it's it's gonna be interesting to see how this progress as a in a year or two or five for now with Brett Kavanaugh because there was nothing to back up or his accusers claims there was no corroboration there was no evidence at\nAll of these allegations for thirty five plus years ago and yet\nAh I just saw an article today about from demos Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court just right from office than just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when\nWas no crowd ration and no evidence yeah and you know wow first of all I think once we get past this election but Brett Kavanaugh stuff is going to die down quite a bit because I mean you ...\nSend me scene I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't hear ... occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story\nYou know they'll be still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest eight Brett Kavanaugh but I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations it was always about the ... the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court can they thought they had a chance of winning\nOr the Senate and could block ... block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court would that was one hundred percent of of it for every ... every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and\nCertainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was certainly part of her calculus there [laughter] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story we don't know um but\nThe other people in Cory Booker did not care a lot for one second about what happened to this woman not at all not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him so he could call themselves Spartacus a and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty candidate\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um and he and his ... and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and\nThen again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but what you're judging by the standards that they're putting up it's totally different\nWell let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating\nAfter I think of how recent this Brett Kavanaugh saying was an ... story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find\nThat Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people uh they were there none of those people say that they remember this this incident\nUh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she went back what had happened what mine of it it happened right none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media\nWas if let's say one of the witnesses she named instead\nCame out and said yeah I remember that party I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know very distant and I I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on for something like that just one person\nSaying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident was just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party a Kurd none of it is isn't it happened just that the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of slate\nTalking about the accusation of rape not sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances

said she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to go down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it she eventually told the FBI the truth uh Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son\nA lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was saying like perjury charges or something against her five people said ... five people say Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred\nWow so not while for one person who was at the hotel or at the party in the cabinet case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after it occurred\nOr a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick where they bloody lip and torn pantyhose in their shared hotel room broader he explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband then her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days of the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe ... and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked for rape is like a by the way I'm going to renovate the prison over there that don't work\nUm NBC News found a date and what ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended newspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred\nThere was a prison outside the hotel window wow that is ... times the amount of even alleged evidence yeah that occurred with ah with Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet that was ignored for ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats\nAnd now yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment that only happens now after they never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever again\nTo them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump\nAnd that's why they have no more used for them but I mean Bill Clinton goes on and still\nMakes a big level speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there it's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so\nBizarre and the fact that they that that the media actually thinks we should take\nTheir ... current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when you report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system with actual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened\nI mean that is what that the system we have is the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we're now supposed to go through these kangaroo courts and and even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it\nIs now or standard that didn't sanity it's insanity\nAnd yet you have Hillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there is some stand show evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's trying to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated a reception\nOf Michael ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy as they are so pissed off about that and they do not want him running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are today are very much trying to destroy him at this point\nBut what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then Michael up and out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad that even Trevor Noah who's the ... I mean I I\nIt's about Nazi evil and those who enabled it the book will stun you as Nazi hunters risk their lives to track down mass killers like Adolf Eichmann were protected by ruthless forces there is a reason why the killing books have sold more than twelve million copies\nSo I Hope you check out killing the ss it's well worth your time\nYou F.

John Morgan Morgan Morgan first to know that you will have the burden to prove that the place of business knew or should have no other dangerous conditions\nMake sure someone goes back\n... ... with that and to Tripoli Seventy Seventy easy Kay [noise] uh there's this [noise] there's an interesting\nThing for the New York times today and it is they do this little\nPod cast in the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage ever ever um you did things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah and that and they said yes at odd\nPart of this saga with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him and doing some thing that against it as well right like he would ask they say yes or or um there was one case where um he\n[noise] again like this is the level of the accusation here he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with a woman a woman believed that he was pleasure in himself while on the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics our dynamic absolutely yeah the power to and it makes you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian he's in ... he wields incredible power in this country now incredibly led to ever\nFired at any job in the nation and giving any job and you're a sarcasm is just reality and the situation that they're kind of go why and what\nThey were saying they're saying they ... if some of them people were other comedians and one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there is something invited her back to his trailer to do his thing in front of her which apparently was\nSo is this is ... ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife and a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nAnd that's the center of the allegation that he didn't do it he didn't force her to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation she learned to do this thing which is believable obviously icky right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I have issues I'm Sorry\nSay that is is that sexual assault what I mean the accusation there are no that was shown what she answered\nA diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so I ... he admitted to being a dirt bag right now and he admitted in such a general way that people kind of\nUh making people he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make the make the right and I think\nThat that would I just described you is obviously wrong yeah okay so I was wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no and and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible but that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's evidence\nThat he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again just making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was the folks who scares away from right you're not supposed to just a Seattle and people will commit crimes in the future\nAnd listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar is famous New York comedy club like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedians I never heard of that probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks in it doesn't set or Jerry Seinfeld comes into our cars that are loose okay well I'm going to doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he's bounced around to several clubs around New York since and they let him on stage so the New York times of the exhaustive report about tried to talk to the club owner but why you let him on stage\nThis is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision\nListen all the people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy but he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work that he's like never might never say never\nTell me initially about American financing reckon financing is a great company who\nAre

don't tolerate anything yeah more\nIf you don't believe exactly what they want you to believe there is no tolerance a lot of people on the left who have who have dealt with with that\nAnd that they've yeah no doubt yeah Ninety percent of the stuff but you you fall down on one issue to the progressive God\nLook outlook out yeah\nGive us some examples coming up with a\nIt might as\nWell do you how did he lie what do you lie about it he said he drink to excess from time to time yep\nWhen he lie about the idea is that while others because other people around them are like well I think he ... he ... did blackout how the hell the you know not only he would know that right or you know and maybe he did I I don't see how that's all that uh\nThere's no way to know that into the conversation but still there's no way to know what if the ridiculous thing to to complain about and I you know this is one of the most annoying parts about this is the subtle accusation that everyone who supported\nBrett Kavanaugh was a terrible person even from people like you know there are people in the left but you know I'm ... I certainly know them and they were against Kavanaugh because they believe ah you know Dr Ford ... ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially in everything that they're saying which is\nThey accuse us of believing\nForward\nIn a roundabout sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want him on the Supreme Court right and like no right now is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want him on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over the line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her your prerogative but you don't accuse me of of the ... of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I think I don't think it happened\nI don't either and it hadn't been I think it happened with somebody else maybe but even that is is this is a I don't think it happened at all\nTo be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't fair but the ... when it when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens with any big public official a in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades\nThen talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who were there and they can't remember the party\nLike what are we and the person who's making the accusation has an overt uh dislike for the\nParty of the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist his mark shit women's march rallies is is an obvious Democrat like\nYou have to take in motivation forty years later into account\nI always started skepticism I had this idea and basically I think people almost it's like it's got some bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of seeing about it yeah I Am I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you die and leave the survivors\nNo no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor the indicate that this this has occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the event occurred I Would I ever called the victim I called them survivor but when I when they leave I Am\n... survived this assault by this man if they've assault didn't happen they didn't survive it [laughter] yeah I guess we could all colors survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... a million things are possible what you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make it up\nWhy would she lie about it that's a good question because I Love this one ...\nPossibly can lose your motivation [laughter]\nNot whether they should like this I don't know when I tell her to go we\nTalk about uh yeah I Know we're talking about the the ... women's\nRight to choose it is to fend did as if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one\nI wouldn't defend my children's lives about as strongly as they would they defend their right to kill their children hit is the most important thing in the universe to how many millions of Americans\nThe idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy who you think is going to overturn that right that you think is so vital is insane we've seen foreign crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week were five\nFive accusers accused the high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him\nYeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle on receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against the being anti gay\nThis happens all the time you know why\nPeople are horrible many of them are awful their women are awful men are awful they do terrible things that you can explain it happens all the time\nAnd the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing a swastika on their door for nothing you know to like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused we may do we know for a fact the fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them we know these\nThe fourth accuser didn't even bother right any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or what had happened we know that the third accuser went to Michael ... and no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusations we're littered all over the store\nAnd the only two they even seem ... seem credible to even Democrats were the first two\n... and in the second one is the is that there's a ... they're writing when they the person who made the allegation\nSaid I I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them\nAll right well I I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate the person and that person said no it didn't happen\nAnd she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember it even happened exactly\nThe same old act on Sunday ... operating evidence on that one either and there was and look the Fort one was only ... I think taking more seriously than the others because there was it an obvious\nPerson saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people if there was no evidence proving\nThat had happened here I'm In and of course obviously people like have it on his uh his or what does his worst thing though um but that one was serious because she went in to you know took the step of going in front of the of the hearing and and and doing relatively credible job it recounting what she believed the story was\nWho knows if it was true or if it was completely felt fall the idea that you can't pull one percent of the United states who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation against someone but it's just completely false it's just an eight yeah of course you can do it\nI mean but as we heard with Hillary Clinton\nShe said there was a vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this but they the media access if this is entirely foreign world where someone could lie about politics [laughter]\nDon't of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five cases and probably in all of them\nAnd you you brought up the high school situation in California where they called the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accused is one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault and they they asked the first accuser\nOn Snapchat somebody posted on Snapchat a photo\n[laughter]\nI could barely say it I can barely get the words out of a toy gun oh my gosh ... put it right up there he was holding it this kid Eighteen year old Eighteen year old kid holding up a toy gun\nBut fortunately the Chicago police would ride into action and uh found him almost immediately they located him a and arrested him and uh\nAnd potential for um what was the charge that they arrested him genocide she genocide or an attempted genocide because he posted the photo of a toy gun and you know with that toy gun who knows how many people\nI mean he could have put an eye out I have a good idea of how many people are zero [laughter]\nProbably yes zero\nIs right it's hard they actually they actually arrested him for disturbing the peace\nThe photo of of all the air soft it was an air soft gun I'm\nWas disturbing the peace I mean that's amazing isn't it also I mean that cannot hold up I can not hold\nUp I wouldn't think the ... the community as a plotting no police swift success the Swiss successive locating arresting him\nIs due to the timely information provided by numerous concern teens and adults as well as the cooperation of the park ridge police department and the cook county sheriff's bleak so is this was a a multi department\nGood uh operation to get this kid weight does this story come around though do we here at the end but by the way they found out it was an air stuff done and now he's now you know this story you know ...\nCause I mean it let's just say you had a realistic looking air soft gun ... that media last it's a little are you I assume they all have the orange thing on the end shifts are fake right let's just say that fell off or something or you get to the black what'd you say\nHe's walking down the street or he's walking towards the school I can understand someone passing by me like a what the hell is going on and sharing the police yeah\nAnd what happens if they show up and they talk to them they owe dinner or something I stopped by our it's ... I think are getting at the orange piece of people are gonna freak out and then you release them right to tell you max the maximum penalty but we will look we're going to take the gun will return it to you later instead\nThey found the ... gun in his truck and arrested him for just serving the did they realize it was an air south yeah they knew what was in ... they said it was an air soft gun\nAnd they're they're still being congratulated for their swings to the extent [laughter] hope that I don't know I don't know what are you going to do with an ... I mean if you're shot somebody in the eyes yeah you're supposed to work goggles right when you're wearing yeah that would hurt a you might put an eye out my mom warns me\nMore than me about that a word that was a kid um but other than that\nI I don't know what you're going to do with yourself gun\nBut it's so dangerous that they had their arrest the kid when they found out it's an air soft gun\nBut he wasn't even walking down the street and he was posted a photo you didn't on right now buddy didn't didn't say I'm going to use this school none of that\nVery bizarre [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThat great super deer on joined by\nOthers call them fat so uh but that's where all that I that we don't like that should have ... people who call ... ... yeah to severely do you do and\nSo you are to try to remember when that happened in a well a lot behind your back we don't like people to call you okay so to your face and so we chastise them or when they do it behind your back and it's a great point which is just before we get into this conversation we should point out the name of the thing of course chewing the fat [laughter]\nRight [noise] [noise]\nI just mean the conversation you know oh yeah and I also have the fastest growing success in America right now that was Jeff pitcher is there any other I'm called ... oh yeah right All right Dr scientific measures on that but I Know the numbers in really good for the new uh subscribers the jazz or wouldn't\nGo goes real happy about it's fun to Monday through friday during the ...
