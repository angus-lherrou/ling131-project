{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "When I found out that I was pregnant with our youngest daughter now well\nI was not thrilled\nTo be pregnant and I'm embarrassing to admit that to people I have two kids that were getting ready to graduate high school and I was just at a point in my life\nWhere starting over with\nMidnight feeding than they for changes that wasn't\nReally what I had in mind for myself at that point and so for the first few months that I was pregnant I actually really struggling with now I Know for the last thing but it doesn't feel like one\nAnd of course then I\nObviously did come to terms with that I was very excited when no album born she was beautiful but when we received her diagnosis of Down syndrome and Edward syndrome there was a guilt and a little bit of fear and wonder you know and oh God punishing me\nFor for being so ungrateful and for not\nAccepting his gas right off the bat\nYeah that was something that I\nDid have to struggle with for a while before for me\nI'm ... now I can think of times where I looked at my past\nYou know when I was young I kind of like in Solomon lord forgive me for my rebellious youth\nBut there there are instances where things come into your life and you'd be like oh you know I Wonder if God is on a journey\nFor that but that's that's really not how God works right\nSo it sounds like both of you had an opportunity to come to a point in your lives when you learned\nMitt to God's well\nCertainly plants that I had for this season in my life have been changed dramatically\nBy Noel arrival you know ideas that I had for myself one on my\nOlder or children were in school finished school or\nLeaving home even all of those things have been put on the back burner because now I and not\nOnly mothering a small child again but also a child that has some out of the\n... I think if there's anything that we know by reading God's word is not that you become a Christian and all of a sudden your life is perfect but in fact you you can expect suffering you can expect trials because\nYou are literally going in the opposite direction in the world wants to take you and that's going to increase friction great friction\nThere haven't been to our fair share of trial but um there's also been a lot of joy and a lot of\nA blessing and I think\nYou know specifically speaking to Noelle and her surprise arrival but also her\nI'm surprised diagnosis I think that when we received that diagnosis we all reacted in a very human way we were\nScared because we didn't know what that meant we were\nSad because we grieved\nThis idea of the life that our child was going to have\nTheir were element I'm\nYou know uncertainty and the fear of what other people\nGoing to think and how does this and you know how this is going to impact our family long term I started thinking about the fact that\nYou know Perry and I may never have an empty and that and that's a huge thing to deal with and to come to terms with and what I didn't realize I'm what I didn't think about was the huge blessing\nThat we were going to get through her\nThat was one of the greatest lessons that I learned through this whole experience so harm\nOf God Bless us with her was just that one\nWe got to know her and once we recognize how amazing her differences make her how kind and how unconditionally loving and how\nAmazing she is like she has to work so much harder than everyone else to achieve the same\nTask that we all achieved quite easily\nThere is so much rejoicing\nRejoicing over little tiny things that you would normally take for granted those are the things that I feel like God has taught us through no well\nAnd when I watch the way that our children are older children are with her and the patient and the acceptance that they have learned and the ways that they have grown in their opinions on people with\nDifferent [noise] I just feel incredibly by which has been incredible\nFor me to realize and and I think it's a good reflection on a simple conditions [noise] we get very caught up\nIn looking at the ... the dark clouds of uh\nThe potential of something that happened\nAnd so you can get very focused on the challenges of bringing up a a child who\nHas Down syndrome and and and really just get\nSo wrapped up in the old you're thinking about\nAnd what we we fail to see is that there can be more going on than meets All right so you know some people might not see a\nHaving a child come into their home is a blessing she was absolute blessing for our home and continues to be today because you know she became the sunshine\nThat we all were able to revolve around and be blessed by and and this you know the little person who is just beaming love you\nKnow she has her brother or something like that but a more often than not it is just about\nI I Want to love you I I Want to be happy with you I Want to smile I I I Want to make you happy and\nWe all uh we're there for her you know to help her with the challenges and so we learn more compassion\nAnd care and all these things and and that's what God was giving us was this opportunity to love and to serve in and\nWe may not realize that at first but wow what a blessing\nThe give and and and it was so thankful for it today\nYeah and even the blessing now of being able to share our stories with other\nPeople and hope that we might somehow encouraged someone else who\nAt the beginning of thirty me um you know just finding out that they have a diagnosis downtown or my child you know prenatal a year after they're born or someone that they know that when\nYou're that that hopefully it would just help people to open\nTheir mind to refrain thing think about things a little bit differently that this isn't a burden or a tragedy\nThat this is life it's a little bit different but it's a blessing number law and um you know especially with all\nThe talk lately about\nYou know prenatal testing and eradicating Down syndrome in certain countries in the world and of course that's not what they're doing their job\nKilling all of the baby that have Down syndrome before they're more um which is just heartbreaking and so to have the opportunity to go out to be kept women out there to be in that group during her life and um and sharing your story which is really what we\nRun a Noel sound like a beautiful gas and ...\nAnd want to thank you for sharing a little bit of your story sharing your family your

I'll Try to warn them if they have a timeline shorts at ... want to give yourself to three months\nUm you know if your fortune you'll find a house in two weeks book be prepared for you to take him off to find a house and then of course like you mentioned be prepared for thirty days or so of the actual process of the mortgaging and closing and what not to be prepared for that 'cause if you if you're giving yourself a short leash like you said you might just into becoming a renter\nUh I'll give an example of just to a a confirmed what you just said Laura a had a customer from a young lady on Tuesday who asked me to run her credit and pre qualified her and when we discuss that there were some things you need to do to repair her credit\nShe said oh uh I was hoping to move in by Monday because I'm being kicked out of my apartment this weekend so there's a perfect example of not planning well in advance you need\nThe fact is they have more buyers which means more money end up faster sale for you Lewis timeframe for selling homes is thirty five percent faster than the average agent\nAnd at the same time they also get their clients eight percent more money for example just ask Adriana who sold her house in eight days at one hundred one percent of asking price\nLaura is so confident that you're home will sell that they will guarantee it in writing if you're home doesn't sell she'll buy at a price acceptable to you guaranteed so if you're selling your home called Laura Peterson at front gate realty\nFrom your cell called pound to fifty then said the key word real estate that's pounded two fifty and say the key word real estate\nWhen it comes to the title of blizzards services you want someone who was the little known\nWhat you first said he top should've equitable title there's Twenty years of experience with real estate was excellent customer service is all about taking care of your needs flush research officers the wide and being attorney on you know the city tops equitable titled can get your title including needs done quickly and correctly\nEquitable tribal dot com and get started today that equitable titled on\nTV are closing success\nPicking at selling your home but want it so fast and for top dollar Hi this is W.

effort and my friend Laura Peterson\nWith me this morning is urban and Howard shutting from [noise]\nMortgage and in order to get in touch with any of us you can call for seven five six six to five five five or pound to fifty on your cell and key word is real estate\nSo we were talking um with Chris was mostly talking after um on our last segment they're going into some of the products that are available we're talking about home ready and home possible and then we're talking a little bit\nAbout um F. ha and all of that kind of stuff in as a reminder Chris can be reached that\nOr seven for one for six one five four\nAnd um then there's a lot of um misconceptions in regards to dating perfect credit and that kind of thing can you speak about this a little bit\nYeah I Would love to um so I'm sure everybody wants to achieve that eight hundred score right that's that's considered the holy grail credit you know you get up there today ordered score and um\nYou know like everybody know that about one percent of our country has that that ... score achieved in is definitely not necessary so just realize that's rare oh so that and want to say something that's there almost every single one program offered today does not require anything near that\n[noise] yeah and I think that um you know if you've got that I mean you've done a great job but there is somebody that I was just working with a week or two ago\nAnd one of the things that came up on them for them is that you know they had a lot of student loans and and the loan officer said that you know there is no way that their credit score is ever going to go\nAbove probably like seven hundred for several more years until that student land comes down significantly so\nThere are certain things that you can do and there are certain things that you just gotta live with\nBut you know you wouldn't want to not have those student loans to be able to you know work the job that you're working and all of those kinds of things so\nI always say there's no perfect people out there and there's one percent I guess they're perfect then there yet it [laughter] and that's it very ... um I Believe there's things that you can do that you guys can help people with in repairing their credit though too\nYeah there is a you know so yeah being doing this now for about nine years and working on mortgages had the opportunity to look at probably about ... hundreds or maybe even a ... worth of of credit reports right so uh yeah I've been able to develop certain skills that where it allows me to look at it and\nAnd say okay look what's develop a plan of attack here to to get your credit in the position we need to um and on top of that we have some proprietary tools that help me figure out what they have something a little more complicated than normal allow me to\nA little bit easier figure okay here's what we need to do and another point will sit with over maybe and say you know do this and do that\nAnd then let's figured out that point you come back to a few months or whatever it takes um it'll give you a quick example of of usually what needs to be done is is credit cards\nUm most of the time credit cards might be just what we call over utilized they're they're just using too much of the bill balance all use some simple numbers to give people an idea of what to look for a sea of a credit card with a thousand dollar credit limit\nAnd let's say you have a nine hundred dollar balance on that credit card at that point you were over utilizing your available credit to you\nAnd so typically what we will sit down and talk about is ... down to let's say three hundred dollar balance mhm printed out and then it's about thirty percent utilization at that point then that's what's important to him and so you get that down and I'm more than likely you'll see a significant boost in your credit scores if you're able to do that\nUm you know sometimes it's seen as much as Seventy ... increased just by doing that\nYeah which is amazing so it really is you know it's just like anything out there there's tips and tricks to everything to get it done and you guys are they're working in it on a consistent basis and so as a result of that you are able to go ahead and make\nThings happen for people and how long does it take I mean it doesn't take as long as people think either\nKnow or I'll give you a quick story on on on just for the sake of time on it um I had a veteran who was looking to purchase a home and he came to me and he was over using is available credit I'm so we sat down we talked about it he was actually able to pay those off almost right away\nAnd we do have some available tactics that we can um if you let it happen naturally they will typically take a month or two for it to update 'em indoors and tools we can use if you're if we need you and a house right away that we have five\nDays or so it won't take up the um so that's a very unique time period because it allows us to extradite in a situation where we need to\nWell and it's like we talked about that you know planning ahead I mean that's what it's really all about because\nI ... I Believe too that that I've been told and you get you can verify it is that that the difference in your credit score determines your interest rate so the difference in the points in your credit score you know are gonna you can get a lower interest rate if you have a higher score\nAnd that's all really looking for now certain programs have certain timelines or what we call seasoning on this too were before they were going to lend to you again um some are a little bit more than others are the most ... generally the harshest program or the one that might just look at a little bit more harshly than the rest of the conventional loan um\nIf you've had let's say just they foreclosure you're going to have to wait seven years\nUm and it's a long time now most of the time you don't see people who have just a foreclosure usually they're advised by some of some form of turn your counsel to go ahead and do a bankruptcy and what they'll end up doing is willing in whatever mortgage they had into the bankruptcy and\nThe way the ... combat with it for anything else Southern Baptist to distinguish at that point on the news when you do that as you include that foreclosure into bankruptcy you're going to find that you can do I conventional within four years\nAnd so it was a little bit less of a timeline at that point\nIn the same thing applies to if you've had a short sale that you're going to wait for years on a conventional loan now the other pop pop a product which is of ha is definitely a little more lenient\nIf you had a bankruptcy and and let's say you didn't get a mortgage you're waiting two years\nBut let's say you did like over property know if a cheesy little unique because they look at something different a lot of people don't realize is actually on an effigy loan if you let the house go into foreclosure you're actually going to look at the date that the bank took it from you\nI'm without we call it a certificate title I'm sure you've seen those before is the return or does the public with accounting and so we're looking at that to say okay when did that happen and then at that point you just wait three years\nUm and so it's pretty you know the other program the problem VA very lenient it's the two years on and on for an foreclosure bankruptcy you had a short sale there's no seasoning at all and so if you're a veteran and you've had something happen you you have the easiest route to go for sure\nWell and again that comes down to counseling with people you know like yourselves they're like myself to find out you know where you're at and where you can go and what your options are because there's also um companies out there now that will actually let you rent to own until you're able to buy\nAnd you can choose the house and everything just as if you would own it and then you could go ahead and go into it so that exists here in central Florida\nAnd so if you're in that position and then you could just you know wait out maybe it's a year or two that you have to wait in order to do that but one of the things that um I find interesting in today's market is because the market has rebounded as well as it has is that there aren't very many people that are underwater today\nLike ... like um I don't know five years or so ago when we're looking at the MLS and the stats and there was about Seventy percent distressed in central Florida meaning they were short sales or foreclosures that were on the market and today it's two percent\nWhich so now you said it's a much smaller amount so if you're sitting there and you run into one of those wrote blacks and I was talking to a lady the other day that her head but has been had passed away and she had taken care of the bills\nAnd she didn't know how to do everything so she got behind in their payments and everything but she had a tremendous amount of equity in her house that just selling it would take care of that situation and there was no reason to give it back to the bank and then she had the money that she could go forward on that\nSo it's really important that it's not a problem if you're in trouble in any way shape or form because we can I'll help you out of that and that's what I think the lesson is because if you don't have that foreclosure on there and maybe you had the late you're not going to have to wait near that amount of time\nAnd the people fought fall into a trap quickly they've they've found a little bit behind it I think all the only way is just walking away from it like you said in in today's market the likelihood that you can't so for at least the corporate world and even parts that way you avoid that on your credit and you're able to more immediately by another home that you and your family might want to be in\nYeah I actually um was working with a lady earlier this year that it was that exact situation you know they had had the husband had lost his job temporarily and so it just became overwhelming so she was they were able to sell their house and then they actually had to move to another area that they had planned to move into I think it was\nYou know some other part of North Carolina or something like that instead of from Florida and so they were able to do that but they were able to go intact and then able to you know do what they needed to do where they move to as opposed to having this monkey on their head and so if you're just joining us You're listening to news radio Ninety three point line WFL a than his taxation in Orlando\nHosts Laura Peterson Frank ... homes sold guaranteed or by the central Florida real estate radio\nWith you every Sunday at eight o'clock joining me today is Howard Shannon and I'm Chris urban from butler mortgage if you want to get in touch with any of us come for seven five six six she five five\nIf or parents you fifty on your cell and the key word is real estate so I'm listening to talk about VA loans for a little bit you know um if you were a veteran or at any point in time then there's an eligibility certificate I think that you have to get and you get a you can buy a house with a hundred percent down\nYeah have you know the loans and how about the mortgage were were so excited and happy and we get the honor to to work with the er or countries heros\nI'm so whenever we have someone approaches us you know the first thing we'll ask him is okay you know did you serve how long ago did a lot of people don't realize are veterans and realize that you had to sort of at least two years\nAn active duty or eastern time period if you win and reserves but as the first thing were to ask an ... point credit and everything like that but it's it's a free program because it's a hundred percent financing with no more his insurance\nYou can't beat that there's nothing better in my opinion the interview alone and it's it's a privilege to do for our veterans\nWell and I think that people probably have a question and what is mortgage insurance and how is that calculated in that kind of thing and how does that fit into the payment because\nYou know it's like that's one of those terms that we use in the industry but everybody out there doesn't know so so why don't you give us a\nYeah I Know you know we touched a little bit earlier on the twenty percent down in in the ... that each donated so one of the ... I called it an eye on this or a lesser evil and and what it does is it the added as almost like a ... if you walk away or for clothes on your property\nAnd so if you do a let's say a conventional and five percent down I'm a ... ... ... more restaurants will be added to the monthly payment\nI'm notes the amount of that payment or whatever that more of a short might be per month is generally decide to between home which one you're putting down and what your credit score is so obviously the more money putting down in the higher credit score again that's what's important if we can help you get a higher credit score\nIt makes that payment a little bit lower in the good news is generally on a conventional loan if you keep the house were ... times usually a seven to ten years it will just naturally drop by itself\nAnd so it will go away but it I like I said it's called a necessary evil because it does allow someone who ah let's face it trying to save a ... percent today might be just impossible for about anybody you know have a debt that over your head and you're thinking oh I have three percent now you get yourself went home and you're just going to have a little bit of extra more returns paint on top of your payment to do it\nAnd when you're getting pre qualified they go over you go over all that stuff with them and so they know exactly what it is say you know what your payments going to be because that's the most important thing usually to people is knowing what your payment is\nBecause that's what's going to come out of your pocket and that there's a lot of people that qualify for a lot more of a loan than they actually purchased because they want to keep their payment at a certain level and so they're able to do that by that pre planning so it's not anything you need to be concerned about auto\nSo in order to get in touch with us for seven five six sixty five five five\nFound two fifty on your cell phone keyword real estate and we'll talk down next week have a great when everybody\nOf selling your home but want it so fast and for top dollar Hi this is W.

rule that actually was put in place Twenty years ago so it's not so new\nUh but the rules that relate to when you sell your primary residence ... the old rule was you're talking about before the break it allows you to sort of keep rolling the\nCapital gay ... on your primary residence as you bought bigger and bigger houses as is traditionally sort of the pattern\nOr over the course of one's lifetime and then again the old rule allows you to do basically a downsize one time\nAnd sell the property and not have to worry about the capital gain and then a by a a next the next house which would was smaller sort of that downsizing transition\nAnd then you didn't have to report the gay and there were two things wrong with that number one um\nThe assumption that you always buy a bigger house along the way may not actually be a fair assumption number two the assumption that you downsize um may not be a fair assumption as well I mean if you sell the home and decided to move over to the beach well the beach place might cost you more\nUh ... uh even though it might be smaller than the house that you're selling and then number three was just a simple logistics of trying to keep track of all of that so the IRS scrapped all of that that that the notion of rolling over the game and then having a one time opportunity where\nUh you can avoid the gain\nAnd downsize that is gone that's been gone for Twenty years\nThe current rule\nIs very different from that the current rule looks at the amount of gang and says if it is less than two fifty two hundred and fifty thousand for a single person or less than five hundred thousand for a couple we don't care\nYou can fully exclude that gain on your primary residence now the one cab yet is it you must have lived in that property two years of the during the course of the last five years\nMeasured from the date of sales if you had the day to sail let's say the data sale is a October the first two thousand and Eighteen\nThen going back to October one two thousand Thirteen at least twenty four months during that five year period of time you had to live in the house as your primary residence if you did then assuming the gain is less than five hundred thousand for a married couple less than two fifty for a single person then\nFine you're good you don't have to worry about reporting that game and here's the thing you can\nGo and do it again\nLike say you buy the next house in the real estate market goes up and you sell as long as that you have not taken advantage of this particular uh exclusion of capital\nGain within a two year period of time then you can do it again basically you\nCan wind up doing it every couple of years I think over the course of the past Twenty years or did it on the house in DC uh uh and then did on the first house here in Orlando so I have taken advantage of that and certainly taking advantage because it's\nActually the rules so so I have followed that rule\nInvolving the sale of primary residences ah twice and I don't know that all lined up to do it a third time anytime soon or because kids are still still hanging up the house uh but the primary residence rules and the sale\nAnd how that works out very different than what they used to be and yet\nEven though that rule change happened Twenty years ago still a lot of folks\nOperating under that impression of if I if I if I sell my property I've got to turn around and put it into a smaller property I got a turnaround put it into a bigger property no no not true anymore\nYou you calculate the game if it's less than five hundred thousand than your perfectly fine as a drink as an joint return less than five hundred thousand you perfectly fine you do need to worry about the only time you got to worry about that\nIs if the game is over five hundred thousand then you're going to have to report and pay taxes on that or if you're doing that too often uh meaning that you're doing it every year rather than a no more than every two years of course if you're doing that well in your real estate\nAh purchases than um you're doing really well um but I don't think anybody's doing quite that well where they're making a half million dollars every\nIt really depends upon um free clarify income tax implications it really depends upon\nWhat it is that your inheriting we gave you the property example before the break another example of course is short life insurance life insurance and the proceeds from life insurance all if you're the beneficiary always tax free now contrast that\nWith an annuity and in New ... assuming it's a non qualified annuity which means if somebody put some money into it on an after tax base as the profit on that\nDoes have to get paid and treated as ordinary income so let's give an example of someone at a hundred thousand dollars you sitting in their checking account your parents who passed away head on two thousand dollars sitting in a checking account\nAnd they put it into an annuity because they wanted to get a little bit more of a return and someone convince them that annuities we're somehow you\nKnow safe for and hadn't insurance to it and all that nonsense that people get sold on annuities that's uh my view on opinion or my view on annuities\nIs ... that's a different radio show but let's just suffice that we're not a big fan because we think they're pretty expensive\nOr they lock people's money up and you know the fact that they're the highest commission product in the business seems to us uh one of the biggest reasons why they are sold more\nThan actually used as a viable a investment product for someone's a future but anyway there's the digression on annuities let's say though that you would have been ... and the new at a hundred thousand dollars was put in value today is a hundred and fifty thousand\nOn that type of an annuity you're gonna have to report and pay the gain\nAs ordinary income on your tax return that's why most annuities we'll give you the option to pay it out over a five year period of time\nAnd that's fine the reality is that\nAre you still are going to have to deal with\nThe first dollars on that annuity that are coming out or the profit dollars which means that those the dollars you're going to have to report and pay income taxes on\nSo there's there's no way around that there is some options typically with an annuity to to defer it out over a period of time but even that\nMight not be the best decision even though the taxes might be a little bit lighter if\nYou're only going to have that annuity just sitting in cash right\nOr perhaps you pay a little bit higher taxes to get it and to get that money\nAnd they get that money in fact working for you rather than sitting inside that new itty only making one or two percent yes you're saving on the taxes by spreading it out but\nUh you are costing yourself on the potential for investment return so so just be aware\nYeah you can probably spread the taxes out on that but depending upon the type of an annuity it is and the type of options\nYou're getting offered as the beneficiary\nOr you really want to take a close look at those options to make sure that\nThe balance in the contract continues to stay invested so that you can make more money over that pay out period or if it just simply gets dumped into a effectively a one or two percent then\nYou do wind up paying the higher taxes to take it all out at one year rather than spread that out over time so that's kind of how\nThe annuities work you've you've got to understand what the underlying basis is in that annuity and then the difference between the value in that basis that is all ordinary income\nThat you're gonna have to pay taxes on so be aware of that on an annuity very different from straight life insurance straight life insurance is always\nTax free\nNow any other type of an account that is sort of non qualified or after tax dollars so let's say your parents bought ExxonMobil Thirty years ago obviously there's a huge gain on that\nAgain that gained disappears because of the step up and basis equal to the value of their day to death so so in those in those cases don't have mom and dad's cell Exxon Mobil if they're up into their eighties\nRight if it because the reality is\nThat if they sell it they're going to have a capital gain to report if they pass away that gain completely goes away so that's pretty powerful stuff when you start to think about okay what assets do I need to use for my parents care as they are getting older\nOr where one of the tax implications on it\nUh in in that particular case if you've got something that's got a big gain a and you're able to kind of set it off to the side and use other assets that understand that that gain a goes away when they pass through the step up in basis concept or the last\nUh the last uh a typical account that you'll see people and getting inherited is of course some type of an IRA four one K. for three be or what have you let me be very clear on this one\nOne of the biggest reasons why you want to take your old employer four one K. or for three B. and roll it over to an IRA is that the IRA does in fact have more options to stretch out\nThe distribution of that money over a long period of time a long period of time meaning the rest of your the beneficiaries lifetime so be aware though for one case for three babies they don't necessarily have\nThe stretch provisions that are standard in the I. R. A. so so that's a primary reason why\nAre all along with the fact that most for one k.'s and for three days are getting pretty cookie cutter on their investment choices with all these target date an allocation funds\nUm it is still one of the biggest reasons why we say you know when you leave your employer four one K. for three be rolling it over to an IRA is a great strategy because then that frees up\nThat money to be used in a much more tax flexible manner and in particular where your beneficiaries it gives them more options as well\nIn terms of how they're getting that money out so on and I are are you do have a few options if you are the beneficiary of the first\nFirst option is the usual option or with any of those types of account which is I can just cash at all that\nWell that particular case you may not want to do that\nTo have a full tax liability on that\nUm and in contrast to the new ... you should be able to have those IRA assets invested [noise] even on an inherited face [noise] we'll talk more about that\nAh when we get back here on dollars and cents this is Joel Garrett's of Nelson financial planning news radio Ninety three point one WFL [noise]\nFrom the Airflow designs heating and air conditioning traffic center\nTo feed on our air said don't have any promise ... east or west outlook and get on I Ninety five is well we did have an accident on us one Ninety to eat bad right at celebration avenue blocking lanes that accident is now cleared\nOut for our craft all about the Vineland road at world centered around a lot of problems over the last conversation ... deadline that phone number is eight six six six seven six or seven seven democratic better I'm came on\n[noise] Jesus a name that is uniquely above every night\nFor teachers that one day the whole world about down in ...

goes up and the markets go down how much of your life savings that is exposed to market risk is a very important consideration\nThat is why I strongly encourage everyone to think of their money in terms of red money and green money\nThose terms may sound funny but I Believe they will help us understand a very important concept let me explain red money is money that we're willing to exposed to market risk in hopes of a higher return\nWe accept the possibility of losses even significant losses and hopes of greater gains\nRed money is exposed the upside and downside market risk green money is about safety and security with green money we're not willing to accept the risk of losses so we're willing to accept a lower return in exchange\nGreen money does not have downside market risk\nSo of
