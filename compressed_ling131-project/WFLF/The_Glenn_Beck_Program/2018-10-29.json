understand that is why no one ever wants them no one ever stands for them they're always the last in line and so the world\nJust cited let them have this scrap\nOf land and they say well is there is because of the Bible let 'em have it it's uninhabitable it's it's just nothing but a desert there's no oil there's nothing there just gave it to them\nAnd the Jews happily took it restored to their homeland\nAs the only nation on earth to be wiped off the face of the map and then to be restored to two thousand years later exactly as for told\nIsraeli exists because no one seems to want them\nIsraeli exists because they have a right to live\n\nSo let me go back to Russia and our musical friend\nIn Nineteen eighty nine forty years after the battle of Stalingrad the Hebrew immigrant aid society was helping Jews get out of the Soviet Union and go to Israel and the United states and they provided lawyers money to find homes food even language classes to help them assimilate in their new country\nFor the first time ever\nGregory and the rest of the Jews that he had known that had survived both Hitler and Stalin could concentrate on something more than just surviving\n\nThey had a right to pursue their happiness they could practice their faith they could be proud of who they were they could finally live\n\nThe group that saved him the Hebrew immigrant aid society is the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world let me say that again it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world\nIt was established in the Eighteen hundreds and they're responsible for assisting thousands and thousands of Jews\nAnd a few years ago they open up their services not just to Jews but people of all faiths all faiths that are persecuted and need to be rescued\n\nTheir currency a CEO was asked recently why they decided to do it\n\nHis answer couldn't be more perfect\n\nWe no longer help refugees because they're Jewish\n\nWe help refugees because we are Jewish\n\nReason why I'm telling you the story is this is the organization that I'm mad man went into Philadelphia\nTo try to stop\nThis is the organization that was attacked on Saturday morning at the tree of life synagogue\n\nStory never seems to end the eleven people were killed in the deadliest attack on Jews in our country's history\n\nStories like Gregory filled the synagogue that Saturday morning\n\nThe horrors that collectively endured unimaginable to most people\nAnd yet here we are again the group of people who now have to concentrate just on one thing survive\nAnti Semitism is evil anti Semitism is a disease\nAnti Semitism is as old as the world\nFrom the moment\nGods said I Will make you my people there has been anti Semitism and it is on the rise as it always is in times of nationalism and socialism every time the Jew is the canary in the coal mine they are always look first\nAnd if the world doesn't pay attention at that point it's washed in blood\n\nIf the world decides they need to come for the Jews I proudly declare myself a Jew\n\n\nThe world makes promises all the time and they don't ever intend on keeping them\nBut I Do\nWe said never forget\nI've told you you are the audience that will in the in\n... the republic save the republic and it's not going to be through violence\nThe world is going to become more and more violent\n\nWe must be a unique and peculiar people\nBecause the vast majority of Americans know this is not who we are\n\nThis is not who we want to be\nAnd we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish brothers and sisters\n\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with her Christian Brothers and sisters in the middle east we will stand shoulder to shoulder with a\nMuslim that is being rounded up by the Chinese\nThe cycle of hate\nHas been gone again and it's not Donald Trump and it's not for rock Obama\n\nIt's a cycle that has been running since the beginning of time\nAnd the world always acts the same way because it always comes in a time of chaos it always comes in a time of fear\nIt always comes in a we cycle when the forget the individual it's what's best for all of society it's why our founders\nCame here in the first place it's why our founders defended the Jews\n\nWe're a different country where a different people we're\nNot better than the rest of the world we just see things differently\nThan if we don't shame on us\nOur pilgrims came here thinking that they were completing the journey from the red sea\nOur first to a great deal of the United states was the pillar of fire and pharaohs horses and the party of the red sea\n\nTheir kids are tired of it because they're the ones getting blamed they're the ones that are racist they're the ones that are massage and ... they're the ones excuse me were just out here in Boston are asked trying to make a living well you freaks\nAre limited high on the hog on our tax dollars\nBut the the\nWhat's happening in our society is a symptom\nWe are unfortunately sick\nDave Ramsey ... takes me out on the news radio Ninety three point one\nHow often do fast person here on the phone today don't waste register online and on the phone\n[noise]\nAcclaimed back from an [noise]\nWe welcome to the program Mr a pat gray a hello pat how are you\nGoing good that was a good how's your weekend a\nIt was a it was not great at it really is and why why why not\nIt was a you know a bad football games uh\nExperiences everywhere I went ah what do you what do you experience is everywhere you you're not having a hard time talking out and speaking true you know that would cause the easiest thing in the world right now [noise] sure sure it is sure it is\nThis uh this weekend a I had to really I really had a difficult time uh I mean I just did you guys watching the news all this week you\nKnow as little as possible I write a little bit because of the shooting 'cause it's like I get the updates but yeah\nYeah so only to get the updates and stuff I I don't know who's watching cable news anymore\nYeah I I never watch cable news never mind the highlights I get the clips but I don't I don't actually sit there and watch Fox\nNews or CNN [noise] I'd go to heaven forbid and MSNBC or CNN\nJet why don't you don't want to because I don't know who's doing that and they do I really don't know who's your\nFans watch Fox you know 'cause uh it's a safe haven mostly English watches Shepard Smith uh [laughter] but that's always been that way but I don't know I'm just CNN I don't know who does 'cause that's his son watch\nAll the people who hate Trump ... yeah I guess the only reason I ever turn any of that stuff on it sort of the show you know because we're supposed to be aware of it right and do you do that occasionally but I certainly out\nIf I was not in this business I don't know why I Would bother with any of that oh I wouldn't I Would listen to him talk about early do down the synagogue thing is he's oh literally it's quite ... comedy questions that is until they can get to a question about why Trump's what Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of birds\nBut he'd be like you know did he he didn't go there to help with today is the first question was ah you know but what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I live in a country as a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning center in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt some anti Semitism my entire life he's ... he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah\nThis is a terrible tragedy then they're like well ... ... what part of of that you think this is the the climate of today change and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear\nThat this shooter\nA outwardly hated Donald Trump\nYeah we did not like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or has nothing to do that don't tie him to be a ... more broadly we do have this problem with with\nWith discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall our discourse is pretty terrible at the moment but again has nothing to do with this and all these cable news networks are ... that were telling you that it's us there ... telling your\nWife well we don't want to say we don't blame it on a do Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault right [laughter]\nThat's really is really that's what they're doing never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever that guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot all of the geo ... and another guy and tried to tried to bring to kill thirty Republican seat\nThat's tenth of the Republican was working for Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault no we never said that and neither did I say ... either do today yes of course not they didn't even talk about it it gets I had a very balanced view of that one\nFor a understood that individuals who are responsible for their own actions that time that's right he understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them in and they always complain about this course isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes we can sit on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the python think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt\n'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie Sanders situation\nBut both situations we said the individual is responsible the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individual shootings and I'm gonna do with it and you do not you ... ... discourse does not commit murder\nDoesn't happen so the reason why ... ... and this morning is because uh you know he he sees doing more on trivia and uh and pour a trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh\nSo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know and that one I'm never going to band on that one\nAnd in fact repeated it consistently gets repeat it and it was fabulous and again it was\nYou know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nThank you thank you so are you coming to the show in Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's on Sunday becoming\nNo we're going to be out of town is going to be out of town really 'cause I already free tickets but seriously though now all of a sudden you're in our can change I get you change your plans I've got free tickets for if you want if you'd like them\nSerious I Am serious goes my ... that that would I change my plans okay All right All right good thanks Suzie we'll see you or what is the Sunday\nUh ... I think it Sunday yes it's going back to ... tour by the way for the tickets and the details on we're going to be ... it's gotta be fun there's a lot of election stuff to talk about ... ah ah stuff\nYou have given gift from the gods as far as serial goes the the ... turned completely insane so it makes a comedy fairly easy\nSaid it does\nAnd Pittsburgh we've got something special for you there were going to have laughs and\nAnd comedy but uh also uh I Am a taking all of the proceeds from the I'm from the event\nAnd um we're giving them to\nI'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to or to\nThe uh the refugee I'm telling you a group I'm not sure we're going to give 'em to yet but we're we're\nUh we're we're standing with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going\nUm to a a local Jewish um\nCenter perhaps the the synagogue center and I sense from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I noticed he went back and forth a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was a she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever ... uh criticized I think it was George Soros stream into\nA and I remember and you came back to this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know\nAnd then she posted here's an example um ... supporting the Jewish people and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros or as as an example of how much you hate the Jews\nNow I did respond because I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish\nPeople as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard a that was a\nNational award one of the highest um ... most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people cry but beyond that uh it was just it was just presented by the the prime minister of Israel though oh well that's it [laughter] okay that's not a big one that out of bed quite a\nBig one so it's just amazing because this is not just a criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporter it's all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros\nThat you are an anti Semite it's completely insane if you are a ... a conservative\nAnd the people in this audience I Would leave all would fall into this category many of them would criticize door source but they criticize him because he's a liberal as progressive policies he supports a policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him as rounded him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he has a very shady history\nOr around the world that but anti Semite patriarch source to weigh in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew or the way they don't like fish Shapiro\nBecause you're in front of a Shiite hero party policies you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx he was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a Jew no but because\nHe came up with the idea of communism\nNot a bad no not a fan of\nFat and the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized Ben Shapiro before\nIs that because they're anti Semite it's because they don't like what Ben Shapiro said\nThey will love ... they would love Ben Shapiro he was a liberal\nAnd they don't like him because he is a conservative is this distinction difficult for people can you really not understand I mean we all know cannot do it and I it's not all understand that they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives are anti Semite we hate\nIt when you're telling me the way they uh you know Sheldon Adelson right\nHere's a guy who is one of the biggest financier the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic what it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas are they racist\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas is legal opinions because they don't support what they believe it's not about it it is and she tried to make these into cartoon arguments ... is such a a ... ...\nAgain this is another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're calling everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they\nSay it anyway 'cause they don't care [noise]\nThat that that is exactly what they they they claim to be again and they do it every day wow I didn't hear solution there to\nGo to a battering I don't know what I have a good point and ah we're we're going to talk about one when we come back\nYou is your smart speaker to Google Home to plain news radio Ninety three point one WFL away\nSo let me talk to you a little bit about um [noise] buying or selling a home\nIf you are if you're buying a home right now or you're thinking about it do it now get the low interest rate right now if you have to refinance your loan\nDo it right now do it now I'm\nA home equity is at an all time high\nHomeowners are starting to cash in and pay off high interest or that there is there is a way for you to do this with people who are are working for you they're not working for the bank so if you want to consolidate you want to re fi or you're looking to buy a new home\nGo to the people who work for you and that is American financing\nYou could be looking at twelve thousand dollars in annual savings right now and you can close as fast\nAs ten days American financing eight

Anthony Fox News\nWords if unwelcome in Pittsburgh rabbi Jeffrey Maier vigil\nWhere they just you know symptoms are getting rid of this character reportedly we'll see if that actually happens it seems like it is and their reaction was oh we didn't want him to get rid of the character\nSo now they're complaining about the fact that their little movie got or a ... this this character removed from the show now they're complaining about it oh we just wanted him to be I mean basically what they're saying is we don't want you to get rid of them we just wanted to write everything that he says\nWell I mean that's not something The Simpsons signed on for yeah sorry\nTwice in the ... race and this is a great lesson for everyone who tries to please save Megan Kelly I think the same type of thing right you can't you can't no matter what you say they're never going to be pleased the people who come after you for these in these nonsensical PC issues\nWill never be pleased no matter what you give them no matter what apologies say no matter how sincere it is no matter who they are not asking you to remove up who they're not asking you to change they're asking for something that you can't possibly give them and the earlier you realize that the better\n[noise]\nLet me change the subject to enough is enough when America will enough be enough\nNew polls Americans fed up\nCrave unity admitted violence now\nThis one should terrify you\nBecause fifty seven percent now say they want a third party\nThey want unity that number is even higher but I'm not sure people actually mean this\nI'm not sure what unity even means and then they say that we no longer really uh agree on the core values of our country which I think is actually true we don't agree on core values\nBut what are those core values\nAnybody know\nWhat are the values that brought up what are the things that were actually\nArguing about now way things are going in the United states twenty five percent are satisfied fifty eight percent dissatisfied the state of politics nine percent satisfied Seventy seven percent dissatisfied\nThirteen percent are like a ...\nPercentage that say Americans are United in agreement about the most important values Fifteen\nPercent Fifteen Percent of us say where United on the most important values my question is what are those values\nSincerely what are we fighting for far we are we fighting for lower taxes\nHere's what the the here's the surveys the shows where we divide on our quote the most important values\nPolitics in this country it's politics of value um moral ethics in our country\nIs that a value\nRace relations gap between rich and poor the state of the news media the way things are going in the U.S the environment the way things are going in your state\nRights for algae beat the status of religion homeland security\nWith an exception of a couple of those aren't values\nThose are issues that is a political campaign and perhaps that's what we're missing\nSee I I firmly believe and I I I wrote this in the book addicted outrage\nWe have a few things we have to decide we have to decide one so western world worth saving is freedom as our founders saw it\nIs it worth saving yes or no\nTo just to you know jump bobbing yeah absolutely why why why is it worth saving who can articulate this\nWhy is it worth saving how has it changed the world in specifics who can make that case among us who's making that case to their kids at dinner at night in specifics\n\nIs America good place or a bad place we have to decide because half of the country says it's a great place half of the country says and I don't even know if these numbers are accurate and half I doubt they are have but let's just say half the country says it's a bad place half the country says it's a good place\nWhich are we sincerely which are we we have to choose deli\nBecause it's a binary choice isn't it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one\nNo no you don't\n\nIt's not a binary choice the answers were both\nWe're both we've been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hell was paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions\nWhat are we going to do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them\nHave you heard anyone actually make the case for America and not just in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important\n\nWhy is the constitution worth fighting for\nBecause if we don't know let's just get on with it man let's just move on\n\nI I'm I we cannot sit here and argue about our greatest issues of our time we don't have our basic living rooms I Want to make sure I have this right our our basic essential values in line\nLike climate change\n\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each other and how do we treat the earth okay that's a value\nThat's on climate change\nClimate change comes off of that value in principle\n\nClimate change is okay is there a problem\nIs there a problem well I'm Sorry but the science is not settled\n\nThe climate is constantly changing it always has to why we we had the ice age ... where were the SUVs for the ice age\nIt always changes now can we do things that can affect the climate I don't know some people say we can some people say we can't\nThe evidence is spotty at best and you can't trust the evidence that is there because we have too much evidence of collusion and ... and in the scientific field\nYou gave me clean cut studies okay\n\nBut that's not even what we're arguing about were arguing about what to do about it see they keep making them about you know whether it's happening or not I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt I'm willing to say okay it's happening All right it's happening what do you want to do about it\n\nWell the solutions are insane the solutions don't work now that is a political discussion that is a political discussion you know where our values come in on that particular discussion when someone says the sciences settled a shot up\nThat's a violation of our values\nWhen people sit down at the table and say look I care about the environment I really do I disagree with the science and here the people on my side that are showing you that this is ... this is collusion\nEnd that yours your system that you're you're you're you're you're touting is nothing more than a political system and it doesn't work\n\nThat's a political discussion those are the things we should have what brings us together at the end\nOr the values\nWe both care about the earth who doesn't care about the earth sincerely who doesn't care about the earth and I'm tired of being lectured by people who will go and protest and leave us see of garbage buying them for others to keep and clean up\nI'm sick of it don't tell me you care about the environment and then after a protest everything is nothing but later\nI have never before endorsed

afford nice cars in fact my dad never bought a new car he always had a a used car I'm the first new car I bought him when I first made it a which was kind of a cool thing\nSo I kinda grew up but I Know students to with that a check engine light oh yeah and even before the check engine light a you know it was ... I Would watch the uh the heat\nAnd you know break off the side of the road and steam pouring out and it was always a nightmare when you have a used car because you don't know the next time you go in and you might have to replace something really expensive you don't have to worry about that now if your car is out of warranty with car shield they'll provide\nFour seven seven roadside assistance rental cars while you're as in the shopping fixed it's all free\nThey pay for you for repairs go now to ... dot com car shield dot com\nVoted already down or do you know this is going on constantly now in the last couple of weeks these elections is totally different way of thinking about this\nAnd of course you know these campaigns like it because it gives them a chance because I'm so many chances to get people to go and get people to to the polls and force them to go early to get all the activists out and they can have them go and you know\nFill pass out you know go take down Ted Cruz signs or whatever the heck they're they're they're a volunteers are doing on that particular day but there's one interesting way of looking at this we talked to a lot about a districts that have changed\nFrom Obama to Trump people who voted for Obama and then changed from [noise]\nAnd there's the other side of that people who voted for Romney and change to Clinton\nAnd there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a let's see if the Thirteen districts that voted for Mitt Romney in two thousand twelve and then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand and sixteen so two thousand twelve on average ... according to five thirty eight had about an eight point advantage for Romney\nAnd two thousand sixteen it was a five point advantage for Democrats [noise]\nSo what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling as of right now\nAre we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in those states so if you look at it it kind of ... just summarize those that kind of lost three points are well well the three point Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six to ... less passionate didn't did you do that and sixteen but a big big move from two thousand twelve got it so they're kind\nOf in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand correcting\nNow they were Twenty one district that voted for Barack Obama and then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one\nOr so in two thousand twelve with Rocco bomb on they had about a six point advantage for Democrats ...\n... in two thousand sixteen that's swung from all the way back to seven points Republican for Donald Trump so it's a huge swing there\nIs that you would think of these real swing districts so far polling you're showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half points but big the big change to it and that was that's almost equal to where they were voting roam around ... so if you look at that the people who were\nVoted for a bomb and then switched to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for Iraq Obama wave Romney\nOr the people who voted for Romney then went to Clinton\nThey're in between those two positions but leaning towards Clinton [noise]\nThat's where these districts show up there is also five states where this is a where this occurred\nFive state of Florida Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin where they voted for all bronco Obama been changed to Trump\nIn the Obama election that had about five point advantage for Obama and those states in the Trump election there was about to point advantage for Trump\nRight now those states are showing eight twelve point advantage for Democrats now now that part of that is it's a little bit different than what you would say in the house where they're broken up into little areas and there's so many candidates and their up all the time\nWe're this is some of these races are just they're so popular Democrats already Pennsylvania's like an example of that where they have been just a big lead or not because I don't think it's necessarily solely because of some switch like soldiers settled ... tell me what all this means from last week or the Democrats\nMaking is is the momentum start just they're just starting to swing back\nTowards the Democrat I Would say it doesn't tell you much about the Senate but it's I think it does tell you something about the house which is [noise]\nThere was that I Hope that there'll be some movement in the house towards Republicans these numbers aren't showing that I mean it right now wait ... seems like the Democrats will take the house uh and the Republicans look pretty solid in the Senate right now when will we see\nAny movement at all are due to the shooting in the bombing [noise]\nWell the polling wouldn't even start probably if you want real polling reaction that at least till today so you have three I mean you're probably not till later this week Thursday or friday the early okay I Will look for this\nElection by numbers [noise]\nOn the Glenn Beck program [noise]\nThis weekend as you know a gunman opened fire at the a tree of life synagogue and Pittsburgh he shot and killed eleven people during Sabbath services injured six others for where police officers the guy was insane\n\nHated Donald Trump that doesn't make him a Democrat doesn't mean that he was you know following I dunno Cory Booker whoever it just means this is not political\nAnd should it be\n\nWe keep jumping to politics first\n\nI Can't imagine what these families are going through\nPennsylvania has taught us before with the Amish\nHow to deal with killers\n\n[noise] if you've been listening to me um for a long time you know what I Believe is coming and have said is coming for a while and I'm always wrong with timing but I don't think there's any way to deny that what I've\nWorn was coming is here now we're seeing the beginnings of it now\n\nAnd it's only going to get worse and it's going to get harder it's going to get harder for you to stand up\nIf they've taken gab down yet I think the\n... the service provider for them has taken them down or I don't know if they're back up as not gaps fault gap is that it's a kind of a shorter\nCompetitor I guess I Would say that they found up are becoming a safe haven for anti Semite so I guess and and and you know I don't want that\nNobody wants that but uh we either believe in freedom or we don't and yes I don't I don't like the poison that they put out\n\nBut I also don't like the silencing of voices this America man this is American principles you can't silent voices\n\nSky was deeply disturbed really bad guy\n\nYou know you watch TV and you see the victims the faces curling across the TV screens\n\nAnd you might think that things are getting worse\n\nAnd I guess historically speaking this is the worst anti Semitic shooting we've ever had in the history of our country eleven people\nOn the positive side that's nothing compared to some countries\n\nI saw some reporter saying you know the problem is is a this is Donald Trump I Hope you I Hope you're happy that do you have your uh your synagogue or I'm Sorry your uh your embassy in Jerusalem\nReally really that's where you're going really\nThis was caused by moving the embassy to Jerusalem oh my gosh\n[noise] wow\n\nYeah Jews were killed in Israel by terrorists last year a hundred and twenty two hundred and twenty two is that Donald Trump's fall to where's that just the evil Jews full how many of France\nFrance they're moving out at a record number because they know they've seen this movie before\n\nSo tired of the west to being to blame for everything that there's nobody worse than us I'm so tired I was tired in two thousand eight when the president at the time was saying you know\nWe're not going to allow people to around up Muslims in the middle of night\nWe've never done that we've never done that stop it you know who he is\nIt was doing a defensive Israel a program in Israel I mean I'm not anti Semitic I'm I point out the facts of what George Soros has used his money\nAh oh really really\nGlenn then now you're saying that he's paid for the caravan no I didn't say that he paid the paid some of the money\nFor the last caravan but I don't have anything on this caravan but let's just look at the facts\nGround zero we climbed Louis we nighttime news radio ... one [noise]\n\n\nThe Glenn Beck program so whether you're here to Alison in Kentucky thanks for holding you're on the Glenn Beck program [noise] good\nMorning when it's so difficult to hear you struggling this morning maybe I can give you some of the long time listeners some advice\nOkay I'm not really well [laughter]\nI like I've been a subscriber to this network ... TV we hearing voice when you're struggling a bit more than ... than usual okay hit my my my advice is make it tangible because there's so many of us that tune in every day and and listening to this broadcast but then we don't make a tangible\nAnd even you were saying that you haven't been doing it shows you haven't been out of the road for a while I think it's going to be so good for you because you need to connect with the people agree my friend and I\nGenerally of I had a a friend of mine that says Vietnam veterans in his seventies and we went all the way that we live in Ashland, Kentucky we got up at two AM drove six hours to Illinois for it that the Trump rally this weekend on Saturday now\nAnd and then stood for eleven hours straight because we we were told the first two thousand people in line would get into the hangar\nAnd we knew we were going to get that way and and as it got through security I'm looking at Georgetown can't wait to sit down and you get to the hangar there were no states so there's a reality of we're going to be standing another six hours on concrete\nSo when I was saying is this president is a lawyer I'm Sorry I just play just playing Bruce [laughter] go ahead tell us or\nI could say it as much as they want you know what we were standing in line making fun of the Carbondale a solidarity network which with a socialist group that was coming to protest they had to have their eleven AM pancake breakfast before they came to protest\nAnd you know we ... we were joking well do you think there were a vegan and gluten free option is to go along with that and the right but there were over ten thousand people there for the rally and less than Seventy five people showed up to protest\nThere was not a piece of heard you say this about your ... function as when you've had the restoring functions\nThere was no garbage we he would never know when there was ten thousand people there no one was complaining I was kind of had to warm up to Trump myself and I was a tendency to go to one of these things because I was afraid if I said one negative thing I was going to be completely shouted down\nNow people were so open about talking and\nYou know someone had to go to the bathroom ... their child stayed with us I mean you're in a group of ten thousand people you trust strangers to watch your child while while you may run and do an errand a comeback real quick it was it was such a positive environment\nAnd you know it's like the president just happened to show up [laughter] it was a ... I'm so glad he's actually going to be in Huntington on friday which has five miles away from where I live I'm so glad I went to Illinois\nBecause I remember standing in line and seeing the the headline break about the shooting mhm and wait we also went through the doubt whether the president was going to show up or not\nAnd this was after we got in the hangar at least been standing there for two hours but we never gave up hope and we were we we all know we had jokes of you know conservatives the one thing liberals can do better than us is chance we can't can't it's like when you classes or something\nYou know we saw that I Believe if I'm really glad we suck [laughter]\nBut you know it it's it was such a positive environment and our legs were or just killing us by the time that he got there\nAnd George not drove back that night it was at twenty eight our road trip that we took for the experience and as exhausted as we were in as much as we were a gang George looks at me and says he's doing one in Missouri later this week as they how far\nIs that well that was that what it was just six hours Missouri was going to be eight but we were going to go\nUntil we found out that this one was going to happen right across the river on friday so fight lake it tangible ... that's the best I can say is go and meet these other people tend to Seventy five\n... we were very quiet people but when you do cut to this rally and there there was just an energy that was there that you realized we can be there is hope for society\nYeah granted I got up and went to Walmart the next morning and people are cutting you off to get to the best parking spot you know yup on how\nAlison hang on to say I want to get your copy of my book I I signed it I'll send it out to you thank you so much for holding him\nThanks for I'm I'm sharing that it is that that is but maybe if I might struggling today\nDo feel like I'm struggling today because I don't feel like I'm struggling to them I'm a little frustrated at ... it'd be mission I Would say to people I'm frustrated that we concentrate on all the wrong things and I think that's kind of what you're saying here\nUm let's see these aren't the things we should be concentrating on you know the the the president or being an anti Semite chief his daughter is Jewish or you know how many Klan members are cool with that I I don't think any relatively", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "29"}
