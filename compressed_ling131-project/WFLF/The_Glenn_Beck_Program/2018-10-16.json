I can pull [noise]\nGoing back program we need to have a power about Elizabeth Warren to now shall we need to make that a oatmeal soup that she made and how I found don't know I think we should try that I Hope that somebody smoking peace pipe on this whole thing\nBecause this is this is just outrageous don't you think yeah she released this big uh basically I Would say presidential audition video yesterday and show everyone that she was for Native American yeah super duper NATO she was she's Cherokee she's Cherokee and Delaware yes\nA which is a is something that does not seem to be backed up by the facts now they first came out and said well the DNA test shows her to be one thirty second uh Cherokee and then they revise that you won ...\n... the media revise they can they actually looked at the report and says one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve and ... then they realized loops deep sea we made a a math there this is a serious correction they didn't say what you do see in the corruption but they pay they should have a cause that always makes everything better sure but it was between\nOne uh one sixty fourth in one one thousand twenty fourth I Believe it was yeah one one thousand twenty fourth now that of course in and of itself so he kept the human body up to what one thousand twenty four pieces that one of them one of those\nPieces would have a little bit of Cherokee\nNow this theoretically right I could at least give her a technical defense of her bull crap over the past fifty years right where she's lying and saying she's\nA you know she's a Native American and she's uh getting benefits for this and she's getting her stupid super recipes in Palau child which is the goal of almost everybody\nIn America how how some wild child and they want to talk about appropriating a culture powwow chow that's right I'm going all ... I'm going all full I\nI've just I'm going to I just but let's all complain about the names of how ... how ... from here on out our our audiences called our tribe and we mean it in the Native Americans sense it's a tribe to trial does\nThe I mean there are studies that show that the average ... percent of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing\nIn her study average person the average person because he I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it up to ...\nShow any DNA from an actual Native American yet what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not participating in DNA studies we don't want\nAny DNA studies so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test the DNA against\nWe have to use people from Peru Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well way\nAnd there's the the theory is that they those the same people want to migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she is Native American blood and it's not even what they tested a and even that it's it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you\nIf you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed and like to point out over the years he would not show the his Canadian blood\nScience like that not only did they say oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian DNA does is it shows the lineage of game shows it's it can be interesting in some ways show migration patterns I Wonder if he would it would have his blood would show that he's\nA thousand times more Hispanic than\nA friend's disorder [laughter] that's true it probably would show that\nUh but so it's interesting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and falling\nFlat on her face first of all as it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was um\nIt was her great great great great grandmother I think a several generations back and um when she register it was in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white\nNow the theory again as put forth by the the war in a campaign and and and and this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of thing you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right ... and they were able to get away with that there'd be some serious incentives to do that\nNumber one obviously what that is true we don't know that is true with this person right we don't know that it was true with hit her great great great great great great grandmother Titanic secondarily yeah but what have we learned from progressive\nWe've learned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white\nAnd now or denying her what she herself has identified as\nShe said she was white and now we're going to tell her she's not that was what I was we were not allowed to apply to any money we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee so we have to\nAccept that she is so we can't accept look what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous this story is just so rich I don't really care I don't care either but I don't care that she's lighting and the people you know she's lying or let me just like\nLook I Want a cigar store\nIndian with Elizabeth Warren's face more than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those yet those got them you know we've got to start making them a [laughter] I Want one more than life itself okay so you know where I'm coming from however you know we all have things I have a story in my family okay\nOf ah one of my great great great grandfather is now my ... my grandfather actually took a horse of being a full size of course he was a he was kind of a vet\nAnd he talked to him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else it but and he took him and he punched him in the head and knock the horse out okay\nSo ... my family my on my mother's side they're big people are and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't have okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather or was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept\nA jumping over and getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this and he picked it up and threw it over the fence\nI don't know if that's true I gotta go in and say it's not my family you don't know [laughter] so he could be truly it might not be true oh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing you oh yeah this is what it was\nBut it was the was it was not true somebody advantages through your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls and I was ... I almost made it into WWE but how many times have you told extra you've been on the air for how many are never never I've never you you've you've\nYeah yeah yeah I get it I get it or she is ... trying to play identity politics and if you're going to play identity politics you better be right on these things\nThat's why I decided I can give you that I got what it's about is I give you then\nAnd you get the nomination comeback close enough to the center to where people are going oh she didn't really mean to shout the abortion thing oh she didn't really mean and cars and so far in the show your abortion people are not going to let you get away with it\nHere you've been eaten you've been eaten\nBy the hard left and the Democrats are waking up to it they don't like what's happening on campuses they don't like what's happening in the news they may not like what's happening in the White House either but they're not about shouting their abortion\nUse your smart speaker to Google Home to plain news radio Ninety three point one WFL my in\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute of maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area make silver sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight\n\nTo claim that Iran\nWill Stanford welcome to the program ledger here how are you sir I Glenn how you doing\nGreat good [noise]\n\nSo uh we'll pay you for having me oh You're welcome a welcome to the program what's on your mind\n[noise] well um [noise] you know I had a written you an email and wanted to say\nThank you very much for being an inspiration [laughter] um and I followed politics since I was eleven years old and I see you as well to the great minds and political commentary today and um recently I I saw an interview between ... Shapiro yeah\nUm and he came out and and spoke about to your past with alcohol and a ... you had asked her to a and I talk to you and are struggling with alcohol myself I'm betting and being drunk when I watched that video I'm you know I I stopped island you know this\nThis man with all the stress that he goes through a he's he's managed to overcome this problem and become a better person I'm really I've seen a good change in your personality I'm you become much more humble and so\nBecause of your inspiration I decided to step out and go to AA myself and uh it's been a huge help\nTo value when did you go to a when did you just start\nAh about three weeks ago and you're still you're still sober Oh absolutely yes or having a great time at that\nReally that wasn't my experience but good for you good for you know [laughter] so ah so ... what was it that was set in that that that turned you\nSay you know it was um [noise] we're talking about the ... it was funny you know of course it was it was really impacting ... D so honest I mean it's it's got to be tough being in the public I Am out something so personal and that that really hit me like a ton of bricks and um\nAnd then you are talking about the uh the the lady and your and your group that said oh\nHoney where all drunks in this room [laughter] and uh I you know I always\nSeen a meetings is probably something lame or or people that wouldn't understand me or anything like that and that was the one moment that really turned my attitude and made me go well I can walk in the door and I can do this and I'll be in good company and I I found that to be true\nBut I tell you will um every a meeting his difference it just depends on where you are and if you do find one that you relate to go find another one\nUh because they are getting wildly wildly different to you walked into a a meeting in midtown Manhattan and uh you know I had a hard time relating to people because they literally were in the gutter and just coming out and I never experienced that in so it was it was different for me\nBut you'll you'll find the people you relate to I'm so happy for you did did people in your life you know that you were having a problem will\n[noise] uh yes you know my my problems had been I'm\nA pretty obvious for a long time I've I've struggled with alcohol for a ... almost Twenty years and uh I first I first got drunk when I was Fifteen I I've always struggled from self confidence issues which is kind of the under current that\nHasn't helped me and um when I was around Nineteen I was in a terrible relationship and had a bad breakup and and got into alcohol to kind of\nCope with it and try and get over it and get over the emotions and I'm\n... I made a terrible drunk decision and kind of been retaliation I committed a crime and um my parents helped me through that time company counseling me things that I needed [noise] but um\nWith their self confidence issues I I have a lot of self hatred that came from committing the crime and are coming out of that I was drunk or every day for about seven years you know and I held my life together\nI I Would sober up to go to work I Would come home and just get tanked and start all over again and then I'm back in ... years two thousand eight I had a terrible accident I was drunk again uh messing around with fireworks\nFrom Wyoming and lost a fifty percent of my left hand\nOh my gosh and I didn't know her up\nI I soak it up for four years and I got married a guy took on three step kids and walked into a different life rebuilt my relationship with God and I came to a point of stress says comes in marriage and um sell off the wagon\nThey were cheap yeah well a typical you know staples office kind of a chair at which they were on the high end but it you know they weren't cheap but they\n... valley thank you oh You're welcome a and a night of the actors in here and it's a big difference I mean you just you know it's you know you have a lot more support you they're more comfortable there you know the the feet you know the features on them when they go up and down they actually work yeah\nAnd everything there is like a hundred and forty four adjustments did you not know is it like a hundred and forty four different adjustments to say it's crazy or you could just sit here I just don't have time I have to sit here\nAll day and just make it absolutely perfect\nSo every day I just adjusted a little bit more like okay oh wait I forgot that feature and you move it in their fantastic chairs feel the difference for yourself ex chair on sale now for a hundred dollars off\nAnd if you go to ... chair back dot com that's ex chair acts the letter chair back BC K. dot com or coal aid for for for X chair\nNext year will come with a thirty day no questions asked guarantee of complete satisfaction you have to sit in it to know you have to adjusted to know\nSo get it acts chair back dot com usa ... bc K. you get a free foot rest as well and the thirty day renewal plus the hundred dollars a off that is on sale right now eight for for for ... chair or ex chair back dot com [noise]\nWash Limbaugh ... knew until three on news radio not every point one [noise]\nI Can't believe it but we are up against the holidays with blinds dot com and getting your home holiday ready doesn't mean that you have to take out a second mortgage you can get brand new made to order custom lines from\nBlinds dot com and they're going to give your home an instant upgrading facelift and it's just in time to impress everyone over the holidays the team of ... going to walk you through the entire measure and installation process\nAnd you can even send them pictures to help guide their recommendations and they'll answer questions via the phone or email or live chat\nPlus you can read all the reviews and see the before and after pictures and get the latest trends and colors and patterns at\nTheir site with Twenty years in the business end over twenty million blind sold blinds dot com is the number one online retailer of custom window coverings for a reason order now through October sixteenth and you'll save\nThirty percent plus take an additional five percent off site why would promote coat back that's up to thirty percent plus an additional five percent off site why did blinds dot com ... Bek\nRules and restrictions do apply\nYeah well look at those to those two versions or wouldn't have been that different on friday night the the guys who are looking for a fight they got into an extra kicks right and so that's maybe five seconds of violence that wouldn't have happened if it went your way\nThat's five seconds out of three days of terror or antifa was was threatening the venue they were giving ... threat to this old lady who answered the phone they're\nGay hang on hang on we're starting to let's go back to what you were doing what the venue is what [laughter] and you have to hit the poster because uh [laughter]\nI think the poster is just to be entertaining but go ahead\nWell I Will try it again the coots she killed a socialist samurai sword in Nineteen sixty and it's a funny trolls that a lot of right wing guys do it sort of like the Pinochet thing where he writes the helicopter rides for comedy is\nReally really fat tire right right so it it it's that kind of set up I announce it on Tuesdays call myself a toy again like Gabby and photo shop myself into his mug shot\nUm second we announced that and anyone who knows me to know is that a satire antifa goes all the blast they start attacking the venue attacking the old lady there the calls are coming from all over the country by the way\nSo this was a planned attack that anti for his work I think the and the and the people are working hand in hand traditional as well organized and well funded\nSo then that those attacks continue that before the venue totally trashed windows smashed ridiculous pretentious manifesto nail to the door that says we put the Republicans on notice a this is only the beginning we are not civil which by the way the Hillary quote\nA and then I get to the venue that night for the next night total in outer chaos because we made signed screaming hurling bottles of urine which one of them hit my car on the way out a ... organized rallies like\nThere's this kind of met that you'll see if you really get deeper into the foxhole where he is calling it the first thing you know you guys go over there over there I citizen journalists get beat up\nTake his backpack their police to arrest him and then\nThey they arrest the citizen journalist\n... no no I'm Sorry to arrest three like at the end who mop this guy okay but I had I interviewed him today and he was talking about coordinated attacks it seemed very military so this isn't anarchy these anarchist or pulling off\nWell you you know I I don't know I'm sure you are um and to FAA Austin\nIs a on their Facebook page has called for a guerrilla style tactics they've they've called for a what do they call it a black shirt army or something or read a a red shirt army I Can't remember 'em but they're calling for\nPeople that just want to go out and do what ... normally does but they're also calling now for a an actual standing army\nAnd they were looking for people that know military tactics that could teach people so that's that's happening and of course Facebook doesn't have a problem with was covering that but\nI must be the Mets had tried the police are looking for that my citizen journalists told me about 'em so yeah that those guys were charged with assault and robbery because they took his backpack so now you know when I by the way peaceful amount of Martin Luther King I must say I saw the same experience right up till now and it's been days\nAnd then when it's time to leave I come out there I've got my plastic sword I make\nA choice which the joke and that's something ... may I jump in the car\nAnd then a group of Proud Boys are are the last ones to go they they leave and the video just came out yesterday on breaking nine one one on Twitter they were attacked by antifa fully clad with all their gear and they throw a bottle at them and the huge fight breaks out and now\nIn your world that fight would have been you know hey cops cops or something like that\nAnd then I'll come actual it's a little bit longer but again five to ten seconds different so we're splitting hairs here you know the real issue is we're up against homicidal lunatics which no gender NO PLAN it's not like they know where we're going to get you know our our gas and oil from after the revolution\nWhat's not what you'd expect for someone to whom the sermon on the mount mount with divine commanders as you can if us\nBut we we we got here altogether through all this mess and all this suffering and here we are in the fridge country of the world and we get people complaining thing America was never great\nAnd and that's what pissed me off and it's ironic that we ... we get caught a white supremacist because the reason we love America is it doesn't bother with all of that crap\nGame and we had this for a long time I think the media basically just said antifa was the baby didn't exist they ignore them completely in as the violence has escalated their new tactic seems to be well yes there's violence but it it's the Proud Boys fault or the right wing ...\nHave you noticed or they're just exercising my favorite is they're just exercising their\nFirst Amendment right of the assembly and Patricia of course of course I'm curious if you have if you detected a difference recently\nI'm In the approach from the media as it is trying to make your group\nThe real a village the real villain in this because I mean I I ... you know there was a ... a tweet string going on about the alleged violence by Proud Boys members and he was re tweeted by people like ... like the big time reporters were going after this you become I think a central target in this is that do feel that\nDefinitely I think that the DNC put their uh hate is not hate has no home here that the only thing they have to say to America and it's an idiotic thing to say that's like saying well we we are sick of albino violent\nLike what was this really weird concept the evil Nazis and they said we're going to rid America of the clan and Nazis\nNow there are not so they go ... uh we got to expand the net here and so now anyone who disagrees with them as part of this evil hate that has to stop and I unfortunately have fallen into that\nThat definition and it is [laughter] it's amazing that anti ... and the media and the DNC are all in groups like Cuomo was saying hey this is like a a match and you put it on dry\nDry grass and then the wind just takes that I think the matches and chased by the wind is the media and it can't be are starting fires\n[noise] I don't I ... I I have to tell you I have a hard time disagreeing with that I'm seeing the way the\nUh the left has just consumed the DNC I mean there there's you know when you when you're into a ... organization where you're starting to say you know shout your abortion and\nUm and and that kind of really despicable kind of a a behavior you're bound and determined to start just going way off the rails and they're they are they're they're the extremist party now\n... and it's it's getting so great I mean they used to and at the same as in Britain by the way the way that it the anti uses and keep their paramilitary kept paramilitary wing here\nOr the media here is that the hottest over there and and the attitude in both cases the enemy of my enemy is my friend and then she says language and the DNC language getting more and more similar just like that noted that we're not still that's what he said well let me go low\nWhen they go low we kick them or Maxine Waters saying no no freedom no L. P. sure would ever go to their own attack then we've got people on CNN saying that Sarah Huckabee Sanders ... for the rest of her life that's alleged Denton it's at the same thing about Susan Collins they're sending race in\nRepublicans they got Rand Paul's wife sleeping with the gun we've got senator is getting that text to be heading trick cabinet comes in I mean can you tell the difference in all those stories between at the end it in the daytime pretty similar to me\nGiven McGinnis thanks for other appreciated chairs Douglas\nKevin McGinnis or from the er TV get off my lawn or [noise]\nThese are the conversations we should be having we should be looking inside and saying what is it I Believe what works what doesn't mercury\nYou is your smart speaker and say Alexa plain news radio ...\nAmerica all ready have this power you should too\nBy voting yes on amendments three\nMain political advertisement paid for by voters in charge PO box Nineteen Ninety One Orlando, Florida three ... and\n... down here you are you looking ... what are you doing in mind your sense of ... it's been amount time since we've had an adventure and my last year and he said Steven took me a long time to get here you're right [noise]\n\nYou're listening to Glenn Beck ... [noise]\nYou know in the in the book addicted outrage I [noise] I\n... some people who haven't read the book I think that it is about um a surrendering or or just making friends with the left and it's not it's not what this is about at all\nIt's about knowing what you believe and then taking a strong stand but with a different approach because times have changed and um\nAnd they're getting more and more dangerous and I have\nTalked to you about Martin Luther king for a long time or a somebody who wrote a read my book who [noise] um I really respect they they read it and they said a\nYear about a year to to a head I'm not sure\nUm maybe maybe\nBecause I think more people will look at this as things become crazier and\nCrazier maybe but it's not about\nIt's not about reuniting with the left because I don't think you can unite with the the left the left has gone insane I think you can with a lot of Democrats and I'm not talking about the ones in Washington I'm not talking about political people I'm Talking about your neighbors but the first thing we have to do is unite\nWith each other we have to unite to people people who are or on\nThe right part of the spectrum need to come together we have to come together\nAnd I'm I'm really I I'm I don't like the hey you're on the train or you're not on the train what he's talking about what train where's the train\nGoing here's the train that we should all be on\nThe declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights because that's why people came here in the first place people die\nIn the middle of the night in the desert to get here because we have a a rule of law be we do not have a class system you can break out if you work hard you're smart and you're a little bit lucky you can break out\nYou can change the world you can invent something in your garage and become Bill Gates\nThat's America that's great that's why people come here and we're losing sight of that until the first thing they have to do is ask are we worth saving and I think the answer\nAcross the board I'll bet you eighty percent maybe Ninety percent of America Says yes America is worth saving so what does that mean well capitalism capitalism but not necessarily the way we're doing it\nNow where it's playing favorites the constitution but we haven't\nBeen on the constitution nor the bill of rights that a long time but we do need a rule of law let me start asking you know just a few questions and I don't care who he voted for I don't care what side of the aisle you're on just answer yes or no do you hate\nMen\nBut what he does something right yeah I did that look at that huh call balls and strikes that's where America is the first thing we have to do is come together behind those\nPrinciples I don't care if you are on the Democratic side of the Republican side or the independence I don't care I don't care who you voted for in the past I don't care what you believed in the past what\nDo you believe now do you believe we're on the ropes\nDo you believe this system of government is worth saving do you believe this this capitalism is worth saving do you believe the the scientific method is worth saving\nGreat than let's stand together and put our our differences of approach aside\nBecause we've got a lot of work to save this thing right now [noise]\n\nBy the way Kevin has already been silenced on Twitter and voices don't start coming together uh [noise] more are going to be silenced for what was it five or six hundred\nA where silence last week from Facebook and I don't see anybody talking about it we'll

spike a hundred twenty a hundred and forty dollars a barrel that's what collapsed us last time in two thousand eight was a spike to a hundred and thirty or a hundred and forty dollars a barrel\nYou

going to come from Saudi Arabia anymore and you know where they're going to go to get it now obviously there is other places for them to get money for the tech industry but it was easy money\nOr from the Saudis it was a easy to get they had plenty of it they were looking to invest it and when you lose a huge source of funding like that it's you know can hurt the industry\nYou also have Saudi Arabia being the massive check on um uh on Iran\nIf they are weakened if uh they are a weekend in the area not only with Iran but also the Muslim Brotherhood that's a significant force in our favor in
