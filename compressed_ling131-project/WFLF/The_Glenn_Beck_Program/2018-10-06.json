I mean we had rain but I I'm not on top of the hill\nYeah yeah it could be the opposite also I drop some fruits by the extension of who say if they can take a look at him see if there's anything inside of them or anything because when you get that hundred percent drop like that something dramatic is happened then is normally a cultural problem can be over fertilizing anything like that\nI have seen a lot of stink bugs around them or they\nYoga or they can they can sing them and you'll get little spots on the fruits when that happens you'll see a white spots and and and that could traumatized them enough to cause that type of drop something like that had to happen\nOK\nOkay saying I have a great gardening de Pere shaded last caller today Germany is Larry in Little Rock ledge very good morning to you the wrong time yes how can we help you today\nYeah been planning on putting in my beans are just are fascinated by I've got a bunch of Kentucky wanders that I Know it's a little late season and the effect of grow right\nYes beans are quick crop uh so you have a probably a pretty much to mindset sixty days and plus a little bit of December so and you're in rock ledger warmer anyway uh so you you should do fine\nAll right I'm pretty sure\nYou have a great gardening de ... that was the last call today a here's a question here came in for a text message uh what do you feed corn with you know you can actually fertilized corn with lawn fertilizer you gotta remember corn is say a grass and so a higher\nThe region is what it needs but it also likes to the needs of a phosphorus into potassium\nSo make sure whatever product to use has all three nutrients with nitrogen being a higher when I go through I just fertilize mind the other day and I used to a liquid fertilizer and you have to do that more often so I'll go through with a liquid fertilizer made for vegetables and flowers\nAnd use it about every two weeks otherwise you can get any general fertilizer vegetable garden fertilizer which will contain the nitrogen phosphorus and potassium but if you really want it to you could use a lawn fertilized or at least once or twice\nA but you want to make sure you have enough phosphorus potassium also because the phosphorus is what helps uh with the your your production so you get a good a good fruiting so\nOr anyone that you want to use there will be fine hey Columbus Day weekend or remember Columbus discovered the pineapple and a fourteen Ninety three a it's a holiday\nWe don't celebrate too much but if you go up north you will find much more celebration going on for Columbus Day so maybe you might want to revive that tradition just a little bit Brian thank you for being here and have a great weekend Julia or a new or whether you\nRub it in ... and I don't forget some of those weeds and landscaper edible Joni goes all the weeds on okay have a good weekend everybody everybody have a break we keep your questions handy don't forget you can get up on our website better on top you can do there to listen if you want to do with our\nPodcast where you can download it and I'll listen to us during the week we're happy to have to do that and uh also uh uh you can just get up there and just send the message or keep your questions handy will be here for you next\nWeekend this has been lunging guards on comic out as an extension agent or they're just with the University of Florida and as far as talking entertainment that word\nRained gets under there and that little gaffe an get sucked up and as we get like a sponge and then routes or do you have is this the paint on the outside but as soon as you touched that frame you put your finger you flip through it because is rotted out again\nAnd something else suggested you know years ago a before fiberglass was really around I put in metal doors all the time 'cause that's what was the popular thing but\nWhenever you do that or if you're doing it yourself or you're having a painter are carp and to do it um I Would take to the door off the frame to paint in Atlanta and saw saw us this is what I did but I always painted the underneath because there's a piece of wood and the bottom correct in the metal would go over it and you'd see metal doors start to rest on the bottom\nRight and then the the piece of wood where outright out\nRight so the the rest often happen because of the wood rushing out the ...\nBecause they hadn't been painted and you know if you're going to environmental doing about the wooden frame at the bottom before we even paint the underside they cook around the edges with a mental and the would mean mhm just seal that said no more she gets in between and wakes up\nThen paint the wood to prevent any further issues\nYeah so I adore actually has six sides not just two sides so you have to get all six sides sealed and painted\nBut I'm going to tell you we could go to a subdivision right now and put a mirror underneath and you'll see oh I'm sure at ten out of ten yeah aren't painted em right and it doesn't cost anything you have the pain and maintenance not extra money or anything\nLike this or to go back in time and a little bit of if at all it is\nSo for our listeners out there if you're putting in New doors or even if you are very painting your house or take the time to take that use door off and and throw a little coat of paint underneath no harm in the top two yup yes at the top you don't have the problem like you do in the bottom the bottom of is quite often you know subject to more moisture in the top\nSo I imagine you see that a lot\nOn among Vakifli almost every house for ... will constantly there there's a subdivision\nOr in like Mary in at the Gulf and country club mhm I convinced they do the home inspection by memory because I've been speaking so many of the condos that they all have the same issues\nThe doors being number one and the windows being number two because they don't\n[noise] they couldn't build a grade windows and nobody recourse around them so that oil leak and wood frame building\nIt drops out the address out the wood frame and so ah the wolves eventually collapse\nRight for our or people who live in points Hannah who've been there for a while or who nowhere Marian is a many many years ago Twenty years ago I had a couple of firemen who worked for me as electricians you know they work so many hours in their off for a few days sworn off\nDays are they worked for me and uh one of them also volunteer down in points to enter um I ... on point she and a parkway they used to be a I'm a volunteer fire department and now they built the seven eleven in there\nBut anyway there was not much and like Mary and it was how was this one here when they are in in wooded areas so one weekend day my one of my guys was working there had to fire station they guy came in had been out of town and he was asking for a report on his home he just found out as it burned down you know burned to the ground it was wood frame\nSo they went and they didn't have any information as far as they know there was no house fire and like marrying their area so they went down there in the fire truck and they clean this lab but the whole is burned completely to the ground if there was nothing left\nThey are but it you know it burned itself out after a while yeah just interesting if you're living in the ... what can happen\nRight 'cause that area is no longer the ... by them know that places built up but yeah when you've got an acreage nobody though to says\nYeah in a ... and that might be with the new smoke and and see oh detectives come into like was it a lot of them are smart\nAnd they can communicate so you don't have to be home but if a fire breaks out it'll notify you on your cell phone\nYeah I mean in in my house or not the one island now the first one I built a I had a security system in a regular smoke detector system and then the fire alarm system so one day I'm torn my oldest daughter around to colleges you know\nA she wanted to look at all the colleges we went all over the place even the gators\nUh we're far away and my cell phone rings and uh it's my security company you know asking me if I'm at the house they have a report that is a fire going on and would you like me to send the fire department\nAnd I live in just a ground yeah it was I did\nBut at the that was a lousy feeling yeah and you know I was like two and a half hours away\nFrom home come to find out my son came and he was cooking a hamburger and then went and took a shower or something of smoked up the house but there was nothing going on\nBut you know I think that's something I don't understand about security companies although\nI don't understand why they cook a hamburger and go take a shower either but that's another story that\nTeenagers yeah but you know they'll call you a there's a fire or someone's broke into your home would you like us to cool the sheriff's department\nWhy would I Want you to do that right you know I understand that this is the ... you know the they call the the sheriff's office in a false alarm is a fine and fall\nBut write that into the contract so that if something does happen use a homeowner liable\nYou know and then call and say there's been a break that the house we notified the sheriff's department\nWell I think over the years there there's so many false alarms with burglar alarm systems uh-huh that you know they were driving the sheriff's department and the city police\nIt happens that are long would show room or frequently for whatever reason we have a limited amount of security cards that we can pass out and inadvertently someone will get left there after hours and they don't have their security card so they can't turn the alarm off so they'll leave and lock up and then the next person comes in in the morning and\nIn my in my building we have the same thing courage and get in and out but if somebody doesn't turn the alarm on it when they leave for any reason\nIt automatically arms at a certain hour you know yeah and then it disconnects at a certain hour in the morning as well but uh you have to have security today yeah sure on one of them false alarms that it was about two thirty in the morning\nI I you know I went out there just to make sure I met the sheriff they walked and went and nothing was ... there was no breaking though nothing\nBut the canine Corp came he said do you mind if I was just let the dog go through the whole building you know right I don't want to go home and go to sleep anyway and I go to the dog ran around for a couple of hours they got to train them right yeah so uh\nAnd speaking at two o'clock in the morning I Want to talk about smoke detectors and smoke to fix the batteries at some point today so we're going to go to a break and our phone number is four o seven nine one six fifty four hundred toll free eight six six nine one six fifty four hundred\nOr you can text me two three six eight zero that's

season we just\nWe need more great ac installers and they see a technician so\nCharlie since this is the mutual admiration society meeting this morning [laughter] um\nYou very seldom talk about it but I've got your family value plant mhm and it's something on the phone believer and why don't you explain that this is what the family value plan is\nWell it's in a maintenance plan basically to to ah to make sure your your home is still in in good shape because things happen I was just just fall apart as time goes on and uh it covers your electrical your plumbing euro conditioning the three items that we do it I saw I was at all and um\nWe come out to your house twice a year to maintain your air conditioner\nOr we'd go through it from a to Z we clean up the drain line and make sure all the capacitors and contact does all the things that fail in a regular basis because of wear and tear\nI'm over in good shape so you know one of them people call my air conditioned is not working it's not cool and it's not running you know uh and people get very emotional and all you have those calls every day yeah but they're usually not from our people with the ace family value plan with the people who\nDon't maintain their system as long as I Walk in the house and it's cold air conditioned working fine yep and uh and the most important thing a ... a homeowner can do\nIs to change the filter every month because we don't change to filter it gets filthy brought the stuffed drops in the pan under the coil and ended up going to drain line plugs that drain line up\nA and it's not if that's going to happen it's one that's going to happen to be an even worse than that it can do damage to your home it can uh you can get mould and ruin wood floors and have water we not supposed to have water\nAnd then we go out to your home or a once a year for electrical safety check to make sure your houses or let a electrically safe\nAnd a similar thing with plumbing we make sure to shut off work and we check everything and if you have any bad flap as will change to a year um with the electrical I spoke a little bit of both smoke detectors this will change the batteries and then up to four smoke detectors as well\nYou never pay a Carlo charge whether it's a dispatch for you whether it's during the day or at night\nAnd um and you get a discount on any service from repair work Fifteen Percent off our regular price so there's plenty of value put into it um and it you know I always kind of a equated to people take better care of their car\nThan they do their home and it's a much smaller investment is just that they're active with the car right day in and day out and then some people don't take care of the car either so imagine their home you know the people who you know\nI remember I had a friend up north and uh uh he he learned a lesson he bought a new Camaro and he never changed oil it came up and talk and he was another electrician he says\nBut when I add the oil I bought I had the best that they sell at the gas station said Dave that ain't gonna work he blew the motor up yeah wrapping and this and that after that uh every three thousand miles he changed the oil faithfully yeah but that was inexpensive less than he had a car that was\nBought new never changed the oil like four years later\nChanged the engine yup and you don't want to do that with your air conditioner your air conditioner should last a without a lot of trouble Fifteen Years if you take care of it if you're not sometimes it's six eight years with changing your air conditioning not that there's anything\nWrong with that manufacture it could be installation as well but I'm just because you don't take care of it\nSo um it's just like yourself you got to take care of yourself right you go to a doctor or if seemed to be okay they still will you go for physical they weigh you take your blood pressure your polls and go through the ... you know at a fall that's good you're probably pretty good health\nUm even if you go in for a scrape knee they check check all that stuff so I'm just a matter of taking care of it because\nUm we don't meet many customers who are putting money away for their air conditioner right and it's not a five dollar item you know what I mean they're putting money away for their kids' education or a vacation or a new car and then when the air conditioner breaks or they're not happy campers without\nWhen you've got to it comes time you're gonna have to put a couple of thousand dollars in a machine that is really been abused for eight or ten or twelve years it's kind of a dumb investment might as well get a new one but then take care of it right or it's just that simple so\nPeople get very emotional when they come home from work at five six seven o'clock in the evening or and they call our office they have no air conditioning and you know the sky's falling right so have you had your air conditioner fail logo\nOn a good day no ... is is the capacitor last time so relatively inexpensive fix but you know that you had to go to ... without air conditioning yeah a couple of days being uncomfortable now that would be caught we test every compassion are and if it's in that particular range\nOr it's good if it's not will tell you this thing needs to be change is not doing what it's supposed to do and you don't have to if you don't want it can go a couple of days without air conditioning when it finally failed you know 'cause there's a capacity for some of the motives in for the\nCompressor and it helps them start and you can do damage as well and some of the new uh uh motives are not cheap there over a thousand bucks apiece so you don't want them to fail for a small part\nYou know and and folks is the secret to that plan because they come at twice the you get them to come out at the beginning of spring\nThat's what we try to do but ... the or\nThe real facts as there's people that their systems working right so they don't want to do right now I'm ... you know the beginning of spring and the and the middle of all if I was in you clean the elements get rid of the dust so you can get the smell and you start

Senate prepares for a final vote on Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination what makes today different is that most demonstrators will be kept outside the only way\nUh yeah you want it you know what I was saying to you is that the state if you own a state have a hold of state license they get a copy as well and if you don't have insurance you license gets put on hold\nYou know you can't do any business in ... does all those are the counties that I work in the cities I work and they all have a you know they're all listed as a a a a certificate holder as well\nAnd it can be tempting to try to hire somebody that is not license or insured but the ... the risks are just not worth it you can you can end up spending ten times or even more the cost of that job that where you just said a couple of dollars\nIf I didn't have to have public liability and workers' comp that bottom line would move\nYeah we I mean you're you're not just a liable for the or your your exposure is not just limited to shoddy work you're also liable if the\nPerson doing the work is hurt on your property absolutely and the ... you know the insurance claims will be denied if they don't have the proper insurance in licensing and everything else that they're supposed to have and I don't know if the insurance cover to cover would cover your insurance company if I had to lend license contrary exactly something happened\nI I Know people who've lost their property because they hired somebody that that a worker that they thought they were hiring you know somebody that it was\nJust hired Joe blow and he had some workers and they just assume that they were insured and had workers' comp and somebody got hurt and so what happens when they get hurt if they go to the hospital I say where's your health insurance but I don't have health insurance okay with it on the job workers' comp I don't have workers' comp so the question becomes who's going to pay for that and\nThe law there there is case why out there that the homeowner can be in that case be considered the employer and be sued for for not you know providing insurance to that person 'cause they were the ... facto employer and people have lost their homes over\nYou know so let's not let it happen to anybody who's listening so right All right in a way we can protect or our customers as well as by using as to seal to send all our employees through before we hire them so why don't you explain what your business does to people who may not know\n\nWe lose you add some reason we have a lousy connection so\nSo we can explain a little bit about its business how how that we're we don't need you ed\nYeah [laughter] but go ahead and call back I think\nUh yeah it's company does is are we use them been using them since he went into business I think and\nHe uh ... anybody we want to hire\nWe have to submit first of all that in my company would first we submit to a license to our insurance company and they tell us to if he's a can drive or not and then after that I submitted to they have to sign a form given permission and we submitted to edge company and they do a national background check out the whole country\nYou know a real deep dive deep down and make sure that they're okay and then after that we have a drug test and uh and and then you know everybody who works for us\nUh has the seal of approval from asked to seal will send a picture of what a little by on them and so forth\nAnd uh and then\n... years ago I background check the guys just you know a local type of thing and\nAnd uh and you might be worth ... with me for ten twelve years and you never get checked again but it does a better check and he also or does it on a regular routine basis yeah at least every year he checks them again so it's a great thing because\nYou know there are some ... we're in a home improvement type business right electrical plumbing in air\nWe're in hundreds of homes a week and a and and I want to make sure that isn't my guys are a trustworthy and that doesn't mean that guy goes nuts at some point but uh\nWe start off on a good clean thing and try to keep it that way and it's not only for contractors a lot of us contractors habits are all kinds of businesses you can go to asked us as to seal dot com\nAnd look up a jeweler who's honest or an accountant or wealth advisor um all kinds of things in it doesn't cost you anything or as a consumer to use it you don't you don't have to give your email address you don't have to give any information uses the when they put the ZIP Code where you live in what you're looking for\nAnd we've run a an ad can I can probably say exactly how many but we've run thousands of people through between of the state of floor\nSo here um but add I mean the ... one thing that you said that I thought was going to push the button and see if you yeah I I think he's back with us but yeah\nI'm here yes open promote your business you we don't even need you anymore I I've been able to hear your yeah okay [laughter] you don't need me\nNow but one thing that had said that is you know if we submit an employee for um for the ask the steel background check and they were denied um they're going to be working somewhere but at least we know that they're not working for us\nAnd the same roof or you're not I've had some guys that look good on the on the surface you know sure seemed we given aptitude tests they did pretty well we had\nOne recently and uh there was pages at that you sent us\nOkay problems and of course we didn't hire him you know that same week we sent another one for a drug test and he didn't study long enough he was on coke so we need him either but yeah\nAnd I you know I tell people this is the these are dangerous times when when the labor market is is high and it's hard to find people to do\nYour labor air conditioning plumbing electoral that sort of thing uh there there's a larger temptation for companies to cut corners and thank God I Can't find anybody I'm just going to lower my standard or a you know I really need somebody I'm going to hire this person ... you know despite the fact that they've got to burglar convictions\nOr they say I just don't want to know anymore and I stopped doing background checks or\nI told you I was on a blog a few months ago I I think I cut and paste it and sent it to a fellow ... fellow contractor and up in the Carolinas or got so disgusted a few years ago we started at a higher felons and he said it hasn't had any problems yet\nYet yet she has her that he knows a yeah just crazy\nI'm so it's scary and people just assume that the contractors are going to be responsible and and do the checks and not put somebody dangerous or and they're bringing into their home and it happens every day they'd be shocked at how often have happened\nYeah I was at a trade conference this past week and I was talking to a few friends and from all over the country and and uh we got to talk and so there's some guys in his area\nAre you know that he couldn't hire but they went to work somewhere else and the company that they went to to the public you know they sound like they do with what they should but in reality they don't you know they don't check to people so\nHe's lost a few guys and he noticed these seen him in those other trucks you know right in that game\nAnd that's why I started to feel I was in the air conditioning pondering business and we were we were background check people that we were interviewing and yeah we have people routinely coming from our competitors who had\nBurglary and some really nice to be sex crime a conviction and they were working for a competitor to advertise that they background checked all their ... and that's what\nThat's what really got me and and caused me to start this company is that I said you know these guys are saying they're doing these things and the customs consumers are believing that and then I just didn't think it was right\nNo it's certainly not so how does somebody use your service and it doesn't have to be in these trades it can be for a multitude of things\nYeah um so you can go to the field dot com every time and they all we do is ask for what trade they're looking for in a ZIP Code and will show them company that we've verified their license shrimp every background check their field employees as well as people checking credit cards are back at the office\nOr and if you're not comfortable doing that on the computer that can call us during normal business hours during the week eight hundred for ten feel and will be happy to do the search for them and and help him a different medium for mission over the phone\nAnd does if if somebody types and asked to seal dot com or go to you as well because that's what I been telling everybody\nYeah it's it's the I so if they both go to the same place where we start with what we've done is split it out for contractors and consumers so when you go to the field\nYou can say I'm a consumer and I'm looking for a company and ask the field or you can say I'm a company that cares about my customers and you can you can go on to get the field but either way atrophy or to seal both go to the same place\nOkay great well I appreciate your calling in and thanks for your help with the insurance situation as well\nBanks guy who are out we'll see you next week bill\nYeah right at

have said that scrub that but\nThey came out and they gave me a check for forty five thousand everything was fine\nUntil I said this is not enough\nThey eventually pay that title of a hundred and five thousand 'cause we we had hurricane hit that the tornado touch the house during hurricane Charlie\nAnd we moved out of the house for eight months while they repaired everything and insurance company had to pay for all of a combination and stuff they as a as well right um but we've got a hundred and five thousand to fix the house\nSo you know I I Would imagine the lesson here is probably the same
