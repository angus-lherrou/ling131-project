F. L. A. [noise]\n\nHeadlines right now a mail order item is responsible for causing a brief scare in Polk County this will show you how on edge where you all are after all the mail bombs uh winter haven woman showed up at the sheriff's office with a package mailed to her that looks suspicious looked like all those mail\nBombs okay the sheriff's office was evacuated while the package was inspected well the all clear was given once investigators found out that that package was just an item that the woman had ordered in the mail\nAnd had mailed to herself all was well updates at least every ten minutes and a top stories throughout the morning here on good morning all end up from the\nIt's amazing\nWhat a smart phone will do in one of the great features is the incredible set out of the of the\nOf the cameras that are a part of ... smartphone technology may take magnificent pictures\nYou know and I guess we've all got hundreds maybe thousands of them on our smartphones and and that's where you have to go to see 'em if you can find them and their permanently trapped inside your smartphone\nAnd I always thought well you know there's really no economical way to get them all out of there and read them all up et cetera and my wonderful wife Linda is proven me wrong she's involved in this\nReally cool little project that if you haven't done it you might want to consider doing it 'cause it really works wonderfully well and it's easy to do and trust me if you could afford a smartphone\nYou can afford to do this\nShe is liberating\nI think it's in total going to be more than a thousand family photographs kids grandkids all combinations of extended family taking over the last ten years she's owned a smartphone\nAnd and and getting them in bunches of Seventy five or a hundred um printed up at the local pharmacy photo desk\nAnd it's really cheap to do and the prince come out for my six nice glossy beautiful the picture was good\nThe photos gonna look just as good\nAnd and it it's amazing I mean\nYesterday I saw a shot of me dancing at my daughter's wedding with my now Thirteen year old granddaughter literally on my shoulder when she was three I haven't seen that photo in ten years\nAnd it's the most wonderful thing and then I said listen what are you going to do now you're going to go out and you're going to buy photo albums and we're gonna you know ... we're going to have them all over the place and taking up space we don't have she says no I'm not doing that\nShe has one big box okay and in their sheep bottles um up according to categories whatever certain combinations of certain people or whatever it happens to be\nAnd um she puts them in a Ziploc bag\nAnd and labels what they are what the ear is who was involved in that and puts them in a box anytime you want to take them out you take them out and you're just you know ... anybody wants to see a within the family make reprint to do the whole thing yeah the it's unbelievable and it is so much fun\nAnd and we've liberated all of these photos that were trapped inside the smartphone where nobody ever saw him\nYeah that happens a lot a lot of people they take pictures on their phone and they just you know forget about 'em and they leave 'em there that's why I always post them on Facebook or Instagram or something but at least somewhere short\nBut at least somewhere but when I hear you know there's something about you know modern technology is just amazing smartphones are incredible there's something about being able to hold those shiny glossy prints in your hand and actually yeah I Do to him again you know and it's just kind of a cool\nEven though people like CNN or are you know calling these are mocking those who call these are an invasion but\nWhat do you call a group of people two thousand four thousand seven thousand strong marching to a border saying you're going to cross whether the country wants your not while carrying another country's flag ...\nWhat what do you call that\n[noise] you know the reason why you have to stop this if it's coming the reason why you have to stop it is because if you don't stop this one there will be an invasion because\nAmerica can control our own borders\nNearly eight thousand troops to match what four thousand strong caravan fourteen thousand if the second caravan linked up with the first swelling their numbers just seven thousand so any media magician trying to spin what this caravan really is\nAnd I honestly don't know how you can describe a potential force of seven thousand people all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\n\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no\nBut what does America say\nIt is classic mail is ... military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country that has not happened before\nBut I said I Want to be fair here unexpected and a regular tactics call for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing that men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\nI don't know what you can expect what should you do nothing nothing\nIf you had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house and they said we're going to go into your house whether you like it or not\nAnd we've got two thousand people here and you're not going to be able to stop us because what's in your house we want we're just going to live there\nNow if you had a group of people that were marching\nSaying that coming to your house\nWould you want the police to do nothing what'd you think that would you be happy if the police all of a sudden just said you know what they're not\nCommon for you know cute they they're on the road there on the road there they are there's the video there's the video them saying they're going to come into my house and live in my house oh please\nI don't know about you but the next time there was a campaign I shouldn't be running for sheriff\n\nLocal law enforcement protect our streets the border patrol protects our borders\nThe new standard cannot be the military on our borders a hundred percent of the\nTime\nEmergency situations always give birth to emergency changes which always turn into permanent changes\nThe federal income tax the Patriot act two examples of many\nI don't like emergency measures that's why we should have a border policy that allows immigrants to come in that are qualified\n\nCome in through the front door\nAnd stops all of the side windows and the back door and trees\nThe country needs either\nSerious policy on the border that will stop this\nOr you need to build the damn wall because quite frankly the military on the border is not a good solution but I'm Sorry CNN\nI don't know what you want to call it I mean after all you don't like to call you don't like to call and to fall when they're throwing Molotov cocktails you don't even like to call them a mob\nGlenn Beck program\nDirection by numbers\nLet's take a look at election by a numbers fellows do tell me what's happening\nSo far well uh we're one week away and this is when we get balls you with a chart a little bit because we have had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of toss up category yep I'm biggest polling has been close and now we start to\nTry and move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are down to only three tossup races or we have moved uh Missouri and Indiana\nInto a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident us Indiana\nThe polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time\nUm but we're moving those to lean Republican but the lives there was a Ted Cruz's still lean Republican state\nAh and ah ah Mississippi and North Dakota there's going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican senators have there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure tossed up still and we couldn't really move them\nArizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls for Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points place falling as a lot closer are really a toss up race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the tops of category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we've moved to Florida to a lean Democrat date\nAgain this is a tough race cars you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen\nA movement towards about put towards a Nelson in Florida and we now have that one is a lean Democrat state um we moved from Minnesota as well from faith Democrat to leaning Democrat appalling there [noise] yeah [noise]\nI still think that's going to the Democrats but at the polling is closer than I think most people expect there's two reasons in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we've moved to lean Democrat as well or was a tossup races for most of the time it looks like tester as a sign up enough of a lead there to consider this one to be\nLeaning Democrat at this point ah and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin and leaning Democrat as well so if if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three forty five for Democrats so\nI mean it's pretty it's [noise]\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate\nThat is a lot of started to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida was discouraging I think for Republicans the past few days Montana's not turning around you know we've seen no signs of real movement I I don't think in West Virginia\nAs well which was a big hope for a pick up again this was a state that voted for Trump by thirty points and Joe mansion I think he\nI think he's solidified his seat there with his pro Kevin Olival yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and high camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's\nThe majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slight leaders were moving these days I Would normally keeping those in the tops of categories of or a week away and we got to pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now I mean people are voting all across the country right now or it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break and come back and give us some of those results on the house term\nLecture and by numbers [noise]\nOn the Glenn Beck program\nOr don't want to tell you about our sponsor this half hour it's filtered by a filter by\nIs a great service really truly a great service I I'm going to be honest with you I've I've I'm I'm uh fifty three\nIt's not I wouldn't say it's dramatically to the left but it does seem to be leaning that would get\nOut and vote knew not to sit this election out get out and vote\nDo what is

Institute of maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit ... dot com or call a\nBallet [noise]\nWFL a\nWeight is news stand up to talk about it was already on ... on anyone [noise]\nGlenn Beck man [noise]\nWelcome to the program Mr pat gray who ah proceeds this program on the blaze radio and television network a and also has his a podcast that you can listen to and download\nAt your leisure welcome to the program Patt big news of the day to you is\nI Would say the possibility of the president issuing an executive order ending birthright citizenship ... problem\nWell problem it's an executive order I'd agree with them [laughter]\nSo you're all day with it yeah whatever [laughter] it was not the justification yeah that is the justification I think what would happen is it would be challenged parts and then it would go to the Supreme Court which finally\nOkay force the Supreme Court to rule on that the fourteenth amendment is not about is not about illegals coming you're dropping babies and having them be citizens out what it's about no\nThis was clearly again I said yesterday everything after the tenth amendment basically is a ... and it's just to\nReiterate or did you not get this yes blacks we mean black people to\nGay that right on the thirteenth amendment fourteenth amendment is oh Gees okay and then I'll stop it yeah you're gee you literally Democrats knock it off ... yes their children are citizens to yeah that's what this was right this is not about coming over here and\nHaving a baby and then you know sneaking in cross it having a baby and then being able to bring all your family here\nLudicrous someone that was ... and so it's been an interpreter now all this time right but you can't you can't do it with an executive no\nBut if he's doing with an executive order so it's challenged and it goes right directly the Supreme Court I kind of okay with that yeah\nAnd that's I think that's what would happen yeah um because of they will challenge it\nThey will challenge it and I want I I ... I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just\nBecause I constitutionally I think you know the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually means\nIt seems to be a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included and it will be entirely there is yeah I seen it would be interesting to see like how that shakes out because you know one of the things we've praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts\nSo he needs to the judges he's put in would now rule on this and with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or not it would be fascinating yeah it does happen imagine Chuck Schumer and uh\nAnd Nancy Pelosi riding up that brief as a friend of the court just come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh\nWe we really believe this that guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think oh\nReally I mean you can usually come with the Pittsburgh shooter and if you lie and say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's got to be a part of it but just goes\nOh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership trying to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play we play just a couple of things [noise] listen listen to this this so far they have gone so far they've got here's here's Joe Scarborough and what he had to say listen to this\nMake a um [noise]\nThey don't want a week

shouldn't be Americans I'm Dave Anthony Fox News that's what President Trump believes considering an executive order to undo the policy any baby born here whether the mothers in the country legally or not is a U.S citizen he tells actually goes on HBO\nNo no we don't do it well you know and and it and it's something we need to do\nSo I'm so to take the audience through a bit what did you what did you learn from that because I think this is the same thing that's happening when we said Brock Obama\nIs surrounded by socialist look we'll get to look at the cover of what was it a Newsweek Magazine said we're all socialist now and as soon as we said we're going for socialism\nOr they immediately said were racist now when you point out uh George Soros this week the media is trying to say anybody who disagrees with George Soros is an anti Semite that's kind of the same thing that you found in Hollywood with your case is about\nI did I did and they basically taken the position that anybody that is a Republican or conservative is racist is anti Semite is\nIs a homo phobic and it's just their their way of kind of the ring us I mean I'm an American of Mexican descent and so and my wife is Mexican she's a first generation\nUh you know a a Mexican American ... it's ... they\nUse this identity politics to address and then they completely ostracized and it just isn't that attack mode and it's something that it it it goes into understanding why Hollywood is so ubiquitous late\nLast waning and you know you see why all these stories that come out of Hollywood that are so one sided that only tell one side of the story so that is when I saw this I said you know what we need to start telling our side of the story and we need to use storytelling\nAs a as a way to do that so that's what I ... it was it was astonishing\nKind of moment to to call out a man that is getting in bed with other people's kids and to actually have the entire community turn on it purely because we were conservatives it was an astonishing moment to go through\nWhat is it that they what is it that they have about conservatives more than pedophilia\n[noise] you know it I think it is a fear Hollywood is such a small community and it's run by so few people\nAnd it was just such a fear for Louisiana work and one way and it and on top of that it's like the game of Thrones where they're it it's very competitive to ah to to get that work so the first the first way to take somebody out is the state of their concert\nUm and and anybody that anybody that is even near that person that gets to ... them on conservative that they're conservative they run from that person so there's a lot of it is the loudest voices basically first kind of ... you out like invasion of the body Snatchers\nThat this guy is a conservative and then you have the the second tier which are just people that are fearful or they're forgetting work and those people run as well so it's just kind of this kind of\nA very the unhealthy community that get set up and then you know and then you start to see what happens to the Hollywood box office they started you know slowly over the last Fifteen Years start to decline because they aren't making a content for the other half of the country\nSo um you know I I I think that conservatives have really locked in on this and said you know what a ... of this we're not taking this any more you see the rating start to go down but now it's our time and now there's this new friends here for conservatives\nWhere we need to start creating content for ourselves and we need to start entertaining ourselves because they're never going to do\nUm and that's what we're trying to do with red old America that's on the heart radio a pod cast are cheating\nAre you shooting ...\nWe're talking to a Patrick grilled cheese and um let me ask you I'm Patrick I'm I have this theory about what happened with Megan Kelly\nThat the that the business people looked at Megan Kelly inside while she's a great gift she's she's very credible she's great an interview you know we have our own kind of sixty\nMinutes kind of person\nI'm very very smart yadda yadda yadda they hire her and that's when the social justice warriors all around them\nRemind her remind them she's a conservative she was or at least she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um and no you can't play nice\nAnd you have to destroy her\nAnd so they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized that the social justice warriors were against it\nThey did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy do you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was she used to I also do think that\nOr a ... going after the network for their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and the entire me too movement had a big part of that is a lot of people aren't touching on um ... it basically she was you know print brave and doing that\nUm I think you know from a career wise it might have been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet here's a woman in the me too moment and exposing the corporation for covering\nAnd they don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become just a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not um being used in a way that it was a God given birth to a\n...
