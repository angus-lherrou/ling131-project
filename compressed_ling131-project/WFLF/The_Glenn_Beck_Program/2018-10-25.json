have you been monitoring the very latest on the situation with all of these um uh these uh mail bombs that have been sent to prominent Democrats and CNN\nAn an acme style bomb none of them have gone off and you took the time to print a medium that has the ISIS flag and underneath it\nIt's a quote from Larry the cable guy that says get her\nDone except none of your bombs get it done none\nThey they've had zero chance of making it through security screening and Wylie coyote I think must have known that at some point\nThe coyotes got to go this dam road runner keeps going getting away maybe it's me\nDo you think Hillary Clinton actually personally checks her mailbox every time you know to see of or Amazon Prime order came in and you think George Soros does every person that has been sent one of these package has mail screening these devices were not\nDesigned to kill but to be detected caught and seen\nWylie coyote wanted a media circus and boy did he get one now I Am not going to speculate whether Wiley really is from the right or from the left I don't know\nThere's a lot of not jobs out that are looking to change narratives before the midterms\nNo one knows yet this could be a kid that just thought this would be funny again there's no chance these bombs would go off\nSo maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who's so screwed up he just doesn't even know what he's doing there's also the possibility\nSomeone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other\nThis however is not stopping the left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste by noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's all wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about his rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\n\nYou know what this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a left wing guy\nOr just a crazy person they will never report that\nCould I ask when the president has actually called for violence\nThat you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\nCalling the media fake news\nIs not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence encouraging your electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business Maxine Waters\nIsn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility Hillary Clinton I mean I could go on\nBut we all know the left narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms is\nIs over or that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue many of our friends in the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked that this kind of attack occurred\nOne person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first of all that would ... the\nForest one to deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to the Mike Pence\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep\nIn your memory bank you might need a hypnotists or therapists to bring this memory back at it so long ago\nOh wait a minute no it was just a couple of weeks ago the rice and letters just sent to the white\nHouse James Mattis FBI Director Christopher Wray CIA director Gina Haspel air force secretary Heather Wilson chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson did you just happen\nTo forget all about all of those or should I take you back to the baseball diamond which was way but I mean how old were you in twenty Seventeen\nHe barely remember was I walking at the time I don't even know\n\nAnd as far as the identity of Wylie coyote for those of you in the mainstream media it's really best not to speculate\nIf you don't know you should say you don't know here's who I think this is I\nDon't know there's no evidence on anything everything is speculation and if I Would say are effect versus a left wing person trying to ramp everybody up\nWhat would that do that would choose the people listening\nAnd they'd say oh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters\nAnd blaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\n\nYou know [noise] if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts you do something like that and something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny cold credibility\nBut you'd have to be you'd have to be interested in having some credibility\nTo be able to gain it\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] well\nFor the second day in a row Jason ... who is with us it it it he is I'm\nA former [noise] I'm a former military intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I eat\nThese Jason how ridiculous is this bomb the most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever seen it sort of when I when we first looked at it I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder and um I I was looking at it and I was like\nNo not really I mean it's a ... you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the shrapnel was what's dangerous and apply bought the explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need\nKnow that's no excuse for soccer but not for someone who's running a news organization ... he wrote\nA there's a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand there was words matter that's far they have shown no comprehension of that\nThat is that I think it's a fair criticism at times and we made it um I don't like everything that he says about the media but we have no evidence no evidence at all the rhetoric or anything else fed into these bombings we have no idea we have no idea who did them we have no idea what the motivation was yet I mean I think you could probably say there's a political motive but that's a\nClear political motive but that's all you could say you don't know it is such these bombs or so ridiculous that it was either done by somebody who is mentally inefficient or\nIt's somebody who didn't want the bombs to go off the sticker the ISIS me right either done that clearly marks that as somebody from the right\nWhy would you put that on there\nAnd why did none of them go off right I mean again you hope glad I'm Glad none of them went off by the way um\nBut it it seems to indicate someone who one of these things to be seen every single part of this that we just talked about\nA no leads to that and and your in your in your point about the timer before it's like ... there's a reason why there's FedEx and ... like that because the postal service is not an\nExact science you can't say often to point to our right at that time [laughter] what are you timing to you could have blown up the post and yeah it's so that there was a photo timer it when it was just probably a digital counter that was doing nothing but that was was kind of funny as the wires are going into them with a way of doing\nAmerica's first news when Gordon Deal every day five to

up on my a leftist anarchists cookbook\nA that was put out a by the left\nAnd the Nineteen sixties and seventies about pipe bombs and you know it's really interesting is um uh it does show how to make one you know with a clock or but it also shows how to make them\nYou know so they go off like let's say you open an envelope mhm you would pull a string and that era in that area which would make the bomb go off [noise]\nI'm I'm trying to figure out welcome to the program pat gray from pat gray unleashed um I'm trying to figure out what was the timer timing to\nEither this is the worst bomber of all time in human history or there's something else going on here\nBecause you would you put up a sticker on a bomb I ... I\nGuess I've seen pictures of people in the military for example who are about to fire a missile and they put like Osama bin Laden name on it or something like I guess and theoretically possible but if you knew of bombs going to explode why would you put a sticker of a right wing me mom and ... and less and less again potentially\nA you've thought maybe they wouldn't blow up and that people would see the right wing meat yeah right like\nIt's almost as if they put on the outside of the envelope open with care this is an explosive so that they wouldn't explode it's not one of the nine has gone off\nBy all put they also put glass in instead of ball bearings or anything metal you walk metal as your as your shrapnel you'd you you wouldn't but glass in the bomb would just\nDisintegrate the glass even more ... you you don't want it in PVC pipe you wanted in a metal pipe because of the shrapnel\nThis is just ... it's there's just too many things wrong with this and again it might just be somebody who was sick and demented ... and ... that was the end the stupid or it might be some kid that taught this would be funny it might be some\nYou know mentally deficient\nA right wing or they did it it also may be somebody who was on the left is like oh I Know how to change the narrative could be that two of ... I don't know I mean you have\nTo have some level of skepticism of the south of the of the obvious narrative here right a which is some right wing or did this I think the first thing that makes you lead to that is it's not the haven't exploded\nRight so if you are trying to harm someone usually you'd be able to do it okay the same thing applies I Believe two white powder arriving to the president whenever I hear that whenever right wing ... figures are hit with a bunch of white powder in the mail my first thought is\nWell okay obviously you'd think if someone who's opposed to them but would take a ... minute here and consider that someone is trying to make the president or some other right wing figure look like they're under attack especially when it turns out not to be rights and and just white powder\nWide and someone do that well of course there should be skepticism we've had these these things have happened to a hundred times unbelievable so much just to listen to this I suppose he thinks the\nCommunist didn't set fire to the rice dog as well [laughter] I mean of course take a moment to consider and and there's no reason to come to a conclusion because we have no idea at this point what you see these statements that have come out from CNN\nAnd ... you know people just outwardly blaming\nThe rights and Donald Trump for this\nI I don't we first of all you can't blame Donald Trump for the ... unless you think he actually was responsible does anyone think that he actually sent the bombs and brought them to George Soros is how well no but I think of our income might have been [laughter] unless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions we know that\nBut beyond that if you're gonna ... you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's obvious incentive to make America feels that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right they could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs to go off it's certainly possible but\nThey are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault you do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some skeptical lie\nIn supply food storage that I have and you should have as well a two week food cat will get you started out two

president Pence and a second package or to vice president Joe Biden was ah found this morning the Delaware postal facility\nBut you know another reason why I guess you put a timer on those things I mean it's just it's so this is so bizarre\nAgain none of them have gone off they they intentionally exploded I think the Soros one um to make sure that you know they ... the police did it\nUm but ah listen to this this is again we're supposed to be there's a high level of sophistication of these bombings ... someone actually said that the biggest mass uh assassination attempt a we've seen in some time yeah about a year because\nYou just had it and they actually like almost killed someone in Congress and I'm a baseball field they just completely forget about this moment but listen to that this

the important thing but it's gonna be so many people speculating about this I just think you can't jump to conclusions ... there's going to be a massive investigation over this I don't know why this is so much of a bigger story than you know rice and being sent to right wing figures a week or two ago\nI've got a gas or whatever it's honestly this is going to last longer and be bigger than what

offices she keeps bringing that up\nShe was very serious and one of the biggest critics of NBC and the way\nThey handled some of those allegations seemingly they are really finding a a quick way but it\nSeems to me to me that maybe she has a target on her for some of those uh\nThings that she said which is kind of fascinating because that'd be the I mean as we know that they're going to tell us talk to us constantly about the inequality between the sexes and and that and how how those conservatives are really about Roy Moore oh he's a he's a bad guy\nOr but we're going to find that when it comes to people like Matt Lauer and Brokaw and how many more at NBC it's been one of the biggest and not to mention ignoring the Harvey Weinstein thing for how long remembered they employed Ronan Farrow when he was writing the story and they gave it to the New Yorker\nI I you know all that goes on and making Kelly happens to be one of the biggest critics of what happened at NBC and yet you know she has one comment that people don't like and she's gone it's fascinating\nNBC News uh chairman Andy lack released a statement following her comments there is no other way to put this but I can damn those remarks\nThere is no place on our air or in this work place for those kinds of words I mean touchy feely guys that's fine but words no no no I'm Sorry I added that quote it's very unfortunate and quote\nWhat is unfortunate is that America has devolved into a country of oversensitive cry babies who\nTake offense at the slightest thing and you know what I don't even think it's America I don't think it's Americans I really don't I don't think\nThat it's a vast but I don't think it's eighty or Ninety percent of this country that are cry babies they're sick of this\nIs about maybe five to ten percent of America and many of them in the media and many of them in politics\nAnd the last place probably the last comes first\nAcademia [laughter] oh you should be coddled the slightest thing upset you well that's not American\nIt's not where are the ones you know what I have a picture of my grandmother she crossed the Rocky Mountains and in a um a in a ... a wagon\nTrain okay is she was she looks like me in a dress with a bomb it okay she she ...\nShe also kind of looks a little like a pirate you know why because on the wagon train her I was poked out [laughter]\nYou know she did she wiped her face and ... and\nKept going she didn't wine she cry about it she's like oh crap [noise] shouldn't around with that\nI poked my eye out and she moved on\n\nThat to Americans are yes bad things happen we move on yes people say things that I don't like we move on and yes\nThings have changed we're involving we're learning new things some things are outdated some things that are good or just being tossed out the window and somebody should say wait a minute let's not throw that away\n\nMegan Kelly oughta know blackface is awful yes\nIt's no longer acceptable but you know what\nIf it's a costume that his purpose flea ridden a ridiculing race as black face has done historically yes it's not kosher nor should it be\nBut notice what is happening here with Kelly ... being fired not because she wore black face\nBut because of words and I the ah question it's not even she was advocating she was questioning why why\nIs this wrong if I'm not ridiculing people why is this wrong and that person light Diana Ross wanted to be like Diana Ross in a costume why is this wrong\n\nI think that deserves an answer\nInstead what we got was an apology I Am so sorry I shouldn't have oh please don't be me please don't beat me master please don't be mean [laughter] I don't want to know are whipping please don't beat me are you kidding me how\nAre we supposed to learn if we don't have civil conversations and yes once in a while we ask a question that's politically incorrect\n\nThe criteria in America right now has narrowed so far that it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river if she floats we know she's a bigoted racist\nIf she doesn't well we will will know that will know that she was innocent\nBut it's just so ridiculous how similar it is to the thought crimes that Orwell wrote about in Nineteen eighty four\nHere's a passage for anybody who you know it hasn't sort of there's something called a book in a while\nThe main character Winston Smith training himself to avoid thought crimes here it is quote the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself the process should be automatic instinctive crimes stop\nThat's what they call it a new speak\nHe's had to work to exercise himself in crimes stop he presented himself with propositions the party says the earth is flat the party says that ISIS heavier than water\nAnd trained himself and not seeing or understanding the arguments that contradicted them and quote here's another one quote if you made an unexpected movement and then they yelled at you from the tell a screen\nSwap tell a screen swap tell a screen with what Twitter\nAnd here we are in reality let me read that one more time if you said something unexpected if you made unexpected movements they yelled at you through the tell a screen\nI don't want to ruin Nineteen eighty four for you but let me just say it's not the kind of world we want to end up in unfortunately not enough people read anymore you should because it is

a lot of people in and side of NBC that one in her out for other reasons like ... this has nothing to do if she could have said that easily and been applauded\nHad she not come from Fox and she'd come from CNN or she was on the left or whatever that that crowd would've applauded her saying that and I think they know there's a lot of people don't be dated didn't appreciate her coming out against NBC personalities on the sexual assault stuff as well\nBut just just talking specifically about let's forget all that exist and talk about the fact that actual conversation\nHer point is what is important when you're trying to decipher someone doing something that is racist for example is the motivation right the motivation is what is important the words themselves can be bad or good but the motivation is what is important let's go further than black face for a second\nThe N. word right the N. word\nWhen said by someone carrying a torch in Charlottesville we all understand really bad mhm when Chris Rock says it\nNot so bad why because we know Chris Rock's motivation is not because he says terrible racist we know in Charlottesville the case is that they are terrible racist or in this been sorry for the city of Charlottesville who now if they're named just sit on to this with racism but I mean we don't we are talking about here\nThe the if you have an All right figure you have Richard Spencer if some hardcore racist saying the N word it means something different and the motivation is different and that is important like it but I Will say this it is still I\nI don't care who says the N word I think it's a disgusting word I Do too I don't I don't like that word used by anybody but you don't get drummed out of society if you if you're if you're a Chris Rock because everybody knows that your motivation is not this deep hatred of racism another example it's always sunny in Philadelphia\nIs a is the longest running a live action sitcom in us history it's fourteen season it's going I signed up for the fourteenth season\nAt least once and I think twice they've done entire episode where they're white characters were in blackface\nK now their motivation as liberals right\nTheir motivation is to show that racism is really dumb and their characters are really dumb and their dressing up this way and they're showing how stupid they are and making the point that they think it's okay to dress up in blackface but they actually did it on camera multiple episodes this is a a liberal icon of a program\nOK totally okay for them to do it\nBut for her to question it and say if it's a positive motivation is that okay well I don't remember I don't remember a lot of an outcry from the left over it's always sunny in Philadelphia doing it multiple times they did an entire episode ... which is one of the greatest television\nEpisodes of any series of all time called the gang turns black\nAnd they they have a situation where they all wake up what after getting the electric or getting struck by lightning and they're all black and they have to live as black people for the day and they walk around ten minutes orderly amazing\nBut beyond that it is something that there's been no pushback on look at things like family guy you'll see the you know then the animation but it's still the same types of things happen\nBecause they believe and we all kind of like well the motivation there is\nThat he he's that they're not trying to be racist an upstarting trying to say black people are inferior or anything like that they're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay\nWhat she's saying here is if the motivation is good let's say a child for example who thinks they want to dress up as a hero of there's a happens to be black\nAnd they don't want to be damned dynamics right you want to be black and white they don't understand the dynamics of blackface they would think OK well you'd think the kids not racist their motivation is they're trying to look up to a hero and that's the only point you bring up it might not even be true we may say\nAs a society that we think black faces too far and we'd have to adjust some things but okay but the issue is her asking that question she's saying if it's a good motivation not motivated by racism and therefore shouldn't be treated the same way as she loses her gig over that I mean\nIt's just completely insane and we're not adults if we can't handle that level of conversation Mm\nGround zero we climb Louis we nicer than news radio Ninety three point one\n[noise]\n\nListening to claim [noise]\nBrief the [noise] you know I I I have\nTo watch cable news so you don't have to and so we have these you know we have these monitors in front of me and I'm just looking up and I just I I just oh my gosh my blood pressure just goes through the roof every time I look up by I see something that it's just like\nOh [noise] but anyway uh let me talk a little bit about ah\nThe caravan now sue\nYou're listening to uh you're listening to the mainstream media and what did they tell you the\nIt well there was a [noise] a very there's one individual or in Honduras who\nWas the victim of horrible a poverty and violence likely from a capitalist and decided just post on his Facebook page and there was a grassroots effort to\nA migrant march [noise] and the people who all of them one by one hundred percent but it was Seventy five hundred people or fourteen thousand I Would say I don't but I was fourteen thousand these are the top fourteen thousand people in in the United in the world\nAre they are they're the best people the top fourteen thousand from one to fourteen thousand in the entire world they're marching up there and I'm Out of the ... just to show\nHow how much they they love America and they just want to participate I Want to share in in in freedom and the American gathering I Do think I could get fourteen thousand\nPeople who march across the United states mhm okay march across the United states for\nYou know any reason [laughter]\nNo I don't think I was fourteen thousand people in the United states capable of of this large yeah I don't think so okay you're talking about uh you know Seventy five Seventy five hundred to fourteen thousand people marching what's left twenty six hundred miles mhm okay\nSo that's not just something that everybody is like you do that\n\nNow what's really going on is this is all politically motivated and not politically motivated here in the United states has has nothing to do with Democrats or Republicans this has everything to do with the politics\nBetween Honduras Venezuela Cuba and the United states\n[noise] we've been outlining this now for the last few days and nobody seems to really want to pick up on it but we'll continue to tell the story because that's what's really happening now last night I got this in\nA as has during Mr Beck I live in Honduras on the island

was a Marxist a revolutionary\nHe was a ... job is a a puppet\nHe was doing exactly what Hugo Chavez did he came in and then he was going to change the constitution exactly the way Hugo Chavez has changed the constitution and made it into a a a dictatorship\nSo the Supreme Court\nSaid the president is acting unconstitutionally talk to the other branch you need to arrest him an exile him the other branch did so two branches of the government ousted him\nSaid that's not what we do\nWe don't want to be a Hugo Chavez Venezuela okay\nHe said ever since then we Hondurans have lived in chaos many things try to buy a ... and his party deliberate which translates to Freedom Party to destabilize our country\nLet me ask you if you got a piece of a package in the mail and it said it came from Glenn Beck and it had assigned book it it would you open it or would you just immediately throw it away\nAt all what if you had assigned book from Glenn Beck or in oh well I Would I Would I Would open how amazing when I'm going to make one word it to him I'm going to make this an\nAn acme book\n[laughter] I like him I appreciated your copy of the outrage is on the way\nWith a go I mean it seems

everywhere you look and and people have\nTalented staff of comedy writers during their jokes where more is Michael Moore's ... you know he was funny for Columbus is at the time but he's not really funny enough to be a standup comedian as we as a side has basically stand up comedy show or Michael Moore and Trump land which cannot\nTwenty sixteen break during the weeks before the election he's hoping to sway the electric ...\nWhen you when you say you know when you say like we saw um I don't think you're yet you should be careful with the use of the week 'cause I don't think I don't think I could find two people maybe you and I don't know who else in his audience might have a seat that act I\nThink they're dressed like a million bucks I mean and as always most slapped in the past few years and that's the kind of worse and worse sick oh did okay but\nTwelve years ago as movie about a health insurance and what she claimed that the Cuban healthcare system was better than us okay this is a it is sort of insane rats are no longer that rare you can find them everywhere and basically I think they use audience that used to go to movies I remember\nOn Columbine and get a lot of young people in their twenties are really excited about that movie uh they've forgotten about it maybe they moved on to turn came along compare a Daily Show and all these other alternative forms of comedy and\nUh you know Michael Moore is ... is not really funny enough to be a comic\nAnd as a okay so ... so you are you saying that it's just that he's not funny or that a is there anything to be said\nFor uh the fact that ah this this kind of stuff uh\nYou know you can get the actual people you get the people in office now saying these crazy things so he's not\nHe's not the rebel anymore it's just it's not you know he was revolutionary and we're a rebels you know alliance and we all got to you know we're all in it together will now you've got Nancy Pelosi saying all the same stuff that he was saying\nRight there is no scarcity value to what he does anymore everyone's doing it uh there's a kind of a sad moment at the end of star nine eleven nine where he does as it were a montage and try and say Trump is like Hitler and it's like interest into playing the speech the Trump and Hillary and that's what everyone's been saying Trump is like Hitler on the left for about three years\nHe's like he's the last one to this Trump is that what party it's so boring it's been done to death\nThat is amazing observation of ... where the culture has gone because we have a ... at that point it was a big deal when someone came out and essentially advocated for socialism in America\nI mean even when we talked about what Bernie Sanders and twenty Thirteen coming out with Medicare for all he got no cosponsors on that bill and twenty Thirteen now every major democratic candidate is pitching for that policy and they're not just talking about social you know there's a there's a problem in America where we look\nAt Canada and say that to socialize nation does not that's a capitalist nation that has socialized medicine and has other thing all sorts of welfare state yeah I had you know as welfare state that's not a socialist nation and they're now\nOn the left pointing that out that we're calling for an end of capitalism I mean we've gone\nWe've gone further than just saying yeah were you know where socialist like Canadians no no they're now saying no we want an end to capitalism and they're still getting elected\n\nRead Michael Moore has been a leader of the\nParade for a while but now he's kind of ... in ... it's ... it's kind of gotten a hands on he closed his movie um capitalism a love story with uh the communist are you seeing the Soviet Nashville handsome and and I that kind of thing is is not that special anymore but that's the whole Democratic Party has gone so far left\nSo what does that say to you does that say as I say we're\nIn a lot more trouble than people might think\nWhat does it say to you that this isn't shocking at all\nI think the Democratic party is not doing themselves any favor by by moving way to the west to about Obama at the time was seemed like\nGehring Lee far west but that's that's about as far west as they really should Barrett to go they really should stay out of all this transgender stuff they should really stay out of this open borders stuff they should stay away from a abolish ice they should stay away from Medicare for all all all the stuff that they're doing is not helping them as the polls\nAnd as the Republican Party as a result is is in its strongest position since the Nineteen twenties\nWhich is astounding which is astounding for the opposition that it is had 'em and the the the flaws or that it is that is well it's it's amazing that it is this strong a and it's only because I think of the Democrats moving so far left\nAgree ... thank you so much Kyle Smith a critic at large for National Review\nSo\nI'm listening to President Trump\nGot another one of these ah [noise]\nAh you know rallies and he's talking\nAnd I'm\n... and and I'm I'm hearing the reporter this morning talk about it and how out of touch he is and I thought to myself\nYou know one of us is deeply deeply mistaken because he was saying you know this is this is this election\nIs about Kavanaugh this election is about the caravan this election is about um uh shutting\nPeople up this election is about tax cuts\nAnd I thought yeah that's that's really what this is about that's what this is about\nAnd they of course are saying you know those are just dog whistles except for the if if you think that the caravan is not something you should worry about what's wrong with you\nIf you're not worried about the economy and the effects of the budget and tax cuts uh what's wrong with you you just don't see it or are you is your philosophy\nSo upside down from traditional American or economics in philosophies that we are now on the other side of the fence promote move from one another and I\nI think when it comes to the politicians that's what it is they are on the other side of the fence and they just don't think this way anymore\nDonald Trump has said if we lose the house God Forbid the house and the Senate but if we lose the house\nIt's going to be a different world and I think he's

P. Morgan it was the morgue and house if you will his office was in there\nOne of the bombs went off right next to that building\nBut Morgan had built this classical building so deep and so thick that it didn't penetrate anything thirty eight people killed a hundred and forty three severely injured the bomb went off just off of the sidewalk and it didn't affect his building\nExcept there are ... marks

many people in the media today even know that story\n\nI can guarantee you nobody is telling you that story they're\nSaying this is unprecedented and it has to be the right historically speaking it's almost always the left now\nThis might be the right this might be actually Republican because Republicans are known for not getting anything done uh and so this guy built these bombs and build them in such a way that they were never going to explode\nI don't know who built these bombs could be somebody from the left could be somebody from the right\nBut it's unusual that you could build this these this number of bombs and none of them went off\nRemember Nineteen Nineteen twelve bombs were delivered twelve bombs went off Seventeen were not delivered Seventeen were stopped before they could\nGo

operatives in Honduras Mike Lee a senator who was always standing guard by our constitution welcome to the program sir how are you\nDoing great thank you very much good\nSo you um [noise] uh you wrote to me last night and I'm not smart enough to understand that ah you said there is a ... there is a procedure that you're pushing for 'em to hold these countries responsible and get them involved in stopping it can you explain\nWhat happened was that the Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley and I sent a letter to they had said that department of homeland security and the department of state chasing a workout like cream it\nWith Mexico whereby a Mexico would require people who enter Mexico let's say from Honduras or from El Salvador or from any of these other countries in Central America where a lot of these people were coming from\nWhen the intent of claiming asylum that they would have to claim asylum in Mexico rather than in the United states\nWould be similar to an agreement that we already have in place with Canada and a rule imposed by the EU refugees are arriving in ... countries from Syria in other words\nWhen people were fleeing a a a a country that's dangerous to them that is particularly hostile towards them for some particular reason so that they have an asylum claim\nWay out to apply for asylum and the first country they reach that could be potentially save your that should be Mexico\nIsn't that normally what happens I mean I thought that when you wanted asylum I thought I personally I think the United states government should be running ads do not come to America with your family because you will be turned away if you were in danger come to the closest to us embassy\nAnd apply for asylum\nI uh I mean why are we die thought that was what we always do\nYeah it should be more like that and that's not really how it works and that ... in order to these people end up applying for asylum with Mexico they're sort of going for the long bomb will marry pass and tried to\nMake it all the way the United states but this jury is itself dangerous this journey that sell 'em\nRight with opportunities for people to be exploited uh it it can exceptionally dangerous journey for many people especially for children and for young women many of whom are sexually assaulted during\nAnd a lot of the people claiming asylum turn out not to be able to make the case that they're even eligible for asylum but once they're in the United states it makes it much more difficult to get them back and we think at\nThe asylum application that they're coming by land for Mexico ought to be made to Mexico as they enter Mexico\nI talked to a great guy but the other day and he said that he thought Mexico was working on something with the UN to put some sort of a camp there in Mexico for these refugees have you heard anything about that\nI have not but I\nDon't think that sounds like a a great idea I think that could become a another potential magnet agree for bringing people here um if the idea is to facilitate that journey specifically the journey from somewhere else in Central America to the United states that could become more of a problem\nI can ... you nailed it quite a few minutes ago and saying that the humanitarian crisis that we have to be focusing on here really is the crisis with the refugees themselves having to make this long dangerous journey and then knowing that when they get\nHere the odds are pretty high that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event and it just creates a whole lot of headaches for them in the process\nSo Mike I gotta I got an um an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and then a born and raised native or in Honduras\nSaid have been following the news or on the caravan here locally uh been also a fan of your show watch your show and I have to applaud you and your intel um the origins of this migrant march this all wrapped it in two thousand
