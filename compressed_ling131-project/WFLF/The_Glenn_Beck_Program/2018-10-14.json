{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "Most of the times still oddly enough I I use prayer when I go to sleep I'm a person that thinks a lot in their head and turning off those worries and those concerns especially when I'm trying to sleep\nPrayer is about the only effective way for me to to do that so it's carried along with me this this whole time so it's it's more than just apply attitude in it actually is is is powerful\nYeah would you say fear is a bad thing but I guess you know it's what kind of fear is it\nAnd who you ask probably so when I was a little kid I felt that that fear was bad and maybe a it was my subconscious working out the issues that I was going through so maybe it was good but as an adult\nI found that that fear actually can be good obviously fear helps to protect us from things so you have that that a fight or flight syndrome that we get help ensure exactly what the hell the fear of of things that would do damage to you\nI also think that when it comes to fear that\nIt is something that can set of hedge or a boundary so that we remain faithful to God and then there is I'm not like a horrifying kind of fear but a a fear when we look at God\nIn who he is honoring him and that's a kind of fear too and I would say that's a that's a positive fear as well\nYeah actually the first use of the law would be an example of a healthy fear the fear of running afoul of the authorities that God has put in place the curb\nThat yeah restrained you from acting out on whatever sinful impulse you might have that might be against the law so in that case that would be a healthy of fear and a half\nYou're correct so like the the the first use of the law um why do people obey the law in in that sense it's because they're fearful of the negative punishment you know [laughter] and so it's like oh well I'm not going to do this because I don't wanna go to jail so you're not really a doing things\nFor a wonderful virtuous reasons but because you're fearful of the\nPenalty but at the same time it's not like the man's trying to keep you down you know I mean it's it's really about protecting you as well as a maintaining stable society so while there's fear involved the overall goal isn't simply tear the\nOverall goal is to Maine taint peace and to keep us protected and to keep us healthy\nIn the sermon Dr Hoffman said that all fears are really mirrors of the one fear the fear of death would you agree with that\nI agree with that I might put it a little bit differently to me to death is one kind of loss okay and at least for me personally I think that a lot of my fear is connected to loss a death being probably the largest one but\nYeah I I Would say that the death as a form of loss and and if you think about it that way that many of our fears are connected so uh we're fearful if we're gonna lose our job or if we're going to lose a relationship with someone that we love or if we lose someone in in death or if we're going to lose part of our identity you know or part of our freedom\nUm all of those I think go back to loss for me\nAnd maybe it tells you a little too much about who I Am I'm but fear of loss of of of many kinds has has been something that that I've dealt with over my life uh it it also I think it exposes the fact that\nMaybe we think that the things that we provide for ourselves are the only way that we make it through this world\nAnd if we if we lose those things we're not going to be able to go on\nSo I think it probably also says something about my understanding of my of my trust and and my relationship with God and those types of fear\nIt seems to me that fear could also be a result of uncertainty not knowing where things are going to go and so you fear what could happen\nOr exactly yeah I'm I'm One of those people that I I'd probably do myself a harm by thinking about all of the possible results of a situation you know so I can imagine like forty different horrible things that could happen [laughter] you know I'm so\nUh I I tend to I tend to let my mind think through those things and sometimes I noticed that that will that will actually impact me emotionally that I Will be fearful about a consequence that I have determined to simply be a possibility in my mind\nAnd trying to realize that there's there's plenty of real things to be fearful about instead of just being fearful\nOh the thousand things that I make up\nIn his sermon Dr Hoffman says when fear is so ... you can cut it with a knife face cuts through and then there's light again no matter what may happen there is God and where God is no fear\nNow I couldn't agree with that more you know as we're talking about this I only started the illustration as I was coming down here about the story of when I was a child\nBut thinking about that statement and also thinking about some forty six that he's using them is that a a a mighty fortress you know kind of thing I thought well I Know of course I didn't know this but uh in a way I was kind of building a fortress your own little forgeries clerics yeah with prayer\nBut that is true in the darkest times God is that defense he used that lights that cuts through that darkness we also know from scripture that a lot of times we don't necessarily see the light of God enlisted stark\nOr to put another way we see it more clearly are more brightly when it's dark\nSo it's interesting that when you talk about faith and you talk about people's relationship with God through Christ that if you ask them to tell you a story about it many times they are going to tell you a story about darkness\nA story about fear a time when God made a difference in their daily life so in many ways without these times of fear without this times of broken it's without these times of darkness\nMaybe we wouldn't understand God's graciousness and provision as much as we do today [noise]\nTo learn how you can support the worldwide outreach a Lutheran our

remember if you want to reach any of us you can call for seven five six six she five five five or on your cell hit pound to fifty and the key word is real estate\nSo um other costs that come up and this is probably a confusing when you guys can talk about is\nThat you know the first year of homeowners insurance obviously has to be paid wishes the closing costs because obviously you need insurance but then on top of that their esque grows and most of the time that the the lender is collecting for both taxes\nAnd for um homeowner's insurance but it's it's a weird percentage or something of how they figure it out so has that kind of get calculated\nSo so the way it works is um you know first for most of the as far as taxes but we'll we'll break 'em down a little bit property taxes are are mostly paid from from the first of January until the date of closing by the seller regular ... in the house or the time period and then uh then you have a little bit of whatever you might on towards the end right so\nUm we're going to make sure that you have enough money in your restaurant ... that's going to be there to pay your property taxes which ... in Florida and the recount his do November right so there's a exec accusation for that\nNow homeowners earns a little bit different we do click you're up front\nAnd always pay for the for years so insurance always ... years in advance and we we don't want you to not have been insured and something happens so that's why we pay 'em and then we're going to ball for both of them a little bit in the ... the little ... there are certain laws actually protect\nHow much we can buffer I'm so for taxes your typical you're going to see two to three months of of a buffer in escrow account of what is it so you take your let's say two thousand dollar a thousand dollar per year by that by twelve and we're going to quote if he wants to that\nSame thing with homeowner's insurance now what you might see on a on the settlement staying with what we call closing schools are today is a ... a good adjustment mhm and death to get it to the exact tea 'cause their goal is only ... what we need to\nWe don't want you to pay more than there is no reason to have a huge huge both for on it just so that the that we wanted to do so for example let's say we close in November of this year going to have your taxes already there and then you're going to have just enough for insurance as we do every year that November insurance will be in taxes so that that's what it's meant for\nAnd then there's another a fee on there that are it is the uh interest\nThat's going to be paid for the rest of the month or whatever and um so I have some people say I want to close at the beginning of the month because I Want\nTo pay this interest payment and then I have other people say I want to pay at the end of the month because they don't want to have that interest payment or whatever\nYou know why should that at the end to me it's just like it is what it in but sometimes it makes a little bit of a difference when you were closing like how much money you need to close but the thing that's it that I think is really interesting that most people don't know is when you're first payment is due\nCorrect or so when we can talk to our our buyers about this to see what they want to do and in ... when it um if you close at the end of the month you're going to have very ... to give everybody a quick idea of mortgage interest is ... is ... and the daily alarm in rye so every day you know let's say it's twenty dollars thirty dollars whatever\nSo we we look at him quick that at that point if you close on let's say the thirties of the month you're gonna have one day of interest on you as part of your closing costs so it's going to help you with your your bottom line and if you're in a situation where you're just a little bit strapped her little because we want to be\nThan we would say okay look was closing towards the end the ...\nThe differences so let's say we close in um the the Rickles November if because of them are thirtieth your very first pay movie January first\nThen so you get a ... a little bit of a reprieve well let's see we close November first\nJust what your payments to January first but now you have ... sixty days of just not having to worry about a mortgage payment but the more vision that mortgage interest will be collected for almost a full thirty days on your clothes and in your final settlements Damon which will up your total bottom line from the date of closing\nRight so in order

discuss the sale of your home or to get in touch with Howard or Chris you can call for a seven five six sixty five five five or on your cell phone you hit pound to fifty and the key word is real estate\nSo we've been talking I'm you know just in general about what happens when you're buying or selling the house or whatever and one of the things that comes into play a lot is the appraisal which\nAh the thing with an appraisal is that it is historical information that the appraisers are required by law to use so\nIf the market's going up sometimes it's kind of hard for a seller because it's going to reflect what's actually sold it can't be like well that has down the street I Know it selling for ten thousand more well that doesn't really matter and the big story ... ... yeah\nAnd I actually ran into a situation a couple of weeks ago where um the the appraiser had used some stuff that was pretty old and so I said you know well here's a house that\nRight down the street and it just sold last week but it sold a day after the guy did the appraisal\nSo he couldn't use it he said that and and I didn't know that before so I thought that was a really good argument because it was like instead of a year old it was like yesterday but they couldn't open up the appraisal for that and I was like not happy\nIt [laughter] or appraisers are bound to certain rules and yeah go requirements just the same way wanders unreal hers are yeah they they have to go by\nOh you'd be comparable cells otherwise known as comes right in the area or in recent history that's\nRight yeah and it can't be like more recent than when they did it [laughter] I\nI wrote a little flexibility you know if if the state's unique property they can kind of spread out how far the look but yeah go over I Do a idea's fine recent sold homes like the property in the same market um that we were you're getting a true market value on the home\nYeah and you're lucky and it usually is going out within a mile and a square footage is within a few hundred square feet so\nAnd you know the good news in central Florida is that there are a lot of houses that are very similar to the other has found the street I mean we're I think our land though I mean in my opinion our lander was more of a newer community then a lot of others in the United states so\nWe do have a lot of subdivisions we do have a lot of age uh ways we do have all those kinds of things\nThat are into it and so as a result of that you know there's similar properties when you're driving down the street I was and I was driving around my neighborhood I was riding my bike around and I thought I thought okay and I'm going to see how many houses in this neighborhood look like mine because I you know and all and\nAnd it was funny because I couldn't see more than like two or three that I could pinpoint were actually like my house I Know there's more than that in there but because of the way that they have the different elevations on the front and\nYou know a a couple of different things here and there that it really does you know it didn't look like it was all the same property style but it could be\nQuite possible the aside for a plan\nSo naturally a same yeah but but it's like when I was riding around the neighborhood I really couldn't tell you know but I Know when I go do the camps\nAnd all that kind of stuff that they are quite a few houses that are very similar in that\nYou're right there a lot of the houses in the central Florida marketed they're very similar however we've seen all kinds of different types of properties from homes with acreage to log cabins and there's\nThere's there's there's a lot of unique properties and anything that's on the water is a completely different animals and all that good stuff as well and there are some you know older parts of the towns like there's older parts of downtown Orlando\nYou know College Park has got some Winter Park you know those kinds of things and then obviously downtown Kissimmee that Orlando in Kissimmee we're probably not\nThat's on the I'm really concerned about\nHowever if you finalize the divorce because it opens up another can of worms because at that point we do have to look at your the the divorce decree in and the reason why is there are certain things in there that you might be why before that we have to know about I'm ... so could play a role and you're all ... of alone\nI'm so that that does maybe like I said open up a can of worms that could cause some issues um and it's good to disclose to us up front because it's hard for something like that not to get caught\nLater on in the process a lot of people don't realize that we poll a a rather expensive public record report on every single individual just to make sure we have all all the books in a row and all the information that we need in front of us and generally names will pop up and it's so if you have someone\nWhere the your associates at one point in time we have to by law askcokie who is this new vigil and what was your relationship with them um and then as you know if you if you own property in the middle of all that it can get it any more complicated\nYeah it can it it's definitely you know doable though but again it comes down to just planning and figuring out you know what's gonna happen so I usually people have lawyers involved when they're getting divorced but ... you know it probably wouldn't hurt to\nAlso include the lenders and the realtors and that kind of stuff in that process to say you know where you're going to end up I mean I've\nWorked with people that the wife for example ended up with the home and that was part of the divorce and then she decided that she wanted to sell it mhm well it wasn't necessarily worth as much as what she thought it was worth when she agreed to it in the divorce\nAnd so you know all of those things are important to check out to know really what's the the best way for you to go about it so so it's like you know and I think it you know and\nEverybody doesn't want to be fair going through those prices as unfortunately but there are a lot of people that do want to be fair and so you just want to make sure that what you're talking about and what you're doing is completely what you think you're doing as opposed to you know setting yourself up for failure and they were the ones that are actively matters\nIf you're in a more mutual situation or if you're in a kind of a dog fight type situation\nPlanning is the key like you say if you if you don't have a good plan if you haven't spoken to the experts to make sure that you're you're going about it the way that will make it at the end of the day is good results because they can be obviously it's not usually a great situation but planning is definitely the key and talking to the right people\nNow it absolutely is and anything that you do in life that's that's a big change in that kind of thing and knowing and strategically planting you know when how you're going to handle your housing and and when that's going to be done and all that like you said that it's like if you buy something before the divorce has actually final I mean\nThat other person might have an interest in that house after your divorce his final and you might not want that to be the case and say you need to make sure that everything is done in the way that you want to\nAnd that's all the best advice I think for all of us to give you [laughter] so if you're just joining us You're listening to news radio Ninety three point wind WFL a than his taxation in Orlando\nI'm your hosts Laura Peterson Frank ... ... homes sold guaranteed by\nThe central Florida real estate radio with you every Sunday at eight o'clock joining me today is Chris urban and Howard Shannon a butler mortgage remember if you want to reach any of us you can call for a seven I have six six she five five five or you can hit pound to fifty on your cell and the key word is real estate\nSo one of the things that I found interesting this week that I was reading about\nThat said that hurricanes and make us poor but they don't slow the economy that's interesting yeah I thought that was interesting and I and it and it's true because it's like you know when it first happened so I mean everybody kind of just like\nOkay you know from a year ago when Irma came through or whatever that it's like okay we have to deal with whatever's going on outside and do we need a new roof with which a lot more people needed a new roof than they thought needed and when the storm was over but um you know basically you know you go through all of that stuff\nBut but basically ah the amazing thing is that it does it slow the economy and it actually somewhat gets it going which I think it would be the opposite ... but it definitely is not the opposite\nI remember a during hurricanes Charlie Francis and Jean however thousand four\nYeah hey we remember that so I remember a gentleman who was fixing screened enclosures pulling up in a Hummer\nFor it and I said wow that's really nice looks brand new he said you just got it and it's all from screen repairs yeah wow yeah my run economy after these uh Roderick circumstances\nAbsolutely yeah so there's a there's a silver lining you know at the end of uh all of that kind of good stuff but yeah so it's it's good to know but it does make us poor or sometimes you know kids there is a lot of times that you can't work during them and all of that kind of stuff so what does that do really in a lending type of atmosphere\nI think the the biggest issue for especially in those first few months is okay especially people that are in the middle of buying a house as what's the condition of the home yeah two hours in and of course anybody that's looking to buy houses okay can I find a house that that isn't in need of major repair or most of the time like you said a ... of a brand new roof\nUm it causes a lot of issue mostly with roots because um\nIf you have a house that is in need of a roof we as a lender we just we're not going to close on it because you're buying a house that might be um won't obviously not in the best condition at that point in time but the actual health risk to you\nI'm is if it's a leaky roof or anything like that or from hurricane comes in and then all of a sudden you were at a major risk there so we typically will make sure that there are things in place that doesn't make it impossible there's just things that we will put in place to make sure you are protected because that's that's our number one goal is I mean when you buy a house we're not putting something that is just in in the city\nSo what happens in the case of that you know you didn't work for ... days or whatever after the hurricane doesn't that you know ... play into the employment thing or they know that that's kind of going on so they kind of forget it\nI'm sure\nYeah most of the time is it if it's if you could explain it typically if we see someone who's had unpaid leave on other shipmates show up yeah explain it to us and you tell us that hurricane my I had to go out family or whatever it is yes something that's out of your control right and when we generally an explanation is all we need to get by that so\nYeah so so everybody's reasonable and it's not like you know ...\nOr a letter to an underwriter solve that right away\nAnd we're all human you know so we all know that things happen and you take care of it so\nYeah so you don't have to worry you know when that kind of thing happens and and it's probably the same with illness and that kind of stuff to a certain extent and that kind of thing too yes you know that that it's like you had to miss work because somebody was having a operation or something like that it just has to be explained and that men everybody can move on and\nAnd have a happy closing and all of those kinds of things around her yeah\nWell one thing that I heard a while ago is that somebody explain it to me a long time ago they said that you know back in the day that that um\nThat year loan files were about a quarter of an inch thick and now today they're about three inches thick and that really protects you I mean it's a ... you think of it as a pain as a consumer but it really does protect you to make sure that you're not making\nA mistake but we don't want to go back to the old days I guess right sooner you get in touch with us for seven five six sixty five or ... to fifty on your cell you were real estate sinus on line at Central

radio\nStation [noise]\nTotally consumed by a chilling last for power I'm Pam who sales Fox News President Trump leveling that charge against Democrats in a political rally in Kentucky\nAnd so but the third one third that third is is generally spent working and I guess sort of figuring things out\nUh and and uh and in that last\nThird is is more those retirement years ... and ... and and so you think of it like that it's let folks this is this is\nA marathon if you will it is not a sprint and and the any unfortunate part is you get weeks like this\nAnd and and it's Katy bar the door if you will from the media is perspective because they're going to just keep whipping and fanning these these these flames that they've been hoping that the media always hopes for a decline because declined gets people's attention much more than an increase\nIn kind and and so they just they they're hoping that this is going to happen and that way they can get everybody excited and everybody watching\nThat's the reality and the problem is well some of them\nDo a decent job and distract people particularly when you look at these statistics that say that Seventy percent of the population now there are things that the market over the past ten years has been flat or down when the reality is it's basically\nTripled quadrupled in by some measures so that's a very different perception versus reality right so what causes that what causes that is when we go\nWeeks like this and the media fixated on it it\nSays it's never going to end it's going to keep going down and and it's all going to turn into soup\nWell reality is\nNothing ever is that bad or not the new ever is that\nGood along the way and and\nUltimately what it always comes back to his economic fundamentals those economic fundamentals those things like consumer spending corporate spending those still point to some pretty strong numbers and if anything\nAnd we've certainly talked about this on the program over the course of the past month\nA lot of volatility generally kicks up at this time of year\nParticularly in mid term election years what do we talk about I think it was two Sundays ago maybe three Sundays ago the takeaways from a midterm election year one of them was the volatility increases as you get closer to the election [noise] what do we have\nVolatility increasing as you get closer to the election once the election is resolved that volatility has a tendency to dissipate so don't overreact to what went on this past week in the market will have some more thoughts on this and continue the conversation\nAt when we get back after this year on dollars and cents with ... financial planning on news radio Ninety three point one WFL I\nThe rangers Beijing ranger speaking I Want to record

on dollars in San ... about anything to do with your money why falling into seven nine one six and fix the four hundred almost all the time limit your dollar back to\nThe very ladies and gentlemen dollars and cents here on news radio Ninety three point one W. F. O. F. talking of course as you might well expect on a financial show that uh\nUh is done on a weekly basis we were talking a little bit about the market this past week and uh trying to get some perspective remember folks it is\nA marathon not a sprint if your retirement age guess what\nYou've still got another twenty or twenty five years to go so don't turn the apple cart upside down volatility a normal part of the market if you look at the past ten years there's been eleven now twelve instances of where there have been declines of between five and twenty percent\nThis is normal this is not as the media describes the media would have you think that this doesn't happen okay or when it does it means catastrophe must be around the corner that's their job\nBecause they want to get you hooked on the bad news because human nature is much more inclined to get hooked on bad news rather than good news\nOf course the problem is that you lose complete perspective along the way over the past ten years the markets have triple quadruple depending upon which ... index you look at\nBut yet you've got Seventy percent of the population believing that the markets were flat or down during that time period where do you think that misperception comes from comes from the garbage\nThat the media and the Internet ... view fourth\nTry not to pay a whole lot of attention\nTo it yes is it always a good idea to double check your allocation absolutely absolutely but you shouldn't be\nTurning your allocation upside down during periods of time\nLike this make some adjustments if you feel it's warranted but at the end of the day if you're Seventy five percent stock twenty five percent bonds don't all of a sudden becomes Seventy five percent bonds twenty five percent stock it that that's turning the apple cart upside maintain\nSome perspective on it at the end of the day\nThis is all normal it is not abnormal\nLike the folks in the media and on the Internet would like to have you believe\nAll part of the normal cycle\nBe consistent stay invested it is time in the markets not timing to achieve an investment results over time and that should be your goal it should not be\nI'm invested in his money in one year later one take it all up and how it works I mean you save money\nRight you're working during that middle third of your life your work you're putting money away you're doing that on a regular basis\nOver that extended period of time well guess what when you get to that and that last third of life you're going to be taking that money out over that entire period of time not all in ...\nTennessee So be very very careful on the information that you're getting from the media and make sure you're not turning the apple cart\nUp side\nSo some thoughts in perspective on the week that was certainly a rough week all part of the normal behavior the market on average you see these declines of five ten percent\nAt least once per year even though the overall trend that the market is still a\nA and stay tuned because as we mentioned mentioning before the break or one of the things that we talked about two or three weeks ago on the program was about mid term elections and the takeaways from that one of the key takeaways is that if you look at mid term election years you will see an increase in volatility\nSet it on this very program increasing volatility in the weeks leading up to mid term elections what do we have an increase in volatility mid term elections happened\nThat gets ... this resolution on that and what happens if you look at the prior history\nGot the third year the presidential term coming up and are in this current case\nGot a relatively strong economy consumer spending corporate spending all looking relatively strong\nAnd so when you look historically\nAt that twelve month period following the term elections\nOr the returns on an average of about fifty percent so we will hope that the pattern continues to hold true interestingly the pattern so far this year and a ... year is holding very much true to prior midterm years year is typically marred where they declined early on which was what happened in January February\nNot a good number to look at these days because it is getting skewed dramatically because of how the calendar falls\nThe ten year trailing number measures the period back ten years\nUnfortunately as we get deeper into October the reality is that you lose the first week of October of two thousand and eight when the market decline did most of its decline actually in that one week period of time first week of October two thousand eight [noise]\nWhich means that your ten year number is really getting skewed right now where by two weeks ago the ten year number which had a lot of the two thousand a decline in it\nMaking it a somewhat worthwhile number to look at was around seven or eight percent now two weeks later that number has jumped up to eleven percent tend to eleven percent depending upon what the type of fund is that you're looking at well\nDoes does does that is that\nSort of skewing the the the bottom line results of course it is you better believe it is so when when you look at that number you can no longer really rely on the ten year number to give you an effective gauge\nOf the performance of a fun to do a full market cycle and folks we would stressed you that that's an important\nFor barometer to look at is to look at what the fund has done to a full market cycle\nUps and downs sideways because that helps to then give you a number that you can sort of to plan on from an investment perspective\nBut right now that ten year number really is doing incredibly incredibly high and frankly if you've got a phone will lessen the tenure track record then you have no idea\nYou have no gauge you have no perspective on how that fun actually performed when times got tough\nAnd I would submit to you that that's a pretty important perhaps the most important piece of information to know about your investments how do these things do when times get tough\nBecause at the end of the day that's going to make a big\nDifference she'll be very careful as you're looking at funds these days the ten year number no longer a good number of because of this skewed dramatically to the positive\nAnd we're gonna continue to see that number\nContinue to get skewed as we go forward over the course of the next three or four months remember the market in two thousand eight did not bottom until march of two thousand and not so you've got between now and march\nWhere that number that ten year number is going to get for aggressively better and look for aggressively better but it's going to be a very skewed result so in order to get a true result you've really got to start looking at the Fifteen year performance number\nIn order to see exactly what went on during that period of time so remember that\nBecause that's going to be pretty important in terms of gauging performance and ah how funds have actually performed during a full market cycle and speaking of ...\nOne of the most interesting ... parameters to put into play when you're looking at a fun particularly managed fund or particularly an act of fun\nIs the compensation structure of the portfolio management team who is in fact operating that find that ... and why is that important because\nIf\nYour portfolio manager is paid\nMore on the short term basis than what you have is a fun that's not really investing what you have is a fund that is trading and trading is no way to achieve investment results overtime\n\nSo one of the biggest things you can ask where you can find out if you're working\nWith somebody and need to ask this question if you're not then you need to call the one eight hundred number and ask them this question how has the portfolio manager that is running these investments how are they paid\n... just the statistics will in fact shock you eighty percent eighty\nPercent of portfolio managers make more than half\nTheir compensation on a one year performance number let me say that uh get eighty percent of portfolio managers make more than half of their compensation on their one year performance I'm Sorry but that's not rewarding\nInvestment results that is rewarding timing and it's a problem that's pervasive in the mutual fund industry and it's one of the biggest reasons why most mutual funds don't perform very well there was eleven thousand different mutual funds out there\nThe mutual fund industry has a bad rap because the vast majority of them\nDon't do very well at all their internally expensive\nThey have funds clearly the management team as being is being incentivized is being paid to make short term trading decisions to boost performance because let's face it human beings always act in the best interests of their wallet\nSo if they're competent if your compensation is tied to\nThe majority of your compensation is tied to what you did over the course of the past year [noise] what do you think you're going to do\nWhat do you think you're going to do as you know you get to the end of the year and they may be lagging a little bit behind on ... you know I'm going to start trading one struck trying to go ... for the fences if you will\nYou only problem is when you're sitting in for the fences that's also when you have a tendency to strike ... which is why so many mutual funds under perform the market\nIs because the compensation system is wrong it doesn't reward investing in it rewards trading\nAnd that's one of the biggest underlying issues that you probably don't hear much about the nobody wants to talk about compensation and how the portfolio managers are compensated nobody wants to talk about it okay but we think it's a pretty important thing\nTo look at and the ass it's a question that we ask regularly\n[noise] of the funds that we recommend to our clients is the question that we ask regularly\nBecause we want to make sure that if you're managing investor money that you're incentivize and paid to be an investor not a traitor\nHis trading never works to produce good investment results overtime so that's one of the many questions that we ask\nWe're trying to decide what funds to recommend to our clients\nIt's very important to know how the portfolio management team is actually being compensated the test sticks and the numbers suggest that the vast majority of funds portfolio management teams are compensated\nMajority of their compensation is based upon a very short term twelve month track record those are the kinds of questions that you want to ask when it comes to your investments and your money\nTo make sure that the interest of that fun in that portfolio management team are aligned with your interests will have more when we get back you're on dollars and cents this is ... now some financial planning on news radio Ninety three but one WFL [noise]\nFrom

cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved enduring storing aerobic activity and it even proved to support brain function great study from Weill Cornell Medical school to New York I was just reading that an even neutralizes free radicals\nBut the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any perceived health threat like not eating enough\nCaloric restriction your body feels threatened this which is on what they call the longevity gene in your body switches on sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a secular level but apple ism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the tape\nAccording to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard and this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening in all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWow this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years of their co Q. formulas\nBut now that feature co enzyme Q. ten which is just as important as well is there a troll especially for your heart health and you also say in some ways it's got even more evidence behind it so let me ask you this who needs ... ten ... what exactly is it good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak or what our co enzyme is a cold wind\nTime has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects well co Q. ten is the new trend that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart\nYour liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy\nWow that's amazing yeah well that's what it's all about not only that\nBut it's a very powerful antibiotics and\nAnd I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's awhile ago while I was teaching for the first time and physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin where they were looking for what makes the heart beat well they found out that was co Q. ten\nAnd that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell wins himself a Nobel Prize for describing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten\nSo we could say it's so darn important because your energy is related to the amount of coke you ten and your body and without an adequate supply of co Q. ten you're living in what we call an energy deficient stay your heart and he's co Q. ten\nIn fact the highest concentration of co Q. ten in your body is right in your heart muscle\nYour brain needs co Q. ten at all times co Q. ten supplies energy not only to your heart and brain but to your immune system\nIt supplies energy to your lungs to your liver so needless to say we all of this energy that case is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty\nYou've got less than fifty percent of the co Q. ten and your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential\nWell doesn't person I understood you told purity that it was time to buying these to reduce the co Q. ten and the reserve troll now why is the product is cutting edge combination purity calls it their co Q. super boost formula what can it actually do for people\nWell its energy I mean the combination of these two incredible nutrients resveratrol and co Q. ten in fact\nOne of my students called it the advantage I like that so I adopted the term is combining to amazing nutrients unto themselves which a spectacular but when you combine them indeed this spectacular ... if we can call it that this is enhanced this advantage this cardiovascular advantage\nThe cardiovascular benefits\nBenefits to your brain function and cognitive performance it even is involved in healthy aging and it's important for supporting immune function it's great for your skin it's great for energy and enduring Santa Rosa capacity and as we said before\nIt supports normal ... activity throughout your body\nAnd I think this is the ultimate combination not remember mark as we said the energy in your body is converted by co Q. ten add to that the benefits of resveratrol this combination it is on beat a boat and indeed you get as my students said this real advantage\nBut it's interesting you know we're talking with Dr Alan ... know that you tell me more about the consequences of being co Q. ten deficient\nStill well that's really interesting you know one of the assignments I gave my class awhile ago was to create a co Q. ten deficiency questionnaire well the first thing everybody agreed on in class was a feeling of being run down so basically a lack of energy\nA lack of stamina and remember we need a constant supply of energy to live and to thrive and co Q. ten is a key nutrient involved in energy production\nBut the point is you don't have to have these symptoms to supplement keep in mind that co Q. ten is crucial for your general energy production\nAnd as we said it diminishes as we age\nNow I Know you used an recommended coke do tend to patients for decades but now the story is better we seen abundance of research merging onto a spiritual\nSoup you tell purity to combine there was a miracle blended with the co Q. ten you tell your do you want them to give away a full size bottles for free and they finally agreed but how would you just do the benefits and you had to list the top three or four reasons the tables formula what was the\nWorld's number one without a doubt the energy the indoor and stamina but he has more physical performance cardiovascular protection but as we go down the list I'm going to talk about immune support I'm going to talk about increase anti oxygen levels in your body would protect cell membranes and end some addict function\nAnd there was just an amazing article on co Q. ten ability could decrease the rough and find wrinkles and your skin it's an amazing combination so I Can't give you a three I gave you a little bit more than that\nBall right even better but regarding new co Q. ten plus was very tall blimp purity products how many glasses or read one is this equipment to\nWell I Would say two to three classes a day\nAnd that's what you see the Mediterranean diet\nYeah that's what you see exactly in the Mediterranean diet but I got to tell you personally I couldn't handle that maybe you could\nWell [laughter] I don't know but I\nTalked to me about how many capitals I've got to take when they do take multi vitamins I take fish oil\nWhile you just need to take too soft shells a day and that's really easy to take and the best time to take them as writing a book for a meal\nLaw now that the best known a pause for a minute remind
