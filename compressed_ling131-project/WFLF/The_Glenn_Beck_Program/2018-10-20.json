underneath the bar to bark there's\nNot real thick it's about the thickness of a piece of cardboard that underneath it\nIf it's a a cream colored to an orange colored that's the mushroom route route fungus\nAnd that was taken him out and and that would be my guess and it doesn't take 'em out right in a row normally they'll take one out here one out there too in a row or something of that nature and and regretfully Jerry I don't have good news there is nothing new about it the ... are just very susceptible to I'm\nA nurse or men in back of us thought he was doing something nice and he was he

question here a ... a text message says a lot of foliage on my young mango tree this spring summer should attribute\nThat girl leave a lot of the ... going to do under I leave the foliage\nI mean you know less a tree needs some opening up or or a size reduction but outside of that more foliage more grows more fruits more flowers\nI I Would just leave it alone now we do have with our fruit trees are ones like the mango for instance we want to keep them to a certain size so it's harvest civil but we're looking at the center young tree we're looking at trees that you know maybe around twenty love the twenty five feet were belt where you want to keep them\nUh and we want to keep in balance so that we don't have a misshapen tree but outside of that I wouldn't touch it I don't see any reason to do any pruning on the street or we started off the program talking about things that I think I should do I left out three of them here\nI'm In the last three ... do the weather's getting cooler we

inside its consulate in Istanbul, Turkey once senior Turkish officials said on Twitter that is not possible Saturday administration to wake up ... out of this crime if it's confirmed\nYou know yeah but ... yeah what would that would be left to go out there but I'm telling us aid to people you it would be much better to have a service play you know I had to get to get it service uh\nAnd and she will join us on him outta sight outta mind even some of the people we have agreements where I have somebody fulltime who calls out sets appointments and even some of the people what the agreements you know they don't need it right now the units running good it's nice and cool in the house but it's a maintenance and preventive maintenance they don't flood the house\nIt is but you know when when I bought my house just my new house a few months ago part of the cells agreement was they had to have the AC cleaned and service yeah\nWell two months down the road I'd come home one night and they'll always flooded why the AC tech didn't blow after Condon site\nPipe and a half and\nThere I Am an eleven o'clock at night with a ... was that wet drive back on the outside taping it to the Condon said rain line and then pouring hot water in the ... my neighbors thought I was crazy\nNow do you know for sure they had a service to CNN voice and unfortunately not okay but\nYou know they don't\nHave a ... which is\n... right and that's the thing is you know on on on a few jobs like that and that was Kate they had it service but yet the conversation during was a service with me that's the first day of course that's where the\nConverse everybody's drains going back ah that's right the matter you know and and it can cause a lot of damage ... him if\nIf you pull ... ... ... for a half and half a gallon hot water down there every couple of months it's never gonna backup because you clear out the drain\nAnd we have an attachment to a wet and dry in fact we hooked to the line outside and just let it run than going dump it out and if you want to be grossed out go looking\nGuy right well I don't have that special attachment I've got it but I've got something else I bought duct tape [laughter]\nThat's another purpose far and we've had shows whatever you use duct\nDuct tape before I ... and you know they just take the vacuum stick it on a type of clothes or that it's that can suck you\nKnow on her up this morning I was reading a review a ... showed me on this phone from one of his customers and it was a nice review but one of the things that mentioned is you know the wife of the\nUh of the couple or didn't\nThink she needed all wanted to have a home inspection kinda kinda the way it was written thought it was maybe a waste of money\nYeah she she was skeptical because he's he's one of these guys that likes to maintain this time okay good but\nBut he's buying another home so no\nNo this this is they're putting in time and he wanted a a maintenance things say he knew if there was any issues that needed to be taken care of okay and uh we found some\nAs a as far as people purchasing homes you know uh I Know it's not mandatory by you know banks or anything like that but um most people I Would think in today's day and age would have a home inspection well\nMost too but ... ... especially now that the market is softening again but when the markets very hot like it was the last few months where there weren't enough homes on the market there was more biased than they were settlers\nI'm One of the things that people would do because they were desperate they would put the clothes that they forgot to the home inspection so they can get the closing they moved up and make an incentive for the people to sell because hey if there's something wrong don't worry we'll take care of it often we bought a house\nAnd\nYou know so they bought a house and they get and then they find the ... yeah\nYeah well they find that that Scott saloon them lick wiring and now they've got to repair it well they got federal Pacific electrical panels like the home that I did for this gentleman for maintenance you don't and it's very federal Pacific panels oh is that right that's the daughter house\nWell he had a he had an older house and then when they split federal Pacific they had an addition put on the house so there was one\n... um service drop with two hundred dams was another one with a hundred dams and then the electrical panel where the water heater was that they were using as a shuttle was another federal Pacific panel\nThey were popular because they were inexpensive and at the time you know as an industry we didn't know there was something wrong with the right\nAnd so you know now you have to bring up the whole electrical systems cold code and he's got some salted aluminum\nFiring and but ... but he I asked is going to be safe mhm and that's the big thing you know people say with federal Pacific well I've never had a problem is never trip from Rob the probably\nThe folks if you're if you or Google if the panel of federal Pacific electrical panels and if you have one in your home and he'll he'll read read there's plenty to read there but uh you know and most insurance companies will not insure you if they know you have that in your house\nAnd and federal electrical is not the same as federal Pacific Electric\nYet in terms of how can they tell if they have a an inside of the panel label it'll tape federal Pacific Electric company and they have an orange handle in most cases\nRight little orange thing at the title the average of the breaker and very often on the on the cover on the X on the outside it ... it's the mental to stand with if he\nOh okay and the problem is folks um there've been known to trip in other words if there's a short circuit in the house instead of trip and like a normal BRCA should and this is designed to keep just send in power there and sending power there in in a ... could cause a fire\nAnd Charlie talk about what happens when you put in a new air conditioning\nAs happened at this time and the maximum average was forty five\nThey left the old sixty ... breaker in there\nSo it probably didn't get inspected because inspector would pick up on the ... when we have to check off what size breakers in there but you probably can't get a federal Pacific forty five yeah yeah\nWell if I may breaker yes but you could still go to the main distribution panel or it could ... upgrade change the disconnect outside to a breaker and put the proper size\nRight and how expensive is that compared to rebuilding your home values or anywhere\nYeah no I mean if you have that your\nGoals should be to save up to get federal Pacific out because uh when you go to sell it and there's a home inspector it's going to be flagged it is and uh and that's not a good thing because ah when houses or a certain age people will call us they just bought it and they got an insured and they have to have this document filled out\nYou know one of the things is does have a woman I'm wiring does it have fuses as have federal Pacific\nMandolin it and you know we have to fill it out properly and they send it off to their insurance company and\nUh they'll force them to change the panel right and uh and it's not you know so and the ... sorry Kennedy on so if when when you have at the home inspected it's you'd think the markets off and do a little bit\nIt has it has you know at one stage [noise] gives its normal in Florida have sixty they inventory on the market mhm we went down to low within forty days and went back to about forty three forty four days right now so is softening up prices have gone up\nI think the more ... writes them on a summer or you\nKnow and it was ... now and then of course come the end of November beginning December right through the end of January it soften because people are starting to buy gifts for Christmas and then come January when they get the credit card statement\nI break

Fifteen sixteen hundred dollars is in stark a budget do you think you have a leak Frank\nNo but I'm like like anybody else I'm you know I'd I'd like to be as proactive as I can\nAbsolutely especially in this case 'cause it you know again you know you're going to minimize damage can be one leak are just\nSo off the moment and then you see people home after a leak in the lowest at school for three or four days you need you beat him at the door and they shake and you know did all the noise and then the camera or whatever ... during that process\nI've seen our neighbors we have a I live in a community it's twenty five thirty years old and I've seen firsthand neighbors come home and their power house was flooded\nAnd exactly it's it's a light nightmare\nThat Dr ... and the owners of the\nIf you have to experience one time you just want to do that one one you don't want to you know you do not do a second time\nAnd that's a lot of why we would look and look quite some time\nIs up like that to minimize that type of damage or that experience and that's what this does in like a one payment insurance policy exactly you know and again for running we find that the insurance it gets paid it over time uh it pays for itself to ensure it when the insurers\nRank they may ask you a crazy question what's the color of your plumbing pipes ... color\nYes because she said the houses about twenty five thirty years old ... yes her as the white ... was a cop\nOut say white okay All right\nThat that that's a good sign because of was gray and had blue writing on it you'd have all the ... when then that would be a major problem but you know ...\nThat the community was built in stages now I Am neighbors [laughter] some other plumbing is is copper ...\nAnd some of it it's kind of a mixed bag [noise] so that's why I I tend to I Would tend to ... to ... be a I'd rather be\nSafe right spend the X. ray Fifteen sixteen hundred dollars right you know\nThe exact me it's a great insurance policy and that's what a joyous yeah\nThey're in a you'll be surprised how much you know damage occurs from things you don't see you were talking earlier about the air conditioner the a garbage

W.\nLife dot net WFL I find ... ... patients every door Orlando news radio nutty free by one WFL a and I heard a radio station [noise]\nClashes with police out the caravan draws closer I'm Pam who sales Fox News\nYou know right but you know they don't exist and says now that you know you know you can go to the big\nBox stores you can get him you know multi packs for thirty forty bucks and you get to three or four of them and uh yeah I Know the expense well\nIn that you know it's just a a I'm Still stuck on the one in each bedroom\nOh yeah that's been code for a little while so I mean your whole you know houses older adults yeah here's a little bit older and uh you know coach changing everything all the time\nAnd uh usually it's for the better oh yeah most most code is safety rhino and public safety and so forth a ... and ... and it's important you know now\nCharlie when you guys go out to test you use can smoke correct yes Orion's who's you also get the candles that you you can light and they give off a lot of smoke\nYeah we don't do that we have an air handled and smoke it's made to test smoke detectors\nAnd that's what we use because it's just pushing the button doesn't mean anything but it means the button ... yes that's exactly right\nAnd they should all ring in tandem if it's done right there why it and write in such a fashion that you pushed one there all day all started going how difficult is it to go back in we reward you know Adam ... at them yeah you have that at them and\nAnd work for some reason I'm the batteries fail and the smoke detectors start beep and this happened in my house about a month ago between two and three o'clock in the ... that's where the U.S why the batteries that in there and that's why people go out and they just tear it down shut it\nYou know in a ... and and they're going to get to it another day that I get\nThis is like the old Ron Popeil Abbott's sit and think that low on the table and forget it right now so [laughter]\nBut it's an important thing that you shouldn't have in your home and and the other thing you should know where your main electrical in Maine water shut off is you know I got I got a problem\nYou know uh because you know we from time to time have somebody call the office and you know and they have a link and they don't wear always shut it off I don't know you live there where do you shut it off I don't know uh but if you go look at your water meter\nGenerally than look to the corner that how you know the closest corner of the way the crow flies yeah and it should be around there if you if you have one\nBut but that out by the ... we asked people about you know the water meter a of their meter or maybe that's what we're asking but we're about to water meter and they take us to the electrical meter yeah last on how we get that a lot but this the water is going to be getting out by the curb or\nIn the grass lot that was going to be covered up by grass was going to be covered up you can't buy it but uh just to get in the area\nYou know if it doesn't it's not easy to shut it off at the meter for no not really you know the utility company ... ... is a be able to they don't want you shouldn't do it off you know uh that's for them to stop Iran a homeowner to turn it all you need a ballot by your house\nRight you shouldn't have most too but not at all to not all most do not yeah and in the George you said in the past on the show if you have a high oh you think you have a high bill don't have an swap you're meter out\nRight there that's how that's how it's been in the past Charlotte because you the older meter usually when they failed they under registers did over register but my after we\nI I Would say a different new meters now those have to be swapped out 'cause we're finding that they get over it after the the the new leaders one those\nDigital meters ... made a smart meters yeah but the reason why I don't know how they are I I think that they said that way on purpose either I think that's the smart part because what we're saying that a lot\nOf what they're over registry\nYou know and they're not Ovechkin by you know a couple of gallons I mean people getting you know forty thousand get ah it's like a gallon a minute for us you know a big big leaks are showing up as big leagues is is the meters not even know that they're moving right\nDo either of you know what the average person family consumes and water a month\n[noise] they figure\nYou can figure each person normally as a rule is about three thousand per person you know so you can for about twelve thousand gallons\nPer month ... that's a lot of water well\nIt is too you start to get in that twenty thousand gallons of mud water be like you know we started looking at that but we got to look at our numbers we probably would give up about ... thousand ... oh well family that's\nUsed in pretty good you know you you you're not really being conservative they're not into day's work and you know 'cause you got all these orders saving devices customer base you know that so that should be down from there but if you tell the person you're pretty good so twelve thousand the good or bad for the war\nAnd they say if you have children you know teenagers and you have a tank was water heater you consume more cars in exactly you got water never cools off you gotta is warm that so they stay in their longer ... I'm doing okay then as far as water consumption once and well yeah how many gallons you use\nThe um about the right one thousand three hundred a month oh yeah that's because you'd never home yeah once a week without a doubt and right yeah you were out you're\nGoing to get a call from the water you want to come check your meat or what you have a newer home too so you have a lot of\n... I have a lot of water saving ... right yeah and start\nDoing that you can get that ... so you probably about right there ... three thousand yeah\nI Know I've had a couple of shocking bills and and that's when it was because of my sprinkler system right now I had a leak in and then sometimes I'm running on a Sunday I come home and check it and make it run all the zones and so forth\n'cause my water bill runs about forty five bucks a month\nWhich is that and go to shore yes but\nSeventy five percent of that is taxes butter that\nThat's what we're talking to people about the water and they tell us about the dollar amount if not the dollar amount we work with you know because of that right I Want to know the consumption consumption yeah we can the conception is not going to change that dollar amount as all over the place the ... ... ... ... you're talking\nYeah who has a higher water rates around central Florida oh I don't want to name names\nBut [laughter] I don't know\nBut I 'cause when I was in Kissimmee I wasn't on well and septic so I never\nHad a war to build oh and I are you working up to a new day oh\nYeah I sure am and of course I've got you can uh gee now too but that's another ... irrigation do with the irrigation irrigation is on um got a ... you pay for it or is it yeah I get charged for it in\nSome places it used to be free than it was a flat rate right\nNow now they charge you a gathering of course I got my notes from a Orange County this this last week say time to reset your sprinklers to one so white once a week now instead of twice a week\nYeah and that and I did see a ... a toehold water\nOn my street one morning early when I was coming to the radio show ... um and they stopped in front of a couple of houses down with a spike was going in and uh right in the morning you know 'cause they weren't supposed to be on\nRight and and so if you go even numbers you cannot be worked on this day and go on numbers you can any word on that
