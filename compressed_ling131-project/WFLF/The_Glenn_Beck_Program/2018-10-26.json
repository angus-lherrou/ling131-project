both very strong hum of personality very strong and so you know we seem to be able to get along reasonably well\nDo fine and I don't know why can't transfer now to the political arena I Know it's when

and good morning Orlando from the front gate realty studio from your cell phone pound to fifty he word\nReal estate we continue to follow breaking news and you have to be brought us are you a moment ago here one of these packages of one to another anti Trump Democrats I'm\nCory Booker had that investigation continues and that was discovered here in the state of Florida and they're investigating and their ... now\nThat male facility the male sorting facility down around the Miami area an awful lot of thinking that they may be able to get to the bottom of this and figure out who's responsible will follow it all day and nobody was I'm sure we'll be talking about a Monday cell\nThank you God Bless you and God Bless America [noise]\nThis is a Fox News alerts an eleventh packages turned up this one in Florida I'm Dave Anthony and it was also sent to a Democrat Senator Cory Booker intercepted again in Florida looking similar to the other ones that bomb like devices inside the envelope stand Fox News has learned\nThe mainstream media has been painfully obvious that they are not fans of Donald Trump on many occasions the attacks that are that they have a have been the hitting him with and then silently retracting\nAre false but also the media has been under attack by the White House for very long time\nIt's not an issue with just the current administration and stop making it one President Obama was historically a nightmare for the free press and you refuse to say anything about\nIt the crazy thing is today the craziest thing is is\nThat the media gleefully gave Obama a pass even though he was ... the FBI and the de OJ against the press\nDonald Trump has gone so far as just calling them fake news and they got their feelings hurt forget about the oh I don't know threatening to\nThrow us all in jail this ... that it is calling us fake news\nYeah well he kind of has a point just if you even look at how President Obama treated the press compared\nTo you know President Obama was putting new people in jail\nHe was ... the government against you and you failed to stand up and say any saying\n\nOh\nThere's the media was gearing up for its outrage over being called fake the New York times\nWas publishing an article on the very same day these pipe bomb packages were delivered now I Want you to remember this is what you know just just put this in your pipe and smoking for a little bit\n\nThere being called fake news they're being called liars they're saying\nNo no no no we're not we don't publish fake news we don't have anything against the president is not a vendetta and\nWhile this is happening the New York times is printing ... an article titled five novelist imagine Trump's next chapter [noise]\nFive novel lists imagine Trump's next chapter\nThe main image at the top of this story shows the White House on fire and thinking into the ground as President Trump waves goodbye\nEach novelist had one assignment right out what you think happens after the Mueller investigation is completed okay [laughter]\nSo let's come up let's go to fiction writers and come up with what they think is going to happen with Mueller's investigation and what's gonna happen immediately after\nAnd you mock me you mock me\nEvery single one that's going to come into the prize they found five fiction writers are going to do it but every single one wrote a short story depicting a scenario where the president was found guilty\nEvery single one isn't that amazing they couldn't find one fiction writer to write something where Trump was not guilty it's crazy one story had Trump's signing the twenty Fifth Amendment\nA and another even had him of being assassinated by a Russian agent with the help of Secret Service\nYeah\nWe can write about the president being assassinated were advocating violence I don't know what ... what are you are you kidding me know that it was about the Russians that wasn't about a coup yes yes okay Secret Service was involved but that's not about a cool\nThis is the New York times\nYou know the ones who are leading the way saying oh my gosh the talk of violence is so horrible [laughter] oh my gosh and we don't print fake news you're supposed to be investigators we're supposed to be neutral\nI thought that was the idea let's be neutral\nNow I understand that everybody has an opinion but five riders and no one can come up with anything other than the guy is guilty and maybe he's going to be killed by the secret service\nThis is unbelievable\nHow is it the two hundred journalists can sign a letter claiming that everything is the president's fault when the flagship of the American media is writing this bull crap while the pipe bombs are coming in\n\nThis this time space exhibit a\nFor why journalism is currently dead in America it is dead in America all of you dancing on the grave of Megan Kelly really what was her what was her big thin she asked a question that\nOh my gosh lock her in a tower\nOh my gosh she's got to be chased out of the public ... you can ask a question don't you dare ask a question\nThis is frightening America fact\nFinding is gone the media has already made up their mind they know the answer and if you disagree they will chase you out of the public\nSquare they have no inclination to actually at even attempt to find the truth even attempt to understand\n\nYes there's a little righteous indignation and me it's not an anger is it is righteous indignation\nBecause I have called these people I have talked to these people\nI have gone to them over and over again we've had in hand and said listen you need to understand how half the country feels\nJust have a conversation you're making a huge error and yes I made all these errors oh my gosh I'm the worst person in the world I'm with you just listen to me please you have to hear what half the country is saying\nThey won't do it they're not interested they don't care and now they're quite literally making it up what's the difference between a novelist and a New York times journalist I don't know\nMedia [noise]\nThis is a radical concept and I know you like radicals you love radical\nYou you feel there's nothing wrong with being radical mob yeah those are those are just people that feel passionately so I Know you love radicals\nBut here's a radical idea if you don't want to be called fake you might want to just start with literally stopping publishing fiction\n\nFriday over twenty second line backer program [noise]\nSelf awareness seems to be dead at this point in the media in particular Glen or this one what is the one thing that if you're conservative Trump makes the ACA criticisms of the media they say\nHey it's fake news hey these guys are relying hey they're the enemy of the people and they say that same as violence\nLike your your your your ... right I Can't go there yet I Can't I Can't I got to take a break I Can't go there yet\nI Can't I Know where you're going and boy does it need to be said I Can't do it yet but\nI can do you need a video I just crank either that or we are now he thinks that's it again I'd been telling you for years to get to your alcohol if we can reignite that it's going to be a good ratings most time can I tell you something the\nBlackouts I Need the blackout right now I Need them so desperate alright it would be so great I forgot about everything that they said that was so stupid yesterday [laughter] I don't even recall it at all I Love that idea I Need\nTo take a break first let me tell you about car shield\nCar shield is ah is is going to save you from a lot of trouble they're going to save you from taking your car in and you've got something wrong with it or even an oil change and then it comes out and they're like are going to have some bad news for you\nAnd we found some extra stuff and it's going to cost and you're like why look\nThese are surprises that nobody wants and everybody gets but if you have car shield you don't have to worry about it if your car breaks down after the warranty expires you could be out of pocket for thousands of dollars just to get it fixed but if you have car shield\nChances are you're not gonna have to come out of pocket for anything\nIf you if you want to take your car into your favorite mechanic or the dealership usually people\nOr none of their devices harmed anyone and it was not immediately clear whether any of them could have late\nSo these are ... are very dangerous yeah I mean in fact uh shows a level of sophistication I that's what I heard from CNN these pipe bombs show a level\nOf sophistication ... what's the New York times say now I'm One law enforcement officials said investigators we're examining the possibility that they were hoax devices instructed to look like bomb would not have exploded wow now you may uh you may have read the story from the New York times\nAnd I said well they never gave us really any details on\n... ... well you probably didn't get to a paragraph thirty four ah\nThat sort of like ... you know you know how you know how like Jewish people read from a right to left we read left to right Mm okay I was in New York Times it's like reading a foreign language I like to read the bottom up\nA lot of good stuff towards the end when you get to the bottom you start with the bottom it it's funny because usually the headline doesn't matter\nUh some bomb technicians who studied photos of the device that circulated on social media suggested the bomb sent to CNN had the hallmarks of fake\nExplosives kind more typically depicted on television and movies rather than devices capable of detonating almost like a Wylie coyote kind of bomb almost a digital clock was taped to the middle of the pain of feature that experts say it's typically shown on fictional\nBombs in an attempt to ratchet up\nDramatic tension ah but I'm very in real life I'm ... in fact\nThe fact they go on the New York times in fact bomb makers generally\nAvoid attaching visible clocked into their devices really keep from tipping off they're targeting no about when the bombs are said to explain it was just a like a nice little clock they were sending to these people for their death [laughter] that's what I saw a look at that and you're like that's not a bomb here's a here's a bonus if you survive\nThey all it is that it got an alarm you know what one hundred percent survive abilities so far on these bombs\nOne hundred percent survive ability\nWe're it is weird now look it could it be a I think here's a plausible scenario that someone on the right did this pay\nSomeone on the right who really does not like all these figures decided that they wanted to send a message to all these figures but aren't actually or murder they want to scare the hell out of them but they didn't actually when it kills they wanted to say that if they\nPull you want to know what you could be doing to this country let let me show yet and they're crazy they were wrong Italy horror despicable and everyone they weren't murderers and so they built this to look like bomb\nIf you look on I mean you get this example of it on social media all the time I mean if we counted all of the death threats and horrible things that you get on social media as real all the time\nYou'd have to have a staff of salads and checking them all out mhm instead you know most of the time people say crap on social media that goes way too far and that they're actually intend to do they don't intend on a you know you start to happen to for example Dana lash right like has to take all those things seriously when she was on TV\nUh she got all sorts of threats on her family and they did take them seriously but like\nAs far as I Know at least no one actually acted on those things thank God right so you have these serious threats that come into public figures often and and sometimes\nThey don't wind up panning out most of the time right even ego to look at terrorists I mean the the amount of ... people in the middle east who say that they would execute a terrorist attack on on people who are on you know people from another country for example you and I neither state it is so high it's incredibly disturbing\nYou almost would never walk outside if you realize how many millions of people will tell pollsters that yes I Would kill American citizens\nHowever obviously they're not doing it right whether it's because they're not capable of doing it or whether they're a in reality they just want to send a message or they really don't like them but I'm not going to go kill someone whatever the reason is and that could be the situation here\nCould be the same thing from a someone on the left who wants to make the right look bad a week before the election\nUh sending these things around with no intention of killing anyone but wants to make a big media circus he says are all plausible possibilities we have no relative and know that other than the fact that these were all political figures and none of the bottom seem to work and they're really all that's all the information we have right now\nWell but I Know that's that's pretty much all the information they had on the rice dog fire and um I don't know about you but I think the Germans behaved admirably I think the Germans did exactly how to do with you on that one no\nBut this is the rice dog then communist did that bright line [noise]\nUse your smart speaker to Google Home to plain news radio Ninety three point one WFL a in\nTen days fast enough don't waste register online and on the phone from my\n[noise]\nWell [noise]\nAnd the [noise] the Glenn Beck and\nBill O'Reilly Georgia's that about half an hour for no bad gray from pat gray at least heard every day uh\nJust prior to this program on the blaze radio and television network a and you can sign up for his podcast a really great podcasts lots of laughs and lots of insight path gray unleash wherever you get your podcasts pat\nShould we talk a little bit about Megan Kelly\nYes in the hands horrific crime she committed I'm surprised ... still walking around in this society sincerely has she been imprisoned yet I don't\nThink so and she needs to be she dangerous well she has you know she is violated something that NBC feels passionately about to do well he started to they\nDidn't feel that passionately about it when Jimmy Fallon dressed up in blackface as Chris Rock wait what he dressed up and imitated Chris Rock and yeah but I'm from what network though I'm a little over there\nThat was on ... you see all these Indians e NBC that end up paying network anywhere really worked for ... dress up and blackmail no no it it might be okay for Halloween the if you are\nNot making fun of someone right so he wasn't making fun\nOf well he was he was kind of making fun of Christ was he was imitating ... a ... you know it's even more agree just than that though and it's it's a it's despicable that we have to play this game and it's okay for all of them uh the Jimmy Kimmel thing with good oh ha imitating Carl Malone\nDo we have that audio yet Sarah my gosh I Am not one has agreed oh we have a rabbit listen to this is Jimmy Kimmel in blackface [noise]\nSometime and night home alone look open sky and say what the hell's going on out there for another planet\nAnd hold on while home loan rate on TV about why people getting to violence and all on a hell of a damn thing\nHome alone ever seen a flying saucer hisself folk festival real spoke at times almost say say I saw just\nHanging out that's just give me kill it's unbelievable unbelievable we talked about you imagine even even talking that way no without blackface just talking that way\nWould be our last day be gone you know I talked to\nA of a couple of different examples of blackface are being used in comedy early recently like in those Sunday in Philadelphia was one of the examples we brought up\nThat it's an insult was sending in Philadelphia they did it and they did it as for a minute they're making a point right like that only be more on ... characters on this show would think that that's an appropriate thing mhm\nRisk gimme came up with is just saying hey I'm black and I'm Carl Malone it just him mocking a black person yeah a mind the way he the only thing that speak\nThe only thing that's funny about that is the way he speaks yeah yeah that's it mhm I mean play that again tell me the joke in here other than the way he's speaking what was it the Ebonics isn't that what they call\nAnd then the person that's the only other I think he's doing right now listen to this [noise]\nI mean the joke too common night home alone look up and sky of hair on going on out there will fall into another\nPlanet in home like in the home loan rate on TV about why people getting the violence and all on a hell of a family thing down\nI mean they're not a single jokes no idea he wanted to sing retiring as Karl Malone always did no not always but often did referring to himself and third person and it's a random topic of the only other part of that basic yeah and even black face right like that you don't believe that they're getting\nCut again at the end the Jimmy Fallon one more because Jimmy Fallon has not a political enemies and Kimmel has put himself in as a political commentator so it's\nReally agree just for him but Fallon who is I think there's no ill intent by Jimmy Fallon doing that but he's friends with Chris Rock right but the issue here is it on the freaking NBC yeah you can spirit us ally early for mentioning it but you're like Jimmy you're going to give Jimmy Fallon the top but placed in your network so what\nShe said was weight but if you are if you are holding somebody up if you're if you're making fun of them okay but if you're holding somebody up like this woman who you know with\nDiana Ross she liked Diana Ross you unlike Diana Ross for the night\nAnd she's not making fun of and she's not making fun of Diana Ross well isn't that what Fallon did actually didn't ask the question teaches ... ...\n... ... ... you brought up a great point yesterday glad I thought about this as we were getting close to we're getting close to Halloween\nYou should be ashamed of yourself you should be ashamed of yourself you are going against everything this country has ever stood for no matter how ugly this speech is the first amendment\nMember of the press is being silenced\nBy you for asking a question now you may not\nOr you may not have agreed with this question because I can see how corrosive how dangerous how awful that question really was but God help you when you ask\nA question that your overlords\nWho may I just point out ads the FAA the far far far left that\nMany of you are starting to go I don't know I'm starting to be afraid of my own side when they actually grab you by the throat and say you can't ask that

don't you care about the children you don't make it on without breaking the few act man\nHey man you're the eggs audience yeah ... yeah [laughter] we have to get to\nSome more of the New York times that I Am very interested to hear what a Bill O'Reilly might think about the uh the media's actions this week I I I feel like he may have some thoughts on it I don't\nKnow yeah he's really kind of silent about things like this usually yeah he didn't call you do get\nThe sense that are above all bill really cares about the media at like ... above it he loves it you know obviously talked about the country and he talks about the issues and everything else but like you eat the passion comes out because you know he's been on the wrong\nSide of it here for a while or the passion comes out when the media is mentioned and there was a lot to talk about this week so we're going to mention the media ... going to poke him with a big wall our next our Bill O'Reilly semi Mm\nAmerica's first news when Gordon Deal every day five to six AM news radio Ninety three point one Mm\nA it was started by what's his fat face loud mouth guy what's his name to a a no no no uh Alex Jones sixty five percent\n[noise] whatever it is a you know and I and I talked to Bush about this on TV and extensively and he basically said factor\nThat's my strategy I'm not changing it okay so that's number one so Donald Trump could have done that easy but he chose the fight back trumped it\nAnd he said I'm not gonna let these people marginalized me 'cause it'll never end and the American people uh see me as a fighter they see me as a person who strikes back when attacked so while I'm going to do that\nSo then you have to say okay well who started the fracas who started this and you can make a case said Trump's bombastic a tax on his rivals in the in the primary process um started it you can make a case for that\nHow how he's he's assuming people names yeah he's a symptom the American\nPeople have never been this way we've never been this way no no no is it to them on your ... feeling beat and kit to death by being called racist and homophobia and everything else came later\nWhen it when it was apparent that Trump was a player and could win\nSee what people don't understand is that in the beginning the press didn't think that Donald Trump could do anything you want to have a chance he was he was like\nEntertainment All right let's bring out the dancing bear that's how the press on him but then when he started to win the whole strategy changed and I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does\nOkay so then it was destroy him\nDestroy ... that that would be orders that came down from the editors of the New York times not in those words but it was very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post CNN MSNBC\nElemental Facebook I mean they're on their ... their on video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered how does\nTrump counter what does he do he doesn't have surrogates I mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it\nSo he does it in a very ... and sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what is his choice\nWhat if he doesn't do it they\nAre going to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah and the liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that but he has a growing I Believe growing number of people supporting him and the reason he has it been is because it gives them no quarter yes he fights\nBack but now they're turning it around saying well your\nYour fight back it's like Kavanaugh Kavanaugh fought back oh he's out of control oh that's not a if that fight back shows he doesn't have the temperament oh come on you're you're being destroyed by these people you're not allowed to show emotion\nIt's the same thing so now with the bomb thing oh Trump did it where where CNN and we're not responsible for any of it or not us now I'm hoping that the vast majority of the American people\nUnderstand what's happening I think they do because CNN's ratings are so terrible no matter what they do no matter how they ratcheted up still very very few people watch them so I'm hoping they get it\nWell they're not going to um so so bill uh\nHow much trouble or are they in I mean the New York times literally paragraph thirty five\nIn the New York times talks about how this doesn't look like these bombs were made by somebody who wanted to actually kill anybody this was just a statement of some sort of what happened to us from the jump of course they're cartoon bombs they are leaving it it\nDoesn't ... this is a the gang that couldn't shoot straight or gay or straight this has written by major yes was a\nPress we're going to do this to get it into the press because we know the media will go hysterical\nCorrect and it could be somebody who was on the right and didn't want to kill anybody but wanted to make a statement and they're crazy\nCould be somebody on the left who wanted to do the same thing could be somebody who is just a really unbelievably worse the bomb maker known to man which I highly doubt\nIt could very well be somebody who thought you know\nBut we're going to send these to the press and needs to all of the all of the enemies of the right obviously sway an election\nObviously crowd contrived to get media attention to influence them in terms of putting my money on putting\nA button [laughter]\nHow do how does the uh media respond when it turns out that ah it's it's either a prank with no political motive or it was politically motivated or by the left\nWell that would be an amazing story when that was why I'm hoping the FBI can flush this out pretty quickly\n... how would the press handle what I think that they would um look you have to understand it every morning out of the Washington DC think tanks progression think tanks and stuff\nTo Anderson Cooper and and Rachel Maddow and these people they get stuff [noise] so that they'll they'll sit down and go okay now how are we going to spin this may

Eighteen this year alone tens of millions of dollars into the worst organizations and by that I mean they attack and smear anyone they disagree with David Brock runs one of them\nThat's the media matters guy and I don't tell me that's you know this was a benevolent mad so I Believe that these kinds of people I Can't prove it because there's no accountability and on doors but I Believe they're behind a big ... big money behind as everybody knows\nA bill I and I invite you to read what even the president of ... saying I'm this is this is backed by a cube of the Venezuela a and ousted president of Honduras\nAre that are blaming the United states for all of the unrest ah the former president says that ah America's gonna have to pay for all of this or they'll have to accept our citizens of this is just an ongoing internal battle\nA in Honduras that has quite honestly lied to many of their people um and said that America's gonna have to take you and they're going to because they're responsible for this mess this is a Marxist a revolutionary\nUh that uh has tried to take Honduras by force the Supreme Court two branches of their government\nFound what he was doing to be unconstitutional and kicked him out and he's been causing problems ever since and now\nHe Venezuela and Cuba are together and what was formerly known is all about but they are here to the United states and they're the ones financing at least the beginning of it\nThat's how it started now ... others may be involved but I haven't seen any evidence of that yet but I Would not put it past them\nRight and and it would be interesting to see if there is a pipeline of cash going into ... so this is what I say I'm skeptical of everything and I agree with you there has been no hard evidence put forth of George Soros or people like him did this but if you know it's it's\nOne of his things they've done in the ... yes but the\nThe government of Honduras should be able to trace ... foreign money coming into that country back they should be able to show people this is what has arrived here\nSo\nI Hope they do that if they if they believe Cuba and Venezuela actively involved in subverting their own country on doors and and by extension hurting the usa they have the ability to find that out\nThere or to let's go there are two other groups that are being formed now are two other waves that are supposedly following this one uh and I would love to hear when we come back what you think the president should do uh what do you think it looks like\nIf they do arrive at the border are and

they're dismissing it and that's just a\nCrazy conspiracies the thing the ghetto the Trump supporters all round up\nThere all dismissing this now um I I Can't believe that the they're going to make it by the mid term election I think this is the to the to arrive after the mid term election\nA and a possible new Democratic House which will throw us into chaos\nHey you think there's any the reality in their ... be what do you see coming in and how things are going to shake out\n[noise] why I said on Bill O'Reilly dot com I now who says that the Mexican government will break up a a lot of the uh the caravan before\nThey start getting on to vehicles because they're not going to walk to Macau in Texas or to wanna um San Diego sector either not gonna do it so they're at a there are approaching a railway term in is now in Mexico\nSome of them will get on trains heading north those trains have to stop it in Mexico city and that's where I Believe the Mexican government to start to intervene um some of them will make it I'm\nNow and they're not going to walk\nSo you don't think it'll be a mass\nNodded break 'em up that's what you know look the state department palm pay I was down there now I mean he's screaming at them now that you know if you let these people en masse go to the border we're gonna take economic reprisals on Mexico and that's what they'll do and they know it so they'll break it up\nBut some people will reach and some people would get they're mostly in vehicles I'm not sure where the smugglers command the cartels come in a a a\nBlouse in front the at us already has vehicles down there um you can do trains you can do a whole bunch of thought but when it gets to that point the um border authorities will put up barriers new barriers and there'll be man by us troops and it will be no way\nFor the migrants to get to any U.S officials to apply for asylum\nTerms already said he's going to do that he has to do it um the left is hoping for some kind of violent

section of the country or rent\n[noise] do you ah um do you see the the\nPossibility that real radicals would like to set up a a Palestinian\nUh Israel situation at our border and they would be handled exactly the same way by the media as they handle the Palestinians and Israel they\nThey ah show the big bad state beating up on the on the little guy do you I mean I I said two years ago this

small stage bring it you know bring it to Broadway bring it to the American border and that's the way they'll play it\nMay be but there's all the ... the Mexican government does not want that or they don't they they don't want that got problems on the border um you know war is one of the worst places in the world peace wanna right behind they don't want all this\nBecause it drains their infrastructure I mean this is an environmental disaster from Mexico these people only facilities that they are the water they need food Mexican people are poor\nThere's not the infrastructure to support their so yeah so how do they would love shanty\nTowns there with ... mothers and babies and look at the United states they're rich and look at these people and let them in short but the

that was ambushed after having a Humvee take a hit from an ICD\nHe was treated um he was a treated or in the wounded man and needed to carry one of the soldiers off to another Humvee to be met in fact out\nOne of the soldiers had his arm severed just below the elbow when he was in shock\nHe handed the soldiers his own arm after applying a tourniquet and told the soldier he needed to follow him as he got another soldier out that I wasn't able to walk the man and looked at his own sever an army and his hand and repeatedly told the medic that that helped him that his arm was fine and this was in his arm\nSometimes we just don't know how to deal with things\nFor two solid weeks I lie to myself my daughter was fine and this didn't happen didn't happen to her it didn't happen to us and I broke down in tears finally able to process what in the fall when my now seven year old daughter\nMy wife forgave me for spending those two weeks it wasn't until months after\nThat we would figure out who had done this terrible thing only wanted to do after she told me about this\nWas find is that this guy and cut off the offending appendages\n\nAs it turned out it was a twelve year old boy he was in

wanted to let you know that in the height of my hatred I downloaded your book addicted to outrage on audible\nWas the last couple of chapters and I heard you speak that I\nI realize that my outrage was justified but it was also toxic and it would become a force to be used to destroy me I needed to forgive this boy because we are required to forgive all men\nI forgave him in my heart\nAnd as I did I felt the burden of my outrage and my anger lifted\nYes the pain of what happens still lingers and the reality of the situation is still very real but my outlook in my spirit or no longer held hostage by my hate\n\nI just wanted to thank you for writing this book it literally helped me pick myself out of darkness so deep that I thought there was no way out\n\nI wanted to let you know that your work has helped save at least\nOne guy Christian\n\n\n\nChristian is a hum\n\nAs a man who has gone through a similar situation recently with one of my children\n\n\nAnd I thank God we caught it before anything happened\nI understand I understand\n\nWe knew that the address of the man who [noise] um did this to my son\n\nAnd I think if it would have happened and I wasn't home my wife may have killed him\n\n\nI think about it all the time I think about my children all the time\nAnd\n\n\nYour email has reminded me\n\nThat it's not just me\nOr I haven't talked to my wife about it\n\nFor the last few months and I know how much it still bothers me\n\nHow we're responsible I have been\n\nTo not realize she is probably dealing with it as well\n\nThere are things that we don't want to think about that are truly frightening\nAnd I think when\nWe look at our country when we look and we really realize\n\nWhat we really stand to lose\nIt's not our job is not our money\nIt's the unsinkable\n\nIt's something that doesn't happen to us that happens to other countries but it doesn't happen to us\n\nAnd it's so scares us that we avoided and we talk about other things\n\nBut that's just as dangerous as the outrage and justice talks toxic\n\n\nIf you send somebody if you said to everybody you met in the next two weeks you know you look like you could use some cheering up\n\nI think you'd be right about eighty or Ninety percent of the time\n\nAnd you know there are those people on both sides and this is why it is so a terrifying it's not going to beat a rational person that causes these things they're not gonna be rational\nAre going to be nuts they're going to be absolutely nuts uh and uh and that's what's\nFrightening is ... the media just puts all of the nut jobs on the right in as the regular person right when it comes to the left they don't even reports some but they certainly say well that's not\nThat's not you know that's not who Bernie Sanders is that's not a Bernie Sanders follower well I agree with you I agree with you why is this guy all of a sudden any less than the guy from burning that that was a Bernie Sanders volunteer\nAnd as we said at the time and Bernie Sanders is not responsible for shooting at a baseball field endures Donald Trump responsible for this as any\nLogical person that's ever seen anything to do with our legal system would be able to note um but you know again this is we were not going to know enough about this this is but this is a product\nOf the world we are creating now and that is all of us all of us are creating this

Want to know that I Want a guy in like an hour ago I went this guy in jail right now I Want to know and speaking of that by the way I mean isn't the bigger problem here don't we just stopped selling

good if you're driving a white van right now we know you're up to no good what did you smell\nBut what what what was it was ... or is it about which one was where were you know at home sleeping last

of things it I mean if they have their own show they can make that point I suppose\nWasn't the guy wasn't the guy in Virginia [laughter] so if you disagree with is get your own show a pleasant the guy in Virginia didn't he have a van to I thought he was living in his van or something wasn't ...\nYeah it's I think you're right yes he was because he went to um he did he would be that the YMCA the local YMCA so when the shooting happened they all knew where he was and they knew who he was because he was very he he lived in another state and drove there should basically camped out there and prepare for the shooting right he\nWas he was a Bernie Sanders guy a big big big big big big big big crazy big Bernie Sanders guy and he was living in is man\nI mean it's going to be interesting to see I think there's several distinctions to several additional levels to this list that we find out that this is exactly what is it is the person it is his band these are pro Trump stickers whatever I mean we don't know any of those things for sure yet uh but if we find that out it'll be an interesting distinction to see if he is the ... he's either a very incompetent\nLunatic who tried to\nBlow up people and failed hang on or hold on I'm well more than ... ... or he's a a lunatic who ah was just try to scare people did not intend to kill people that will be an ... a distinction that will\nBe interesting in the investigation did you see is when\nI get I Want to guess incompetent [laughter] get get sick of it too because of an like\nThat you know if you're thinking I'm going to put a sticker on my phone my bag because I Want people to know and maybe it'll change their heart maybe it'll change their mind\nThat man's not that bad that that that man is like a ... stay away from this

stickers on a car has anyone ever changed in opinion are considered a new one because someone not from one bumper sticker 'cause I think that's even possible\nBut maybe even a ... maybe not to write three you're pushing it you have a three hundred bumper stickers covering all of your windows you are not convincing anyone to your viewpoint I think you know people because of it\nOh no if you have a
