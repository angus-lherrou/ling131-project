Brandon Tatum Brandon I've set the table let's get right to a good morning\nThe morning they mail and it is mourning\nFor you because you're three hours behind us here in the eastern time zone so thank you so much for getting up and and doing this interview with us this morning as a former police officer hum I assume you've taken sexual assault reports right\nYes I have okay how would you assess taking reports from sexual assault victims and ... for his testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee\n[noise] yeah I mean are based on my training and experience and also exposure to certain cases like this it is at best\nI Believe her testimony was disingenuous um there's a lot of holes in our story in the gaps that are not consistent with the amount of trauma that she explain has the plague and her for the last thirty plus years\nYou know one of the biggest red flags for me was that two red flags was that you don't have all of her memory she remember vividly that she only drink wine beer and if her memory is betting that\nI find it very troubling and an inconsistent that she couldn't remember how she got home you're talking a Fifteen year old young lady there is no ... no cell phones around this time she lived about eight miles from the location I mean we know she'd walk\nSo I Would presume that and I've seen is in many cases when when people were victims of of heinous crimes that play them for long periods of time\nThat the moment of safety is the moment they remember most not just the sexual assault or the rate they remembered the moment if they were safely at home they fail safe\nAnd also the uh the moment in which they have to confront what the tail their parents or someone they love or to keep it a secret\nWill Brandon I appreciate that assessment now you know it seems like the socialist democratic movement is is picking up steam el though I'm not so convinced is picking up steam from the uninformed frankly and of course that's you know who they look for they look for the uninformed\nAnd I'm I'm a little concerned with these attacks and and listening to the calls for attacks from certain Democrats how dangerous do you see the socialist democratic movement and and how do we deal with these attacks I mean it it just seems like we're we're being quite passive\nNot taking it as seriously as maybe we should\n[noise] yeah I think that this is absolutely um deplorable it's it's just not right this is not what America is built on what America is made of\nYou know if you can't argue policy and you can't argue good points to help American citizens and you resort to violence\nUm bet is like you referred to earlier on the broadcast that's why you see the favorability over public is going up and Democrats going down I mean we need to enforce the law where people out here\nIn Britain and people just being disruptive and in Venus because it's against the law to go to a private business and disrupted business or threaten intimidate another person we we don't need to just\nGive them a slap on the wrist and tell them oh please exit the restaurant please exit the private business you know people need to start going to jail there needs to be you know higher consequences could deter people from doing this is unacceptable\nThere's a difference between protesters and threaten somebody's life there's a difference between standing up for what you believe in ... and being a mob\n... and I think we need to make that determination and delineation I started acting upon it I you know as a police officer former police officer you know I I Would have zero tolerance but people breaking the law to do things of this nature\nAs a as a black man\nPersonalize it for me I I'm sure your messages being trashed as a sellout or whatever\nI it doesn't seem like that bothers you but but how can you convince young blacks who are confused they're they're listening to your message and liking it but then they're also listening and watching about the things being said about you how do you deal with that how are you reaching out to the black community to to inform and educate them\nThey're the first thing that I Would encourage anybody to do with the black or white but especially um for the black communities that are coming from a a family of lying you know we stuff road on my back\nNo matter what I'm going to stay strong a staff of what I Believe and I think everybody should I mean as a black ... or a person of color or black or African American whatever people want to\nIdentify me as you know we come from from stock of people who have been slaves who of overcome adversity so someone writing a tweet about me or something doesn't make me lose sleep at all actually I sleep\nA pretty good at night over that stuff but I Would encourage people\nTo forget politics\nDon't look at Republican Democrat Donald Trump Hillary Clinton look in the mirror and say what do you want for your community you know are you tired of the same old same are tired of the violence in the inner city are you tired of not having opportunities are you tired of seeing illegal immigrants\nYou know clearly and call them immigrants there aliens there's no such thing as being illegal immigrant fame time so illegal aliens coming into your community taking opportunities are you tired of it than than what you should do is you should focus on solution and then when it comes to voting\nForget the party line vote for the person is going to do what's best for your community emotional ... gets us nowhere\nAnd my approach is probably a tough love approach you know some people can coddled\nAnd baby people into into finding out certain things but my thing um that that our pride myself on is tough love you know that's the way I was raised with tough love and that's the way I'm going to present it I Love people and the reason why I'm so passionate is because I Want to see things change and I'm tired of the same old same
