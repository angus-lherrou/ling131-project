I think it's actually a good thing not a bad thing I think it's a good thing that would that being said I'd like to go quickly I think the fashion interview anybody that they want with it and read\nAll right there's the president now is that backing a little bit away from Kavanaugh\nIs bad is and I felt that this was the president yesterday in the rose garden commended Brett Kavanaugh for admitting that he had a drinking problem but Kavanaugh was very clear that is not at all\nWhat he had or has\nHe enjoys beer is never out of control has never assaulted anybody one drunk or otherwise has never blacked out from drinking and here you have the president who is famously a non drinker because he an alcoholic older brother who was a bad model\nIn that regard and died very very young his brother friend okay so the president's never\nTouched the stuff but jeeze Mr President what's going on here when your commanding Kavanaugh for having a problem with alcohol I watched that hearing\nI watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man who is drink the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years 'cause nobody said anything bad about him and many many years they go back to high school\nAnd I graduated from high school and and I I while I did not drink I saw a lot of people drink they drink beer and they go crazy and you know they were in high school they were sixteen Seventeen years old and I saw a lot of it [noise] does that mean that\nThey can't do something that they want to do with their life so it's a very tough thing I I really believe that he was very strong on the fact that he\nDrank a lot seems like he's saying conceding that point that that Kavanaugh\nWas asked what alcohol and a drinking problem as a teenager but has overcome it and it shouldn't be held against them but that is not the testimony of bread cabinet or is it\nWhat's the president's doing here backing away so it doesn't go well he's not too closely attached to the man he chose for Supreme Court how do you feel about what you heard here this morning\nBorrow seven non one six fifty four hundred I felt like he was partially throwing his guy under the bus yesterday for the first time he's still said nice things about him and did again last night at a political rally\nFor all seven nine one six fifty four hundred eight six six nine one six fifty four hundred a toll free tech wind through three six zero Quinnipiac poll on all of this is very interesting\nNow all your Kavanaugh's upside down with the voters across this country according to Quinnipiac forty eight percent don't want him confirmed forty two percent do want him confirmed I'm independent voters have broken away from Kavanaugh there were supporting him forty five thirty nine in this poll on September tenth\nNow they're forty nine thirty nine against him no surprise here women oppose confirmation fifty five thirty seven men supported forty nine forty huge gender gap there\nForty eight percent of American voters bully forward but forty one percent believe cabin on Christine forward the original accuser who was who was there in the hearing room yesterday or last week telling her story now it's interesting\nForty eight percent don't want him confirmed only forty two wanting confirmed but forty nine percent said cabin on is the target to be politically motivated smear campaign ...\nHeck out of them as bad as not fair but we still don't want 'em confirmed\nLandslide up support for the one week extension another FBI background check by sixty eight twenty eight people support that according to Quinnipiac\nSo I've got the polling in there I've I've played a couple of sound cuts when the rose garden yesterday and by the way the president should do his own news conferences more on that later man he just shut down those reporters\nUm who wanted to ask questions when he wasn't ready to talk about something it was awesome will get into that in the next half hour but I've got to tell you it's very very interesting here by the way Lindsey Graham has said on Fox last night\nThat if this nomination goes down by let's say one vote which could happen\nUm that the president or re nominate Kavanaugh in advance of the mid ...\nArms and take the case to the people but take Italy in states where Trump won and senators are up for reelection\nAnd see if the people will put pressure on their senators to change no votes that send them down perhaps the first time if that happens and bring 'em back and get them approved I don't believe that has ever happened\nIt sounds like kind of a crazy idea that would never happen but it is now out there so where are you as we speak and the FBI continues to do its

again on this big story good morning to you Michael\nAnd good morning to you bud man happy Tuesday\nWell yes and so far so good what can you tell us this hour\nWhat we know that the FBI is extending the branches if you will of their investigation we know that they have for example to spoken to the attorney for and with legal in Kaiser herself on Saturday\nWe Oregon good friend right about girls brand of I'm Christine forward for a lotta years right\nCorrect in one of the people that are Dr Ford says was at this party at when you saw the the um the testimony from both Dr\n... cabin on Thursday she says as well as a person that was at the party would know about the situation at the party that this event all happened that with Kavanaugh pushing her down on the bed and all of that kind of stuff so\nWe'll in Kaiser said to have all this information we don't know what was talked about that investigation at that meeting on Saturday we do know that Leland Kaiser's attorneys not providing additional details about the interview but we know that the interview did happen we also know but now that as of yesterday\nCharles letting tin who is a Yale classmate who accused Kavanaugh of blatantly ms characterizing his drinking during his college years spoke to the FBI hit written in writing and writing a a statement in regards to seeing cab and not get into a bar fight over the singer of UP forty and whether or not a person at that bar was the singer\nOr there's a police report that indicates police officers did indeed speak to Kevin although he was not arrested one of the friends of cabinet was arrested at that bar fight and that seems so there's that element of this which is kind of the drinking elements slash according to Democrats\nIs this a situation where we have judge Kavanaugh lying under oath\nSo those kinds of questions are coming up and then lastly and this seems to be one of the bigger ones that needs to be addressed the FBI has in their possession now screen shots from some people who swear that they were speaking via text with Brett Kavanaugh on some of his other college classmates\nPrior to the release of Deborah marriages assault allegation for like months prior to that released they were talking behind the scenes trying to refute that claim so cab and all we know\nTalked when he spoke to the Senate Judiciary committee under oath\nAbout the first time he heard of these allegations was September twenty third of the New Yorker\nThese screen shot seemed to come back to July on some level so when did he know exactly about these allegations and then perhaps as important when did the White House know about them had they been sitting on them for a while he had he lied to the White House ... those kinds of questions right now under the or the FBI investigation\nYeah and of course Ramirez who don't want to claim that at a party years ago ... a young cabinet exposed himself to her just to keep track of rest a sweat Nick who uh is the woman who claims that\nUm that Kavanaugh was involved in setting up gang rape scenarios um drunken party she was talking to NBC\nUm but walked back some of her assertions at least that latest that I Know\nYeah between the time that she initially contacted a Michael ... who is her lawyer and then they released a statement in regards to what she was claiming against cabinet and then the discussion that she had yesterday on NBC\nSeemed to be a little bit different which kind of highlights what her ex boyfriend had said that she may not be somebody that you can rely on as far as a a cute a straightforward testimony on any kind of a level\nHe accused her of being a liar I multiple different occasions and I think that when you saw her speak yesterday there certainly were questions as to what she does recall\nBefore you go Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell yesterday on the floor of the Senate they're going to vote on this nomination for some time this week\nUh what is the latest you're hearing on one there's FBI seven background checked on Kavanaugh wraps up president wants it done by friday I'm hearing that it might be done as early as today what do you know\nIt seems to me like Mitch McConnell seems to think it could be done some time between today and Thursday and that he's expecting\nFully that it will be wrapped up done in a nice little bow and a folder on his desk come Thursday night friday morning at the latest so that they can conduct this vote that they would like that and he would like to have done on friday so listen there's a lot that we've seen that have shifted over the past week\nJust even getting an FBI investigation I think that it's optimistic to think that you're going to have the vote on\nFriday and I know that that's what McConnell wants to have for his deadline right now but I think that's probably written in pencil on the schedule and they would be able to be erased and shifted off till Monday of next week depending on what could come
