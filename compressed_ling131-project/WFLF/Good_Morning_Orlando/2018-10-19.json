referendum on the Trump presidency the midterms are just not unusual\nAnytime you have a president in his first term that the midterm she had to become a referendum on the incumbent president but even more so with the president because of how controversial he is um you know I think it's all the good I think the guys on an awesome job but you know what's going on out there but healthcare number one\nThat's the Fox poll here is something to back it up\nThe um non partisan and well regarded Kaiser Health organization does tracking poll and finds the following that fifty nine percent of Floridians want to expand Medicaid to cover more low income people that'll be about eight hundred\nThousand of them here this is one Gillum wants to do with the Democrats socialist running for governor in this state it's going to cost billions of dollars to do this why Rick Scott did not go for Medicaid expansion\nOnly thirty four percent wanna keep Medicaid the way it is so there's a great groundswell for this quote unquote free health care but it's not\nIt's going to break the back of Florida what Gillum wants to do um then there's other polling as well that says that you know hey listen what\nOh good good time with his call there I take care of your patients on Medicaid under corn babies with Medicaid and everyone in between and she is so misguided a lovely lady though she's right if I don't know\nIf an older person has to get into a nursing home they're eligible for Medicaid as long as they don't have five thousand dollars or more in the bank um you know people get health care in this state\nTiny easily the problem is it's not always going to be government run health care Medicare for all these government run health care dial\nAnd if they only knew the headaches that creates for our stock is I've spent twenty minutes from the phone with Medicaid just two days ago\nTrying to stay active with them because I hadn't had my fingerprints done you know I supposed to go get fingerprinted to the Medicaid provider in the state of Florida every couple of years I'm like well we already has gone through that and I could go on and on about the the the nightmare of the paperwork with Medicare itself nevermind Medicaid\nSo what is the autumn line for you you obviously I'm not buying into one Gillum wants to do what's the best policy that the scientists needs to put out there and then implement\nThis that the suffering from having been in Congress for too long because they couldn't get their act together as we all too painfully no\nHe is right about patient choice we need to create more health savings accounts down the road and we need to try to work more with the commercial insurance carriers that we already have that are starting to figure out how to make a patient accountability and Dr accountability in other words better\nQuality at a lower cost it is working it's the ship is turning around slowly using the current model and I don't see a lot of people in Florida complaining about lack of health right now I really thought and I take care of the spectrum I I really hope the standards and work on this one and and get the message out patient choice in ...\nA relationship is more important than government run health care\nGreat great call from a man who knows what he's talking about thank you and birth but as always agree or disagree I
