campaign has been not great shakes just said the very least it seems to me like they've been slow getting policy statements out on healthcare and other things as well it seems to me Gillum is everywhere and to say this is nowhere\nHe's got he's got he's got great qualifications um he stands for all the things I Believe are good for this state in for this country with almost no exceptions and Gillum is the most extreme politician\nEver to secure a manger party's nomination for governor in the state of Florida it is not even close that leap within my lifetime and this\nExtreme left wing socialist Democrat is leading and all the polls right now it's just going to be a disaster if he takes the reins of power\nThat is why last night's debate was so critically important because of the hurricane the first one was canceled this is the first time they've had a debate as CNN moderator Jake Tapper said it just sounded me last night believe it or not last night was the first time run to send us an Andrew Gillum I've ever met each other\nThat's incredible to me you know they both been working politically and north Florida I'd never met unbelievable but be that as it may\nI think you'll and got back on his heels by the opening statements because the first one wanted to say it is and it was an introduction and a warm fuzzy and talk at all about my wonderful family for a minute he did a little bit of that but it was just scientists bang bang bang here's what I stand for that it's good\nBang bang bang here is what is left wing extremist as socialist Andrew Gillum is all about and what he would do for the state let's listen\nTo run the Senate is I I Am Ron ...\nI'm an Iraq veteran I'm a former prosecutor\nAnd I'm On a mission to protect Florida's future for a generation we need to protect the economic momentum that we've enjoyed but you can't do that if you do what Andrew wants to do which is to raise taxes forty percent and introduce a lot of new taxes that will stop our economy\nThat will cost jobs I also think we need to protect our environment and clean our water restore the Everglades and freight red tide I've been endorsed by Everglades trust\nOn the guy that can get that done\nAnd I also want to protect our communities that mean standing with law enforcement\nThat means fighting sanctuary cities that means not allowing the opioid federal is to get their way look Andrews a failed mayor he's presided over a crime ridden city um he's involved in and corruption he's not the guy that lead are say I've worn the uniform I protect our communities I've stood for taxpayers\nAs governor I'll stand for you and I would protect Florida's future about\nThe most substantive opening statement I've heard in a debate in a long time but I don't think Gillum was ready for it and it wasn't the way he intended to go let's listen to this\nWell that was a mouthful ah my name's Andrew Gillum on here this evening standing for anybody who has ever been told that they don't belong or that they didn't come from the background of the right pedigree\nOn here fighting for everyday Floridian so that this is a state that works for all of us again\nI'm honored to be the Democratic nominee for governor but more importantly on extremely proud to be a Floridian and if you get into the opportunity to serve I promise to work everyday on behalf of everyday Floridians thanks and I'm looking forward to very engaged conversation\nAll right and on it went from one issue to another and we'll\nHear some of that in this hour in the seven o'clock hour\nUm listen the\nIssue here you asked me right now is those voters who are still up for grabs and haven't quite decided who they want to be there next governor okay the rights locked in with the same as the left raw locked in with with Gillum and I thought the dissenters because he's a little behind and all the polls in way behind them at CNN thing I'm not sure I buy that\nBut at any rate he needed to be strong last night they are both the best debaters you know a a viable here um we proved that during the primary season that's how they more than anything warn their their primaries by how well they debated against their opponents\nUh I I thought the sand as broad as a game I thought he was very strong and I think his basic point is this\nA lot of the polls say people are pretty happy with the way things are going in Florida right now wonder Rick Scott I'm pretty happy how the economy in particular is going under Donald Trump this guy stands for maintaining that and building on that you got something it's so he's he's the vote if you liked the way things are you want to keep them this way he's your guy\nAnd the point that I think he made and he made well and he made it will all night was just Gillum is way out there and he's a very risky vote for those of you who are still trying to decide just about two weeks out from the election\nAnd I really think that's the best point to saying this can make is that worked for to is doing really well right now why would you vote in a left wing social with who's going to fundamentally transform how ... works\nIs saying is handled a Gillum I think very well last night and he's tough to handle because he's silver tongue and very\nAndrew Gillum the issue is not you you're locked in on your vote the issue is the vote still up for grabs I think that the scientists and his message in his presentation would be a bit more appealing than Gillum quick check on the text line here if you can ten twenty seconds maybe ...\nOr yeah just a pretty much response some people think the saying is one and then I Want tax who thinks to than is to not do well at all really yeah that's interesting I like to somebody to nervous you seem nervous and that's that's what the texture saying\nOkay well listen we'll get into that a little later on again and we'll we'll welcome your input throughout the moment it's a big big\nStory no question about it

I'm an Iraq veteran I'm a former prosecutor and I'm On a mission to protect Florida's future for a generation we need to protect the economic momentum that we've enjoyed but you can't do that\nIf you do what Andrew wants to do which is to raise taxes forty percent and introduced a lot of new taxes that will stop our economy that will cost jobs I also think we need to protect our environment and clean our water restore the Everglades and Frank red tide I've been endorsed by Everglades trust on the guy that can get that done\nAnd I also want to protect our communities that means standing with law enforcement\nThat means fighting sanctuary cities that means not allowing the opioid pedal is to get their way look Andrews a failed mayor he's presided over a crime ridden city um he's involved in and corruption he's not the guy that lead our state I've worn the uniform are protected our communities I've stood for taxpayers\nAs governor I'll stand for you and I will protect Florida's future\nIt's pretty clear when I turn it over to kill him for his opening statement that he wasn't ready for all he got from the scientists\nWell that was a mouthful uh my name's Andrew yellow I'm here this evening standing for anybody who has ever been told that they don't belong or that they didn't come from the white background or the right pedigree\nI'm here fighting for everyday Floridian so that this is a state that works for all of us again\nI'm honored to be the Democratic nominee for governor but more importantly on extremely proud to be a Floridian and if you get the opportunity to serve I promise to work every day on behalf of everyday Floridians thanks and I'm looking forward to very engaged conversation\nNow I was hoping the race card wouldn't be played last night but those hopes were dashed and Andrew Gillum is the one who played the card harkening back to when he had just won the Democratic primary and uh became the first black man ever to win the party's nomination for Florida governor\nThe scientists said at the time the last thing Floridians need to do now is the monkey it up when I'm voting for a left wing extremists like you'll know Gillum knows that wasn't a racist comment\nThat the commitment don't mess it up or don't mock it up it was just a scramble choice of words for God's sake I mean Gillum knows that the Sanders has no history of being a racist or that's what made this moment so ugly in my eyes and hopefully turned off some voters still trying to decide who they want for our next governor\nCongressman and let us know exactly where he was going to take this race that day after he won the nomination the monkey up comic set it all and he is only continued and the course of his campaign to draw all the attention he can or to the color of my skin and the truth is is you know what I'm black I been black all my life so far as I Know that\nMakes me sick when the race card gets played particularly when there was no justification for it\nIllegal immigration what should be done with the estimated eight hundred and fifty thousand illegal aliens living in Florida that was the debate question Gillum notoriously sympathetic towards the illegals wants to abolish ice in its current form now want you to listen to decide is trying to pin Gillum down on this and how once again Gillum avoids answering\nAnd he did that several times last night because he knows his stance on illegal immigrants\nThey believe that of Andrew Gillum do you have a quick comment off the text line here yeah I think\nA yes bug died a few ... one person said the Senate sounded confident persuasive and ready to hit the ground running\nI thought so and ready to hit the ground running with a news for them this morning or good friend
