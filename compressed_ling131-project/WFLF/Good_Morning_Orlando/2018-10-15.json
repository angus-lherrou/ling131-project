what do you think about that case\nThis is a fantastic story a fantastic ending I get to a sad story where a new American pastor who's been in Turkey a pastor in the church was caught up in the failed coup attempt against the Turkish president Erdogan and he got a put in jail and some bogus\nTerrorism charges and un held for ah for two years\nUh and it's really the effort of the Trump Administration a tireless efforts\nTo get him out of jail that uh that that he's home now and uh and that came up with a full court press from the Trump Administration\nUh from investors are from our ambassador at large for a religious freedom San Brownback uh everyone uh got in on this and as a result pastor Brunson is free\nThat's great news now I Know you've been up all night working on a brief so I really appreciate you joining us Trump's record number of judicial appointments this is really phenomenal is that\nIt really is a you know with the Kavanaugh hearings and his his recent uh I'm a confirmation that Supreme Court\nOr it may be easy to lose sight of the bigger picture which is it in his first year in office President Trump set a record for federal appellate court judges and seems to be keeping up that record pace he's put a eighty four judges on the federal bench and what that means that these are lifetime appointment and so\nNo a set of accomplishments for President Trump will do more to restore constitutional\nOrder and sanity to our country than these judicial appointment can't be done when Trump leaves office\nThat's right that is very true you know Christopher ... the son of the late Justice Antonin Scalia had something to say quoted his dad in a in a recent article published in\nFox News on Fox News on their website\nHe said his father's once said quote no court can expect to remain immune from severe political pressure if it assumes the role of inventing solutions for social problems instead of merely applying those solutions prescribing democratically adopted statutory unconstitutional tax\nI couldn't agree with the more ... do you have seen are cords going back to the constitution and not this peer pressure and brought to you know issues driven by polls\nI sure hope so and and I saw that quote too and it reminded me of why Scalia was such a clear voice on the court or he would be the first to say that the Supreme Court shouldn't be making most of the decisions that get put over there to it\nBut the the legislative branch as an end to a large extent abdicated its power it really should be the most powerful branch of government it should be the one making policy decisions are in the hard political decisions to move the country forward uh I Do hope\nThose reporters brought to you by Walgreens looking to save on Medicare part D switching
