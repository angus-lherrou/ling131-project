now now\nStephanie forget that I just said a million people are listening and what was it that the caller wanted you to relay\nHe wanting to know how well people in Tallahassee be able to vote\nOkay that's a good question um since the election is on November six\nWe have a little bit of time\nAre we are now of course in that period where if you've not registered to vote in the November six election uh you cannot vote in that election\nAnd also I might add you can still registered to vote this is where a lot of contention comes in about voter fraud questions\nOh but I registered to vote I don't understand why wasn't able to vote well when you registered to vote after the deadline you are a registered voter but you cannot vote until the next election so we're not talking about that specifically the question is what about Tallahassee in the panhandle area that's gonna be a decision that has to be made by the governor of the state\nAnd so you know November ... election day honestly should not be impacted too badly I think there'll be a lot of recovery and they'll be opportunities for people to vote in their precincts\nThe question is because Florida has early voting\nWhere we'll those individuals be able to vote so uh also absentee ballots it really depends on the conditions\nAs to whether or not people who applied for an absentee ballot by the deadline are going to be able to receive it and return it so it really rest with the governor whether he wants to extend voting in the state\nIn those counties that are impact it would not be state wide it should not be statewide it should only be in those counties impacted where a supervisor of elections say that you know we we can't function and secure the vote and make sure that it's that is actress so\nIt will be a decision made by the governor based on input from the supervisors of elections in those twenty six plus counties I think it'll probably be fewer than that maybe ten or twelve counties impact and great question\nGreat great question thank you for relaying that and next time they'll be afraid to give me a call I I you know I'm I'm nice to my students to they don't think so but at least I challenge him to think which is what you were doing so that's all good to\nAh let's see let's move in here\nTo amendment five\nIs the super majority vote required to impose authorize or raise state taxes or fees this amendment would require a two thirds vote in the Florida House and Senate\nInstead of a simple majority to raise taxes now this was placed on the ballot by the legislature with the intent to make it more difficult for lawmakers to raise taxes see this is the big difference between having Republicans in our state legislature and also in\nThe governor's mansion versus Democrats\nI mean think about this you have state lawmakers saying we are going to make it more difficult for us to reach into your wallet now who supports this obviously the Florida chamber of commerce in Florida tax watch\nThey'll listen to the opponents of this before the Policy Institute progress Florida and get this group the league of women voters of Florida\nSo you know this this this notion that the league of women voters as impartial they're going to all these libraries across Florida and they're just giving information they're not telling you where to stand on these things well

man\nAll right Stephanie ah has\nThe call or is it a tax on the tax line that ah there's a question about the initiatives or ballot referendum it was on the ... okay go ahead and read that for me and I'll do my\nBest to answer a question for the professor yes that that'd be you who gets to write the amendments summary language that appears on your voting ballot that's a very\nGood question and the first thing you do is you find out you have to have an initiative first of all you have to get a certain percentage of registered voters in order to get the the the question even you know on the ballot\nAnd so there is a sponsor if you take a look itll show the election year that you were targeting so for instance if is the twenty Eighteen general election you might want it to be on a primary ballot so you have to determine the election year\nOr whether it's the status whether it is active or inactive the date that it has been proposed then the title so really it's the person who comes up with the initiative\nWho decides what the title about amendments should be and the language that is involved with it\nThen there was a serial number or ballot number that gets assigned to it if indeed receives the number of registered voters and again they have to be registered voters in the states and then there was a listing of who the sponsor is All right so the language is actually written by the sponsor but there is a process that has gone through\nA you have for instance the state legislature that is going to look at it and in some cases obviously the state legislature my bypass depending on the state you have to remember fifty different states fifty different state constitutions in fifty different ways of doing things\nThe constitution revision commission might take a look at it and determine whether the languages I'm not clear or for instance the league of women voters\nUh that's why we do not have amendment eight that we're going to be voting on because the league of women voters looked at the language that was provided a again I assume here by the sponsorship and assume but I Would imagine the sponsors the one that had that a terminology that you know the league of women voters said it's just not clear it needs to be fine tune\nIt also goes through the process of the Florida State Supreme Court or the state Supreme courts don't forget what happened in Pennsylvania a Pennsylvania state Supreme Court told the state legislature that they had to go back and redraw the district lines\nBecause they determine them not to be fair and before the state legislature this year had an opportunity to go back and redraw the lines the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court\nTook it out of the hands of the state legislature and said we'll do it and they actually rewrote the congressional districts and if you take a look and see what these are very liberal leaning state Supreme Court justices in Pennsylvania did they really have given a huge advantage to three\nThree congressional districts very democratic control now so\nThe answer is the sponsors submit the written word there is a process that you go through to determine whether the terminology is easy to understand or whether it's intentionally you know trying to be a little vague so when you vote yes you really you know voting no and and those types of things\nThe Florida Supreme Court does rule and says remove from time to time as we have seen\nA certain amount of ballot so very good question excellent question and a one that you put the test to the professor so I appreciate that as
