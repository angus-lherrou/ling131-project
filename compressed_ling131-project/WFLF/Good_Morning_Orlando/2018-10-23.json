the big picture here and asking this question off the Trump comment why would anyone vote the Democrat Party line in this year's midterms\nWhy I mean\nYou and I think we all basically vote for candidates that\nWe think if they are elected will make things better\nFor us for everybody else for that matter so let me ask you if Democrats vote\nThe straight party line two weeks from today and those people get elected what gets better and America\nThe economy\nAre you kidding the economy under Trump\nIs better than it is banned in my entire life time the economy is on fire\nAnd this kind of economic revival you know they a rising tide lifts all boats every body benefits Republicans Democrats men women old middle aged young\nEverybody benefits how can the Democrats take this economy and make it better than it is it is better than it has ever been\nAnd look what the Democrat did to the economy under Obama I mean come on\nYour vote the Democrat Party line why would you do it to make the economy better give me a break you know that's not that can't possibly be a legitimate reason or the jobs the jobs just there'll be a ... well\n... ... writes three point seven percent right now what what what what Mr ... it'll get it'll get better if I voted Democrat Party line for minorities in this country for ... for Republicans don't care about people of color\nWell wait a minute\nLife in America right now for minorities is better than it's ever been by almost any measure\nThe lowest unemployment rate now in history for black Americans and Hispanic Americans how are the Democrats going to improve on that why would you wouldn't possibly just mindlessly vote the Democrat Party line to make it better for minorities that's already been done what about health care a\nLot of Democrats one Obamacare which has been a failure\nWhat they really want in many cases particularly those all the left side of the Democrat Party which is now more and more of the Democratic party they want a government takeover of healthcare a single payer system socialized medicine\nThat will not be better for America and if you are used to voting Democrat you know in your heart that it is so\n... border security yes I'll vote Democrat for better border security are you kidding me your party is awful on border security and that's a mess we have now with a caravan coming in and people pouring across the border Democrats not even giving the president a single vote to try to build the wall that will stop this\n... one way to my vote Democrat but man for for national security purposes\nReally how could we been doing any better\nWe're building up the military we've defeated ISIS under Trump what are the Democrats going to do that's going to make that situation any better\nMy answer to my own question why would anyone vote the Democrat Party line and these midterms\nThe only answer I can think because I have enough respect for most Democrats to think they are not crazy they're not stark raving mad they're not all idiots what they are afflicted with a terminal tastes of trumped arrangements syndrome they're still ticked off that you beat their girl Hillary and the election\nTrumped arrangement syndrome ... hatred for Trump has clouded rational thinking by Democrat voters\nAnd a lot of people and this is true for Republicans and Democrats and I hate to say
