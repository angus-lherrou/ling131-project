that's it\nI I Do not see I never did see by the way this this blue wave this blue Saddam is coming or just as it didn't arrive in twenty sixteen the polls have all been wrong you know I I listen I watch\nI read the Quinnipiac poll as a professor of political science let me just explain a couple of things first of all when you have a valid pole where the sample of the poll is valid you have to have a minimum of at least one thousand five hundred people in that poll\nI mean look at the polls that have been coming out six hundred Ninety seven eight hundred\nAnd that raises it increases the margin of error\nYou know how how to give them have a six point lead\nThat now all of a sudden is a two point lead well take a look at how many people were surveyed and the various polls if they even give you access to it which I was unable to gain access to two of the polls on how many Democrats and how many Republicans were surveyed you know in the state of Florida right now\nThere is less than one percent between the registered Democrats and registered Republicans people did not realize that they do not understand because the media does a tremendous disservice they don't cover state and local politics or government for that matter\nAnd so when you look at it and you see that there is less than one percent difference between the number of registered Democrats\nWhich are more than registered Republican which are fewer less than one percent fewer we have never been this close\nIn this state for the Democrats to lose the majority of registered voters so the trend is not people giving up their Republicanism and going to liberalism or you know the Democratic party it seems to be quite frankly the exact opposite\nSo I Do not see in the state of Florida I mean how in the world can Andrew Gillum when and Bill Nelson\nLose what Democrats are going to go in and vote for deal I'm right and then go but I Can't vote for a for a good old Bill Nelson\n... it's just not logical if

I Do this because I guess I'd just like to annoy people\nI asked people you know when is the Santa is going to name\nA running mate I mean my gosh we're into October is this guy ever going to name a running I mean obviously Gillum pick the rich white punk excuse me kid sorry about that\nThe millionaire from Winter Park who walks around frankly when he's with Gillum and I think in his mind the way he perceives himself in the way he projects himself thinks that maybe Gillum as his running mate\nThat's how I see that and since I have a First Amendment right to say it I did so I ask\nPeople when is just Santa's going to pick a woman I mean he can't pick a white guy Gillum already did that and they go yeah this is this is a serious he already did in the beginning of September he asked and she accepted Jeanette pneumonia is\nBy the way she is the first Cuban American woman to be chosen\nBy the way Rick Scott became the first governor as a Republican to have Jennifer Carroll an African
