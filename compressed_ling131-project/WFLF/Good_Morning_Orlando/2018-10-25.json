been spilling their guts to detectives\nThey came pretty close cops say to being able to actually begin at least to carry out this flop they were found holed up in a girl's room at bar into middle school where they attend armed with all kinds of knives butchered knife\nYou know even a pizza cutter and the idea was that they were going they told they told cops that they were going to\nThey were installed there when they were found because there was a tip there was a rumor about this and I'm and about from a student\nThat they were going to attack smaller girls who came into the girl's room\nOverwhelm them slit their throats kill them piled up ... body parts up by the entrance to the girl's room and then kill themselves to be with Satan whom they worshipped I mean I\nI don't even know it takes my breath away to even talk about this and it did pretty much to one bar to police chief Joe Hall talked about it beginning with what catlin per singer has admitted to investigators\nShe

hatching\nThat do not believe that the parents had any knowledge of these two kids playing to kill someone\nYou know [laughter] [noise] well it's a great blessing that it\nNever happened okay and if these kids were adults\nA police say that they'd be facing up to life in prison as well they should for for this conspiracy to to um ah to execute into attempt mass murder and other charges as well

questions that come to mind that I lay before you\nFor your thoughts at four O. seven non one six fifty four hundred ticks along to three six eight zero I mean how do you explain this how how is it possible that at eleven and a twelve year old girl could both be devil worshippers apparently they hatch\nThe plot over the weekend watching scary movies and they just wanted to kill innocent schoolmates this isn't like they had been bullied than they were trying to get even that is not what this appears to be anybody over small enough to attack it overwhelm and killed they were ready\nTo do it to please Satan and ultimately to be with him\nYou know we have an increasingly God was society and I think it's fair to say these girls have never dark dark and the door of a church or had any kind of spiritual dimension to their life except on the dark side it would be impossible to do this\nIf you knew God if you're a Christian you were a believer in Christ in his teaching you you could not do this you could not even think about doing\nThis I think you have to look at the pop culture says pool it's\nA wash it unspeakable violence in violent images they were watching scary movies and

this morning following at all it was our news radio Ninety three point one national correspondent bills ember\nWelcome aboard bill um it's a story that continues what can you tell us this hour\nYeah good morning bud ah we now have nine of these packages total that have been discovered all are said to be similar in nature\nOr two more today one early this morning was discovered at the restaurant owned by Robert De Niro ... back in New York City or it again a similar to the others that were found over the last several days and then we now confirmation that\nAh another package that was addressed a former vice president Joe Biden has been located at a postal facility in New castle Delaware\nAh it had the incorrect address and that's why which turned away and never got to a Biden's residents\nBut still a we still have these nine packages non exploded fortunately but that they are all under investigation by the FBI right now they have some of the devices down at the lab in Quantico, Virginia where they are this assembling looking at every piece of evidence here and bud\nThese experts are guys who can take a fragment from unexploded bombs and trace it back to how it was constructed in where it came from so they have a treasure trove of evidence right here\nBut right now nobody really seems to have a lock on exactly she might be responsible aware of this stuff is coming from\nNo ... and the possibilities are so wide open they are not a narrowing it down at this point in fact right now they say what they are concerned about and what they must assume is that there are other packages out there so they are urging everyone to remain vigilant\nOr if you see something suspicious be shared a reported to authorities and if you look at the people who have received these packages from George Soros to the Clintons Obama's\nOr Eric Holder I uh John Brennan Maxine Waters Joe Biden and now Robert De Niro uh yeah you have to say what do they have in common all had been critical of the present it all up and people the president has lashed out at\nCould be easy to assign blame but right now they are not doing that it could be a range of possibilities even coming down to someone just wanting to play havoc with a mid term elections\nYeah lots of um lots of things we still don't know and of course for CNN and the mix and their\nPresident I'm younger is outraged here you know and and\nAnd and really really is blaming along with so many others in the anti Trump media\nThe president of the United states for his harsh rhetoric or for creating this atmosphere here and the president is not buying any of that firing back that it's the it's the media and and they're inaccurate reporting and their hate filled the reports that they need to back down\nYeah uh that came last night at his rally in Wisconsin where he said that uh yeah I Will he we need peace and harmony but he said the media has a responsibility to set a civil tone and and the false attacks and the false stories that they have been running so a\nWhile the president is calling for a a little bit of peace he continues his attacks on the media that's a little bit disturbing\nAnything else we need to know before you go ...\nWell I I think that the situation now is that a ... a question remains but as to whether these were viable explosive devices or where they just a message that was sent\nA in in advance of the mid term elections that remains to be seen but at this point what we're told from the initial analysis an X ray analysis of these devices before they really got into them is that they were assumed to be viable explosive devices just very fortunate no one has been injured\nAmen to that that's the good news there and thank you so much news radio Ninety three more and more natural corresponding bills ever always on the big stories for you as always thanks so much for joining us on good morning overland do build your welcome bug you about\nSo um what are your thoughts on the blame game that is being played here and the media Italy immediately they any Trump media was blaming the president\nAnd mediate Lee yesterday\nWith no evidence at all and of course he is not responsible he didn't send these devices the person or persons who did are responsible\nAnd there are people on the extreme left and right who are capable of such a thing there's no question about it rush is floating the theory\nThat the Democrats are actually doing this\nSo they can June up negativity about the president and negative feelings about\nCandidates who are supporting the president and or or endorsed by him all to curry favor with their voters in the mid terms\nI don't know whether that's true or not I don't know where the truth lies but we will stay on it what are your thoughts though the blame game though is outrageous\nWhat the anti Trump meeting a machine was doing instantly to the president yesterday that is outrageous\nAs to exactly who was responsible I don't have any more idea than the FBI or you at this hour but I certainly will take phone calls on what you think about the way the blame game is being played and who alternately you
