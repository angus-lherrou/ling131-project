just south of the coastline so it is cruising in order to fixing it to make landfall early to mid afternoon\nAll right we'll be checking back with you again another hour for those just joining us a impact for central Florida yesterday we were talking about some higher than normal winds maybe an inch or two of rain any change in that forecast for central Florida\nNo this is too far off to the west where in a patch of actual dry air it's called substance on the eastern side of the hurricane so we're actually going to be largely rain fried today won't get a little bit of a breeze got up to twenty maybe twenty five miles an hour which isn't as an abnormal here\nAnd we're also going that we can see a line of thunderstorms moving through later in the afternoon as the storm kind of had slant and start to spread out\nAnd I sent an outer band through but that's a ... there's not going to be a whole lot\nAll right thank you so much Maggie Johnson for joining us accuweather meteorologist we'll be checking back in about another hour well he is\nThe one of the the finest men that I Know he has served his country with distinction his family his extended family now his children serve this country with distinction of former Florida attorney general and former congressman Bill McCollum I'm In many ways I Wish she was sitting in the governor's mansion\nAnd uh you know in ways that God has he puts\nPeople to work in areas where he believes they are needed and so Bill McCollum has been very active behind the scenes and very active for Republican clauses\nAnd um he's paid quite close attention to an alarming process\nThat's taking place in Arizona many people don't understand they don't really you know listen or pay attention or understand what merit retention of judges are\nThey aren't quite sure what the merit retention of judges are and if you look at the Orlando Sentinel today there is a commentary a here by Scott Maxwell he's suggesting who should get booted who should\nStay but the congressman McAllen this this whole stacking\nThe bench or looking at merit retention is something that's really on fire but under the radar right now in Arizona right\nIt is that's a really big issue out there for some reason the teachers' union\nUm has come out against two of the judges and they have apparently put quite a bit of money into trying to seek the judges by\nDefeating them all ... retention of being upset with them because they had a a ruling that said that a constitutional amendment they wanted to put on the ballot was not written properly wasn't a well written in terms of the description uh and that's very common in Florida we see that\nFrequently with our Supreme Court in fact our attorney general by old office would take those cases and try to persuade the courtroom where the other about what the ballot initiative that red and if it was sufficient to inform the voters so uh it's really interesting to see a a group\nThat gets so angry about an issue I think in this case it's pay raise out there and believing the judges all her against them that they would go put this initiative or as the big big deal for them it was not allowed on the ballot by the court\nThe justices by the way a nobody knows exactly how they rule is five to two but the names of who ruled one way or ... what we haven't yet been published a under their rules\nShell America retention is a big deal\nIt is and and you mentioned that one of the biggest concerns was that Arizona with the state income tax it with a ... a potentially doubled that state income tax to pay for these teachers and and what the union wanted it is that right that's\nWhy is she the best kept secret of that campaign I mean would you put her out there were a little bit more or at least put her in a position where the media has to cover her as a news story goes up to now she's been virtually ignored\nWell this is what happens with lieutenant governor ... times as much or already known well a such as buddy McKay was when a lot and Charles picked\nHim to be his running mate but it's very hard to get attention and the media it's very hard for that but to the governor on his or her own to do that yes she is highly qualified uh but I think the\nFact of the matter is that people aren't going to vote for or against somebody at the top of the ticket\nFor governor on the basis of their lieutenant governor they're going to vote on the basis of that person right so\nWe're on to satisfy really does need to\nGet his message is out there about what he would do as governor and why he's the better candidate and why the other person is under the contrast way ah it's as simple as that and a voter turnout by the way it's going to be really big deciding issue at this racist it always is but it's particularly true to start\nSo uh we can talk about the issues of what needs to be done but\nTurning out the Republican base vote and getting a winning your share of independence and getting that vote out and the ground game that you want to call it that is going to decide this election in my opinion\nVery good former Florida attorney general and congressman Bill McCollum again thank you for your service to our country and your family's service to our country and for all that you do for conservative values and for the United states of America and of course your home state of Florida thank you\nHave a very good day and my very best to you and your family Michael is now a life threatening category for hurricane and a woman and her emotional support
