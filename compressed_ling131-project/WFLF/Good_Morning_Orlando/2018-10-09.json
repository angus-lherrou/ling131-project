very welcome\nLet's take a look at some of the amendments you know yesterday we talked about a couple of the amendments we had it on open mind Monday a call asking where I stand on amendment for I Do not support amendment for that is the one about villains\nOf restoring voter a rights for voting rights for felons so let's go through them will take and tackle one through four\nToday amendment one is the increased homestead property tax exemption All right\nYou know my feeling with government is we need to stop paying for their mistakes\nThat's the problem we have with government government make some mistakes mistake they want a tax increase they want us to pay\nA for violating really there for a financial so do the do she airy responsibility the stewardship of our tax dollars in other words they're messing up and they're spending our dollars so amendment one reads increased homestead property tax exemption would raise the portion of a home's value\nThat can be exempted from non school property taxes so we're talking non school here right\nThe legislature voted to refer the exemption to the ballot and twenty Seventeen the proposed changes would apply to be assessed value of a homestead property between a hundred thousand a hundred and twenty five thousand raising the maximum exemption to Seventy five thousand so what does it mean\nWhat it means is this shift could save homeowners a couple of hundred dollars and why should we not get money back in our pockets\nI mean we have a balanced budget amendment and almost all the states here we have fifty different states fifty different state constitutions you know the only ones who can't seem to balance the books\nIs the federal government\nAnd of course Ted Cruz and of course of Rand Paul both have introduced at various times a balanced budget amendment in the U.S Senate and it has gone down in flames\nYou know if we don't balance our checkbook where do we end up in jail the shift could save homeowners a couple of hundred dollars but a legislative staff analysis estimated local governments which really do rely this is very true on property taxes for revenue would lose about six hundred and forty five million dollars in the first year if the exemption\nWhich takes effect if it's past January first as a ... you know when I say to that they get enough of our tax dollars here I mean after all we have an extra penny sales tax some of it goes to school some of that goes to roads ... everybody has to tighten their belts\nAnd it's about time that state and local government tightened its belt and if they can't do the job then they need to get out of the way\nThey need to simply get out of the way\nAnd step aside so I say yes on amendment one which is the increased homestead property tax exemption it will save us money and keep money where it belongs\nIn our pockets not in some elected bureaucrat or bureaucrats a pocket presidential proclamation on Columbus Day twenty Eighteen I Want to read just a part of this because President Trump really really send it to the left yesterday they went nuts because he said\nIn fourteen Ninety two Christopher Columbus and his ... probably the ... the parents are in the sense of first spotted\nThe Americas are the best Trump biking to I've been working on him two years I still can't do too well\nHis historic achievement ushered in an age of discovery that expanded our knowledge of the world Columbus was daring journey mark the beginning of centuries\nOf transatlantic exploration that transformed the western hemisphere on Columbus Day we commemorate the achievements of the skilled tallying explore and recognize his courage willpower and ambition all values we cherish as Americans\nAnd you would have thought he had just a written some proclamation to declare war on a country which by the way if you take my US government class you know the president's cannot declare war\nIf it's that among amendment their support what we can't tell you what to say or to do but it's it's it's a it is a very politicized group the league of women voters of Florida is a posing Florida tax watch now you want to know why\nThey say that the group's position\nThis is the league of women voters in Florida the group's position is that no tax revenue\nShould be prohibited in the constitution okay\nThat's a very liberal democratic view so

oh well we can't do anything because according to the police union contracts discipline of officers is up to the police well wouldn't that be John Mina\nOf course that's a little uncomfortable isn't it because the Orlando police chief is running for oh Orange County sheriff\nSo where's the pressure on me you know to address the concerns of the citizens I mean first of all you don't dump this on your police chief\nUrine elected body a governing body you have elected city council people you have a mayor elected separately and what they did was they look down the eyes of the gay community and African Americans and said basically we're not going to accept responsibility\nAnd were you hearing you we've uh we feel your pain\nBut at the end of the day they did absolutely nothing for the very people they say they care so deeply about\nSo why don't you take some action why don't you call your police chief in while he's not out campaigning for sheriff and ask them hey\nWe have some complaints here we we're trying to build trust and the community ... particular would ever want to go on this program before she details the kind of insults that the city of Orlando gives the black community from time to time\nSo I think the question is at the next debate for a share of candidate Mina what do you think about this police officer\nAnd what do you intend to do about it because the mayor and the city council says says that he works for you well doesn't everybody worked for the city council I mean they obviously think they do the taxpayers at least they think that they do\nSo
