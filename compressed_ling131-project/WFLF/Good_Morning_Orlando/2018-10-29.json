CNN and then somehow the president is responsible for the slaughter at the synagogue get that it's his political rhetoric gets the things that he says\nThat is responsible for things like this\n... this is all an effort to change the outcome of the midterms in close races\nAnd and and and and it is outrageous because the president bears no responsibility whatsoever the responsibility lies with the two perpetrators both facing multiple charges as they should\nAnd both of these guys are wackos of the first magnitude\nParticularly the killer at the synagogue I mean this quiet worker Robert Bowers you didn't like Trump by the way\nI'm now we know Trump's not an anti Semite but this guy definitely is he is a deep seated long seeding blind hatred for Jews even said after he was arrested he was wounded as in the hospital will be in court today Robert Bauer said you know\nI just want to kill Jews and he killed eleven of them six other people including for cops were hurt it's an awful
