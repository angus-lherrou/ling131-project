today from the mid\nGerms on November sex and governor Rick Scott announced yesterday through his spokesman that he will not be on the campaign trail until further notice because he's dealing with the disaster that is hurricane Michael\nAnd it's possible that he won't be making any more campaign stops all the way through November six that his wife and we'll speak at campaign events in his place and there will be surrogates other surrogates as well um and also\nBecause the storm damage the capital city of Tallahassee didn't take the direct it like\nYou know Mexico beach or Panama City for example but the capital got rough up pretty good and the mayor the capital\nIs Andrew Gillum who is the left wing Democrat candidate for the governor of this state he took himself off the campaign trail\nTo deal with hurricane recovery in his city of Tallahassee and these are this is proper this is what should be done and it would be a political disaster to just look the other way and and just continue campaigning out there I mean the optics that\nAre horrible I'm going to tell you I'm\nThe best thing Rick Scott can do is never go back on the campaign trail is not an effective speaker and communicator but he is really effective at being on the job with his sleeves rolled up and his navy hat on dealing with a crisis he's really good at that\nYou don't have to hear much all of them you can see them in action\nAnd it really ... it is free campaign coverage is what it amounts to even though he won't be you know making stump speeches and holding rallies or whatever I think it's too I think it's to Rick Scott's advantage to do exactly what he was doing politically because it plays to his strengths and it kind of mitigate his weaknesses\nYou know that's a really good point because before we went on vacation we talked about the debate between Scott and now sending Scott just did so poorly\nIn that debate either right it's just not very good on the campaign trail even though he is one past elections usually it's pretty close but I think he has a better chance of winning like you said of the the man of action you know I think that's why he's doing well in the polls\nYeah and Andrew Gillum um is a very very is effective speaker and campaign or you know and he's got to get back to it on Thursday you know we still need a I'm a ... a more powerful compelling campaign than we've been getting from Ronda Santa's unless I miss something over my vacation you know uh and and and there's no fresh pulling out there\nUh everything I see is is Gail I'm up by a couple of points\nYeah even though Gillum is an out campaigning they're still playing Gillum ads that are very good ads on you know I've seen him on the Internet I he's now he's going to be tough to beat I think\nNow we'll see enda will follow it all the way with comprehensive coverage that you would always expected anything political and elections in particular Iran it WFL like Melissa and am I correct that and and again I'm catching up with things 'cause I've been up in upstate New York in the mountains for a week but uh there was supposed to be a debate and that has been um\nYou know it was owned and just looking at him I said to be tonight yeah and actually it's ... and ... that was going to be a CNN debate I think Scott and they'll sit around and clock at night too and I think parents are hardly Scott has offered to do what I think somewhere downstream on the twenty fifth or whatever but there's been no commitment from CNN I don't know about\nYou know with a red light on for a solid
