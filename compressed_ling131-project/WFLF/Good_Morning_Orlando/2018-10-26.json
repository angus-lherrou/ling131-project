plan a week and a half before the election the Republican nominee for governor is posted details on line to check it out of his website to Sanders claims his plan offers price transparency and as many options for using a doctor is you have when using a cell phone provider\nI guess better late than never on the health care plan Mr the scientists updates at least every ten minutes at a time stories where you're all morning on good morning Orlando\n[noise] Fifteen thousand on your radio\nTo satisfy behind in every fall and governor Rick Scott fee hind in most polls in his Senate race with Bill Nelson President Trump's going to try to pull their cookies\nOut on the fire and bolster the prospects of other Republican candidates state wide where they Florida a rally a treat for supporters of the president on trick or treat night Halloween next\nWednesday at seven PM unfortunately it's a four hour drive at least from Orlando but might be worth the trip it's going to be a make America great again rally down in the Fort Myers area on Halloween and run the scientists will be there\nThe status of Rick Scott for that rally still unknown he needs to be there\nUm where are they going to hold this thing at the hurt Serino in a sterile Florida down in ... county near Fort Myers\nUm eight thousand five hundred the seating capacity I checked it right there should be a wild night\nAnd I think it's critically important I mean you know the influence that Trump had on the governor's race during the primary as soon as he endorsed Romney saying as he came out of nowhere and overwhelm the establishment favorite Adam Putnam moon never was really in the game after that\nThere was only one thing that can turn this race around barring some kind of a major development\nThat I don't foresee\nAnd have Governor Scott take that Senate seat from Democrat Bill Nelson and to have run the scientists continue the economic policies and other policies generally of this Scott administration and of course of the Trump presidency and that is a Trump rally that's a Trump rally\nAnd it's going to happen on Halloween Night at seven PM doors open at four and the tickets are free but it's way down there in Lee county um I've been looking to see whether or not we have a commitment from Rick Scott to be there you know\nHe kind of at times put distance between himself and the president\nWe've seen that he's been off the campaign trail saying my duty as governor primarily as hurricane recovery in the panhandle that's a great thing but I think the political advantage of seeing himself an action like that it is probably passed now two weeks from the storm plus\nA at any rate Rick Scott has not yet committed according to his campaign they say he is or looking over his schedule you have to do you agree with me Rick Scott absolutely needs to do this by God he has a he lives in Naples for crying out loud again sleep in his own bed down there and go to the rally\nYes I absolutely agree with you because I agree with your point you made earlier this week this election is going to be about turnout the Republicans need to turn on and one of the best people to get them to do that is Trump he just is one\nOf the best he's the AC is the one I mean the guy is unbelievable and uh he's made himself available down here he's going to do about ten more rallies between now and the election can you even imagined that he's in North Carolina tonight Illinois tomorrow\nUm he is uh he's going to be on Halloween go down there in southwest Florida and Scott needs to embrace\nHow do you think he's going to win this thing he's down in most of the polls to Bill Nelson okay he's played the hurricane recovery leadership part very very well but he's played that card and he's still down\nRight and he needs to he needs to hope that the campus as well too because I have a feeling a lot of these people that are going to show up to vote either for Sanders the Republican of over Rick Scott as well go they both need to help each other here\nThere's no question about that do you think a Trump rally is the key to a victory for just saying this over Gillum\nAnd to victory for Scott over Nelson how much of a difference make or do you think it will make or oh seven nine one six fifty four hundred a eight six six nine one six fifty for whatever the toll free text me get through through six eight year were standard message and data rates but\nWe've talked about the corruption of the uh uh of the Tallahassee government under mayor\nAndrew Gillum running for governor of course the left wing silver tongue socialist here\nThat looks to me very corrupt and clearly is cast as a liar and being on the take for these expensive Broadway tickets in the and everything else and and you know really being trapped by an FBI Under Cover agent in a moment I Will share something else about um about Andrew Gillum that has not getting enough attention\nUm if you are pro law enforcement as I Am\nYou need to understand how anti police Andrew Gillum is and you'll actually hear him say it\nFresh sound on that coming up don't miss it\nYou want to talk about the race here and whether the Trump rally is the key\nAnd whether or not you believe is we do that Rick Scott's absolutely got to be there a run to saying this is already on board the rally is more than anything to try and get him over the finish line and that needs to happen in his race against Andrew Gillum so what do you think on this Friday morning All right let's talk politics Shelley and will do that\nRight

think another businesses but\nThis is the one I've been in for a long time I have seen that done to people if they're looking for a reason to get rid of you they will find something more often than not um and even in the cheerful apology on the air and later in the week by Megan Kelly after she apologized privately to the staff and uh you know and\nAnd and went on the air and said I I Am sorry here I defended the idea of you know being able to dark and your skin for a Halloween costume\nI'm ed and and and and\nThat I didn't think that that was racist or it wasn't when I grew up and she said it seemed okay well I was wrong and I'm Sorry well I don't necessarily think it was wrong but it it's an all trumped up thing by Megan Kelly against Megan Kelly by NBC they want it around and looks like they may have to eat a sixty nine million dollar contract to get rid of her\nUm I mean it's unbelievable uh al ... and everybody was saying she goes on policy to every one of color in the country they rented on Lester holds a nightly newscast I mean to just to humiliate or it's outrageous\nAnd she did apologize she\nDid vociferous sleet and tearfully and it was it enough okay I mean that's ridiculous but I don't think Fox you take her back what are your thoughts on this ...\nWell I I think they were looking for an excuse to fire her like when you said yes no doubt I think she didn't mean anything by she donated him for it to be racist she was giving a general comment you know it's not something I Would have said but I think in tensions in context matters\nAnd stuff like this and the social media mob just gets way out of hand you know with stuff like this\nAgain they were looking to get her and they found a way to it and they have now done it but I don't think there's a place for her back at Fox I don't see it\nYeah one person actually texted on that said I'm the only thing she could do at Fox is takes Shepard Smith place [laughter] [laughter] I don't think that's going to happen though because I think he does pretty well\nWell the problem with them but the problem was Shepard Smith does older breaking new year plus the three to four show\nFor mental reporting he is anti Trump liberal and he gets on his ranch in he lectures the audience and lectures the president and I find it really offensive when he is not an old pinion guy he's not build that way he is billed as a straight reporter\nWho handles the breaking news you know not political opinion but he's got such a high opinion of himself he plays that game on a show\nWhere that's not appropriate for the host fired a problem with him\nReminds me of Jim Acosta on CNN same type thing White House reporter yes yes uh\nAllen good morning you're joining us on all of this with Megan Kelly from Elton John springs what about it\n[noise] well I agree with you that this is a trumped up charge Shane more conservative she went to a very liberal bias station and they say which is known for that\nAnd I think she was set up right from the very beginning\nSo no should not be fired and the only way I actually agree with the person who texted that\nI absolutely agree should it be great for that position if she was just a straight reporter or the shepherd's threat because frankly I don't watch him and I watch Fox all the time but I Can't stand him so I Do not watch it when he was on I Do not watch\nNow wait a minute let me let me ask you a by the way he he actually once upon a time was a young broadcaster worked a channel six year and then he went down to SBN in Miami and then he hit the big time one box game on the air and do you have the same problem but I have that I just explained with the way he goes off on on on the border\nIf not a reporter if he's going to these schools actually a very good reporter and then when he does the breaking news he can be very good at it but yeah I agree\nBut when he adds his commentary it drives me absolutely crazy he dies he's not really I don't I watch that show I used to watch the show because it was great for breaking news I get on my phone I Would watch it but now I Can't even do that\nA trend on channel Thirteen for the straight news you know because I cannot stand on where you can understand that or I turn on the fourth child turning ESPN or something else for\nThat to you got a lot of company in that regard and uh I think you know he also understand that ...\nThat he is assigned to where okay and the joker incompatible straight news reporting a weed credibility and opinion I'm a ... it's different\nCan I tell you that Megan Kelly has a problem I think she's too expensive I don't think Fox is going to pay anywhere near sixty nine million dollars for her now I Do that's going to be an issue I've\nGot to tell you I I I think they have several people if you're talking about women\nIn crime shows anchoring who are just flat out better than her as a broadcaster I'm looking at it from a talent standpoint coming up here at the top of the hour before\nWe get into amendment three an amendment Thirteen might take and yours that six but that's casino gambling and that's dogged racing and I may surprise you with my take on one or both

ramifications of allowing widespread casino gambling here\nYou know not just on the on the seminal a reservations at their facilities but anywhere here and I think it's fundamentally incompatible with our family friendly tourist industry here\nAre among Disney side on this and I think if we ever\nDecide in this state hey listen yeah we were all four casino casino gambling I don't want a small group of lawmakers who could be in the hip pocket\nOf the casino industry deciding to do something we don't want done where we live so with this amendment you wouldn't be able to expand casino gambling unless it was put to the people's vote\nAnd enshrined in the constitution with a sixty percent approval that's why I'm a yes vote on the amendment three casino gambling for all seven nine one six fifty\nFour hundred I like to know your take on that how do you plan to vote on amendments three and are you with mayor again me on that maybe you can show me the way but as of now I Am a yes vote on amendments three I'm a no vote on amendments Thirteen\nThis ballot language here if this is approved would phase out commercial dog racing\nYou wouldn't be able to wager on it they're they're you know other aspects of this but if you vote yes on this year establishing a a prohibition on the racing\nA of dogs and gambling on the dog's a no vote on this measure maintains the status quo regarding dog racing here in the state of Florida is not what it was a the industry\nIs seeing a fifty percent decrease in revenue from a decade ago I've never gone to dog racing I don't wager on the dogs I have no interest in it I'm concerned about how the dogs are treated at some facilities but there's widespread evidence that they're not abused at all facilities but my basic reason for voting against this\nIs I don't want anything but the free market to determine\nWhether businesses succeed or fail I don't want a sexually government putting a private industry out of business let the free market decide\nThere's diminished demand for dog racing and we're going to say to me will bud man what are you advocating cruelty to animals I don't know what's next we're going to get rid of\nHorse racing cars were making the horses raced and they'd have no say over it I mean you know please don't play the animal rights card here and then go out and have a chicken sandwich or a hamburger we kill animals but the free market decide\nAnd that's where I Am on this I'm a no vote\nOn amendments Thirteen that would phase out dog racing in the state of Florida so that's where I Am and that's why and now I Know what you think here if you've been wrestling with these amendments thinking about it if you got to stand on this do you know what you're going to do or are you going to leave 'em blank we'll check in with yeah the on this as well but\nTyranny of the majority yeah what does that never heard of its\nShare any of them are already I talk about a law here already at five percent of the population ginned up on a hot button issue and everybody else has to live with what they want\nYou know what's the tyranny of the majority or even you know ... it's a it's a country where we've been trying majority rule is kind of how we get things done\n... ... ... the ... already ruled the representation that's the difference\nOf not just through direct democracy and everything else\nUh yeah one person said definitely no one amendment Thirteen let the dogs run as a dog owner myself and a friend of someone in the industry I can vouch for the fact that those dogs are better care for the most family pets yeah interesting take on it\nIt seems like there's not a consistent level of care for what I'm seeing there were some places that are just you know the cage to dogs too much and whatever and others to read the dogs right the issue is I think you know if if people want to support adult racing industry here they should if they don't it closes up free market that's where I Am on that and casino gambling different\nFor the reasons I cited when I got into it with the F e so there we are a um a yes on\nThe people having control over expanding casino gambling in this state I'm In no on um the dog raging amendment that would end dog racing gambling on the dogs here in the state of Florida it's a free market deal bottom of the hour President Trump planning a Florida\nRally if
