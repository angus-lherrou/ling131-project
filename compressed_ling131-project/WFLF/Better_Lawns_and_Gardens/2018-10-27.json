animals is that an extended lifespan and it appears that caloric restriction eating less food and you're eating right now by a certain percentage\nIncreases your longevity you'll live longer it increases the activity of what we call a longevity gene they get switched on they help improve metabolism it increases your ability to cope your ability to adapt in fact this gene helps increased\nTissue repair and switched on by a group of genes called shore to ones now they've found two things at Harvard number one caloric restriction increases these longevity genes these are two inch\nWell so does resveratrol at least in their animal studies and this is exactly why ... been making all these worldwide headlines because if it works in humans as it does and these animals and I'm optimistic it will\nIt represents an entirely new approach to managing health and wellness where we potentially using a traditional compound like resin ... target the exact genes associated with these various areas of improvement that our health and our aging and our longevity\nWell now that the person you say that took you ten holds an elite status in the nutritional supplements industry because it's been so well documented and so well researched maybe give us a brief overview of the research and explain why co Q. ten research is so widely respected\nWell let's go back in Nineteen fifty seven University of Wisconsin\nThe Nobel Prize for Peter Mitchell in Nineteen Seventy eight\nThe University of Texas Medical school Purdue University in Indiana University of Grenada in Spain talking about co Q. ten being a powerful anti ... major studies major universities right here in the United states and abroad the bottom line and these studies\nEnergetic mitochondria without co Q. ten you don't have energy combine that with resveratrol I'm telling you pretty darn amazing\nNow that you present purity products occasionally does these free bottled give away with this one sounds really special wasted is so important\nWell I mean you really got an opportunity you get a chance to see for yourself what I'm Talking about\nI mean you hear me say some pretty amazing things\nAnd you say well that's pretty interesting but until you know and to try this for yourself by taking too soft gels a day of this co Q. super boosts formula you're not going to really appreciate what I'm Talking about and the best way to do that is to call the number you gave out get your free supply try it for yourself and you'll see the difference\nMore with our guest Dr Allen precedent in the middle but right

you've added vitamin D to this and you've added vitamin B. twelve yeah\nNow many people go through life not knowing that they've got a co Q. ten deficiency vitamin D vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these co factors\nRight now I think at this point in time there's more research being done on vitamin D that pretty much any other vitamin or nutrient and the reason is listen to this one\nBillion people worldwide do not get enough of vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine well I mean that's a lot of people now listen to this\nWhen most people think of vitamin date of bone and bone health you might think of sunlight as well or vitamin D\nIt also plays a very powerful role as a supporter of the immune system it supports immune system health in fact it also helps support brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and the great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function its support for healthy colon on top of all of that and a great new study out of the University of Hawaii talking about vitamin D and colon health\nI mean who thinks that those things right\nYeah that's amazing so I think it's a welcome addition to this amazing formula to co Q. super boosts formula in addition to that I said the channel look\nWe should put some B. twelve and here is welded coke bottle on that and I say that because the twelve converge the carbohydrates and proteins in fact that you're eating convert them right in the energy\nAnd this is all about energy and wellbeing\nNow I Know you say until you try this unique combination of the one hundred

themselves well\nAbsolutely must have been fascinating but Dr presents for people who were tuning in late having a quick recap here what exactly is coke Cuba's ... super formula who needs it and why is this in your opinion the next generation of coke you supplementation and how does purity street bottle offer work\nTo help convict the crux\nBlink motion activated indoor and outdoor cameras are wire free set up and minutes and run on to double a battle\nMore juvenile on the ... program I think all of us have to agree that we have been horrible this summer\nThank goodness raw hot weather wet weather over in some way to slow down I'm thinking Dr whether I'm happy to have it in fact if you are just going to fade away and you won't have to control them until next year I'll\nTell you one one of them it happens to be the basket grass many of us see that out there\nAre creeping across the ground that have a ... with me today we'll talk about it many gardeners kind of like this one because it forms a ground cover but it gets into the shrubs and flowering plants is kind of creeps along the surface of the ground comes up and\nSo but it will be fading away very quickly and that probably makes it less of a desirable ground cover\nIt also invades the turf what does it look like when like I said I have a sample with us and we'll talk about uh you know what do you do about the we ... you must control the sooner or later you're you're going to get out of control and you're going to have control them and uh also some of the weeds loved the cooler weather\nOr they were here during the summer and those some of those will fade out some of the year round but then we have what we call the winner re weeds also\nAnyway we'll talk about a good morning to get on top of covering your host

S. Arlen\nCanada or England\nI must say us this time Joni Canada okay Canada wide [laughter]\nNineteen twenty seven really\nLoud journal or I came up with anything I Know but that's what it was when I read now and so uh I I guess it just kind of code on what can I tell you\nOkay I brought some weeds in the day and a here's the story\nThat I feel you don't have to worry about you won't have control now unless you want to one of them's basket grass that when they're Brian has the little critical leaf to it\nAnd and that's what I brought the most of OK okay All right and the other one I brought him was purge and believe it or not just ... it probably won't produce it now 'cause I pulled it up yesterday\nBut uh it's a point set a relative was out there has to have a I'm a warm conditions\nThe one I didn't bring in is called Alexander grass it looks like St Augustine\nAnd it grows a flat like St Augustine but it dies out in the wintertime so all three of those are going to die out so if you're home and listening to get up on the Internet you can find pictures just put in basket grass\nGreat ... [laughter] yeah\nNow you're corn I'd that is some of the best looking corn seems especially popcorn\nIt is popcorn and a first time we've grown it out there and the guard and that might have something to do with it but I've been given a regular fertilizer and they're making sure that it has plenty of irrigation\nYeah well it looked great that's for sure and nice and tall looks like his form in the ears very well you had sweet potatoes or you had some uh different squash a butternut squash is what I saw and the some tomatoes things of that nature and then you're putting in all the cool season vegetables\nYeah there was this uh what are the way it feels right now after this front came through a kind of over ... and vegetables\nAre trying to get the cool season vegetables in the ground\nI have to tell our listeners that you had grown some of the best transplants I've seen I mean those are tough and durable I think he said they were started in September\nSeptember twentieth about five weeks old and that this is the best crop I've turned out this year\nNo this is what that neither do and we were doing a little TV tape for orange t._v. on how to um put transplants in the ground but those are tough endure boy especially with all the hot weather they had to go through it or is this amazing\nWell part of the greenhouse in there has a cooling system and uh I make sure that uh it runs during the daytime uh soon as it gets about Seventy five degrees inside there the ... come on so it starts to cool right away\nThat keeps them more compact now there's lots of things to look at this time right\nOh yeah a lot of things to grow a I like the cool season or the plants aren't nearly as challenging as warm season there's cabbage isn't all their relatives ah including kale broccoli cauliflower collards coal robbing mustard Chinese cabbage and Brussels sprouts or off from the same\nPlant basically uh they've just been selectively bred to give you all those other neat vegetables in the garden and then you've got a letter says I've got Romain growing out there right now I've got a ... type lettuce also growing\nHaven't grown any leaf lettuce is yet and butter crunch lettuce or will be put out and the guard and very shortly\nAnd then we got all the root vegetables like pizza\nAnd I consider Swiss chard in that family root vegetables even though it doesn't make roots it is a beat a that was Brad specifically to make leaves and then there's turnips carrots and radishes so there's a lot to do and a vegetable garden and I guess I\nI'll Try English peas again this year and I've got strawberries grown and I'll be getting mine is and soon\nYeah my English peas are up by the way and they look for all those good but I got I'm right in on the on the edge of this coup was arriving so they say look pretty good now or any of these easier to grow or do you have some favorites\nThere's a couple that are easy to grow I think a or at least one I Know there's really easy to grow and that's radishes\nUm and I usually makes a few radish seeds when I'm putting my carrot seeds out to help me see where the rows of carrots are because of radishes pop up just on a couple of days and my favorites I really liked Romain lettuce I like broccoli variety called gypsy and I like the Swiss chard bright lights because of the colored as the garden\nYeah isn't that neat nice to have some color in the gardener now the radishes or one for kids young and old I mean if you're impatient Gardner you got to plant radishes\nYou have to plant radishes or you put the seeds out in a couple of days you'll see them sprouting and in a month you'll have him on the table if you're gonna wait that long\n[laughter] you know that's one of the first seeds I I grew my parents had me so ready seeds because they knew I see him come up very quickly and in a month or less I I'd be eaten them and you know I'm really not a big ... fan but when I was a kid uh we put them in Salt water and we ate him\nYes we can do that um they don't want to plan out too many at one time though there's so much you can take out of that snappy pap pepper tasting ball that you get out of him\nAnd I found that the key to getting the ball the farmers to have the full sun um any shade at all will give you a whole lot of ... a top growth and you won't get many bombs to form\nYou know how long do we have the plant these cool season crop\nUh we've got up until the end of February and so we've got almost five months to grow them and you can re grow radishes for instance every thirty days you can plant a new batch radishes if you're on\nYeah it's kind of a long season for so uh you know you have plenty of times and still get the gardens are saying uh now yeah that's true yeah what are we at his transplants\n[noise] a boy that's a ... almost all of them you can add is transplants broccoli cauliflower a cabbage we use yesterday and the show\nA brussel sprouts um onions there'll be transplants at this time of year you won't be able to find sets that will grow very well here strawberries will be buried rooted transplants and I usually buy those from a a a produce market over in Plant City so I make sure I got the right type that will grow during\nThere are seasons and uh it just might be too late right now for you to start your own transplant so uh unfortunately uh you could try and have some that Joe plan out maybe in five or six weeks from now but hopefully got enough time on the end of the season they'll reach maturity so\nI just go ahead and you should go for it and see what happens\nYeah each here's a little bit different I think we still have time I I think we're okay on that there are going to skip down a little bit will do onions another time ... going to run out of time uh what what general care do the cool season crops need\nA generally the same care that you get the ... and crops you need plenty of sunlight six or more hours a day water close by us to keep the garden bed monitoring moist\nAnd fertilizer and you want to put it on a frequent basis a usually about every three weeks a light application don't overdo the fertilizer lush you're growing things that you want leaves for then more fertilizer the more leaves you'll probably get\nBut that means you'll probably have more bugs to a crawl around on your plants too so you want to keep after the bugs tried to get them out of the guard and while they're small and be ready for a cold snap from time to time and protect the plants\nThat's always going to ask you what happens if we get a frost er freeze\nWhile most of these crops can handle a free a false a light frost pretty well but if we know that it freezes coming we want to go out and probably put some water in the ground and get some heat in the ground the day before the freeze is supposed to get here\nAnd that Puerto Rico cover or top so she tore a some kind of a much fabric material over the top of the plants and anchor him down with bricks are boards\nAre just so you can trap some of the heat under a couple of degrees protection is about all you really need and you can save your crop that way\nNo sound like a good idea about some classes I Know you have one today\nYes I've got one today I'm teaching for the city of Orlando we're talking about composting of Florida for a new landscape is coming up as well as turf tips in shade alternatives and I'll be talking about coal protection and holiday plant care if you can believe it\nYeah I I expect to see the first point said at the garden center very soon\nAs going to be there very soon it may be there as early as next week and when we set our clocks back\nYeah ah so ah around Halloween when they show up a pre registration is required so you know who's coming in they they can call the office at four Seventy five four Ninety two hundred or they can go up on line and get the information Orange County extension right\nRight and um we've got plenty of room just let us know that you're coming\nOkay sounds good at a very much hey thank you for helping out yesterday garden looks great no matter what you say\n... free she ate that and I enjoyed the the pictures you okay have a great\nDay or he goes down in the garden path right now I teach a class today and of course we're going to take a break journeys coming up she didn't talk about spider webs town and of

increase\nThe um [noise] I've increase the amount of chemical I'm using a little bit and I'm doing it more often and still really not getting any result\nOkay then my guess is you don't have such a those those are two products that should work I mean I've used them both\nIf you want to switch to a different chemical you could go over to or so not said killer that's available at your garden centers and ... and that's a different chemical but ... you know I used to both of those products and they take the job so I might be\nOne thing I have done I mean it it it it it it ...

C O T asthma coats and it's been around for a long time it'll be a true garden center you just go in and asking for asthma code and it's a slow release ... ... and you just follow the instructions there'll be a tablespoon or two over the surface of the soil and that will feed your plan for probably three or four months\nOkay and what about transplanting how often should they transplanted well how big is it now\nIs probably seven feet tall and thin they're saying that I pick it up out from ... in front of someone's house that I thought yeah the other one is slower and it doesn't get us not shy and so on that's looking a little ... but it's always looked good\nYeah well you just give us all this but let's not looking so good\nYellow light levels have changed too when the sun's going down I looking at the amount of sunlight we get now it's only about eleven hours a day so it's come down considerably so probably a little more light for that one uh and uh when when the roots fill the pot you need the next sized pot and so my guess is your plants are ready for the next size pot\nOkay I can live on time so she can tell people waiting thank you so much here you are very helpful\nOkay thanks you too you have a great gardening to enjoy the candy\n[laughter] you too bye\nBye bye thank you I I Need to get if you only give us a call you certainly can the number here's one Tripoli forty five lawns one eight eight eight four or five five\nNine six seven and I know what everybody's waiting for their waiting for the quiz question this is a good quiz question coming up kind of proud of this one here so we'll see how everybody does\nOkay here here's a a a text message here got one on geraniums I Want to do one on this what's but social here says I'm a new homeowner in central Florida no idea as far as where to get started or lawn care I'm planning on doing it myself\nOr any suggestions on how the access to the current state of my lawn\nOr you know you walk out the door and if you're a if your lawn looks good then it's okay if it's got some problems then you have some choices you could you could take a picture and you can email it to us and we'll be happy to look at it for you that way and see what we think\nA ... and you can go up on our Web site get up on our website a better lawns dot com go to the uh contact us and then just telling me you know the same type of question tell me you want to send me a picture and and then I'll I'll respond to you then you can send me to picture\nA but otherwise you can take a two year extension office had and take a look at the pictures maybe take some of the a side if it starts to decline you want to take sides that is\nA not totally dead or but showing the problem and they can help you there also but but here's where I started a long doesn't look too bad I get a fertilizer application on it right now\nAnd if it has weeds and they get one of the weeding feeds a bear has a ... a nice product out there which has the we control it a ... and the reason I like that was because it prevents weeds and also controls the existing weeds\nAnd then also is a loud underneath a trees if you have trees in the area and I've\nUsed his work fine other companies have nice weed and feeds also a ... and the or so and bone died in fertile I'm a high yield they all have them there are all very similar so you can use those the control we just make sure you follow the label labels low labels what we've got to follow\nAnd once you've done that it's amazing how well the launch going to do I fertilized our law not too long ago and and it's nice and green coming back after all summer stress and everything\nWhen it comes to pass ... or you didn't say what kind of law in your head my guess is St Augustine so\nThen you're going to have to be looking for change bugs the major problem and that means you're gonna have to be prepared to control them at that point I go to the extension office or go up on line\nUniversity of Florida and get the bulletins on law and pass for for St Augustine or whatever your lawn is and if that's the case then you can go ahead and get the pests under control so\nOr or keep them under control change bugs have gotten hard going to be honest with you since bugs have gotten very difficult to control so if you have a change bugs or a you have to get very specific and the bullet wounds from the university will help you out there\nOkay dream question [noise] there it is\nA I was given a huge neglected uranium ah most of the drainage look kind of neglected right now unless you go to the garden center and um ... says a ... they did headed cleaned it out and uh as some fertilizer and so what should they be doing now there's some black spots on the leaves things like that\n... is going to start to make good grows now it loves this whether I have one to one that's about three or four years old and it uh it it uh you know a wasn't doing well during the summer I expect that every year so I've cleaned it up straight up\nI'm a even a took some of the old saw pop put some fresh in Costa planted dwindled down to size a little bit\nAnd now I'm fertilize it I'll be water in it and just given a good care and it's going to do fine so if you have a dream with that type of problem just coming back out then you can go to him to start a no increasing the care take out anything is dead or dying\nOr not looking good is if you still have the dark spots on the foliage and you can get a fungus side and put that on and that should work for you also so\nNow the dreams with problems like that are ones that you can bring back at this time of year if it was going into the summer I'd say you probably have much more of a problem\nUh I have my list of uh things to do during the cooler weather I'm Joan\nIs getting some people up on line there but let me go through this a political season crops we talked about that with ed I'm a start your flower sees I started some Holly hawk seeds the other day I'll be starting my petunias and my thoughts clubs in my snap dragging seeds or\nProbably this weekend I'm getting ready to protect your place from coal they talked about what to do in the garden most schools these crops in the garden don't have any problem uh but if we get a freeze and you're going to need some covers their\nUm if you go to bring Foley planes inside the ... uh get to
