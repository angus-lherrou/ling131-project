Ninety degree weather and\nGrime well they say what do they say tomorrow at least in central Florida we're going to have a low in the upper sixties yeah that's we sixty nine and savvy I'm going to go in the sixties just to say that we're in the city yeah I I'm\nGoing to say sixties them I I've seen sixty seven months here already so I'm looking for a continuation or as as I've looked at it I'm going up on line to various areas northern Florida seventies the highest in the seventies or central Florida and South Florida\nEighties somewhere around there mid eighties\nActually today Key West is going to be cooler than we are wow amazing how how often they are cooler they're going to be eighty eight today I think we're getting for Ninety somewhere around there Ninety One round there you know but after today\nIt looks like a ... are gone maybe till spring well we'll see what we can only hope anyway\nA National Weather services predicting no place cooler than normal come winter Mm\nThat'd be kind of neat some areas or even warmer a Farley Florida is likely weather winter than normal\nWinter while they're they're Sunni snow prediction so with just ... then we got snow so Johnny snow three feet of it three where [laughter] mangy every year she predicts the warm weather\nOr wine and her um I work at ... can thank her for that the last year [laughter]\nAh but the old farmers' almanac if you read ... brought this and the other a couple of weeks ago they say warm and dry\nA scare yes yeah so the weather service says warm and wet man you know war is one of the relative terms what's warm is thirty two degrees warm in some areas it probably is yeah uh but anyway uh so old farmers' almanac says warm and dry National Weather service says warm and wet\nAnd we'll see but they're they're saying Warner or in most areas so we'll see what happens there\nAre but I'm going to find out what Mother Nature says okay so you all can help me out with this year\nOkay here's some of the things that the signs of a harsh winter we have to see if they're out there okay okay I already mentioned acorns unusual abundance of acorns huh what do you think as we have more than normal while I'm it yesterday\nJust riding down the road do it but no we actually we stopped lethal oak tree no so with the traffic light and all of a sudden acorn comes down just smacks me\nDid you look up and see if any of Joe nice friend\nOr a year [laughter] hey we're probably\nThrowing hands full that day in and one of only one of them hit me I don't know I I think there's been at least as many and maybe more of a corn if you drive down the road you look underneath the oak trees and see all the ... from a cord\nA dust or move flour or wherever you want to call it a that's been ground up by tires staying on the road so I think maybe there is a at least as many maybe more I don't know\nOh I like this one here but let's see if we've had this uh situation I Would put that on hold Joni so that uh\nSo that you can stay with us there there you go your old joined the program is going to be funny I think ah [laughter] okay now here's one I'd really like to see if you've seen this happening woodpecker sharing trees\nHow how much of that that have you seen I have not seen that the what is sharing in your I I have no idea how the different whole [laughter] I've not seen one woodpecker the trees near as good I don't know if you took it out\nThat Brian's gonna have to check this one out because it is in charge of the blackout mhm okay [laughter]\nThick hair on the night and they ... it means back of the cows neck\nSo what are the black how so how do we know I Know we'll have jak [laughter]\nWhen the ... in the Green River right now real way to eat a lot of people might not know what the green room is is the waiting room before you come into the main studio here so ah so you can check on the cows yourself I mean just go out and pet them most of them are fairly friendly\nA must see spider spinning larger than usual webs huh and entering the house in great numbers so now the only thing I've seen coming into the cockroaches mhm\nNow when I went out this morning and it was in ... we feed the birds had his little dish we bring it nighttime there's one sitting right in there wow and you know I missed a sucker [laughter] pet to swat setting Brian and quick\nAs they are yeah I think ... uh yeah in some countries struggling okay here's another one I haven't seen is but I'm I'm willing to look bless you I'm willing to look for pigs gathering sticks\nThis is all production they building a house\nAnd what I did was in the front yard I gave them a few areas look at and go find something it was going in there that didn't belong there\nAnd of course I sent all during the day as I said there should be just as there and there they found all sorts of acorns dollar we camp for growing some old shop way skunk by basket we crab grass all sorts of wonderful face throwing it shouldn't be about a normal yard garden to just like everybody\nElse ... now let's face it you had them over and you need to get some weeding done and and so that's you set up this little contest so so we'd all go out there and pull the weeds and get it cleaned up for you\nAnd my mother was smart\n[laughter] now what did they do in the backyard\nIn the back yard we did a little bit different I gave them a list and it ... it was kind of a should have seen the faces when I read the list to him [laughter]\nThat was about fifty five items on the list yeah and sent them out there to go uh go find them\nAnd uh the reason I did that with my life to where the class I like to get them back into to the fall the garden not just to to see the roses or something like that but give it back and he gets a different nuances of things that are going on\nSo scavenger hunt and getting them big back in the back behind the other Bush is a fine thanks I find that to be a good way to do it but I guess I had a pretty good time\nWe all had a good time you know I think the one plant the almost nobody knew who was the lucky nuts that are toxic only end or did you have growing there and we don't see that one very often\nYou know not too often and and I was surprised I wasn't right what's the group when we all found that so I don't know whether you had to point that out to somebody else did but ah yeah that's a beautiful yellow flowering Bush but as you said it's a quite toxic\nYeah if you eat one in your survive you're lucky that's what's lucky about it a little [laughter] now that you were telling all of us that you know it hasn't been the best fall for vegetables and I tend to agree with you so so what's been happening\nFor you know I think the problem started timing in my world last spring you know it it got hot too so they got wet and it stayed wet\nReal wet and real hot and I think just that much right there with out of a break all the way through the summer kinda set us up you know\nWe got a fungus and things like that going in abundance where it wasn't always that much in the past or the last couple of years it's been real good at planet and early fall crop this year if you find them early fall crop you might as well just because you're in July\n[laughter] yeah hot out there you were ahead of me I have to laugh because you really pushing ahead of me and and I started\nAfter you and even I mean I've lost two tomato plants already Haiti they deem a myth that we're talking with Bob ... University of Florida in Seminole county master gardener now is anything doing well\n[noise] well I think that my Juliet tomatoes are doing well yeah that's right yeah you were offering them\nQuite well yeah uh let's see what else is the first I had a problem with that might seriously but at but he's onboard a cultural spray on that got rid of them I said and they're coming along now fact I've got four or five for leftover from last season even though they're all looking pretty good sense of sweet potatoes oh good\nGrief potatoes are coming along they they they I think they need about a hundred days I just spent squarely for them that's that's all I can say that whether it's been really squarely yeah and if we start now and again as well we'll call session set back to the uh did you say is well\nThat might save us and what's not doing well [noise] everything else [laughter]\nWell you know I think the bean had a tough start maybe the corn but it looks like it's starting to come around\nThe other according to income around but I had to take really good care of that I've had to add nitrogen and the guy some higher and that puts more black cow in there or you know and I'm not sure it is just not prolific as it has been in the past I expect to see six states but a socks out there right now I've got a yellow eighty five five foot shocks\nYeah is torn tend to tough time yes it has yeah so what will you be planting now\nWell I think you've covered it pretty well on your list I Know you've got to talk about next hour or so good to have the but most of the fall crops I'll take a look at them but you know I'm going to hold off another week I don't believe it's going to say this or the school that they're talking about you know they say down to the sixties or seventies maybe eighty but\nBut you know kind of wait time I think I'm I've got to treat it like it's almost first September fifteenth of September so again because you know we're going to get some days where the temperatures stay below eighty five and that's what the plans need to to flower and fruit so you know I mean we're just running a couple of months later this year\n... believe me we will not see Ninety again I I really believe that um look down the pike down here and I think the mid eighties and and the high sixties for\nA while so we'll we'll tell you I'm going to I'm going to bet you a dollar we salad on that\nOne dollar we'd salad thank you very much and that's what people read now your front yard yesterday by the way [laughter] so uh how about the ah tropical like bananas your banana planning look good\nAll the bananas are doing quite well I've got a job\nI've got bunches of food on a three hundred different trees horse does the trees that doesn't sound like very many\nBut ah yeah they're they're doing okay they look All right if we get a little cold snap here that may be just what they need to a call on a little bit better than what they are the other a fruit trees are growing nicely to teach the pair that are not fair to the present\nA white ... ... they're all coming along quite well they're they're healthy and screen nice so maybe someday\nStar fruits flowering\nStart fruit is doing well it was go back to well I should say killed back it was a frozen back really loved to the ground and I cut it back to about a foot high on now with Becca about what'd you say that the agents and fail and flour into it and all the flowers yeah yeah but now you know\nSuppose it does get cold what happens now we're just transitions I get I think two thousand Eighteen is just going to be a kind of a nine year\nYeah well you're you're ... look good or a horseradish tree\nWe harvest ... and Dr beliefs another round them up and got those in jars so we use those we put about tablespoons of that in most all of us salads on eggs and things like that every day yeah\nWell that explains why how you are a just a just about gardening but anyway so what is your advice to Gardner's when the weather does not cooperate like this\nTime my theory about gardening is I'm not doing it to support myself or to or to feed myself I was I had to\nBe very skinny [noise]\nUh I don't think it's just fun you\nKnow so when things happen that that aren't supposed to personally I just kind of stand back and say well that happened why they do it maybe I can avoid it next year maybe bad seeds all sorts of things you can kind of\nThink about ... just enjoy the experience and yeah sometimes it's going to be productive and sometimes not so productive but but it's always fun\nAnd just plant the next crop getting ready for the next over him\nThat's where I don't look back and and just keep on plug it\nYeah and and you do store or a lot of the things that you grow I I Know Margie freezes a lot of things so so you're not going to start I'm not worried about you\n[laughter] well I Know where you live yeah there you go hey Bob thank you very much we appreciate very much you have a great gardening day\nBut there have a great day too and that's all your listeners may remember some of the stuff we talking about here is is more central Florida orient

Vaseline the rub the pumpkin down or getting on a given the pumpkin massage no that sounds greasy showing up [laughter] or you can do WD forty one says no that'd be easier I might smell though yeah visual\nVegetables and the other ones are all evil but I'm not rather than my pumpkin down with and you know [laughter]\nUm and then there's some pumpkin sprays out there to use meant a spray mental and stuff like that uh they say if a pumpkin is or not as fresh as it should be getting cold water\nI like to give you a pumpkin cold water bath and then when it's not on display you supposed to put it in the fridge raider oh\nYou can make room for that [laughter] yeah how\nDo know how you knew that the number ... neither one here was don't carve your pumpkin painted and and I think that's probably that'll make it lasts longer oh yeah and uh another one said keep the insects away\nAnd the one that I think one site is that they had a thing where you put a sticky boards out so you capture the insects around the\n... I won't go to Joey told me she is going to go buy one of those phone ... car last [laughter]\nYeah we actually have some of those out we have we do lots of little ... and we have some of those out yeah\nThe only thing I find with those is that where the ceiling together they tend to come apart so you have to take super glue and back then you have yeah we have that problem ... it's it's it's cheap it's nice to hear\nThat they look neat that's for sure if I tell you what though so anyway Brian if your car pumpkins that there are some hints I work I might get one and do it anyway just for the fun of dirt cheap enough right now I'm sure must have been a big ... pumpkins issue and stop and get on the way home we may be able to you\nI'm a talker Roy right now in in the when the mayor really good morning to you hey good morning time you're going to carve a pumpkin this year I may do something other than that [laughter] okay [laughter]\nDaughter is going to do that and we'll go over there and celebrate Halloween [laughter]\nOkay well that sounds good as it Jody wants to know what else you're doing so he's going over to his daughters and celebrate Johnny [laughter] okay how can I help you Roy\nI got things and I want to plant I'm going to like you were talking earlier with his whether how does it look at five plant and let us which burned out on me a big if I get from the ... and er it was like ... days all different types of herb is it [noise]\nI like that or no you're right on her you're right on time of uh cilantro yeah you'd probably be okay ah but\nI I put it in a week ago I are about a week ago I planted sugar snap peas and that was another thing yeah yeah they're just starting to come up Roy I think I caught this cool weather just the right time because because they're coming up now\nYeah oh yeah they certainly certainly are as as long as you make them know that this is what you want a for instance a true green in one of my communities is doing to\nChavez is using it in another one of the uh so uh arrows using it in another one that was just a few of the companies that I work with it I have them\nUsing that product and eight to twelve for ... and it can actually be used on trees and shrubs also uh and now Tim says he could even using these long said good products\nSo it's a eight to twelve for ... release with minor nutrients I only know one company that's marketing that to the whole over markets and that's be GI and they had the very bright packages and this is their palm fertilizer they're using the University of formula\nOr so so anyway ah you can you can buy at the commercial suppliers also under that formula but yeah not wearing ... yeah\nWhen I by the end for my own backyard and after the community but for my own backyard when I when I buy the like at Lowe's Home Depot when I pick up fertilizer that's specified for palm trees and my okay\nUh you know the universe I I Would try to find the university's formula that specific one\n... mainly because it's it's formulated was a minor nutrients the palms can take up that is the ratio that the palms need uh the university found also you don't want to use on fertilizer around them you want to use something lower nitrogen diffuse lawn fertilized you get a pop up extra potassium\nSo I I Would try to find that that that's the best way to go I'll put it that way I have seen some miraculous things done by just using that fertilizer\nWhat Tom thank you so much and you certainly enjoy everything you've done for the community and continue to do thank you\nThank you for being at repression hoping I'll ... I'll just a little bit now we have Beverly in Tallahassee Beverly good morning to you\nGood morning I was locked in another one I Know what happened to you I mean I didn't see me doing\nIt must have been Jody it must have been Joni I tell you we're going to cut her salary and a half what can I tell ya how's Tallahassee doing right now\nWhile everybody's got electricity back except for maybe a hundred or so people and now the nights are I mean I can call mid sixties but then we still have that upper eighties and terrific humidity which is so a therapeutic\nI tell you a barrier Beverly it's going to get better I I just my prediction now I I see seventies in your future and the ... and nice days and I I see ... as we come down the state's ... counties are going into spring\nOkay well there'll be a little something in your check [laughter]\nThank you [laughter] yeah so what you're up to today\nWell I've been meaning to try and calling for a few weeks about this I have a totem pole out in my yard that was made in North Carolina so it's got indigenous animals he knows possum senatorial yeah but it seems to be\nLike it's growing hair okay and I I assume it's an airplane\nYeah probably all over it could be like ...\nYeah so well how would you get that off\nSpray or the copper fungus or a couple of possibilities here but you could go through and use the ... side a or you could use something like white and forget forget where it's well on lichens\nOr the copper fungicides may stain things marine wet and forget shouldn't leave any residue or so that might be my first one I'd go for\nOkay and um maybe not as a toxic as the copper fungus\nSo well so you don't have anything growing on the totem pole do you\nMean nothing but the airplane yeah\nActually the copper fungus eyes is use that would preserve is so ah so but you know if there's anything you want to keep on that ... that would be a\nA an airplane like a ... then you couldn't use the copper fungus either wouldn't even use the wet forget on that but if it's just a poll by itself you want to keep that uh what forget or copper fungus I'd\nSay well now that the totem pole painted some I don't think we monitor all trying to win forget first and let you know how\nWe pay for gas going to take a little bit of time ah yeah and and copper will also the copper has a greenish color to it so that that's where it was saying is that what forget wouldn't\nYeah OK okay you could help me\nWell very good well you owe us keep uh keep it cool with him coming okay yes they cool down there okay thanks Beverly you ... have a great gardening de pre shaded are we doing here let's go to a\nBarney and Arlen into Barney good morning to you Hey Tom how are you I Am okay I I Know the cooler weather is coming so I'm energized\nAnd I have um my tomato plants are getting brown spots on the other side of the air leaves there about the size of a ... you know little specks basically can heads and I hit that might have copper fungus side yesterday I was just wondering if that's the right treatment\nYes that would be the right treatment possibly a a bacterial lease spies or maybe some of the fungal ... first thing I Would reach for\nOkay I'm ... is that something that's got to take over the counter at near I mean they're you know the looking\nNow is it mainly now where is it mainly the bottom leaves or overly\nUm mainly that bottom but there there is some ... ... a sporadic ah on higher\nYou know the bottom bottom leaves little to get hit first 'cause they're the ones that are going to stay more and more choice and you'll get splashing up from the ground or it shouldn't take over the plant you got to ... should do okay especially that we're moving into drier weather now to\nOkay my second question that told Johnny we've been here like Eighteen years and like everyone else we have slowly watch Dale ... tree and development die off and basically throughout Orlando has one in our neighborhood it's stat grapefruit that gets real thick Caitlin\nI'm going to talk to me they didn't have much of a flavor at that change seems like it hasn't been affected it wow is there something to that or\nYou know there there is something to it in that you know the they call it natural selection and that some trees may be resistance if it has real thick skin it might be the ... the parents to to the grapefruit\nOr which some people have raised their tend to be bigger fruit\nThe skins are thicker uh but I don't know it it has itself has any special resistance but that the researchers that's what they look for a they look for trees that uh had didn't die out during the breathing and they're thinking you know those may have some resistance to them\nYes\nSo when I was younger and I developed my what I Would do I call the extension office and let them know that they do have this unusual tree to survive than they can they can contact the researchers and see if they're interested\nOkay I'll do that and Tom thanks for everything you do you do and and they just love your showing it just so loaded with information thank you\nHey we have lots of fun doing it and don't
