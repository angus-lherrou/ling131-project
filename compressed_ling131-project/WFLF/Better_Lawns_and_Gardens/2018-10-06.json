this and you've added vitamin D twelve yeah now many people go through life not knowing that they've got to co Q. ten deficiency with vitamin D vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these factors\nWell right now I think at this point in time there's more research being done on vitamin D that pretty much any other vitamin or nutrient and the reason is listen to this one\nBillion people worldwide do not get enough of vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine well I mean that's a lot of people now listen to this\nWhen most people think of vitamin D day of bone and bone health you might think of sunlight as well or vitamin D also plays a very powerful role as a supporter of the immune system\nIt supports immune system health in fact it also helps support brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and the great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function it supports a healthy colon on top of all of that and a great new study out of the University of Hawaii talking about vitamin D and cold and health\nI mean who thinks that those things right\nYeah that's amazing so I think it's a welcome addition to this amazing formula co Q. super

fascinating but Dr presents for people who were tuning in late having a quick recap here what exactly is ... is very tall super formula who needs is and why is this in your opinion the next generation of coke you supplementation and how does purity free bottle offer work\nWell look I think there is a distinct advantage to having energy endurance and stamina and if we were going to isolate the nutrients and create what we would call a daily essential and somebody gave me the assignment list the top five or six nutrients that we need to literally give us energy to build endurance to bill stamina\nI went to list the following nutrients\nCo Q. ten resveratrol the twelve and vitamin D day this is the advantage as we're speaking about and rather than going out and buying all four or five

thinking boy they're down here suffering with any\nFour Ninety five maybe going up but it wasn't like that I guess now or you know this is matter when you leave the house it's you know not\nHot no Seventy one yeah yeah I Wonder how so that was kind of neat\nUh what Julian ire up north of course in Maine New Hampshire Massachusetts for a few days ... uh and we saw the lowest I think we saw was fifty degrees to bad rarely get what you had jackets on well yeah I Know their front of their ... and two days were\nKind of rainy kind of wet but then when we went to the primary pair cleared off one of the best days I think we had the ... that's true yes yes oh very nice anyway a that was a great we went over to solve the all American selections and I'll tell you more about that and just a little bit uh ... we were\nHappy to be back and forth you know that little chill that you have that they're I mean it's nothing like the Florida warm so happy to be back in Florida as mature cast a Columbus Day weekend [noise] does that mean anything special going on\nI haven't heard anything Johnny [laughter] now Brian I thought he was supposed to provide in Ohio [laughter] you know it's interesting here\nColumbus Day weekend is not very big uh-huh but if you go up north where we were staying as in that area that is a big weekend for everybody there in fact the motel that we stay at a given up a a plug the Mariner ... great motel\nOr they were bringing in extra people and for that weekend just to be able to clean the ruins and everything in a while because it's the last farewell I guess to summer\nAnd it's a ... after that a week after I think they closed down people up there on the motels and most of them pulling polling the sidewalks and go to bed for all of the week in season yeah for for\nSeven months in turn the lights on there [laughter] and the other thing that we learn there is they have a hard time getting help at this for this year\nThere's jobs open everywhere and the the prices of people are paying for laborers and things like that\nAnd so they they've had a hard time and\nUh the war we were at the maintenance man had I guess got another job so they were\nLooking he'd been there seven years but anyway uh so that they were pulling their friends and relatives [laughter] and everybody to help them for Columbus Day weekend and said big where people just come in and spend time there [noise]\nOkay what is Columbus they mean to us a well Brian Jodie and I were talking about a little bit\nAnd uh Columbus of course a made a number of voyages to the new world uh fourteen Ninety two fourteen Ninety three fourteen Ninety eight and then there was one more I think he made for voyages total but on the second one I think his biggest discovery as far as you and I were concerned as the pineapple\nDiscovered that are in fourteen Ninety three and a wide loop Guadalupe that's the ...\nUh and uh the Native Americans at that time were already cultivating the pineapple and making selections of sorts and so he took it back to Spain queen Isabel as well one of her favorites and I guess they're grown and under greenhouse conditions there probably are so\nSo anyway the pineapple ... but he discovered under plants also and I just don't have the list the ones that you discovered there so that was all kinds of neat\nOkay Joni do you remember the flowers that we saw when we were up north about the purple ask ... remember those\nJodie and I had this app is really neat mountain and we like to go up on it [laughter] you you might figure Brian it was a hill more [laughter] you know that okay that has good sized to it and we go up to the top of it and there we have some uh ... everybody knows who Mac red foliage on that but the asteroids were blooming\nThis mountain on Mount Ashland many 'cause it's a ... a was a ski area at one time for about Twenty years yeah I guess Jody skied on it oh yeah [laughter]\nGear shift is that you don't do much of that in Florida so that put them out as a decoration ... went to do with us having a out as decoration is I never skied a do did you you haven't done snow skiing down here now now I mean these are young Johnny ... also right oh yeah\nBut we'll corn has it's typical problem the worms are getting into the ... year so I did spray that was the no said last night I knew there was a few and left town\nThere's more now I'm back in town so I finally broke down I was waiting for the wall you know the pulse less just the paper was Joanie talked about last week I think it was will come in and feed on those uh but uh they they didn't make it this time so I went in and put the spin those sit on I Know it'll take care of it for me\nAh spend no citizen veil and the fertile alone or in the bona fide and southern a products a bona fide it's a oh I forget the name of the product now or a dead bugs somebody's that bug but uh it's just really kind of neat\nUh the other thing we have trouble and has a pepper plants I Know that the other gardeners have contacted me about this to where the tips of the plants the leaves start to ... and everything kind of\nUm get snarled looking at the top and the plant just doesn't grow very well that is due to an era fight might and you spell that E. R. I. O. P. H. Y. I. D.\nEra fide might so if you're peppers are not looking good they're not growing the leaves are getting all cream cold then it's an era five might that's a problem and owned peppers and they get on on her plans to I mean you'll see him some time on crate Myrtle Z\nAnd a a an are playing so uh if you had them what I use insecticide also you need something or Nemo will do it also you need a might decide these might are so small I I think there is somewhere around one one hundred and twenty fifth of an inch in size very small\nSo era five nights on peppers are those in the main problems in in the garden as we're there if I might start and insecticide of soap or Nemo should be able to help you out there without any problems\nOkay uh let's answer a ... um [noise]\nHey text messages here if you want to Texas to three six Saito says myself in the mountains wiped out by those caterpillars lead by those black butterflies totally killed them or how can prevent this next year\nYou know it it it's interesting that you have to decide whether you want the butterflies or ... whatever one may be doing this or they have ... own mind also and you you have a couple of options you can go through and pick them off by hand or you can use a product such as their aside\nOr which is the bt product bacillus ... or you can use a product containing spin hosted\nUm so anyway if you have that type of problem there are a snow on an island with those caterpillars that people don't know snowing them out and that has a very colorful ... leaves on it so\nI'm a ... and you know pink and white in green but if you had those problems and you don't want the caterpillars feed known them then you use the third side and spin dosage or spend those one or the other\nA couple of ... I was thinking no less Well hi ms coming up during our number two\nAnd he's gonna be talking about we control\nAnd what am I thought was thoughts was that the weeds change out at this time of the year will start to see new types of weeds come in and some of them are edible and the journey and I've always said that if you eat the weeds in your landscape you won't have many more and [laughter] and all of them are probably tasty\nBut one that will be coming up pretty soon we'll be chickweed is a little very green color a leaf we with little white flowers on it\nAnd it's actually a carnation relative because the flowers or paint a the ... what looked like individual pedals are actually one paddle with two portions to it and they have a lot of those little pedals with two porches but anyway\nChickweed is totally edible and ah from Peggy lenses book here which tells you is you can cook it\nI I I did not get a chance to eat chickweed when I took living off the land\nA and that was a good while ago with Tony ... and a ... he brought in all different kinds of things for us to eat but he had this uh he had this cooked up or the leaves are very tender I'm Peggy land says that a little solve some butter bacon bits er vinegar\nAnd and you can enjoy that where you can just add to your salads is a possibility\nI actually had a friend of mine called me up when times do you have any chickweed and she wanted so she could get the seeds from it so she could start growing it so Chiquita will be coming up it's a cool season annual type flower dies out in the springtime\nAnd the other one that's out there is Florida bet name that will be coming up in Florida bet they are often called the wild radish because when you dig down into the\nLeaves I mean to the ground or the leaves are Longate kind of scalloped when you dig down into ground you'll find these white of a kind of grub looking things actually a they call them radishes I guess that's a better way to put it\nUp but here's what you do what my tree wash 'em off real good I've eaten this one here if you don't wash 'em off very good you get the sand in them and you've got to go through and are you clean the saying out of your teeth I guess you clean your teeth at the same time and you're eating them but they haven't radish labor to them so they're sort of kind of neat they're white and color\nThe plane has to grow a little while uh for the new radishes the form and they would be the better and sweeter ones or to get so far Tibet knee a chick we two of the wild animals just what we talk about that just a little bit there okay let's go to a bill in Georgetown bill good morning to yeah\nGood morning sir yeah boy I Love that for ... it has a real nice flavor to it but like you say if you try to try to grow a cat I mean it's just they disappear on you\nBut I Know you just have to find them are kind of let them grow as a weed and your landscape or a wild flower however you want to call it but but it has a nice little taste is a Chris taste to it it\nDoes I actually prefer radishes because it doesn't have a bitter flavor\nTo it yeah that's what some say and and uh you can cook I'm also but eating them fresh and Chris is fine\nBut I don't know how you find them in quantity I mean if you do at one time that you're not going to because if you try to bring them home grown your care\nYeah it's a it's a tough one and it has its own little environment likes to grow and it's amazing how it when you don't want to know you don't like 'em it's going to grow in your yard\nExactly at a a another flower that ah that I like that that would love to have grown is Lee actress for the blazing star ... out of that growing oil fields and stuff\nAround here but I bring it home and if they have like you say it has its own particular environment and you can't grow it\nThat's the way it is with lots of wildflowers ... I'll be honest with you and then now you're rightly addresses one of them are so but it's it's pretty it's attractive where does grow\nUm whatever happened to bark Tobar fest I miss it\nYou know I have not heard anything about that and and the last year I think they did have something but uh they had not contacted me about it so I have no idea\nFar I missed the plant failing at all and I'm just going down and seeing the gardens that was it was a nice day and I thought it was very successful and I thought it would be continuing\nYeah well you know they've been doing a lot of construction revamping and that might have been part of the problem is though it is an ongoing project for for a couple of years so I don't know maybe somebody from black power and give us a call and tell us and let us know\nAnd one other no I'm the guy had a bird that come back in the in the autumn and a cat birds have come back for the winter\nOh really okay so it can be spending time in your house\nOh yeah oh yeah and in my garden apart not careful [laughter]\nThere you go hey we got to ride okay ... okay you have a great gardening day protect those update their from him also\nA great we'll get to you and just a little bit here and when we come back we're going to take a break but if you want to give us a call you certainly can one triple a forty five laws one eighty four or five five six seven you want to Texas to three ... you know Johnny comes up to come in as far as talking entertainment networks\nA pretty common problem in our area is black and green stuff on outdoor surfaces described it off and it comes right back you need something that will keep it clean wouldn't forget it keeps surfaces clean for a year or more\nTo spray it on and leave it may cleaning easier pick up a bottle of weight and forget today at Wal Mart case do best or visit wetting forget dot com to find a store and they were you\nWill even save your money with cheap rental deals in hotels rental cars even come\nPackages so don't put your tickets and kill you cause first for the absolute chief is prices on us and international airline tickets in hotel\nCold right now for prices solo they can't be published travel experts are here twenty four seven to\nEight hundred Seventy five for\nSeventy five for four or five three one\nThat's eight hundred Seventy five for forty five thirty one\nHere's a special message for those who owe the IRS at least ten thousand or more in back taxes\nThe IRS has special programs in place that could eliminate or reduce your tax dead by thousands of dollars called a federal tax management help line that has been set up for you eight hundred and two six seven Thirteen forty four stop the wage garnishment celebrities and tax liens now\nOnce you've qualified and enroll the IRS will stop all the collection activities against you these unique programs have been allocated to help the economy and significantly reduce or eliminate your tax burden the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements and other favorable programs\nYou may qualify for substantial savings so get the help you need if you owe more than ten thousand in taxes call\nFor free information and to see if you qualify take down the number now for the federal tax management hotline eight hundred and two six seven Thirteen forty four that's eight hundred two six seven Thirteen forty four eight hundred and two six seven Thirteen forty four\nVisit us on the world Wide Web W.

weed in my book and the you know it is it can be a very heavily are spreading throughout the various areas of landscape specially guns filtered son type areas\nAnd but as bill said you're bringing home he tried to grow it can ah so that's the case with a lot of these wild flower type plants\nA matter of text message here or they didn't leave their address or anything so I had no idea where they are so don't write me for that one uh but uh see I have unusually heavy fruit\nCrop on my mature naval citrus trees of course a lot of orange or yellow in early and dropping this time they're going to drop if they're going to do it and the other thing is if the tree has greening you know we all know about greening we\nHeard that much about it lately I guess maybe we haven't made any new finder discoveries or whatever or my guess is some resistance varieties will be coming shortly or what are some time to save the industry I don't know but anyway uh if the tree has greening\nEarly fruit drop is part of the symptoms of the disease\nBut otherwise naval are known for dropping or fruit so if the if the fritter dropping just make sure you keep the moisture if we go through a little dry time we we went through a whole week without adequate moisture\nProbably for a lot of these I Know uh the flowers up front the water had been turned off in our community there scribbling the lawn up ...\nOr so make sure that your ... of a fruit trees have adequate moisture which means ordering once or twice a week\nBut ... will do this it's an old trick or the labels that they will go ahead and start dropping some of their fruit\nI thought the I go through and I could do a couple of things but let me do this year a new one yeah let me give you some of the things that we can plan at this time of year I don't often do that or have time to go through the list but if you're interested in vegetables for instance\nNow is the time we're in October ... temperatures are moderating a little bit like Brian said they're\nThey're they're cool down a little bit Seventy one in our house this morning I'm sure as you go further up the state probably even gotten cooler uh but anyway uh some of the crops

other time the cool season is a time for your great vegetable crops\nYeah tomatoes and peppers or be finishing up a but if you got them in when we asked you to do or starting in mid August going through a early September and you'll be getting a crop of those at the same time you'll be harvesting some of the cool season crops that you could have both\nOkay how about the flowers at this time a lots of flowers can be grown I'm angel owner you can still be put in ... you can start with\nA black eyed Susan's a ... a lot of people don't know ... which is the uh a pot marigolds are the reason

think as I talk home residents commercial companies recently we were one of the major problems this year we started the rainy season early to\nNormal and the rain just continued on recently had the rain subsided were about three inches would be fine for the year already\nHas you know it only takes one storm or tropical front to come through and that all could change we could be a it'll schedule as far as rainfall and the weeds will still continue to grow so at this time we could use a little ring it was all for will still have the weeds and now it's time to care for our lawns and in general get out\nOr get our landscapes back in shape some weeds will die out on their own did you know that some do\nAt this time of year ones like double leading basket grass die back for the winter but they'll be back in the spring but I live on we could add some new ones are like we mentioned or in our number one chickweed in Florida ... me and we also mentioned that they are edible and\nAs bill

I'm guessing they're both rage and ... or maybe the one that is some kind of a vine okay but the ... at ... at that they both get flowers\nOn that one can just like grow right just up in the center of my yard\nAnd and I'm able to lower down whenever I cut the grass okay and ... and and that gets and they get some white flour on with with yellow and the center and I don't know whether that strike some kind of form of a daisy\nOr what is that the leaf on that looks like it has three links\nAre most like something like what may be I guess poison ivy might look like [laughter] I don't I don't think at some point\nYou know it's not poison ivy boys that has a very small white flowers yeah oh yeah and it's a leaflets at three so uh so this is just growing in your yard ... is it in a a type of turf at St Augustine\nNo I don't I don't think my yard as say Augustine grass I think it's just I think it's just regular grass fed or just regular while brass at the net just want us to grow\nOkay well here's the hard part with that because different weed killers affect different grasses also\nAnd so you need to have the grass is Dennis ... to find a weed killer probably one of the liquids if it's not St Augustine then probably one of the liquid weed killers and most companies have one or so has one by one day and says one fertile loan\nOr all those have him but it's very important that
