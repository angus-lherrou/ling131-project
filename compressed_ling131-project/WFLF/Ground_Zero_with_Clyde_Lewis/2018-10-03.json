{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "Sixty thousand is your take home so that means you're probably making Seventy five ... okay when you put your twenty five percent tax bracket right\nNow if you were to cash out the Seventeen thousand out of your savings out of your retirement the government is going to charge you a ten percent penalty wash your twenty five percent tax rate\nShow you're going to get kicked in the teeth to the tune of thirty five percent\nSo it's kind of like saying hey Dave I Want to borrow money at thirty five percent interest to pay off my student loan answer would be and I\nKnow\nYou see what I'm saying\nYes they're laid out\nThe good news is you won the argument the bad news is you're both have to read the book again [laughter]\nMy things were the gal rigs were those risks in Fort Lauderdale Florida Rick how're you\nGuys are how are you better than others or what's up\nI'm just calling about a product I have a I bought a while back all the Wii U L\nO [noise] married oh universal life yes\nYes sir Yes sir I'm and I'm not really sure what to do with it I'm not I know I'm not a fan of it but again even when I talk my advisor on the ins and outs of it I used to walk away to choose and not sure what to do with it\nIs that's because of his one of the techniques they used to get people to keep it [laughter] even the dark and feed them little neuro [laughter] oh mushroom process or keep them in the dark for the manure tried to grow mushrooms um [laughter]\nSo ah he ... the deal is this just a cash value life insurance policy\nThere are three types of his whole life universe verbal universal live and just verbal life and a universe alive or verbal universal laws and the variable universal sometimes has a mutual funds to lecture on the inside of it there's years\nAgo yeah okay and so what happens is though of course that you you know you're not a fan of it because you're not seeing good return ...\n[noise] no it's about eight percent returns but all the fees built into it I think that it if not more yeah yeah\nWell in ... you usually if you're in a good mutual fund that's making ten or twelve you'll ... somewhere in the seven range or after fees\nWhich if you to just bought the mutual fund you might have made dinner twelve in your case you're making eight and their fees are getting you down probably in the full range or actually will be my guest usually the ... are going to eat four to five roughly in those things\nAnd so instead of buying a mutual fund directly you're buying it through the stupid policy and they're kicking you in the states for the tournament other four or five percent that's when it comes down to that's problem number one problem number two is the ...\nThe life insurance portion of it is what's called an A R T an annual adjustable term\nAnd uh the cheapest term insurance you can buy term insurance for one year based on your age that year and then it address up every year as you get older okay that's the cheapest term policy by the year for one year\nNot the cheapest way to buy it over ten years or Twenty years okay but you know if you buy just based on your age this year so you're paying in X number of dollars\nSome of it is going to buy the life insurance and some of those going to the investment that we've already ascertain just doing poorly okay no less and less every year is going to the investment more and more is going to the insurance because your insurance costs to increasing every year because they are the have you noticed that as well\n[laughter] I have not\nOkay and uh because ... and so what we have always suggested that I don't sell any of this I don't give a crap but here's the map on it I have found that a Fifteen to twenty year level term policy locks in and give you less expensive term insurance\nAnd when you invest the money directly into the mutual fund you don't have the extra fees and you get a better net of fees return\nThat make sense it does plus when you die with the Wii U L they're going to pay the face and keep your investment that's the worst part of it\nSo it's a horrible playing when you die [noise] but uh it's just really bad while you're alive then it gets really worse when you show what I Would suggest you do is get the proper amount of term insurance in place and then drop this garbage and do your investing somewhere else does that make sense\nIt does I think the reason I haven't done that yet because of the surrender charges\nWell you're you've already bought that I mean you're just did that just got ripped and this also means you're probably need a new financial advisor\n'cause I think I think you have a life insurance salesman this calling himself a financial advisor\nIt's certainly possible [laughter]\nSo it sounds like it doesn't sound like most of the people in the mutual fund world don't solve this crap neutral funds and some of them sell term insurance too but most of them don't solve this crap because nobody believes in this garbage except the life insurance people\nNobody anymore nobody there's no one in the financial arena in the financial spaces that says buy whole live life insurance or by the cash value insurance on any kind of there isn't one out there\nThey're they're just the cause of math is just so horrible and you figured that part out but this guy's doing smoke and mirrors and hadn't the pea under shell and keeping you confused as to teaching you\n'cause he knows if you've ever understood at that you drop it and him to probably so I'm thinking you need a new advisor and you need to get some term insurance in place you needed to drop this garbage that's what I Would do\nThanks for the call rather open

I said to him I said you know you look at what they you know the project for new American Century look at what they wrote about in the new Pearl Harbor idea that they produce the demand you are the signatories on the on the document\nAnd said you look at the uh ... you look at what they've written about new Pearl Harbor and then they then they said that there was going to be or there can be a even a biological attack since we're a biological attack\nThat could happen and ah it would certainly uh make differences in political movements that would change the way politics would run and of course on in nine eleven you know during the nine eleven attacks after nine eleven attacks in fact I Believe it was um\nJust a few weeks or a week afterwards and then everything you know started happening and it wasn't until about like October fourth I Believe of ah\nOf two thousand one where we started to see that many people were dying from exposure to anthrax\nAnd so I'm Jones said to me you know when I was on the air with him I said uh what do you think the final blow events going to be and I says I said to him I said well I you know I kind of hesitated bit\nBecause I was afraid to commit to something because you know you commit to something like if you if you're a born again preaching and say the world's going to and\nLike if it's going to end at the end of the ... you know damn good well it's not going to end right because just saying it makes it not happen um so I told him I said I'll tell you it's a biological attack from the United states\nAnd uh I said\nYou know things are just kind of bizarre right now I talked about the ... to exercise and I talked about the the er the pandemic and they told them about how they're all being ... they're all preparing we have all these uh\nYou know tabletop exercises about biological pandemic advanced biological attacks and um\nYou know the idea of a biological attack or some sort of biological chemical weapon being use I you know we speculated on many different ways of this would happen will be carried out whether it would be through an arrow slice attack or you know made him skied owes it'd be released I I was very surprised though\nI'm\nWas very surprised and and I and I and I wasn't I guess because I I wondered when it was going to happen I didn't think it would happen today but I read today that the Pentagon reporter that envelopes containing the biological poison and rice and\nArrived at the Pentagon I'm the opposite president Senator Ted Cruz is office\nSo I'm a ... the biological attack or happen today um\nBiological poison rice in uh taken from caster beans I remember when you know back in the day we made you drink castor oil in order to purge crap in your body well there's a reason why is because Castro beans can be made into poison\nAnd um it's a it's it's rice and\nAnd it was reported a of the two packages containing rights than were intercepted on the way the Pentagon\nAnd he was confirmed\nBy the department of defense officials that the parcels were there they indicated that the um the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flag mail delivery building which is located next door to the defense department's massive headquarters in Washington DC\nAnd you know I'm\nThe FBI now is involved with this and they they're actually been called in to\nLead the investigation into the packages which are addressed the secretary of defense James Mattis Angie of naval operations admiral John Richardson and of course there was a letter sent to the president um here's the FBI statement they said uh this is the FBI or the statement they they issued\nOn Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen in coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents to possession of too suspicious armed groups that have been screened at the Pentagon mail facility those on the lips are currently undergoing further testing is this is ongoing we will have no further comment\n\nSo as the Washington DC area work to determine the origin of the rights to attack\nNews also broke out the two individuals have been hospitalized after being exposed to a powdery substance in the mail send to the Texas set to Texas it was a\nActually a ... it wasn't in Texas it was um [noise] it ... maybe I'm trying to figure out it was his office said Cruz's office where it happened yes there was in Houston, Texas Houston, Texas they sent a Senator Ted Cruz is off as a a rice you as well\nOr two people were hospitalized or we don't know um how they're doing a cruise office said they received a piece of mail\nAddress the Senator Cruz\nThis morning when the male is open it contained the white powdery substance the ninth floor of the Phoenix tower was evacuated after the packages found the Pentagon also reported that rice and was attacked that in the mail and of course the writes them since President Trump so um\nYou know so as we predicted um this has happened\nMuch like what happened I mean if you remember half a dozen leather letters um\nContaining anthrax spores were mailed to journalists and politicians beginning one week after the nine eleven attacks for leaders with spores and threaten messages eventual recovered all were post smart from Trenton New Jersey which meant that they had been process of the postal distribution center in uh actually near Hamilton\nTo it as opposed to mark September Eighteenth one address the Tom Brokaw NBC TV\nAnd another was sent to the editor of the New York post the other two letters for stamp October ninth an address to senators Thomas natural and Patrick Leahy so as people became infected in September October and November\nLocal responses revealed gaps in preparedness for biological attack for example the first confirmation of anthrax case was on October fourth\nIn more than two weeks after the initial letters were mailed so I mean we look at the retrospective assessments of all this and um\n\nWe we learned that nine people that were exposed to um the rice in\n... about the rising and sorry the anthrax that already contract is that the fear their illness previously had been missed identified because faulty diagnosis erroneous laboratory tests but in the end the final result at the end or in the end twenty two people had become infected\nFive of them died meanwhile they were buildings that were\nBelatedly found to be contaminated with anthrax spores and they'd leave from the letters or at least thirty thousand people who are deemed at risk required prophylactic antibiotics like skip rope and millions more fearful and many of them anxious about opening their own mail after that\nNow\nA lot of this information then I'm telling you right now about the anthrax attacks\nI'm sure many people have forgotten\nAnd there's a lot of stuff that after doing research I found out that I did not know about I I did not know there were plenty of other buildings that were leaking some of his uh some of his uh you know biological a powder and uh the anthrax spores I had no idea\nAnd so mysterious\nRice to attack I Believe I'm you know warrants a lot of questions one is is this would this be considered the first assassination attempt on the president\nThe first known assassination attempt on the president [noise]\nAnd um [noise] when you look at all and we'll be back

I'll say something and immediately\nGlide Lewis says he's so full of crap you know I I you know sure you know you can make\nPrognostications in prophecies and you can predict stuff in the weatherman does it every day but no one says he's a liar you know and ... and every messes up no one says he's a liar well it's like what I Do is kind of like being a weatherman\nI feel around in a in a look around and I see what the atmosphere is I'm Wondering what's going on and\nAnd uh so I I make my determination so Jones a PIN me and he said hey so tell me what this final blows give me what do you think it is that I said it's going to be a biological attack on the United states\nMeals I agree I agree he's has um and uh I think I'm going on his show again soon probably this will be a good follow up for that you know when you're talking about this\nUh\nBut yeah I told him that I felt it would be a biological attack on the United states and speculate on many different occasions\nThat this will be carried out because I started off talking about ... acts in may I talked about the the tabletop exercise of a pandemic\nSo they're they're preparing for some biological attack some\nContamination some toxic release um I talked to her again and function exercise is something that most people don't know about it and bring it to the forefront of talked about how sometimes in order to do a test run they they take a lesson Marilyn form of something and they released into the public\nIs test to see you know how people react to it sometimes they provide them with a antidote sometimes they see how many people jacket off spittle how many people stay home how many people bring it to work that you know it's just the way for\nA the CDC and others to to to monitor the moving to diseases and some people do support this and a lot of people say it's not good to do this but they do it anyway\nUm\nApparently this new t._v. show about doctors called New Amsterdam\nOr apparently that was a ... that's a show that's on TV Now and somebody had said that it deals with a guy who ah gets Bola Andy brings it to the United states on a plane\nAnd of course we talked about the arrow played we talked about you know the situation that happened\nUh with the uh Emirates plane before other planes where uh you know there was a different diseases monkey pox and uh gosh all kinds of things are happening and uh it's all happening once and they said this is a is a gain of these again and force exercise\nAnd uh I said you know something is going to happen where are the real things going to go down and when it does you know we all know that this the beginning this is the beginning of the final blow them\nAnd so I actually well and it could have been ... through the camp trails that could be you know given through mosquitoes and so today I read that the Pentagon report that envelope containing biological poison rice and arrived at the Pentagon\nOr the office of the president and senator Senator Ted Cruz's\nCampaign office so two packages containing rice in\nOr is intercepted by on the way to the Pentagon and the existence of the suspected packages was had been confirmed by the department of defense officials who indicated the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flagged in the mail delivery building on Monday\nBut in and out and so they were here until Tuesday that was located next door to the defense department and right there is at its headquarters the FBI has been called in now\nTo lead the investigation into the packages which we're addressing the secretary of defense James ... there was an address to James mad as\nChief of naval operations admiral John Richardson and the president Ted Cruz's office the FBI released this statement this is a statement\nFrom the FBI on Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen and coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents to possession of too suspicious and below ups that had been screened at the Pentagon mail facility is envelopes are currently undergoing further testing and this is ongoing will have no further\nComment on this show\nAs Washington DC has been working to figure out of this you know this was any threat to the president Ted Cruz's office said they received a piece of mail there was address the Senator Cruz happened this morning when the male is open and contain white powder\nAnd so the night for the Phoenix tower was evacuated after packages found Pentagon also reports that rice and was detected and that uh and and so we're having a full on biological attack biological a poison\nRice and and this reminded me if you remember when I was talking about the project for the new American Century I said something to the fact that ah one of the other ways that they can change\nThe direction of anything politically is to use biological warfare and even biological warfare that has a certain abilities to mark\nA you know biological markers that would actually activate this stuff and and and rice and acts upon your DNA if ingested or if it's injected if you inhale it and so you can survive a inhaling a rice and it's just that you can die\nIf you're not taking care of\nSo uh it's just some uh pretty scary stuff going on right now and so you know timing is everything and uh I think that uh once again we're seeing history repeating itself because remember back in Nineteen eighty four\nThe Russian each call here in Oregon tried to poison the group of people to try and change the vote\nA in Dallas, Oregon and ah I think here we're seeing a somebody trying to either stop the investigation into cabinet or to believe that the investigation into Kavanaugh or what they're doing is they're trying to find a way\nTo um distract us from it\nAh there's there's a number of things you know especially going down during this time that that I think is volatile time in this country and ah I said the other night on the ground zero lounge they probably will have this investigation wrapped up\nBy Wednesday they'll hand down their decision in the American people probably won't hear what the decision is and they don't have to the FBI doesn't have to reveal anything about their investigation they could put it to a vote and cabinet can be confirmed and I think it would trigger a lot of anger\nWith a lot of people in this country if Kavanaugh actually becomes chief justice\nAnd so tomorrow it to Eighteen eastern time they're gonna be doing that test and emergency test on your telephone\nSo as I said timing is everything just as peculiar and uh I think we should have a discussion about this because I think that uh you\nKnow as we were predicting it I predict it on our Jonah show I talked about it at great length on this program for a good long time and people who is this program\nLived on this people who let's this program know that if I'm On to something and I see the patterns these things go down and when they go down it's not necessarily to the exact numbers I remember when we talked about the pope stepping down when Ratzinger step down\nAnd we said oh you know he would probably lead retired die within three months he left the ... he left the papacy and one of my friends has really blown away by this but it was because we can see you know the talk we heard that we heard the Marines and rumors coming up from ...\nHome and there are several other times it instances where we have a pretty much reported ... be prepared for the students happen or not always right Baugher damn close believe it or not for damn close and so we're obviously seeing the beginnings of what would be the final blow if this gets out of hand\nSaid be prepared because if it were goes down tomorrow about cabinet off some people aren't pleased we can see some more civil unrest in some of the major cities across the country [noise] so we have to prepare for that not that it will happen\nOf repair if it does happen

those are invested in is we need to be careful because you know anything can happen at this point\nIn with rice and being a delivered to you know the Pentagon some addressed to the president I don't understand why\nThis is not being investigated and and uh people aren't wondering if this was an attempt to assassinate the president\nOr in a in a more broader sense a decapitation exercise because if they could send to all of the uh the people involved with the cabinet for case you know packages of rice in ... they could have killed at every single one of them are made them picking up or too sick to vote and they said before\nA this is something that the ... called did back in Nineteen eighty four and this would be considered probably the second a biological attack a that would be a a

cause I'm I Do I like how you a ... you always see these patterns\nAnd it is interesting we're right before that that called the more that that takes tomorrow [noise]\nUm the the thing I keep thinking is is a couple of things is you know is it possible that is that anything is possible but is it possible that this could also be a distraction or I use that word by word but\nCould it be that actually the right side the right wing so to speak\nYeah could be putting this on as a distraction or whatever I'm too you know get some sympathy or whatever and then the other thing would be is um it's kind of interesting that they're targeting a course Donald Trump you know he's the head of the right\nAnd then you have Ted Cruz which if you cruise Facebook\nYou know everybody seems to have Ted Cruz even though he's not really in the squalid anymore\nAnd the other interesting thing is is that Ted Cruz at one point wasn't he kind of a a guy that would have been considered to be a good a Supreme Court nominee so\nWell I don't know forgetting to bench a secretary of defense James Mattis was targeting also chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson was it was also targeted\nRight sure yeah I don't I don't know where their political affiliations wide but\nBut see that's the thing is that if this was I mean obviously this is politically motivated\nOr we don't know do that for what reason it was politically motivated I Would say it was to thwart the investigation and the book the confirmation vote\nI think that it would give them a reason and we're going to stop this right now and we're going to investigate who was involved with sending the rice and but it's not going to stop the FBI the FBI is already made the decision and and I know they've already made the decision because um you know uh actually we were to ground zero allows discussing this and somebody said to me they said well\nThey're going wrap this up by Wednesday they don't have to wait till friday they said well ...

House so they were sent I'm sure there was sent yesterday or the official announcement income today because they were wanting to inspect\nAll the mail to find out of rice and was involved and made the announcement the rice and was in the package is one of the of course\nSend to the president United States but what I find interesting is no reporting of this on other major networks none in fact that they're focusing again on the ah there was again a cabin on board\nIn fact right now they're talking about the protesters I just talked about confronting\nOf course the Mitch McConnell and others of course giving him the basis I mean like they do with the quake without getting into faces of the senators and basically blaming them and saying that the Republican Party is the party of rapists and and this is this is amazingly out of line in my opinion\nYeah it totally out of line\nSo I mean who knows who knows who's responsible for these rice it and who knows what the motive is but it just all sounds like it like I said the Nineteen eighty four tempted thwarting a boat\nOr changes fish it on a boat by the Russian each called in Oregon in Nineteen eighty four it's the same ammo it's the same purpose to somehow stall or otherwise uh for the efforts of either the FBI investigation or the voting for senator cabinet\nYeah\nSo yeah the timing of everything and I like I said there would be a biological attack there has been now we have this cat's do we have to deal with with the phones tomorrow to Eighteen eastern time I'd be happy to see if there's any other timing that goes with that too because that would be that would be even more interesting if I went down\nSo that they will change and that was like well the changes that the state of the last you're\nRight that's another thing

to fill in fact the hype fill up your own ground zero\nGlad high up I think it had a memory\nOut the story that they're still going on in in the summer of two thousand one right before nine eleven\nAnd a matter of fact that morning at nine eleven before the ... tower had hundred reporters than outside a Democrat Senator name that guy ... ... and and the investigation under ... shouted lady\nRemember that yeah I remember that it it after the planes hit the towers\nAnd there was also getting a function they the art but after the towers that story was that was God I didn't hear about it\nOr have you been to say oh I Love you I mean but she she disappeared in May of two thousand one right and uh yeah I mean that was a the hot news item until the towers went down and then that everyone was like about after that you know no more are talking about Gary Condit\nI'm thinking this is comparable with Kevin for\nWell I I yeah I I but Gary wasn't planning on a ... ... being a chief justice [laughter] which one did again we have an extramarital affair story we have\nA a dead woman Chandra Levy a we have an investigation started in may and probably just disappeared off the map after that no one cared about it because of the nine eleven attacks\nAnd you're right you know there's the ... that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad to have a bat but uh\nI Would say that you know they're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many people lost track of what happened was John relieving the Chandra Levy case would Gary Cohn did that is if they were able to look through the ... the nine eleven attacks\nRight okay well I just wanted to put that out there and I'll let you get good\nVery good point though very good comparison history you get your brownie points for being a story about I think it class I loved it and you got to love you too man skilled at TJ in Rhode Island I don't either I\nMight be quick as much as I can be bought you obviously ... what does two plus one plus eight at up to\nTwo plus one plus eight yep eleven\nThat's right and what this two plus there are a plus one plus eight at up to\nUm London\nA trial and when was nine what was what was that date back in September and\nThen I had an eleven when I when I was\nOne plus one add up to\nNine plus one plus one yep twelve\nNine oh one eleven sorry that's right\nAlthough nine eleven had the total eleven twenty Eighteen eleven you have this thing going on at two Eighteen as you said right\nWhich is an eleven eleven yeah and we just had a job or who was murdered in DC not too long ago\nRyan Miller to what was discussed just recently by the previous caller right Kentucky yeah it does have an air quality to it and\nYou might want to get technical when was the ground broken for the Pentagon\nWhat I've what day was that September eleventh\nAll right yeah I'm saying just one thing but I was calling up about the rice said and to to go on Ben and I forgot where the young man was from\nBut when he was speculating on it being possibly from someone on the Republican or or Republicans sympathetic side because if you recall back in terms of predicting programming\nWhat happened to the general in Venezuela where they accused him of staging his little assassination attempt with that drone ... might have tip their hand right they're letting you know in advance what was coming\nWhile I mean you can see that there was something going on with these ah when I called these gain and function exercise I Believe the cameras plane was part of that\nI Believe that when you have a group of people on the on the plane and they all complain of flu like symptoms all at once that's not a flu that something else and it does\nSmack of of rice and poisoning and I'll just to be cleared Nineteen forty one nine eleven September eleven Nineteen forty one was in the Pentagon round was broken for the Pentagon then so I Know nine eleven to be a talked about two\nMen then remember overseas there's a lot of provocative behavior taking place upon the part of the United states where there were already threatening to strike a Russian missile or install installation because of start treaty violations and they're moving a shift to the ass off to see a off\nOf the Ukrainian coastline over there in Crimea right and so I mean there's a lot of powder keg occurring right now within the world\nRight and so there are a lot of distractions but the thing is is that how are these distractions affecting them both how are they affect you invest you know\nThe vote I Will tell you you don't have to I wouldn't even worry about it because I'm already screaming now the court has been de legitimize by Mitch McConnell's machinations and when something comes down that's going to be a dramatic decision that will be the battle cry\nWill be confirmed yeah and when he finally does make a decision for something that will become a fifty fifty unpopularity then it will be pointed out that while you can politicize a court you can't make it political\nHow you feel though if the FBI did not release the information about Kavanaugh in his activities when he was in high school\nOh I Would be I Would be ripping but I've also ripping based on the fact that there's this ... this a speculation on the part of Fox News that they're gonna already be finished by ...\nNow do you have the astronaut elation TJ I'm Sorry to tell you some speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when as far as news that I heard it already from inside or that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressure them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just a value wait a certain times in certain other things he could be guilty as hell and they wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but now Mitch McConnell has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nAs a matter they're getting what they are getting and the American people are going to a prize over it and that's what I really don't\nCause you when you when you start playing with the very last word because it's not right because that's the last word but it's ... it's the last it's ... it's the last word not because it's right but because it is the last word once you start making something from politicized the political that nobody's going to have faith\nAnd or in in the integrity of that institution anymore\nWell I think we've lost faith Eighteen years ago you didn't really I Do I did and I have that's why I'm not political\nWell see that's why I don't understand your problem with people again being harassed you say by it I don't call that harassed but I think\nThat is around look if I if I get on an escalator and a woman says to me oh you turn your back on women is I treat women I look back at her and say no I'm On an escalator I'm getting away from you jumping all over me and yelling at me for something I have no control over\nBut they wouldn't be doing it to you because you're not a person who takes on the position of publicity and demanding attention\nAt it and then even then I had an\nAgreement because I still consider it better than a presidential candidate who says to people beat the cream cheese out of somebody and I'll pay for\nYour legal you know any excuses Trump I don't excuse Trump for what he says in fact he caused whose own problems on his own but when you have people\nThat that basically a sumo things about you in public and yell at him out all over the place I get very angry about in fact I get mad when people assume things about
