distance between people socially it creates civil blowback civil upheaval or anger social ... lack of social cohesion I mean look you just think about\nWhat is happening now\nAnd we're always in the short term thinking when it should be expedient that we think in the long term because pretty soon\nWhere we're going to end up\nWith a lack of strategic caution and with a with a lack of strategic

take guns or or or missiles or aircraft or any other weapon to get the people to move in a direction they wouldn't normally move\n\nAnd so now we have such a fragmented way of thinking about the

from he said she said\n\nAnd so many times we've asked the question why do they hate us well why do we heat ourselves why don't we heat our show so much that we have no knowledge or sense of history\n\nOr even a sense of the future that what happens as far more relevant questions\nAs to what's happening and what we'll be happening\nAnd how complacent some of us a bit and how we don't even think that there are other things going on\n\nBut deserve our attention but we desire a different reality we desire the reality that they're giving us every night on the nightly news\n\nThis is a

people can hide from or skill people could hide from this phenomena are and that's the way to get a all those people who have an ability to make a difference\nJust in case you missed that I'm going to condense it down just so we're clear about what Julian Assange is revealing to everyone this was the last thing he said before now he's disappeared you haven't had any broadcast since listen very closely this is a shorter version of what he said listen\nIn terms of instead of things there's a race that's part of the types now which I assume about being used by our intelligence agencies are very small electronics that are that you can just ... paper or\nPut a painter all on the walls a\n... a ... a powered by the chance haven't stations and they they operate as the jazz some radio waves officer and all that gives them a ... small amount of time to do anything that are going to say that tendency is going to continue that they like the Internet of things and it's a it's like\n[noise]\nAh intelligent evil dust ah scattered everywhere like like confetti everything I think it's increasingly hard things to work out how to deal with that\n[noise] so it's like confetti this uh evil does this uh evil intelligent dusty talking about right that um it's a it's everywhere and I remember we said that wasn't as intelligent evil dust\nAh because of this quote unquote top secret thing we revealed a back last month I mean it was a few weeks ago I Believe a three or four weeks ago\nWe had we talked about this need classified statement\nThat uh you know somehow they were releasing nanoparticles nano robots are and of course Muskie even talked about the ... project with which is another nano technology type of project and\nNano domestic Quayle was with something that we were talking about in the theory in the in the deliverance of the of the notion in the it'd be classified statements\nAnd we said well look barren hurt but hey everybody has them everybody has picked up on them and of course a lot of that said well and everybody knows that this nano particulate is actually connected\nTo more gallons and I'm a Brad Olson called the program who's a writer and he said he has had more gallons or has more gallons he said that everyone can be tested for it and we all have their propensity to develop is because of the nano particles that are in our body\nAnd man I'll tell you people were like going this is nonsense it's a pseudo science this is crazy and now ... he said that he made this he made the statement before\nHe's he's last this was this was his last broadcast that he said before and we don't know what's going on with joined us on right now\nJust today\nWell I don't know if I have time to get right into it but uh it was funny because ah\nToday as I was looking over\nSome of the the reports\nAnd in the in the clip service I I go in every day they check out the clip service don't these reports I have a link some kinds of stuff of the stuff that I use the stuff that I don't use but I always have to see things in a follow up senses I talked about the beginning of the program the blowback of course there's always blow back to some of this stuff but when you talk about in all blows back\nAnd you have to say well look this is this is how it is now\nBefore we were talking about a ... and now it's like this is the real deal people smart cities uh they're they're saying well we have trillions without one trillion sensors that we have to put in place by the you're twenty twenty\nThe FCC saying you got six Ninety Days to start figuring out how we're going to install smart city networks in your part of the woods and you got to do it quick because if you don't we're going to go in and do it for you\n\nSo let's roll control spectrum is giving mandatory by twenty twenty or at least moving into twenty thirty\nRight\nAnd so the FCC say it's got to be done it's got to be done it's got to be done that people are gonna be moving like crazy and of course you're gonna have to pay for this installment of his new matrix of surveillance matrix they want to put in there but how are they gonna move all those sensors\nHow they had him put trillions of sensors in place by twenty twenty that's a lot\nOf ... that's a lot of sensors deporting bike but within two years or even less than two years\nSo how do they how do they fix that problem evil intelligent dust that's the way they do it it's easier to drop trillions\nOf nano particles the size of a grain of sand or a grain of salt and they can do it\nIn that less amount of time I'm sure they're reporting sensors into bigger and and and more capable\nAnd and fiber optic all this stuff that could put that in and yeah the infrastructure is going to change and yeah the matrix of all things are going to change your city of tomorrow weights but while they're still trying to get things settled while they're trying to get the antennas in place for five gee they will dust off\nIf they haven't dusted is already within a protest\n[noise]\nJulie my son [noise] has told us that [noise] we told you there's a lot of freedom until [noise]\nFor those of you that we're
