think like I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cough and then I just either like it goes over and then there's things that I think we're gonna have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just a dorm it\nYou've been doing it a whole two weeks yeah yeah\nWell that you're just takes a little while to get up things that just in the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're\nWrong put more in there but you're always people are always spend more on foods and they think they are I mean people go I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going to hold just no way you know I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more\nReally quick I wanted to ask what should I invested in the financial peace university um I should I get that now are kind of get it after I'm done with my thousand just put everything in their

done other one horn past than this one is definitely the easiest as far as\nThe Harlem the problem is is you're facing your reality it's not the app and it's not the system even it's just the first time you do a budget you suck at it you know and it just takes a month and then the next month to get better really about the third month you're doing it it'll be accurate\nIt'll take about the rhythm of about Ninety Days about three times through it and you'll go oh I'm not forget no soccer picture it in our houses lumbar all day on you know and we know what the food really cost and we know what the utilities really are and\nGot a few things that are fixed that are predictable and you'll rent or your mortgage payment that's fixed thing we know what that is nice but some of these other things you're just you're taking your best guess and and it just takes a little while to get the trial and error I get the course\nOf course corrections done and get adjusted so you'll get it on I'll have to

guys are most Christians however today we're seeing a mix of both religion and witchcraft being practiced openly by women and men and a few hints that perhaps some of the old pagan imagery\nHave not left some of the major churches and\nSo tonight I thought it'd be interesting to explore a some of these teams and and the reason why is because well I mean last night I think kind of a tip a hat to it when we were discussing the ... the and how means in vigils means something in how they're being used\nTo it kind of a ... a form of I guess rich ... kind of form of witchcraft or new form of witchcraft\nA is most certainly a prevalent today\nSo a new book\nThat I have in my possession a fantastic book called sorcery the indication of strange this\nIs written by Thomas shirt and now we've had Thomas shared in on the on the show before he lives in Ireland he's amazing we've had him on the show to comment on all things called openings bizarre and I think it's really a pleasure in ...

able to have you in such a time I mean as I was explaining there seems to be like this shift in attitudes towards I guess you could call it conjuring attitudes towards what would be considered darker magic or some of the darker arts why do you think that this is starting up now why do you think there's a newfound interest in this\n[noise] I think people will be brought these ideas for all kinds\nOf reasons I think you'll have people who will be drawn to choose things like social fears\nThere's a sense of that there's an insecurity within society you see that happening in Brooklyn tomorrow at these these which is like on a blind cabinet is other people will look at things like you know quantum physics and these ideas\nThat reality is malleable to a certain extent and that they won't let you want to test these ideas and they want to say well you know is it you know is the five cents reality is that Malia bill is it\nKind of change it cannot ultra towards my will and still the only effective mechanism out there to do this as things like magic and so people are drawn to us for that reason as well I think also there's a there's a kind of a maturing going off the mall and that its oil is living in the age where\nYou know people that look the especially in recent years we've seen like the behavior of the major religions and the crimes of the Catholic Church and other organizations have been exposed quite readily and people have set themselves at these guys are appalling things and here they are telling us that you know which ... evil so\nIt'd evil really considering the source was coming from and then I I think that's got a lot to do it I think a lot of people have a kind of a hunger now to see if they can test the boundaries of reality using their will\nAnd it's becoming more apparent that they can uh I was just talking last night with Chris geo injury geo we were talking about this new medium that is on the Internet right now but uh certainly

those who sound like they are repetitive Lee speaking from a script and it's very effective and I was saying to ah Chris last night I said isn't that interesting that this character\nKind of resembles the ... of alchemy and it it seems to be very powerful it's just a simple silk like looking character grand color very simple way drawn but it's supposed to be there is some sort of a a I guess you could call it a top a or some sort of mean that that is spreading and certainly going viral and this is a form of magic\n\nI'd been taken a great interest in this as soon as it came to fruition on the electromagnetic spectrum last weekend I knew this was going to be something special\nThe ... like I I've been watching this whole thing around for ... days the way these people have been using ... for a few years now and we are in a different world there's a basically a a generation of\nInstinctual chaos magicians who are using things like mediums two actually mold reality in terms of the political structure medicine at this and the seeming is ... is quite fascinating and not so much in its was putting out there but the reaction\nTo it it's it's it's tapped into something very visceral and frightening in deep within the people it's been it's been aimed act it's almost like the you know that that the judgment is the mirror and the mirror has been held up to these ... these kind of like a\nCultural ... painters or whether you want to call them and ... they're not happy they're not happy because they wanted to believe they were special and certainly they're realizing that the only thing special about them is that they're probably just like androids\nYeah and that's the thing is that they're saying oh it's dehumanizing it hurts us but you're right it's like putting a mirror up to them and say look at what you're saying is that what you're doing look at what you're acting upon\nAnd it just reminded me when I saw that as a you know a several characters that have just been ...

about earlier was that the pope apparently a was at a Senate and ah he pulled out the staff it was a very familiar staff to those who are pagan do those who are which is a this step is called the staying\nAnd a conservative Catholics were appalled\nCan't use the pope's choices staff as evidence is something scary something diabolical something which she was going on at the Vatican\nAnd so you know while most folks do use\nOr what is called the ... a pastoral staff that uh has across the top um\nThis one was different this one uh looked then is Thomas commented it ah it it it seems to be the staff that represents a the the nail support staff resented the pope had a nail going through it and when you look at the iron nail in staying it symbolizes\nA lot of things uh\nThomas was saying that uh that includes the ballots and that is basically what unites the part in bloom is the triple motif of a threefold serpent team to ... uh and uh we were hearing earlier about this man or the called the first hour saying that his wife\nWas involved with some sort of a a serpent teen or women rising up against against the men or ... were rising up against Adam ... serpent Jean represents a

your eyes shall be open\nAnd you should be as God's doing good and evil so you look at the ... which refers to earthly power who source in symbol is the serpent but it's deep in the earth's when you're talking about Canucks power that comes from Cain and so um\nWe have a Thomas sharing back you know it seems to me that and this was said uh this has been said I Can't remember I heard\nThat when Donald Trump was elected president\nAnd Hillary Clinton was not elected president United States this basically jarred or at least a peak the rage of\nThe feminine power and so the feminine power had to regain a a place and so now they're fighting for that power again is this why you think or is this could be why a witchcraft now is is being a actually is having a renaissance\n\nThomas that's a good point I never thought about that one and you hear me okay I can hear you fine thank you yeah go ahead can you hear me uh-huh yeah yeah I never yeah that's an interesting point I never thought about that the thing is that this witchcraft\nThat we're seeing like in Brooklyn tomorrow so on it's not it doesn't come from a healthy place it doesn't come from\nA desire to restore feminine feminine power it doesn't recall from that it was the same way that Hillary Clinton wasn't particularly female press the A R in terms of how she operated herself thing\nI I was there showing up got

term the other day a a a Thomas it was called security theater\nAnd what that term means is that really you know we have to put trust in one another because the reality is is that our lives are fragile that we have fragile lived with Jodie of lived majority of the system collapsing all these things are are a possible their ...\nAnd the truth is is that everybody or gives us a sense of security and they create the security theater by you know having child proof tops TSA the airports that sort of thing\nI think the church especially the Catholic Church now I think they provide this provided with a little spiritual security theater thinking that everything is in control\nBut then we have a pope who steps into the sitting odd holding is staying\nTrying to tell people about uh how he's going to eliminate the pedophilia eliminate the robbing a virtue it's almost as if\nThe vampires now are not afraid of the sunlight nor the afraid of the crop they'll just walk right into the

much if they're not they're not black magic that pretty much close to it conducted by members of the Catholic Church and often I'm just wondering if this with this whole thing with the dying it's some kind of like it it\nDoes is it a symbolic of a nervous breakdown within the Vatican but they're they're losing control you know I have to do that or Eighteen hundred years or whatever\nAnd I I don't I
