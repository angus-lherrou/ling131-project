Iowa radiolab just open the Fox\nNews weather in traffic for the smartest audience and talk radio news radio Ninety three point one [noise]\nMaybe the [laughter] [laughter] [noise]\nAre you working hard to become a vilified one for senator so is your host and here's Carl now okay\nAh already had a flashback to ... we would play the Beatles [laughter]\nBack in the USSR All right let me I don't mean\nJust a real quickly a little further into a ... a it's Latin meaning out of many one we've already spoken about that when it was first adopted a it was an American model they talked about the Thirteen colonies are and I'm\nAt Thirteen American Colonies or a colonies I'm Sorry becoming one nation but over time we think of it a little differently today of course most Americans are things uh think of the modern I mean one people for many backgrounds and that's the case you know when I was growing up in California\n... let\nLet me just say the difference between California and Florida is absolutely stark\nAh and and it may be a little different now and maybe a little different now but I'm just I'm ... I I think Florida is better representation of the melting pot and then it's exactly why so allow me to segue a little bit into Gillum it's exactly why I don't want them to get in a he plays he played the race card so much in\nThat last debate it wasn't representative of the United states in my opinion a a correct picture and are an accurate depiction but it definitely wasn't representative of Florida one of the things that I appreciate it when I came out um to Florida it really did exemplify in my opinion\nA blurb assume from many one um in in California and believe it or not as diverse as it may be that day I don't even know I don't even think that's necessarily the case growing up there California was very segregated believe it or not\nMore uh people kind of stick to themselves\nOr you you come to Florida or or you go to California there are wide areas there are black areas there are a Latino areas and I'm not saying that doesn't exist in Florida obviously a there's pockets of that here but also what you fine art in areas in neighborhoods where you can see\nA Puerto Ricans Cubans blacks whites all within one community that is that\nThat's pretty impressive you you you\nIf you've not grown up anywhere else or like I have Florida has a good down when it came out here there were some things were there some racist things and blah blah yeah sure sure there were\nBoth for the most part the pluribus unum own them was it was prevalent and uh and visible to me when I came out to Florida I was shocked to see how many interracial relationships\nOr that that ... that I saw out here you didn't see that a lot in Florida I Believe it or not I mean in California and believe it or not\nIt it it so so we\nWhat Andrew Gillum was doing he I I just feel like he\nWant to take us back to another time he's not a good representative you wouldn't be a good leader for Florida because he doesn't even recognize were lord it is as far as race relations are\nConcerned I see we have a caller on the line and short period of time so let's know dropped off okay All right so uh so it's one of the reasons why we\nWe should go back I mean he wants to divide us what I saw him in those debate were ... it was the vision was class warfare you know the rich against the poor or it was the blacks against the white every every opportunity he got\nIt was so in the last debate I\nI couldn't even take it was a continuation of the Obama era\nIt was worse I honestly I thought it was worse I had never seen and it was a contentious debate so I'm not saying Rhonda Santas was perfect but what I'm saying is\nIf you're going to run to ... uh he's um box now on Hannity are but what I Am saying is every opportunity descent I mean a Gillum get he spoke about race\nAnd the way he can get the base to vote for him\nHe has to make you angry it's what the left us they have to make you angry you have to be an emotional in order to win a two women vote 'em\nBut e pluribus unum from many one that is what Florida represents a bunch of different cultures or a bunch of different races and ethnicities but we are\nWhat America is supposed to represent and should represent and that's a melting pot is Andrew Gillum gets in he wants to divide and conquer and he wants to blacks against white you will not be able to criticize this guy without being called a racist don't do it\nUh absolutely don't vote a for a for this guy\nUm again liberty is the second thing equality ... liberty we discuss that the third thing is in a is in God we uh trust is in God we trust\nUnlike a recording from a article I'm like almost every other country America never had a state religion but it was found the bounded on the principles are on the principle that God's specifically the God of the Bible is the source of moral values that goes back to um the beginning of the show\nWhen I talked about this a squirrel hills synagogue murderer um\nWe're losing God in this culture we can't we have\nTo have a source of morality otherwise anyone and everyone morality will stand\nThis guy needs to know what he did was wrong how did you teach people how do people how do people connect with right and wrong good and evil you teach them about the God of the Bible like I said going back to that sent a guy who was who was the murderer and who were the victims\nThe victims were the people that were worshipping God\nAnd the murderer was not\nIn other words the victims that were worshipping God would have never done to that man what he did what he did to them because they believed in eternal consequences they believed in the Torah they believed in the ten commandments now shall not murder\n[noise] we get to talk about God again people it is what is missing from our culture and I love this

more hard core beliefs of the drew it was the threshold or the threefold best in what version of the three fold death an individual has three simultaneous causes of death for example wounding hanging or drowning\nHe's causes of death or usually a punishment predicted in advance and naturally there's only a few recorded instances of them\nGiven how unlikely a triple death happens in life oh the cross and the serpent were secret to the true it's so they made the former by cutting off all the branches of an oak tree\nThey fashioned one of them to the main trunk in the form of the letter T\nSo it was a staff with across to the top illiterate tea and then on that oh can cross they would put a snake and so this open across cut to the tea\nWith the snake represented the healing deity the vibe or okay\nAnd many of you know if you read anything in the Bible [noise] you're right about the fiery ... in the Bible\nAnd how Moses did the same you took what looked like a tea took it from a branch made it into a team put the snake on it and today we have a similar\nType of symbol called the producers which you see that all the time in doctors' offices are on ambulances that could use this as the snake coiled around the the tea or called around what appears to be across with\nWings a mercurial healing wand we could call it and it represented the\nIt represented the sorcery of healing one's body shrew corps what is known as course medicine and 'course when as soon as basically taking the dead and using them for the living or using the living the blood putting it into the body making the body whole so either you would\nSee the doctor and he would give you a good bleeding where they would either put slugs on your body or they drain you of all the bad blood and then try to replace it with a good place and some people would have to be sacrificed in order to have that good blood and usually it was the elite there would drink the blood or eat at the heart or or any of those types of sacrifices that were known in the times and the drew even before that\nSo it's okay to cross with the snake coiled around it\nWas the healing simple you on that same symbol is the dollar symbol have you ever noticed that the dollar symbol is an ass\nWith a line through it but what are you originally was was a snake winding around a poll and that's how you got the symbol for money another\nHealing symbol because money they say he was a lot of hills but certainly it's the root of all evil and some say that that old staffer that could do this is the evil Mary making of doctors using the blood and the organs and all sorts of things for their own little rituals so you've gotten across and the serpent sacred to the ...\n\nCutting the branch putting on the snake and then they worship today and it did it was formed well from the sun mood and the stars combination Jehovah bail and those Cyrus\n\nTravel on was the name of that God do you hold the bail Cyrus the mixture of travel on so that drew it's called the descendants of the serpent because they held the serpent on the staff\nAs what they would hold and they would represent healing and represent the medicine mandated represent those who

you heard really ends right what's that\nYou've heard of the ... were the ones that are ... are are ... you you're meeting with Reba Shay remembering your book you talk to ... and he was with new

ritual they stick by or anything like that\nOr how would they tied up with a ... type two\nYeah what what what was exactly the story with you and rabies Shay\nWell basically what it was a ... back in two thousand is seven I'm\nAlways looking for a new idea for a book and I thought about doing well on on the ... forest UFO landing case in England in Nineteen eighty and the reason why I thought about doing it was you know I mean that in a number of books they read on the subject so ready\nBut there was some interesting threads and late suggesting that it ... like I'm almost like an ... type things sort of testing new technologies on the on the military personnel on the base rather than a rail UFO London\nAnd he turns out that Dr Shay um who is I'm a former Nebraska and [noise] um direct to move on and also appraised so yeah you know it's sort of a unique back right when you get to you and ate backgrounds want us as founding director and the other one is a priest\nAnd I spoke to rise to that is seven and he said yeah you know we kind of a ... inch fear may feel I could buy the reading list and stuff and I thought about doing the book on it\nBut when they get on the phone he said well listen even more interesting story and might be interested in in so intrigued about it and that which we all get really make a better story I said well let's face and he said that\nThe guys in the government to the departments of defense who told him that threaten they'll show the case\nWas basically like a fabrication is holograms and mind altering technologies and whatever [noise] um he said that they were actually part of a program that was trying to or is it was sort of looking into the angle\nOf the UFO phenomena and being demonic rather than ... than they and so basically he told me the story of how he met two representatives\nOf this particular group um and that for a number of decades they think quietly and carefully\nInvestigating the whole issue of the UFO phenomenon and trying to put threats together um to as the ice or at least um to confess I'm the idea that this was demonic they want to say I confess I'm\nThat lives with pretty much made up they would paper open mind if they were absolutely sure that's what rights\nSee I was I was under the impression that were re was saying oh they were saying they were trying to tie the aliens to um uh the demons or the
