the crowd Jackson show I miss closing segment hey\nJust ah just remember to pray for the people that are going to be impacted in northern Florida the panhandle of Florida\nI'm In the west coast yeah you're right the west coast of Florida\nI I mean it seemed like a storm that wasn't going to be much and apparently it's progressed and\nObviously now it's hurricane Michael when do they expect it to make landfall in one Wednesday at one PM expected to make landfall so a man people get get prepared to get out of the way if you can get out of the way get out of the way it's such a\nIf you've never lived through hurricane I'm\nA I'm maybe I'm just a whiny crybaby but it is such a miserable experience going through it in the aftermath originally from California\nWe experience earthquakes and I've been through a several pretty large earthquakes as a matter of fact and those are pretty intimidating because they just happen out of nowhere all of a sudden you start shaking like crazy and\nThings can collapse on you so that's pretty that's pretty scary but I can also tell you just going through hurricane and the misery of being without power and just basic stuff good lord I'm such a wimp I Need to I Need to\nBecome better [laughter] of better a veteran\nSurvivor I'm a I'm a ... per se too I mean\nUh but anyway ... ... ah from what I understand you need at least three days of water and food so\nAh you get if you can get that stuff to do it if you can get out of the way and get out of the way it is just not a pleasant experience whatsoever to have the freight train over your head dumping tons of water or possibly destroying your house apartment or wherever you may be\nA just just not a fun experience so pray for those people are and pray for the people and and the Carolinas I mean as a result of the Kavanaugh hearings uh we've not heard much or anything at all about the people in the Carolinas and they just went through it a\nSpeaks of going in and there was flooding all over the place\nAnd just horrible conditions as well and so just don't forget about them I unfortunately I did and I'm going to be praying for them I'm going to make sure that I stand a money to their proper places to donate in and help those people out so hopefully you'll be able to do the same okay\nSo we had a very interesting conversation Tony participated in it and we had our young gun with much wisdom participate in it earlier or\nOr actually at the end of last week on Saturday\nAnd I just thought it was a very fascinating conversation because in the era of me too man really have to be on their guard and I'm Talking about good men listen I let me say this quickly about the me too movement I think the me too movement has done a lot of and it's also done a lot of harm\nI mean I obviously sexual predators sexual a pervert you want to weed out of the communities look at the predators that it exposed\nIn Hollywood and obviously we want those people are we want those people gone um and and they have been but now\nIt's evolved the me too movement has evolved into a movement against\nGood man we see what the me too movement has done against a cabin are wasn't against you know they made 'em they invented this story with the help of Christine Blasey Ford or the cats law firm Dianne Feinstein in my opinion totally fabricated and invented a story\nTo take down a good decent man and sadly this is one of the things we have to be concerned about uh spoke at a meeting I'm I spoke at a meeting just last week\nAnd or a gentleman that attendant there was saying listen I'm more concerned for my college aged son now\nThan I Am from my high school aged daughter just because anyone can make a a allegations unfounded uncorroborated and just totally be destroyed so man you have to be extremely careful if you're a man it's sad that we have to say this\nMake sure you're around were witnesses or around young men married men single man so on\nBut this me too movement is destroying a lot of people and I really think it's destroying women to a because if you think about it it's creating the very men that the\nLeft claims to\nTo to hate men are going to be so scared to touch women to court women and all this kind of good stuff they're not even going to have to worry about abortions middle be too scared to touch him quite frankly I'm a but the men that are\nAre cozying up to women just to try to do it this idea that\nI look at these men on the ... the less that pretend like ah they're all about this me to it if it's such a joke I feel like these men are cozying up to these women basically a so that uh so that they can be more than a more than friends it'd be quite Frank with you but\nIn the Arab me too man I'm telling you just be careful\nOf [noise]

for her\nAnd if you've been to the Facebook page you see the Janine is there and I tell the story as to why and how we came to this and\nThe general support that has already been pouring in for Janine he's amazing and I'm so thankful and grateful and Janine even since her love and thanks for all of the prayers and all the support\nAnd ah we do have a goal but we're going to try and see if we can surpass that goal because that would give us more incentive to at least get some more things been checked that she can use to get better quickly um in in\nWhat we're doing is we're we're ... we're literally having to plan\nKind of ... kind of been a two month way or how to get around all the things that we need to do financially to get out of the situation we're in we're still of course paying on my\nMedical bills for my cancer still or because of mine was a little more expensive for her is of course we can cover now because of the fact that you know over time you know you're able to beat

and I'm gonna tell you this from my heart is so good\nTo know\nThat your loved in that people support families [noise]\n[noise] so that's why I'm going to say about that and um it does my heart good with all the bad news in the world [laughter] there are a lot of good people out there that was to my program\nA lot of good people they're looking out for my beautiful wife Janine thank you thank you so much Janine says thank you too so I'm going to [laughter] I'm gonna let this go just go to my go fund me page I put out for Janine help us out please I really appreciate that very much\nAnd I show is a is going to be a mind bender for everybody and the reason why it's so fun subject for me\nAh you know one of the weirder aspects of quantum mechanics could be explained by an equally weird idea but I've always talked about and that's retro causality we're talking about causation that runs backwards in time but then it can also run forwards and time Feinstein\nCame up with the idea of spooky action at a distance quantum mechanics he said that's how you can be a radical explain or\nBring about evidence to show that retro causality exists which is the particle equivalent of you getting a stomach ache today things to tomorrow's bad lunch\nAt the idea that you got a stomach ache but there was nothing that you ate the gave me the stomach ache but something that you're about to eat is going to give you the stomach I does that make any sense\nI don't like explaining it that way that's kind of a waste science would explain I like explaining it as for example\nYou're at a bar or somewhere like ... uh like let's say that a guy sitting in a bar and a woman comes up to him and says I Want to marry you and they want to marry you on this date so you set a date when the marriage is going to happen right you set a date for that\nAnd uh and she says but there's one thing you need to do you need to cut your hair you shave your beard and you to get yourself a suit and tie and I want a house okay\nSo you're thinking okay I'm going to marry this woman and this is what I got to do and you don't even know what's gonna happen\nYou just do there is a date set ahead and that that future date is going to be affecting the president and the past okay so they passed after you you know after president goes away and continue using continues so vinyl you do go to the day and you find out that all this stuff you prep for was retro causal\nOkay so you're you're preparing for something that may not happen but it's happening it's it's because the futures influencing president passed in in that way which is you know a simple way of explaining it probably not\nIt's probably too simplistic maybe but that's that's the way I see it as the way it works this is causality you know there's cause and effect but what does it affect happens before the cars and that's something that's hard for science to grass although there is a pair of physicist right now from the ... from a from the United states and Canada that actually\nTook a closer look at some basic assumptions in quantum theory undecided unless we discovered time necessarily rent one way measurements made to a particle could echo back in time as well as forward\nSo we have kind of a shadow or an echo in transit pretty much and we all know quantum mechanics is is weird right we we know that part of that we're just comes down to the fact that at a fundamental level\nParticles don't act like solid billiard balls rolling down the table but rather like a blurry cloud of possibility shifting around the room\nNow Stephen Hawking that told me all about this when I met him\nLong time ago when we were discussing Heisenberg and uncertainty principles and Adams and all kinds of other\nYou know who are particles moving about and we're talking about the blurry cloudy and ... and and the blurry cloud comes into sharp focus will be tried to measure particles meaning that we can only ever see a white ball hitting a black one into a corner pocket but we can never see the countless white ball sitting by balls in every pocket\nOkay we can have we can face forward okay and we see everything in front of us right at our feet but behind as there are so many possibilities going on behind it but we don't even if we take a look back well she what's going on but with our back turned there are so many things are happening that we don't understand\nWhy we can't understand it all at once otherwise our brains would explode\nSo this is all about ... hey this might happen this could happen right so when we're dealing with maybe in ...\nI mean these are these are all part of a of causal progression it's all part of the trends that the ... the transient move whether it's an echo or whether it's cause and effect whether it's a fact before cause whether or not you're going and loops so\nHave you can prevent me just a minute\nMisrepresent these ... these clouds ... represents something very real possibilities on a positive level can be very real see that's why I don't like the idea that you know we're all feeling like we're doomed to some fate\nWhere everything falls apart and collapses I mean for some for some reason in that mindset when there's always hope for something to go better\nWe should always try and focus on that hope that things are going to go better you know what I'm saying so if if if if this represents something real up all the particles are like bouncing around and we don't see the possibility is behind this but we only see what it wants in front of a sometimes with Kevin you see behind beyond our own feet\nSo this is just a convenient representation\nOf what can happen [noise]\nTime goes by time goes back and forth [noise]\nAh [noise] it's beginning we are beginning to see that it's kind of like having a a [noise] kind of like a [noise] a knob where you can push ahead in time go back in time that sort of thing and it's becoming more evident that the future [noise]\nIs changing the pan\nAnd we'll talk more about that coming up on ground zero Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred or\nTriple A.

six seven three thirty seven hundred\nLazy seven three seven\nRetro causality has always been one of my topic\nFavorite of mine because it it it's always kind of weird to think that yes maybe something in the future could influence the\nPast or vice versa and I and I started thinking about that back during the nine eleven days seriously um it was because of the fact when nine eleven happened I just felt like time stopped\nAnd I felt like a ... there were some things that happened during that that that era that reminded me of things in the past and quite possibly were affected by that very moment in time I I and I don't know why my brain went that way\nBut it just happened to go that way for some reason I mean we're in the round the fringe analytics\nI like saying that it's better that conspiracy theory we should start using that right were fringe analysts [laughter] like that idea rather than say you're a conspiracy theorist you're fringe analyst and that means you analyze everything that's fringe including paranormal entire political\nBut uh in the realm of fringe analytics and being a fringe a analyst\nThere's a whole lot of maybe using coincidences\nThat should never be ignored even when they sound outrageous and show when I played that audio just now\nThe broadcast demand on the tape or the man on the radio back in Nineteen forty five he could have made a lucky guess right but I'm a sucker for time travel would prophecy especially when it has that paranormal vibe to it and how would lead you down the roads\nThat take you to what it's called the further beyond see modern conspiracy theory there is a notion of predicted programming\nAnd we talk about this all the time as it seems to be a pervasive way to approximate or otherwise force structure the future in some way\nIt is proposed that to what is called revolution of the methods that were warned or were\nBeing prepared to accept certain ideas means er ideologies we see it in film and TV shows and many things that eventually come to pass\nWhat we see it like for example I don't know about you but if you if you go on the Internet a lot you see The Simpsons predicted a lot of\nThings even even the nine eleven attacks being predicted the election of Donald Trump which I think it's fascinating\nSo\nWhen we see these things happen and we wonder about retro causality we wonder how these people who are in the arts can somehow predict the future or at least give us something to think about in future tense like science fiction I remember I went to the uh a convention one time\nWas a convention and we I was on a panel discussing just what science fiction writers got it right there was this one science fiction writer that I was sitting there so I didn't know who he was he was a local\nScience fiction writer he's a science fiction has never gotten it right and I said I beg to differ man I says you write it you're right science or I read it okay I I read the comics I read the books I see the movies and there are a lot of things\nThat people like Harlan Ellison who just passed away got ride for people like Ray Bradbury or Isaac Asimov got right Philip K Dick amazing right he got a lot of surprise um and and so when you're when you're thinking about this revelation of math but it's a it's a very deep\nFascinating conduit to time travel and to\nThe

I'm really wondering what the problem like\nSomebody he made it look like this person from Nineteen forty five was saying that but it was really made last week\nOkay so how much how much of that thing that he how much of that recording was that guy accurate about\nWell I Know that's\nYou know I'm asking not very much of it was not a ... I mean what he said that uh there'd be a lot of entertainment that wouldn't be owned by a lot of companies that's not true we have we have companies that own a lot of our entertainment there are independent or things that he's half right about he didn't get it all have a lot a lot of that production stuff wasn't All right he didn't get\nIt All right [noise] yeah I play it again and again I Want you to review it again and realize that [noise] Wiley golf when he got some of it right he didn't get all of it right you didn't\nKnow it is not what he said it's a question things the validity of [noise]\nOkay All right well your question but let me of it but I don't understand why it's so important [noise] I mean if if they said it was Nineteen forty five and find them you question the validity of it but it's like this guy really I mean when you think about it\nThat it might not all of it was true then he said I mean he really wants to know what he had to say\nAt the point is they hope is something that looks kind of real and who benefits from it so\nI think it's like who benefits from the hopes mark here longer here and there was nothing fearful in that in that broadcast thing\n... war the world it's\nNo really not [laughter] [noise] I'm going to play it again the next hour I don't know if you've heard the ride broadcast or not I don't know if you were really lifted really scary about it at all or nothing\nNew but I've never called a radio\nShow okay but I'm just trying to figure out who benefits from hosting a radio broadcasts like that\nSo\nThere was an audio file but I played last hour and it was an audio file becomes from apex TV okay a apex TB claims bet this radio file their play you comes from Nineteen forty five\nAnd I played it in some guy called left already says oh it's a hoax and I'm thinking well okay he was a hoax and who benefits from it\nThat's what I Want to know who benefits from a hoax that this is the hope\nIt just sounds like a typical guy on a radio making some predictions is all it is and so I don't know why this guy which is so hung up on the idea of the big thought it was a hoax but what I Want to do is want to play you this broadcast the man who's been recorded off the radio could have made a lucky guess\nBut I'm a sucker for time travel and prophecy especially when it has the paranormal by to it so I'm gonna play this for you again\nAnd ah there's no fear mongering here at all even though the guys do this this is big business the intent is to scare people know this is not to scare people but it's here to make you think listen to what this guy so it's like I said Nineteen forty five it's a radio broadcasts where a guy attempted to\nActually predict the future what would happen in the year twenty forty five here we go\nOn gentleman welcome back in the program today we'll talk about or Rob a serious topic to talk to your show today we're going to make some predictions maybe someday my back on the production I yeah I Do know is Nineteen forty five hundred years from\nNow and I'll be twenty forty five it is kind of commitment and the state of the world and one hundred and yes we have seen before the world has changed drastically and the boss is just one hundred years ago\nAnd the ... the concept of self our trying machine seemed is ridiculous and I and I am about to many that's great and dusty revolution\nHas seen a change than ever before I came to mind as we go over our predictions for the next one hundred yeah why not yet I put it that man was that part of a celestial bodies such as I'm On the planet Mars\nAnd one hundred years I put it that the average man will get his news and entertainment from a variety\nOf sources big companies\nWill no longer have a monopoly on the news and entertainment people enjoy\nI predict that in one hundred years cause one no longer be constrained by the crown and we'll have the ability to fly and the average well and\nThe energy that powers the cost will come from San Juan\nYes the television and says he'll get increasingly smaller connect the television and sent to the point that they can to on our\n... five and then what is that over the phone cameras at every corner there won't be put into place in the name of a safety fainted was running increasingly violent way lower grade our freedom a safe way I'm going to allow our rights around our hands and we'll keep our\nChildren now remember protections and they'll say maybe some of the African command more back on the day\nWell future man looking back on them and they are pretty interesting productions if there are predictions that to come from Nineteen forty five\nAnd a some of them are accurate some are a little off by ... by just a a tad I think\nBut when you're dealing with something called revelation of the method we have science fiction people all the time making predictions and having them come true I mean we're warned through this type of predicted programming about how we should be prepared to accept certain ideas certain ... certain ideologies\nWe see in film and TV shows many things that eventually come to pass and when they do we wonder about the theory of retro causality and real time travel is these physicists have been talking about retro causality and whether or not there are things that\nShape the past few shaping the past time travel is a fantastic concept in most would consider the stuff of science fiction and\nYet we hear more and more that the idea of dream through time he's he's he's quite possible actually ah but to change the course of history\nYeah I don't know I mean we're we're told that there are different timelines that if you go back in time uh and you kill baby Hitler that won't matter 'cause there'll be another time my little form after that that kind of thing I don't know\nBut um it is possible or hearing more and more about time travel is becoming more and more possible plausible but um there are those who\nBefore us have had insight to see the future or may say they've come from the future to let us do\nYou know through science fiction but time travel is possible in his happen from time to time or time after time or or time in an item and and that's it and yet as you may know\nLike I said I I in the last hour I I just stumbled upon a film that I saw before called tomorrow and there was a Disney film with George Clooney in it\nAnd what I found most interesting is in the film a they discuss a secret society called plus ultra\nNow according to the fictional history of the film I did some studying on this uh the story goes that good stuff Eiffel\nMet Jules Verne and Thomas Edison at his power apartment just started a secret society of optimist plus ultra was founded it'd be Eighteen eighty nine world's fair in Paris, France\nThe organizations purpose is to create moderate and expand upon new scientific advancements for humanity now key members of this group included\nPeople like H. G. wells Ray Bradbury Amelia Earhart Mark Twain Nikola Tesla and other scientific figures Walt Disney eventually became a member as well so it started\nIn Eighteen eighty nine and there were people who became members of this plus ultra group and what plus ultra was was a group that\nCreated a breakaway civilization in another\nDimension okay so I Know science fiction right but is there any truth to it that's the question well as we do is we dig deeper into this story okay it says now this is according\nTo the movie fiction this is this is the story tomorrow land in Nineteen fifty nine had an expansion at Disneyland it was actually about and this is what they said in the film that tomorrow land was actually a training facility\nFor future societies future members this societies they were training them for a journey to an alternate universe\nAnd at this alternate universe was found and later developed by plus ultra\nNow the blueprints for the expansion he'll keep technologies that enabled the journey including something called the super transport\nKey VIPs were encouraged to join plus ultra were given special VIP audio tour tours of the world's fair or the attraction there there was Ford's magic skyway there was the it's a small world world ride and for those who couldn't attend the fair there was a\nThere was a record player or record that they could play to get information about the details now Walt Disney\nHad the it's a small world attraction at the Pepsi Cola pavilion in the Nineteen sixty four New York world's fair that believed to contain of portraits tomorrow it\nIn reality does he does have a secret place\nAnd it's near the pirates of the Caribbean it's below the pirates of the Caribbean ride\nIt's called club thirty three it's a private club a club thirty three has not accessible to the public and it's for exclusive use of its members and is the only location at Disneyland that serves alcohol now to enter clubs thirty three I guess has to press a buzz buzz around an intercom it's concealed by hidden panel and a doorway\nAnd when Walt Disney was a young boy he was a member of the demo they society and my son a quarter and so a lot of people believe that the thirty three is related to the thirty third degree a Scottish right free masonry soap\nOfficials secret society that is a dimensional secret breakaway civilization called plus ultra\nI started wondering is there something like plus ultra that I can present for you tonight that would be sort of a revealing that there may be some dimensional breakaway civilization or there may be some ties to time travel\nYes I can do this and it it is ... and as I was digging through this this ... plus ultra it's Latin for further beyond now I Need for you to remember\nThose words plus ultra because those are the two words that are going to be the ones that are going to unlock the doorway unlock the key it's a key that opens the door where the doors of perception of your mind to maybe have you thinking about where we are right now and whether or not\nThere are people in high places that can manipulate the future changing the passes or well said he controls the future controls the past well there may be\nA few people that are the\nTypes of [noise] plus ultra people\nThey're actually [noise] using the future to correct things for the past or for using retro causality in order to do it on to the county [noise]\nIt'll blow your mind as to what I found and I'm sharing it with you tonight I'm really excited so stay to Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis you listen to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\n...\nLatest news adequate to talk about and news radio Ninety three point one WFL a [noise]\nIs to create a new world order that would replace world religion in world government he stated fit it all of being replaced by collective it's him and he said it a collective it some would eventually kill religion by replacing it as the new religion philosophy well certainly was a visionary\nWhether or not he was a time travelers a compelling argument whether or not you know a ... year his ideas are going to happen or just like that radio broadcast\nThat we played so when you talk about H.

how much he praises him for his intellect and how he had all the papers of Nikola Tesla and the possibility of a time\nNot only that but you see that plus ultra\nAre on the tiles all over mar a Lago where President Trump is called the king\nThinking about that for a moment\nSo what Donald Trump be fully aware of the fact that there were books written about a young\nMan named a barren Trump\nWho was advised by a man named John these are some very interesting thing British season coincidences did make me wonder about plus ultra and whatnot plus ultra is a real group it's going to Robert in Ohio Hi Robert you're on ground zero\nBelow ground how you doing you love your show what you're talking about it with another as usual mind thinking situation that you always open the canals can and let the mind begin to think\nLast year I think I Love that you do that thank you so much and\nLet me get started by saying that a person who make predictions and things like that\nYou know are generally person should have a totally open mind on that because one never knows what's going to possibly happen in the future anyway right and as a person has come up with the idea that there possibly something good because you'll notice what protections a lot of times it says hey there's something good comes up\nOr something bad happened actually enjoy one or the other\nAnd ah so you know people predicting thing and people who are protected bank\nThat's Nineteen forty five show for instance that you're listening to\nUh put on there earlier was probably something that was played after World War two and England because the gentleman that talking\nI was like ... and ... try to bring people make them realize someday there'll be no more face to worry about right yeah so that that's that's what that in my opinion is what that's all about as far as people making protection and sometimes they're good sometimes they're bad\nMouth all the the secret society now I totally believe that also too as you're saying they alter plus\nA possibility it's I don't know I don't know myself personally if or if there is but with the way the world is today and the way society is today and the way the issues are and the way everything is in this country is right up there is probably secret side\nAll blew my mind is the you know here we have John Tromp who is a Donald Trump cynical who had all the nickel Tesla's work you had all these papers and of course a Trump was\nA pretty much a a a big helping creeping X ray machines much of what tests as war was about and Lawrence Tesla created a depth re a bid to most certainly\nYou know speculative there but it's like well John Trump said well nothing was found that was a very important but yet John Trump\nWent along it became this bit bits in this [noise] and then Donald Trump of course at mar a Lago he stays at mar a Lago and this is where he kinda hangs out his resort for all the dignitaries and all over the walls is is the term plus ultra plus ultra plus ultra\nFrom beyond and it it you know just amazing the way that all comes together like that it makes you wonder about uh also the ah the story about Baron Trump\nAnd the story about the last president it's just an amazing a kind of coincidence that all this went down in the Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nOne thing you'll you'll you'll ... easily find out what secrets are fighting Clyde too is the fact that usually it's the people that have the money\nBut yeah that's right and if and if it's some sort of time travel secret society man that that explains a lot of pressure Robert thank you so much for your call AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred think about it for a moment is there a secret society that knows about time travel will be back with more don't

movies band and I remember it being a good movie I wanted to see it again and what was interesting about it was it reminded me\nOf well\nA secret society in the film official secret society called plus ultra\nAnd a lot of people who are involved with plus all through all these ... Thomas Edison and\nH. G. wells and uh several other people Thomas Edison Mark Twain all having connections in fact they said that even the ... was a member of this plus ultra group and I thought well that sounds really believable is plus ultra real\nWell\nYes and no okay 'cause I'm finding out that maybe it's not called plus ultra but it's something else even does be was a part of southern golf club thirty three to ... he created\nIt was just a special club for some of the people he knew and some very special people and of course a lot of people believe that the club thirty three cups should the thirty three degrees masonry because ... was part of the Malay when he was a kid so plus the ultra\nIs there any truth to the idea of the baby plus ultra may be some time travel group for some group it created a a breakaway civilization on some other plane a utopian plane\nWell H. G. wells are as you know there was a movie made about H. G. wells called time after time it was another picture movie where wells goes into the future to find Jack the ripper and he does so by using his quote fable time machine and the movie and it's kind of quick cryptic wait says H. G. wells married\nAmy capturing Robbins who died in Nineteen twenty seven and it's just as a writer he anticipated socialism global war space travel\nAnd women's liberation he died in Nineteen forty six well wells also claimed that he was the Fabian socialist he was part of the open conspiracy to establish a future new world order out he knew that he wouldn't live to see the data this new world order would happen but he knew that a new world order was in the works that he wrote a book in Nineteen forty called the new world order\nAnd the book addressed the ideal of a world without a war
