like I said I'm I mean last night I think it was pretty evident\nThat I really needed to escape the reality of discord not only in my country but in my state here in Portland, Oregon right with but

of fact the actor James Woods was tweeting actually got shadow banned for tweeting that if if if Hillary Clinton wants civil war will give him a civil war\nSo about whatever was shed you know I talked about how I felt like we were in the middle of one number of them were threatening and Hillary Clinton said well you know we're not going to be civil unless you know we take back what we have and Donald Trump says well if we lose there will be violence\nSo\nWhat is that going to do for America I mean what are you going to do about this that's the question I have is that you know and so you go to the Internet\nAnd you try to you know state where you want to stay on Facebook what is Facebook do well they go after eight hundred Web pages shut them down but you gotta do Facebook pages especially some that have a lot of power like a nation and distress\nIt was the first online publication to endorse President Trump um three point two million likes three million followers gone\nGone because of a what they were what they were saying back then of course ah ... seven hundred thousand followers attacked Trump referred to Republicans is cheating scum bags so a political rhetoric may were saying it was done because\nThey were ... I think what was going on is probably both of them had something to say about the civil war or the idea of a civil war and that they were taking down\nBecause it just seems to me they were going pretty good but they only mentioned these I think these are these are the ones to make them look like they did this uh you know fairly you take away a conservative you take away a liberal you know

... we show our hand and say that we can remove all the conservative viewpoints then there's going to be held to pay with the conservative\nSo\nWatch these moves these moves are very important to watch\nBecause\nWe see this internally Google we realize\nThat of course well this okay this is what they were saying in their in their memo to some of the fact that they may believe in change they they say we will change with the times is necessary meaning that if they just so happened to wipe out if you search injuries based on tone then they can make that dragging apply deal with China and no one will feel that this is some sort of people move\nThis is what the briefing says if I can get it out quick says Google might continue to shift with the times are changing it stands on how much or how little it censors due to public governmental commercial purposes or pressures if it does\nA knowledge of what this shift in position means for users in for Google is essential shifting blindly are

radically inclined both liberal and conservative\nAnd then Google issues a statement saying that we certainly don't want to eliminate certain viewpoint to start dating site users fury\nDumping scaring the gay something just scared them and I think what scared them or the statements you heard from both Hillary Clinton\nAnd Donald Trump they don't\nWant to be responsible for civil war they don't want to be liable for civil war and now the media's got to wise up too because they're encouraging it more so than anybody else now to believe fix every three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six seven

happen this this this and this\nSo uh you know I don't know it just seems to be this is what they're talking about and so then when people started commenting about the whole idea of what Hillary

no I don't think we're seeing the\nDemocratic Party doing anything not see I I'm sure that the I'm sure the Democratic party or people who are representing a the the left wing will say that everything the Republicans are doing or not see I mean\nCalling out of Nazi or calling Nazi you're not see there's kind of forgot when argument and it certainly dumped pills everything into a soup of not of nothing this and it makes it less effective but I Will tell us\nAbout how is this law you know a show like\nLet me finish I'll tell you where it's going well yeah but mayor in this town that is corrupt and deserves to be arrested in fact today I came to work wondering how I could organize a group to arrest them he needs to be arrested or on many reasons many reasons he's arrested because he is not holding together the rule of law in this in this city not at all uh\n... it's it's like it you know the same is live um right without the violence but we still have the same kind of their employees you know I don't know is saying you know a seller before last they shut a major bridge going across the river to live as\nWell when we when we have okay well we have groups that are uh basically blocking traffic a and there and there are abusing people and the police look on the police are told not to do anything so their their arms and tied their hands are tied\nWhen it came on the ice or when there would be a ice pick over here the icy takeover in ah Oregon [noise]\nSame thing happened in fact they were saying that what he did was unconstitutional in and would be a and I think there is somebody actually suing him for what happened there but we also have a governor here is very corrupt she's actually a bear a lot of things that she's doing right now\nBut in my opinion ah would would probably weren't arrest as well for some reason we have two very corrupt leaders\nA mere Portland it's a corrupt leader and the mayor in a in a new governor of Oregon and super corrupt and both of\nThem are in power right now and so even if they're gonna wait it out to the elections but in my opinion [noise] somebody's got to be done sooner than later and a half and this is why we're in the position we're in right now and I I don't normally I don't normally talk about local politics I leave that up to a guy that I work with the Mars Larson is amazing with that stuff\nIs conservative very staunch conservative but still you have a handle on Portland politics and a lot of ways\nAnd I keep telling them every day what are you going to do\nTo get people to start talking about arresting our mayor Ted Wheeler and tell him look you don't you don't allow this type of thing and a lot of crime to run in this in this in the city and I think that uh you know is being well known across the country now his reputation and what he's doing and what has been happening here in Portland, Oregon\nThey sent me poor prepared for anything\nAnything can happen and anything is happening right now so as I say it's best to be prepared I'm not calling for civil war I'm not asking are running the streets I'm asking to throw up your hands and scream and yell all I'm saying is be prepared for anything will be back [noise] [laughter]\nI think they're beginning to feel the heat I think they're beginning to realize that they can't be biased like they are they can't continue to do this\nThat isn't he go hog wild and be all violent and crazy on on Facebook or on Google but they're looking at tone and once again once again this brings to mind the social credit score\nWill look at tone will have a hate scale well we'll run the site to the algorithms and the hate scale and we'll see just how it measures up out of it and it turned out that they have it turns out the ... algorithm ... you have a lot of hate hate speech in your and your Web sites we won't post them\nOnce again the robot determines whether or not you're a racist based on their criteria you know when you're constantly getting these hints\nAbout war civil war\nAnd the license for violence and the motives of course getting what you want to promote it you know we want so many people to go out and vote but we don't want certain people to win and if they win will keep being on civil to one another if they if they lose maybe there'll be more violence\n\nAnd of course the media says about Trump when he said about the GOP violence or Georgia wow that three expected you know he's a he's a fear mongering narcissistic blah blah blah blah blah blah you do that anyway but then Hillary Clinton says\nConsequences be damned we need to have instability until we get what we want enter claim of civility could return when Democrats have power is a measure the ends justify the means\n\nMeanwhile she said this one we've got Republicans that are being shot stabbed docks beating male or a rice in powder\nRun out at restaurants sent death threats and yet she says we got to be an civil until we get what we want well who's giving the chilling responses right now\nSome guy I guess a bit of two hundred pound bomb but you want to detonate on election day one guy said he was going to do is low it was reported the news
