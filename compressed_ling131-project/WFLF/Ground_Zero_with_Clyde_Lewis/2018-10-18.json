I mean I don't know if anybody remembers me much me but I remembered it okay somebody else or there would be saying this now I went back [laughter] I went back to semi shows to try and find it I couldn't find it where I said it\nBut\nI I did say I I Swear I said and then um\nI asked my friend Sarah said that I say this is she listened to the show and I think she called me and she said\nUh how how does this what what what about this space armada thing\nAnd I and so I remember her calling me she remembers calling me because I asked her about it\nAnd so\nI tend to take some of these strange stories I just I bookmark dumb and they put them in my\nIn a file right and so I came in this morning after I had lunch or actually it was afternoon after I had lunch with my friend Sean and I went to look for that story because I wanted to you know I wanted to find\nThe the the guy who emailed me tweeted me are sent me a message saying I'd found the story this is all I got\nBut I looked all over the Web today I ... I just search tying little all over the Web\nTyping in key words armada space armada stark clusters Russian scientists these dark clusters living very alien armada think their daily information or some UFO formation\nCould not find the story\nAt all sure he was gone\nI welcome you to try and find the story on Google if you're near a computer and says to me on Twitter is set up to me and my and my Facebook feed I I'm more than happy\nTo uh you know did Mitt that maybe it is there but I cannot find that story\nCan't find that story\nSo it was like one of those off the cuff comment so I didn't do any research on I'm thinking well I Want to do research on this I Want to find out more can't find a damn thing\nSo last night\nI don't know if I'm any of you know this but there was a full world wide shutdown of YouTube last night\n\nAnd I got an email from a guy named Scott Reed emails me all the time and he kept mentioning this story about uh have you seen this video this video going around the Internet this video of a guy he's in a uniform even military and you say that something is about to hit the moon\nSome large object is about to hit the moon well apparently\nThis is the this is a conspiracy theory this is a conspiracy theory 'cause I cannot confirm it so it's a conspiracy theory meaning that since I Can't confirm it but it's weird that I think I'm having some sort of a mental breakdown or something I don't know what's going on here but\nUm there were rumors flying around as to why the this this this this outage occurred\nLast night\nAnd the cheap rumor is that viral video\n\nThe viral video of a guy something on YouTube relief that purported to show a man in uniform announcing that something large\nHe didn't asteroid a rock a UFO I dunno something large was about to crash into the moon\n\nAs I said I was notified by email and Scott if you're lifting please send that email again and I want I Want to know if you send an email too because I read your email sometimes they don't reply to them but I read your emails and Scott you know who you are I'm Talking right to you\nI Want to know where that video is about men or that that footage of something hitting the moon\n\nBecause from what I understand is that they shut down YouTube last night they shut down YouTube last night because of that video\nThey didn't want that video to go viral slated to shut down the system see they won't tell anybody way the system shut down it just shut down because they wanted to weed out any and all of these videos going around that would show something hitting the moon\n\nNow eight I Can't find proof of this and I can't\nFind a video or if I Can't find the story about the armada and a stark clusters and the Russians and the art the story\nIt all sounds like some science fiction misinformation\nMaybe got leaked out it wasn't supposed to be heard of ... or or thought about right so\nScience fiction disinformation maybe maybe somebody tried to play a joke on people\nBut\nI mean\nIs it really was it really science fiction this information really because of circumstances it just seems a little odd rushing say they see the\nStark let's just say but they don't want to start clusters they look like\nDo you remember the famous than you might remember me saying this on the air\nSo I was talking about the neutrinos coming out of Antarctica right and I said oh and now they're saying that Russia says ... looked like our motto UFOs blah blah blah blah blah you remember I said something about that haven't been able to find that\nQuote [noise] but I have a friend who said you did say it okay I did say it\n\n\nI said it and then the shutdown of YouTube and a mysterious email not really mysterious as a guy who sends me emails all the time saying that he saw video in fact I Want to check my email the series on this year to see if he wrote me back I Want to find out to be listening to me if he's writing me back immediately\nUm see no he hasn't written me he has not\n[noise]\nWell somebody sent me some better rushing star clustered [noise]\nNo that's not in jail thank you but this is a story [noise]\nVisiting the story [noise] I'm thinking

man you got to tell me did you see that video something getting among hitting the moon last night\nBecause I hear that that was the reason why they shut down on YouTube\nAnd I'm feeling I'm honestly and this has been for a fact I'm feeling really nervous than I I'm\nI feel it in my neck I feel tension\nIn my neck something definitely\nHe's weird about this whole thing uh\nI mean as I say\nIt

castle containing the abstract successfully separated from the rocket booster and parachute into the ground with a rescue teams were there to pick them up it's also interesting to know the two of NASA's important space telescopes when did the safe mode\nShutting down about sending information back\nBut the Chandra X ray observatory when did the same boat and halted all the science operation is a few days after Hubble the Hubble Space telescope shut down due to a gyroscope failure according to the agency ... a transition at the same boat was possibly triggered by an issue that also\nHad something to do with this gyroscope component in charge of putting in stabilizing the telescope however there are some investigators and those were into deep space conspiracy theory they're saying that something is happening in space that NASA does not want us to see\nAnd ... and and just out of coincidence NASA's curiosity Mars rover it's temporarily halted science operations to there's been a glitch with that so that we can't see anything from Mars\n\nCan't see anything from Mars here's an overnight bullets and it hasn't made national headlines yet but here we go NASA's planetary defense

the shot up to a hundred and fifty dollars a hundred and fifty million dollars\nSecondly white issue a brand new plan that it's intended to energize a host of agencies who can contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster if there is no debt disaster looming for the foreseeable future something isn't right about all this something is definitely wrong here\nI mean it feels like a really
