I'm already starting now planning on um I'm trying to get jobs or at least one or two jobs over the summer I worked for the sixty hours really kicked in and the gear could get off with credit cards\nAnd you're you said you're a college professor or what subject do you teach\nTheology specifically for individuals with disabilities\nWow and I would guess that would also apply to athletes would it not\nNo my athletes can be disability sports but my research specifically for people who have the ability of cognitive disabilities and they have trouble getting out of the couch and exercise are being physically active now more toward the competitive fun\nYeah okay I Would think an independent practice separate from your teaching where he worked hand a hand in glove with some therapy people in the therapy community a would be ideal for an on going extra income and your jacket up a lot during the summer\nOr in a sense you're you're a tutoring if you will your own students are but you're using your research in your expertise and your information that ought to be very valuable\nUh and and that you could build a coke business consulting business working with therapists are that you come in and and you know supplement what they're doing it and move things alone so I think you've got a real upside there on your income that's exciting stops\nWesley with us in Pensacola Hi Wesley welcome to the day Ramsey show\nBecky Dave how are you doing today\nThan I deserve what's up\n[noise] so a little background my wife and I graduated college last year completely debt free I'm and I'm looking into trying to get a separate vehicle because right now we've been driving or like you said a ... you got a a United States marine driving a few hundred thousand miles Korea so thanks for that\nBut I Know that I'm not driving the base but whatever I\nLive in the car payments because I told my buddy as you also there struck me told me about sixty thousand dollar car and I'm like eating it thought\nAnyway so my question is I'm trying to figure out what to do next because I Want to get rid of the press they don't want to replace it with a\nTruck and I've got a Nineteen sixty four Chevy back home\nMhm um and my uncle is willing to your labor for me for free or to get it fixed up putting new engine it when you train Ian and all kinds of stuff it's really sweet looking shot truck a problem for the is that you know it's not going to be quite as reliable it's probably not going to be reliable as a moderate are what the\nLaw which would you consider going down the road and you know\nStop at a couple of thousand into the truck and make it you know what you know driving around\nOr do you you know save up and wait for a year later on\nI think the trucks a keeper and it's a project truck that you work on after you get your financial straightened out\nOkay um so I I think the previous was gonna say I hate it too I'm with you but [laughter] but I think it's going to be a lot more reliable than a fixed up sixty four I've got a ... I got a Nineteen sixty about those rebuild from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ...\nTo four but dual ... for barrels on it it's a beast or not but it is a project car I mean they you you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere I have to be it's more of a fun thing to have\nIn the garage and I think that's what you're sixty four is going to be some day um but if you want to sell the Prius and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car was what you would have spent on the truck motor and that kinda stuff\nAnd move into a whole different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a big move up kind of a thing that I'd be okay with that if you want to do that\nBut um but I I don't think I'd like to try and get away and I want to do with the project 'cause it's a coup a project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is one of those Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin how Josh how are you\n[noise] I'm good how are you do better than I deserve what's up [noise] so I've got a question um regarding a credit card\nFor business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here I'm looking for someone by um my wife and I have never been through a few but we actually just recently paid off offered to them about two and a half weeks ago\nGreat congratulations\nThank you um I work from home with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in a while\nAnd we are required basically it's you you know pay for some of those business expenses during the trip that money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to be paid for that what we have to kind of want that money I had the time um [noise]\nWe've called on all of our credit cards except for the one of these business trips because we don't have money you know set aside to be able to pay for these expenses\nI might have been much of the expenses run a month\n[noise] well I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but there I mean every time I go on a business trip it gets anywhere from a thousand two thousand dollars covering the hotel mood and then you're going to get the money to act like when you get the money back within thirty\nDays\nYeah OK correct so I mean we're we're paying we hang that often and obviously we're not going to using the credit card for our own personal use to\nThe end of the any religion that you need to see that one time you need to ... from the ... one time with two thousand dollars in a separate ... new checking account that as a debit card on it and it's used only for one thing reimburse ...\nBusiness travel and use your money on your debit card and you pray your little company doesn't go broke and not pay you\nBack a little company you're taking a big risk sure you're\nYou're the bank or for the small company that is too small to even fund their own employees travel\nThat's pretty scary\nAt some point they may go belly up and you're going to be left holding the two thousand dollar ticket in your hand that's the risk you're taking so\nLong now so the company that when you go and visit they they don't they don't\nPay you they pay your company and then your company pays you write your company Roseburg they're going to take that money from that other company and pay their bills with it and you're going to be left out in the cold someday\nSure I've seen it happen I've been doing is Thirty years I've seen it happen a lot\nOf chatter so then where does that or does that fit in with\nThat leaves you well known as up a creek because you're taking a risk for this little bitty company that's what I'm pointing out for you know\nWhat I Would do it all with a debit card if you want to do that that's fine but at least then you're admitting that you're taking this risk\nI Will tell you I'm going to go back to your little bitty company and say gosh I'm Out of that I don't like borrowing money I don't want to borrow money anymore if you want me to take business trips why don't you give me the money to take business trips and then when they pay you back you'll get your money back\nIt's only two thousand dollar right\nI don't ask my people to travel here with their money I got a twenty eight year old young person\nThis trying to feed their dogs and their kids and keep their own and I'm going to send them out and put airline tickets on there on them know this company here pays for their airline tickets so we pay for the rental car and we pay for their hotel in their food when they travel I don't have somebody here to travel and asked them to pay for me\nPay back for just pay for it we give them a debit card we give them the cash when they leave the place you're company should do that for you and you should push 'em on it because you're taking the risk otherwise but if you don't want to change the situation you need to fund it with cash build a debit card and do away with a critical\nWith ads gonna make you how ... going to make your stomach\nBecause now you're realizing there's a real\nRisk there is this is Dave Ramsey show

I I just like it's very comfortable\nAnd uh I just thought it was awesome she got me this massive shirt because it just makes me feel on NASA like you know it's cool but uh\nA NASA gives be such notch they should call it a notch you are because they every everything they do anymore just makes me kinda\nWretched and and feel a little sick to my stomach I Know the earliest days with us space exploration situation one of the most fascinating chapters of human history that's why I like massacres I like reading about Gus Grissom on like reading about uh you know Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin Sharon in ... and\nI like reading about all these guys you know I write\nReading about a ball through team um I got in in in my office and maybe if I get wrong to get it out of the opposite I can take a picture and put on a on Facebook I've got\nUm\nI've got the uh uh a picture of something it's supposed to be the Apollo Thirteen no not a problem with the Apollo fourteen astronaut and it's a little piece of the gold lamb\nFramed I have it's it's kind of a cool thing I don't have any moon rocks but I have that and I have that in my office and I uh I really liked that thing and one of my earliest producers on this program Daniel he worked for NASA\nAnd\n... when I had him on working with me uh it was amazing because I got to get all this inside information and he was the one that\nWas telling me you should do shows about this shows but that asks why this isn't happening announcing that enemy big conspiracy theories about NASA and he worked for them to actually so yeah I mean going to see first band is gonna be cool because it's going to be like going to see Apollo Thirteen\nOr any other space movie running with the historical narrative we know that scientists had a determined effort to go to the moon and they had a limited time table\nAnd their efforts gave us the Gemini program and the Apollo moon landing with Neil Armstrong acting is the first human ... to an extraterrestrial world\nAnd there's so many things we can talk about with him you know leaving the planet along with bugs and\nAnd go in and doing it and you know\nTouching putting his foot on lunar soil and all that whether or not there aliens there whether or not they saw structures they're I mean there's all kinds of things that you can speculate about but almost from the point of the first Apollo mission\nThere were many Americans they expressed skepticism that the\nWhole event taking place at all it had they argued been faked\nIn Hollywood by the federal government for purposes ranging from embezzlement of the public treasury to complex conspiracy theories involving international injury murderous criminality also\nUsing money to foot the war effort in Vietnam this was all thrown together it was a propaganda basically a propaganda scam to make the Russians feel inferior and to be honest it worked\n\nWas whatever it was I mean the Russians were ahead of us in the space race\n\nThen one day they find out that we've got amount on the moon to me is how we don't want to do that and see and that's why there's always bothered me about\nThe moon landing as we landed on the moon\n\nAnd it's kinda like climbing Everest one man climbs up ... makes it to the top bitter several other people that want to climate adversity the saying they don't succeed okay some do but some don't\nSo let's look at the moon is like ed rest right we go about every sweet land on Mt Everest and the Russians that works so hard to go about average decide that but we're not going\n\nNow why didn't they go why were they to second on the moon why when when the when the whole fever pitch was going on we're we're the only ones who are going to and from the moon no one else was going up there Russia wasn't going up there China wasn't going up there\nNobody cared to go up there in fact after the first three moon missions they were kind of getting bored with the moon mission\nThey would rather watch Lucille Ball I mean what are\nThey were rather watching Lucille Ball wondering a busy or near the kid or whoever was going to have a baby or\nI it was like you know\nComedies were more interesting than the moon landing the first one cool second one okay third one or [noise] okay how about about how their lives ruined thing if you're a lot of people that that skepticism about whether it on the moon happened at all when we landed\nAmong Americans between the ages of Eighteen and twenty four years old Mrs figures from the Nineteen sixties the twenty seven percent expressed doubts but NASA went to the moon\nAnd over the years there have been many more doubters and anymore if you express doubts you were called a science dinner\nYou're up there with Blatter's right uh [noise] that's about the first moon landing had been on the rise for some time now and there are a lot of people that don't believe that was it turns out\nThroughout the ladder third of the twenty twenty century onto the twenty first\nConfidence in the United states government by the American public you've been in decline and does remember the Kennedy assassination Vietnam Watergate the nine eleven attacks all these other scandals malfeasance may find it easier to say well you know the governs lied to us about a lot of things why wouldn't they lied it was about the moon landing and what's really weird is is that\nYou know out of all the things you can question questioning the moon landing it's probably one of the worst things you can do okay it's it's one of the worst things that you can do\nFor you that you know using ... you can question Iowa and that's that's kinda bad because people say how dare you there was the most horrible event and history and you're questioning that people have died\nThat that you get that all the time you're talking about Watergate and yeah you do some ... they don't care about Watergate I don't care about Monica Lewinsky is dressed but yet we spent less money on nine eleven I mean ... and that's the thing is you know you look at the embarrassment of that\nYou look at all the money they put into the moon landing and we haven't gone back in fifty some odd years and the rocket ... what happened to them and you know all these questions that people have and when you start speculating they won't even allow you to speculate that it never happened\n\nThey'll tell you you're crazy they'll tell you you you need to go back to physics class\nWell\nYou look back at a ... and you say to yourself well this is kind of interesting and you know with all the the deaths in the accidents before Apollo eleven we sent\nThree guys out into space and nothing really happened to them\nWe didn't lose any astronauts we didn't destroy any equipment in the process maybe on earth we did when the when the alarm on the Armstrong almost killed himself in the lab and his wife says you're not going to the moon no way\nOh yeah I Am I mean I'm going to the moon no not after you crossed to the lunar lander on her as well you know we're not we crashed it on earth but we're not going to crash it on the moon I trust me we're not going to do that\nYou see the space shuttle blows up or astronauts are killed the program for a year to figure out what the hell happened back then I got a timetable to meet you know Neal if you cross the lunar lander tough luck Charlie you're going up into space you're doing that one small step for man speech\nThat's what happened\nAnd you're going to do it with technology but so the equivalent of the computer technology in your toaster of it that's how we're going to do with guys and you're going to be sitting in something the size of a phone booth or those huge backpacks on your back here to take pictures of the moon was something equivalent\nOf and mittens Hi you're going to do it well we got all figured out now is how is this going to be done without people question is what we've got that I'll figure it out to no one will question\nIt it'll be the most brilliant thing ever you're going to the moon and you know you're going to the moon and the American people know you're going to the moon except except\nThat there are a lot of things we're not going to tell them about how we're doing this magic [laughter]\nA lot of things were going to forget about once you've gone [noise]\nAnd we forget about it is it'll delay our moon program for maybe a hundred years [noise]\nI'm not kidding even\nWith the lawn mosque [noise] and all the other guy's trying your base owes trying to get to the moon\nIs one thing the media is gone telling you\nNone of this is happening anytime soon\nThat's what I found out today and I'm going to tell you about it and it makes me wonder again about what the hell did we do in sixty nine\nAnd why can't we do it now\nQuestion whether or not they were doing it didn't make believe back then\nWhen they did Star Trek or triple eats eggs every three thirty seven

zero\nNumbers called tonight AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA ... street thirty seven hundred and\nOne of the first topics on ground zero that I did\nWas the debate over whether or not we went to the moon I was able to interview bill casing what are the old timers you wrote the book about it was also Robert de ... several was later on today and my beard with Robert ... of Penn and teller Showtime special\nShow where they actually make fun of conspiracy theorists I was they didn't really make\nFun of me all that much but they put me with a bunch of other guys were kind of bizarre\nAnd uh it really was kind of unnerving to watch but still I mean I I was one of the first talk show host I mean I only be our belt would have done this because I Do and I were working together at one time when I was on\nDoing a ground zero we're broadcasting on the Internet first shows broadcast on the Internet was ground zero than our do are built showed we had dreamland art bell\nAnd ah I don't believe that our bill was very supportive of me doing just doing the topic and Richard ... knew I was doing the topic and he laughed he thought was funny\nBut uh because he was telling me he says well yeah you know right off the bat you know people are already thinking just admitted we landed on the moon but nobody but we didn't when we didn't go\nThere was a communist propaganda you know did you know whatever so\nI did the show and then uh\nI think it was February of two thousand and one I was very surprised when Fox or did a special called conspiracy theory did we landed on the moon\nAnd uh\nThat changed the entire nature of the debate because this way mainstream\nAnd\nThis is just such it's such a situation where a major\nNetwork presented a conspiracy scenario without any serious rebuttal it was reported this fact okay and that made me feel uncomfortable because at least on my show\nAt least on my show I gave a balance I said okay you know I have my doubts but here's some people to try and convince you otherwise and uh\nI think it was still played actually who got wind of all this and and ah he didn't like me [laughter] I don't think uh but if you if you see the old Penn and teller BS Showtime TV show\nWhere I'm On it talking about the moon landing right talking about the moon landing hoax or what have you a bill plates right there and I recommended him he was he's in the show and you don't have recommended it because I really respected it but I thought it was awesome that he responded to my show\nAnd that he responded to my uh I wrote an article called good luck Mr Gore ski and other\nOther uh other lives about the moon\nAnd uh it was just ... you know what if it was just saying what if it's not that I believed it totally I just had doubts\nSo having doubts I decided well I have a doubt they can say okay I Want to present this to people it's oh man that was the ugliest thing I'd Jim oh Berg from NASA right be a dirty

how dare you how can you sleep at night so often but it was all just popped in in the jaw\nUm so yeah I mean people get all kind of a big shift if you tell them I doubt I doubt that we landed on the moon I mean you'd be skeptical about UFOs you be skeptical about everything else but as many you start being skeptical about the moon landing\n\nIt's like you've kicked the pope somewhere and it's not a part is it's really a bad thing people don't like\nIt well I can tell you I still have my doubts about the moon landing and uh\nYou know I had them even more now after what I read today um you remember back in when was it it was a two thousand for\nPresident George W. Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon and twenty drifting you said the natural with just a new spacecraft was called the crew expiration vehicle by two thousand eight and ... the first mission no later than twenty forty\n\nFour years after the fact nothing we don't we don't have men men started back on the moon again we're we're just really talking about saving for speech to receive signing land on the movie industry go around the moon\nBut the President Bush had a goal set of having a man on the moon living and working there by twenty twenty having a base there and it's not out of the question I mean if you look at what Bigelow Aerospace is up to with making these inflatable moon basically I could have been done even um ours base could've been done\nWell gee that was nine we were told that NASA was carrying out this LCROSS experiment and they were lying to us about it about ... what they were using it for is that they were looking for ice on the move there are plenty of missions prior to the moon landing plenty of missions like the Clementine mission where they were scouting out in the moon finding ice pockets\nAnd so they didn't need the LCROSS mission but ah\nOf course NASA had five hundred million to spend on a rocket who's going to slam into the moon\nBlow up and then a copy of created it's about six miles wide\nAnd you know people say oh my God they're going to new moon and they were going to do this two days or two days shy of the forty F anniversary of first landing on the ...\nAnd there was a lot of stuff about that mission that did all add up didn't make any sense\nAnd\nYou're twenty love and after the LCROSS mission failed rock Obama cut funding for the proposed constellation program and the space vehicles he basically cancelled the five year nine billion dollar effort to build new Orion spacecraft an aries rockets\nThe new space vehicles were slated to replace the masses three aging space shuttles and launch astronauts into orbit and onto the moon that was the thing but no Obama pulled the nine billion and they put the money towards better than I bet that climate change climate science\nSo Obama killed the space program in order to turn announcing the climate change police and that's that's really sad I mean there was ever a time but now that we went to the moon at all that was the time because it you know they just shut down you know here we have this dream or going forward and Obama says not not that we're not going to go\nSo here we are in twenty Eighteen and we'll begin been told that the moon is the goal and later Mars to do the stories\nThe day that I Want to tell you about that really helped me excited but uh some bad news first of all a Russia seems to be out of their minds\nAh apparently may have detected would appear to be to colliding start\nAnd I think somewhere I have the sound of the stars don't try and dig it up but uh yeah they they detected these stars are putting off of sound gate of weird sound\nAnd are there going wait a minute or these really colliding stars are we looking at a space armada coming our way and if they're moving is asked we think they're going to be here by twenty twenty two\n\n[laughter] getting getting Russia found these colliding stars\nThey start collecting stars and they before them out there saying well these these look like cutting stars but the sounds are giving us the map intelligence in them so they may not be colliding stars at all\nWhat are they well they are um are there are no mater of of huge space craft coming our way\nUm\nNASA also reported today that Seventeen scientists often to report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national mission\n\nThe breathing was offered by the national academies of Science Engineering and medicine it emphasizes the importance of including astrobiology the study about life rigid on earth and how it might evolve elsewhere in the University of every phase of all now submissions destined for space from inception conceptualization to planning to development and operation\nSo once again we have Seventeen signed the saying guess what guys every mission that we do from now on is going to have the purpose of finding life out in space\nOnce again every mission is gonna be about finding life in space to have to have a a quest of finding life in space Russia's says they picked up on to quote colliding stars but maybe a space armada heading our way\nSo I Believe that the reason why this is happening why they're saying hey every mission has to have a fact finding like giving whatever is because they have confidence that there's intelligent life out there and the recent reports of techno signatures in fast ... actually it's fast radio burst\nOr the motivation behind the quest I don't know that it has anything to do with these claiming stars are possible are modest coming our way but it certainly has a lot to do with a techno signatures and get this astrophysicist are now saying\nThat with all the thousands of exoplanets out there and and how they're uncovering new insights into the complexity diversity of life on earth the authors also sit in the briefing that not only are you going to be looking for techno signatures guys we want you to look for bio signatures\nSo this is pretty amazing don't you think I mean I think it's cool I mean this bolsters the chance at life could exist out there and therefore\nAll space exploration missions should incorporate technology and find traces of alien organisms ... signatures techno ... I mean look I presume view of the universe is more cramped plants than ever before\nWe have two thousand three hundred confirmed exoplanets discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission and that leads to efforts to six out of every ten stars could host Earth like planet so the sheer number of known exoplanets operas exciting opportunities for finding ... signatures\nFighting chemical markers indicating that yeah there's live out in space\nIn the report sciences recommended that NASA accelerate the development of technologies to detect microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready instrument can travel to a distant world and measure the composition of its elements minerals and organic matter\nSo the good news is is that we've got all this stuff you know happening you're aliens yes this is this is a pretty interest I mean if they're saying look every discovery\nEverything that you go out and do now say it has to have some sort of a XO biological signature to it\nAnd they mentioned look at all the known planets we found the exoplanets and all this stuff well what's really sad about all this saying well we don't have anything available to send out in the space to do this and\nThey're saying you know we need to be able to find ways to get there because we don't have anything to go after our extraterrestrial neighbors or to find them\nIn any solar system so with all these advances are saying well we need a budget\nAnd now says only plan to return to the moon after nearly fifty years just got slammed by an internal audits\nNASA space launch system is designed to be the world's most powerful rocket supposed to be able to take astronauts to the moon and Mars and back however it costs twelve point two billion dollars to develop and launch\nThis rocket first mission and they're saying it's running years behind schedule it faces major cost overruns on Wednesday government auditors published report highlighting problems with the work of NASA in Boeing they're the biggest contractors for the SOS\nReport flag sixty four million dollars in extra fees warning by NASA slam bowling for poor performance\nAnd question the long term sustainability the super rocket program\nThe report even calls into question the sustainability of the entire project meaning but even with all the bright idea is designed the rocket won't even make it off the launch pad to the moon making making this newly manned moon project a pipe dream\nMean auditors put so much blame for the high cost of delays on bowling\nOne of the contractors the company is responsible for about fifty six percent of any rockets cost but it's years behind schedule and delivering the biggest section of the rocket [noise] and [noise]\nI mean there's just pissed you off I mean does it does give you more jobs as to whether or not we went to the moon in the\nFirst place [noise] come on if we're supposed to be on the moon in twenty Fifteen according to George Bush brought rock Obama signed it away now we're seeing twenty twenty we've got ... so we got you on my cell will be able to do that I don't buy it anymore [noise]\nNot when we have like extraterrestrials knocking on our door and humming [noise]\nHow fast radio burst flashing\nTechno signatures being sought after by Saturday and we have nothing to fly out to those guys nothing Tripoli six seven three thirty

you\nWant to hear you saying not only or in another time [noise] and we will ever say\nMore than any moment in our history\nThat is part of a system that is part of a universe where a small\nEnergetic

something\nThere are\nThings that are living out in space [noise]\nSeven feet scientists decided to say the NASA about time and do whatever missions we do now we have an agenda and that agenda is defined live in ... city and met Hugo uber techno signatures now NASA once ... signatures\nI said the reason why they're doing is just because well you know they they they know something's out there they're competing they want to find but when you know what we don't have a vehicle that's capable of going out in space to find that stuff we can't even put a man on the moon we can find a man on the moon back in sixty nine\nBut now we can't put a man on the moon because we just don't have enough money to get the rocket to rebuild\n\nThis rocket they're supposed to be making me SOS rocket just got slammed by an ... an internal audit they're saying on the cost effective no not at but it's\nTaking too much money\nHow is it that this is happening how is it now the way we may not be going to the moon in our lifetime\nEven though George W. Bush said we can do it in twenty Fifteen he said back in two thousand four we can do it and twenty Fifteen ... his own or not we're going to focus on climate change\n\nPresident Trump says racehorse everyone goes [laughter] and then they said no wait a minute we can go to the moon we can't go to Mars we're gonna do it we're going to do it and then of course oh no we can't do it\nWe can't make the rocket we couldn't sixty nine we can't now\nWhat the hell's wrong here just makes you doubt even more so when you go see this movie is this first band movie it's just like what we saw in Nineteen sixty nine right a man on the set\n\nOne small step for man guidance go to Mike in Maryland I'm Sorry for your view on for so I mean you had a good question what was the question\nOkay a member of buzz was talking to that little girl and she asked him a question and he was like yeah it would have been nice if we would have went\nYeah she asked him it was it a some sort of a Comic Con or some sort of a science ... convention and\nShe said to him she said you know Mr Aldrin you know why but we got back to the moon and bugs gave it gave him gave her this look like well that's a question that you know little girls don't ask you know this is a big question and\nI have I have my reservations let me let me play you a clip I got it right here hold on one second ... Michael play for you listen to [noise]\nWhy won't you know [noise]\n\nAn eight year old question [laughter] that's my question\nSo called armada that Russia's tracking\nIt set off alarms all over the United states on radio stations [laughter]\nSo I'm Sorry if you are in life is is that the networks I'm Sorry by\nAlarms out to everybody I mean this is a this is radio guy this is a real radio at night [noise]\nAnd so I sent out the storm frequency or the amount of alien frequency or whatever it was\nAnd it set alarms off all over radio stations across the country so I Apologize for that\nI can hear the low frequency I can hear the home and it went up in up in up to the book down\nSo we'll be back with more ground zero the boy\nYou is your smart speaker say Alexa plain news radio Ninety

remember that magazine's gray magazine yeah\nHis men in the\nMoon landing ... they wouldn't landings compilation of evidence of interviews several scientists including James McKinney who stood originally oh he just presumed it did happen until he like UK professor of physics\nAlso on you to a YouTube channel that guy is better mankind that tr mankind ... and it's titled NASA admits never gone to them a lesson with regard to the show a McKinney\nA like this guy that she came across a better Mick Hi [noise] I'm less admits never gone to the moon\nOh Lucy the various layers uh that would have had to been I'm\nA I'm going through right okay and uh then they break it down according to the metal allergic up where he is the various metals space capsule\nAnd of course the space to by the time the cap so they asked her dad's had gone into like the third or fourth later they would have been vaporized they are right\nAnd that's a that's a story I remember the story of all I can remember like the Russian dog [noise] but I don't quite adult whether Russia is set up a dog called ... and like it was a dog is it up into space to see our dog react to go into space because they were losing a lot of astronauts aspects\nWere dying on space back to the old story about how there's probably some astronaut floating around in deep space somewhere that Russia announced cause not that died or what happened to be sent my up into space\nAnd um\nRussia reported that uh the dog was doing okay you know dogs great out in space or being space\nOr they didn't tell us is is that when it went through the Van Allen belts it died a horrible death and a baby and announced that are for the longest time and and finally they be classified as I think it was like a couple of years ago that but like actually did um die oh maybe ... yeah\nGlad I got a real quick in that in that presentation a lesson learned all the money they they interview several present day astronaut some of them all with a new project and a super advanced space capsule yeah the guy with\nLots of MIT battle Pettitte Don Pettit official tear up your guy for NASA said it's a hard thing to admit but we destroyed the old technology yeah it's it's an even tougher little back to recreate the technology but these other astronaut said well\nIf we're ever going to go to the moon we must ensure that the electronics can survive\nBut first man of course is going to take us through the ... the apparel lead to you know Neil Armstrong went through throw it in the middle of the problems we had with his wife his wife told them would be saving the kids were coming back\nOr either Cubans and you'd be coming back to the moon that's what I meant and so you know all about the efforts of the Gemini program the Apollo program you know the deaths that happened before or the testing but see a lot of people you know point to that\nDid that for Gus Grissom as the beginning of the conspiracy theory that we didn't go to the moon\nAmong Americans between Eighteen and twenty four years old twenty seven percent back in the Nineteen sixties expressed outfit NASA went to the moon over the years there have been many more people\nBut also a stepped up and sit down and believe it been the moon I don't believe that we went to the moon I Believe that a Hollywood has been telling us all the time that we have in the Stanley Kubrick directed the moon landings two guys want a space odyssey took time for bear did the moon landing stuff\nAnd of course we were ... showed in Nineteen Seventy one diamonds Are Forever James Bond film is James Bond gets on a moon landing set Nineteen Seventy eight Capricorn One\nMovie the talks about men faking that the Mars landing ... ah two thousand and one of Fox special conspiracy theory did we wind up in the mood basically saying stating a fact\nThat we never went to the moon Ben Kmart several film titled a funny thing happened on the way to the moon he claimed the footage\nOf the astronaut speaking the famous earth shot and uh it's it's in Israel and if you want to look as funny thing happened to the way the moon it shows the astronaut speaking beat the famous blue earth shot\nSo you know there are plenty of things that can cast doubt plenty of things are getting cast doubt on whether or not the moon landing happen in two thousand for\nPresident George W. Bush started a conversation about putting men back on the moon the Orion program the ... crew exploration vehicle\nBy two thousand eight you know we're supposed to be a working towards going to the moon getting there by twenty fourteen normally no later than twenty Fifteen didn't happen why because in two thousand nine actually with a two thousand nine round two thousand nine rock Obama pulled the plug\nBut ah it it was because of a a a failed mission that we had to go to the moon where the LCROSS a rocket\nWill cratered the ministry of there was water which didn't make any sense because we already had survey ears and landers and and orbiters mapped the moon Clementine actually mapped the moon in Nineteen Ninety four and a crime and China was able to deliver more than one point eight million digital images of the moon back to the ground\nAnd um\nThere was the interest satellite they were ground tracking the stations or that they were ... ground tracking satellite station was picking up on these images so everything is accessible to the general public via the Internet\nAnd one scientist reviewed the data from Clementine they already found the existence of ice within the moon's crater so why did they did as well you know it was a failure nonetheless you across mission was a failure rock Obama pulled the funding from a vis a constellation Orion a project\nWhich kept us from going to the moon and a nine billion dollars is cut from the program and a ... now here we are in twenty\nTeam we've been told that the moon is the gold again\nWhat's really cool\nIs it today it was reported it Seventeen scientist off into report stating that searching for signs of life\nShould be part of every future national NASA mission there the briefing was authored by National Academy of Sciences engineering in medicine it says it says in the briefing it says that\nIt's very important\nThat the new NASA missions include\nA studies at astrobiology studies of how life originated on earth and how it might have evolved elsewhere in the universe and every phase of all NASA missions destined for space from inception conceptualization they have to plan on trying to find a way to discover life in space\nBut I think it's obvious the reason why they're saying this was because yes they accomplished\nDo that is why first management theater\nHas been making fake it and they can make it back then to to relieve six seven three thirty seven hundred that's Tripoli except for three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back\n\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute a maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight\nThis audio is for your review and now for ...
