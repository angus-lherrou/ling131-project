working hard to become a vilified one percent or so is your host fed here's Carl now okay welcome back to the program that says the last stretch hope\nYou have gotten your conservative cardio today and I hope you have your shoes get along because we still got a little ways to go actually not much of a waste but we still got a little bit to go anyway All right so the ... of the Democratic left is that\nUh they want health care for all this has become a major talking point this has been a this has been a point in which they believe they can win back the house and the Senate oh man I meant to go over the Senate races the Senate races are looking very good for the Republican Party looking not so hot\nUm for the Democratic party after the Kavanaugh debacle which they purposely tried to destroy a man or by a lady that we now know is a complete liar lied about being claustrophobic lied about the doors on her house gave several different stories as to how many people\nWere a attacked or at one point for to to uh to you know to again but always different numbers for us with a counselor or bandwidth we learned earlier or at the end of last week\nDifferent number of people with a polygraph person in a different number of people in front of the Senate so this is a lady\nThat literally just made it up as she is she went to try to destroy Brett Kavanaugh and keep 'em all off the court or someone that I Will call severely evil and disturb or to be able to do something like that just absolutely sickening\nUh so we can go no holds barred now on Christine Blasey Ford a totally a total actress in straight up liar\nA what a disgusting person or she is quite frankly I Hope she finds Jesus and knee surgery she's seriously needs to repent just to disgusting evil person or to try to do that to a man that has\nTwo daughters just sickening or what the left do okay so now the laughs as health care for all let's think through this what happens\nAh and Medicare for all they'll say Medicare for all ... let me ask you this question if the land\nThe seeds and getting Medicare for all who is who was Medicare designed for and who will it hurt right off the bat\nOr many was designed as a\nMedical for people that have worked all their lives and then now retired for older people for older people my age and older\nAnd um unfortunately we have a situation already with an eagles getting Medicare or people that haven't paid in this system of getting Medicare and Medicaid is going to go bankrupt anyway so now we want to do Medicare for all\nWhich is the Bernie Sanders socialist health care plan because Obamacare filed yeah yeah so now we're replacing it with Bunni care yeah and then after that it'll be we don't care [laughter]\nListen I mean people are going to be impacted\nNegatively by a by a health care for all it doesn't exist first off we don't even have enough doctors that take care of the people that we have now who's going to pay for it yeah who's the well you're going to pay for it they they like to say free health care and health care for all in order to to accomplish that that means that Florida would have\nTo have state income taxes have Gillum or to get what he wants hopefully we can keep a strong Republican\nA Congress that isn't pull a sellout I'm\nAnd I'm ... and so there's there's just not any money to pay for this stuff\nGovernment remember doesn't have money except the money which they take from you so right away we know that elderly people are gonna ... gonna be rationed automatically Medicare was meant for them Obama already stole seven hundred or something billion from Medicare to get away from the elderly people\nAnd now the Democrats are saying Medicare for all well young people that aren't they don't need\nMedicare or so it's just not going to work\nA truth what they're trying to do is to advertise the middle class the goal is to get people to make I think the numbers are about\n... the numbers are forty eight thousand six hundred and fifty individually and sixty five thousand eight hundred and forty for a couple the goal is to get them into the Medicare system because of what they'll have been or democratic voters for life\nThat's the goal ... it's really going to\nUh it's really going to force the middle class people out of the middle class if you will it'll put a larger gap between the wealthy are and the poor so it will do the exact opposite of what they're claiming\nAnd remember access doesn't mean care it you think about it just it just common sense thinking your doctor goes to let's say a thousand patients on the street corner\nOr to twenty thousand patients overnight do you really think you're going to get better air no you're going to get worse care you're not going to get quality care or it's just an absolute it's an absolute absolute\nSham we literally we're broke now we do not have the money to pay for health care for all and you wouldn't want it quite frankly because it wouldn't mean long waits for simple things except emergencies\nYou break your arm you break your leg okay you can go to the emergency room which drew healthcare and preventative care will become too costly um and it it just will not be available\nI'll have to dive into this in the future when we have a little more time I just couldn't get through it in time tonight but don't let Andrew Gillum and the less scam you there's no such thing as health care for all\nAnd so next week don't go we're doing good and God Bless the [noise]\n[noise]\n\nWas hardest audience and talk radio news

... Fox News reports about the fate of missing Saudi journalist you amount to show\nGear now multiple reports the Saudi Government is putting together an explanation to acknowledge that gee markers show he was killed during an interrogation that went wrong and that the real intent was to a doctor show and bring him back to Saudi Arabia\nThe Gulf of this new narrative is to absolve the crown prince Mohammed bin saw him on\nA responsibility by giving him plausible deniability in other words saying the crown prince didn't order the killing but analysts point out for the past two weeks Saudi Arabia has denied having anything to do with the show he's disappearance even when there was a video of Chris Yogi entering the Saudi consulate\nPeas it's not about a week ago I'm a ... show was about ready to drop the records and uh I I was talking about the deep state and one of the things that bothers me about\nThe state is that it's it's the most overused term\nSince false flag a because well because it showed like Alex Jones or because of uh what people say and what they think that they'd be like a a big big like a false flag is like\nUh I didn't really happen so it's a false flag that's not a false flag okay and I've always felt so people tell people that's a false flag but of course you know a lot of ignorance is bred when people tend to think that one thing means another thing and and they ... the people in defining their own terms\nYou know they're they're defining what is a conservative they are defining what is a liberal people don't even know anymore and they really don't ... and and they don't know what a you know critical analysis that are objectivity anymore because if somebody says one day\nThat he can't stand you know Donald Trump being a noxious\nBecause he is he's obnoxious there's no doubt in my mind he's he's he's obnoxious is obviously is obnoxious okay so he's not noxious president you say so that was going on as well as the Emmys liberal well come on even if you're conservative you have to admit sees help noxious if you if you if you can't you're you're not being genuine you're not being disingenuous\nAnd you know if you're if you're like saying if you can't say that Hillary Clinton is obnoxious ... your your disingenuous because she is obnoxious she's up noxious Donald Trump's obnoxious but the only difference between Hillary Clinton Donald Trump is that Donald Trump is president the United states and he was voted in by the people\nThat's the difference okay and as your obnoxious president we're supposed to\nAh criticized him for things that he does wrong and we do a same with ... and I said the same about Barack Obama and people say I like where I go by the time and say look you know bronco bombs our president\nAnd um we should try to give him some time given the honeymoon that he deserves but you know we didn't give Donald Trump the honeymoon for sure [laughter] no hey nobody gave him a honeymoon and a\nAnd one of the things that's interesting is that you know between the false flag or you know nomenclature being bastard dies the other was the other was the deep state because they think it's an invention of Donald Trump and it's not\nIn fact these state was a shadow government one time there is also the dark state there's also a what is it that dark command there there are several names for the state it's just a deep state stuck with Donald Trump and what's most troubling about this accusation is that certainly is a tactic being used as somehow discredit conspiracy theorists\nAnd others in the media feels are right wing extremist pushing the ever present persecution complex of the president listen uh let me just tell you that\nBack when the Democrats were in power there's a vast right wing conspiracy\nNow uh now that the ... the Republicans\nAre in power there's a vast left wing conspiracy so is it or or no it's just there's a conspiracy and what it is is that it's it's meddling from the deep state operatives all over the world not just here in the United states not just Russia\nIt's all over the world there's these deep state players they wanted to come in and undermine this country and they undermine that by by programming a weirdos to actually go on to Facebook pages and start declaring that a certain person is a certain type of a leading towards a certain type of ideology in in politics which isn't the case because when you are doing\nA conspiracy analysis of geopolitical players\nYou couldn't talk about anybody and say what they do is good or bad and there's always somebody there they will tell you well obviously this is how you think all the time no it's not and so when you're looking at the deep state\nIt's it's not an American delusion ... if it's not you know is it is a worldwide phenomenon okay\nThe deep state on a global level right now is needed in order for the elites to salvage what they called the liberal international order which pure and simple as new speak for new world order liberal conservative whatever it might be it is a new world order and it's being established down the conspiracies done really trying to overthrow\n... and they tried to overthrow many presidents including Brock Obama so they're overthrowing bronco bothering him you know overthrowing George Bush or in fact they successfully a I think uh they they successfully were able to a command and also a puppet George W. Bush when he was in power it's obviously did that\nAnd a bronco bottom of the same they were able to ... him as well they puff it at a mall or the only difference between them and Donald Trump is Donald Trump stubborn Donald Trump stubborn and he doesn't know how to play the game of ah you know the deep state politics which is a dangerous thing for him and he doesn't care\nBut what I worry about it as if he doesn't care how does that fair with the American people and what would the deep state do to try and change all this while we've seen what they do they they mail rice and out to a out to people to scare them\nThey uh they they go in and they they do these are classic kids you know of a of a noted officials may kill people involved with a certain insight into ideology they that's how it works sixteen states in control so whenever you say about politics however I lean left writer or upside down I don't care\nI Know that there is something above it all there is a sin are above it all but certainly as controlling this country and is trying to control the world\nSo all we're arguing various ah you know or arguing a over various ideologies that we don't like or that we're thinking we're leaning towards you know the conspiracy is there to metal in the affairs of nations all over the world\nThat are struggling to keep their sovereignty and this is why there are few oligarchy\nOr willing to buy up in support chaos in the world\nAnd this is why we're now seeing in our major cities gang violence mob takeover and radicalized factions within separate strongholds and we're also seeing is on the Internet as well where people can't help themselves but to try and be mean to one another because somebody has a different ideologies and they do\nInstead of being a little bit more open a little bit more willing to talk things out see the warning of a major collapse the United states is not being heated and it's going on right now because there are many of the radicalized factions and they're quick to blame each other for the problems in the country and not the bad actors on the world stage they wish to see American cities burn\nAnd that's where they want to do they want to see American cities burned the truth is there are many Americans that have been ... by the secret hyper power who wants to further the coaching covered his seizing of world controls against the wishes of the majority\n\nThe psychological damage has been done to this country will take a generation or more to change and that if you're a people will stop and realize they've all been victims of massive know cis brainwashing propaganda it's allowing for raw emotion to get in a way of ultimate truth\n\nIt gets in a way of friendships in family uh relationships it's\nDividing marriages it's dividing man and woman is that if it's dividing political allies it's dividing it all\n\nThe deep state has always been a refuge for rogue intelligence operators\nWho worked for many of the countries that we have said that we said that are they they are our allies we said these are these we allied with these people but yet they're rogue intelligence ops that work within our allies the groups that say that they were friends look they've succeeded in developing ways the heightened suggest ability and says subservient in the world\nAnd with the failure of the fourth estate\nAnd it controls that are now in place has been crucial in creating a warm climate politically motivated violence politically correct speech political dismissive talking points political fanaticism manufacturing racial tension for political gain pseudo science or feared lack of goal resources and the whole hell of a lot of fear mix up we have a whole held a lot of fighting going on [noise]\nI

about are Proud Boys antifa but there's also others and you know\nWe have to learn and we have to remember that there are two main dangers to liberty right now one that comes from the left and when that comes from the right and that is this bond receive from the Warren groups of the city's literally\nAdapting this blood Samantha back in time in Germany and Hitler was blue kites they call the book the kite balloons kite demeaning blood Senate meaning that the leaders would commit acts of accent of murder and violence and the others would follow suit\n\nAnd that's what's happening now we have a little blue ... going on\n\nIn in the deep state certainly is breathing this boots kite\nAnd we are\nHaving a little something called fascism and and ah and fighting a this is this is how we do terrorism American style is is that we do civil and civility or instability was reduced in civility uh American style\nI mean\nYou know the jak boots of course are coming from our own people now be enforced is their own people police show up I mean this kind of stand there and wait kind of a referee uh between the factions fighting\nBut here we are following in the footsteps of or well we're following the footsteps of do CFC we're following in the footsteps of all these guys who forewarned us\nThis way I mean given all we know about what's going on and given all we know about the new world order and what it's going to do and what the new I mean this is this is the example of new world order aid trade\nCitizens like faceless statistics and economic units we bought sold a barter traded in tracked\nIt lies the system why is it cheats it steals it spies it kills\nBreaks laws over reaches authority abuses its power almost every turn and they love to violent their empire so what they do is they create wars they they ah\nThey take over everything they they're swallowing up everything little by little\nSo we have is deep state that is a myth superpower ... worldwide deep state of global industrial the state and so it might get like you know network where uh the\nMid ... says there are no Russia's there are no countries there are no there is no west there's only one organized system systems and that's money and that's takeover and that's dominance\n\nAnd that's ... that's become becoming true you know conspiracy theory but it's becoming a a a true thing\nFor everybody\nAnd that's what's the most terrifying as it is it's very true ideology we we were first afraid of terrorists now are afraid of each other we're afraid of the rising up\nRising up all the middle eastern Paris now it's us that needs to be careful because you know we have a fourth of St that's failed us\nAnd and what they have they have these controls in place now would you be crucial in creating a warm climate of politically motivated violence may want you to speak politically correct speech politically the dismissive talking points political fanaticism I mean we manufacture racial tension we for fifty one people that we don't like\nWe burned the books in the same places we burn people\nAnd it's because of global establishment has risen up against the people and the people responded by radicalizing political ideology that by all intents and purposes is eating us from the inside out\n\nAnd we have a large number of people that always cannot be ... be happy with themselves and let's say pressure other ... other people into believing the whims of of of the deep state or believing the whims of this coercive solution or this course of project to get people angry at one another but see in the end\nIn the end we're all terrorists to one another all mean to one another somebody's going to step and say we got to clean house\n\nWe got to clean house we got to make this place say because everybody's at each other's throats that we got to go in and we got to get everybody to play nice we needed an intervention of some ...\nYou know we do that with other countries we did that with other countries\nIt it you know we always he always something going on in Iran or Iraq and we see a civil war we step in and we sending soldiers we tried to clear up the problem\nAnd how would you feel if we all are fighting like we are right now and China says you know what there's a problem we gotta send troops and take care of the United states and when they're done they're going to thank us for what they've done for them\nThat's how vulnerable we are that that's how fragile we are you realize is that if someone decides that we're just at each other's throats too much they decide they just wanna walk in and clean house they will\nBoy you won't like that will you will be fighting against one enemy or will be fighting amongst ourselves well there are coming in and
