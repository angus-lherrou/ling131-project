children in their care and also make sure that the grandparents maintain their own physical mental health and emotional wellbeing so this counts is going to develop a process that the public can provide comments and recommendations on\nBecause there's such a number of growing randomly he's out there and they expect that to continue unfortunately\nAnd again someone's just due to the population of older adults lots of it has to do with poverty substance abuse especially the current opioid epidemic\nThe death of grandchildren's a grand kids parents and extended military deployment which is

sure like your\nTV show where everything you're hearing and seeing seeing scripted your thoughts scattered from what you were doing before you start losing your concentration you feel a little nervous sometimes you feel agitated sometimes you feel aggravated an angry\nAnd she just want a moment of peace on your commute\nWere reading a book you were playing a game viewer just minding your own business and all of a sudden you see that jacket and trigger you started hearing the guys talking about the march\nI started hearing people talking about fascist and Nazi the KKK and police brutality and you're thinking\nGod you wonder if you're going mad\nYou realize you're trapped in the crossfire trigger words and phrases that are kept dancing in that last remaining nerve\nHasn't been afraid by

been provided for both the left in the right political ideologies through the media and through everything else I mean come on\nYou know\nIf you feel at any time you are being victimized by the script makers then you're not alone there are a lot of people were becoming fatigue over what George Orwell called double speak\nNow what is double speak well\nDouble speak actually disguises the nature of the truth giving new meaning the words with what appear to be scripted dialogue provided by the party and it's never ending ... propaganda\n\nMany people that never read the book Nineteen eighty four even animal farm by George Orwell usually are keen to quote few lines from the from the book they say things like well big brother's watching you and ... you know they they know a few things about the book\n\nI mean big brother's watching has been the mantra for paranoid everywhere and brothers watching me you ever get the feeling you're being watched yeah feeling of being watched my phone's tap your phones tap my phone step to wonder if they're monitoring my email yes they're monitoring your email you go crazy\n[laughter] [laughter] oh God\nThat's where we are now right whoever thought that in America we were talking about whether it being spied upon by our own government there were the surveillance state my God those are things I'm communist countries or that's what they do in fascist country that's right they do how did that happen to America\n[laughter] oh blame it on Trump played on Trump here's the thing\nA\nLittle truth boy\nIn Orwell's Nineteen eighty four big brother was not only watching you he also was capable of brainwashing you and scooping the drones groomed to follow the wishes of the ministry of love\nSee George Orwell was a British Intelligence officer and with his ability to see the possible future he predicted a totalitarian world where the government has corrupted the language forces citizen reachable even lives lives as they were truth\nA tracts everyone with ubiquitous tell us screens that are extent in every home place of business in public facility\n\nThat today\nWe have ... screens they are attached to everyone's hand they are virtually every communications devices they are the first thing we look at in the morning to the last thing we see at night\nThat global to tell a screen every time we want information is the voice of Siri\nOr several other assistance out there that can elect such ... it's about um like I was gonna say like so I don't want to trigger everybody's a Lexus\n[laughter] I was in the office the other day with my boss and he said something in a lecture goes what can you start talking to the Congress shut up a like size I was so angry biggest why the hell is this robot this ... this this\nThis this ... this is this is sympathetic AI why is it bought her a Nazi in our meeting I I had never had a sympathetic AI bother me at a very important meeting with my boss he has ... sitting in his office\n\nIt's all part of the programming process right they're listening in your eavesdropping but at the screen it's its programming the masses we have emails music means ah we have these hey I assistance with every algorithm\nWe are slowly being coerced into following anything that seems to be coddling are confirmation bias\n\nThis process where not only beginning to wonder if someone is watching us\n\nWe are also noticing that somebody is scripted us or at least script and some people in the act like what are now being called non player character's\n[laughter]\nNon player chair and PCs non player care and PCs did you know and I was turned on to this by my guess who's coming on later\n[noise] NBC's or non player characters are the newest me that it appeared on Twitter and Facebook and they seem to be a form of counter propaganda against the liberal left\n\nThe popular NBC named trend frames it targets as non player characters reflect simply spout Neal Marxist axiom Z in response to real world events\nThis is a nice way of digging back\nAt the propaganda of every one calling one side racist one side not the one side this one side that outright Nazi storm front blah blah blah blah and stuff you always hear of your on that side if you're on the side of the other guys you must be a Nazi well that's the kind of stuff that they're doing they're coming up with a clever mean\nCovered in PC he's NBC's The cause of anger a lot of anger because those who see them feel they argue humanizing however I think that's the point [laughter] I mean\nThere clearly are being used to explain what we usually hear his program responses regarding things like fascism where it's like not see\n'em All right KKK all all the same stuff over time the NBC mean mocks leftists and expressionless in appearance they're like these ... that ... they they basically make everything look like a box\nOn line I mean it's basically it's designed to look like in a casual or a causal observer that this ... program\nSo I mean if if you see one of these in PCs they're they're pretty nondescript they're like [noise]\nI don't know how to describe me like plain face to die at a little noses smile or a straight face looking like [noise] zombie I guess it's just the simple way of saying [noise] are you a non player program are you in non player [laughter] it it's just a [noise] if you look forward look on line NBC\nMeans they can be seen in several Facebook pages in spreading quickly on Twitter read it in for channel\nThe trouble is this little\nSimple I mean this little simple counter

arrival of something called me and PC although NBC's have been around for a long time what they are really is the computer controls characters in video games and the problem\nWith it that they have these limited scripted responses like be show up when they go here try this or here here's line three or would you like to go here that's what it is it basically gives you an idea where you need to go now although I I don't know if there are any and PCs in Fort Night because I've been watching we in place for it I don't really know of any\nReal 'cause it's not like the squads are fighting everything else but I mean I can skyrim or fall out\nThere are characters that are known as NBC's they basically babble scripted responses they're limited they don't really do any me just give the parameters of the game\nSo that's why they call\nThat's why they're using this and PC me which is basically this nondescript looking character to describe those who repeat the script or the left and what we're talking about is is like for example\nYou know orange guy oh it's orange guy you know calling President Trump orange guy that's un PC term or um what's another one a dog President Trump doesn't like immigrants well why is his wife\nAn immigrant you know NBC or it's just a bunch of things where you you've heard them right like you know KKK everybody who's outright as KKK everybody who's the conservatives KKK or they're they're racist that's an NBC\n\nMeaning these people have a limited they have a limited fountain to draw from an hour's drive from the same things and they always say the same things to people who are trying to express themselves and it and even if you sound just a little bit on the right\nThe un PC left will come in and they'll say well they'll do that so that's why they're called NBC's may have caused a lot of anger\nUse those you see them feel that they're ... the humanizing well this is a humanizing us that's the point I mean yeah if you don't like the main create your own\nUh yeah it is better to the human I'd been basically saying you're robots your robots they're following a program and you're listening to the program\nAnd it goes on the other side too I have heard so many programs responses whenever you say anything that he was in this little bit of criticism to Donald Trump people go out Jared you he's a man of God and you like what\nHe's the president of United States he's not a man of God he's not the messiah he's not going to turn water into wine\nAlthough ... wine into something else but the catch [laughter] I'm just saying you can't do that for some reason in this country so that NBC name mocks the left basically making them out to be expression listed appearance by like in behavior\nI mean that's one of a causal observers right they just stand there occasionally say oh this is the door\nMake all up here it's like it's like being one of those talking maps make a left three hundred feet ... that's kind of a an NBC it's kind of giving you directions that doesn't have the limited script\nThey even have documents that I signed for home equity loan only I didn't what a nightmare\nShe's the victim of a

stuff going on and what is what's happening in Portland well you know it's going to happen where you live too because I mean you have to consider that the narrative or is responsible for\nThis reality redo we're going through a retro causality creating conspiracy theories that really are more than theories but attempts to somehow put reality into prospective without letting anyone know but secretly tucked away and all of our utility drawers he's a tin foil hat that will probably where it because we know that no one truly lives of the universe is fully objective\n\nI mean what we're seeing limited concepts of time we're hearing about how there are different\nDimensions we're hearing about their different ways of thinking we're hearing that you know we're hearing in the quantum immortality I mean science is basically going all\nParanormal\nAnd they want to quantify all the paranormal and its scientific ways scientific way like ah they want to be halfway with their religion and they want to eat half way with the conscious that they want to do parents ... and this is where I was looking for about how\nHere we are going to ship this ... this was a major paradigm shift and we have a temporal blind spot in some regard because events happened or we perceive they do and then\nLater we're schooled on the idea of it everything we're perceived\nAs wrong\nAnd what we think we know it was done exactly what is in that somehow we reach a point\nWhere we're satisfied with their opinion and then all\nIt's based on his bowl nebulous stimuli we all agree to this and it's like this is my opinion and this is my truth and you say\nWell it's not true if it's just what you think it is see it's all about your selective perception\nAnd we know that selective perception is necessary because we didn't have selective perception we wouldn't be transfixed by the hyper reality and sensory overload we're now getting today our brains are being filled with all sorts of sensory overload thing about it we have simple perceptions of light lifelike love survival spirituality God you know\nAnd then we're exposed to media print television Internet videogames cell phones many other things that you know that are pushing the brain further and further\nAnd all that stimulus his place in a limited area known right there than compartmentalized area called the brain we don't know if the brain is limitless and we have we've learned that in old age would boost memory\nAnd we lose perception of time I mean the brain can be objective it chooses to however it's emotion that is driving these guys and so there's this war going on between the brain and subjective experience\nAnd this is what they call the explanatory gap where we've had to bridge the brain conscious is experienced emotion critical announces we're struggling with primary consciousness right now where we wonder if the experiences worth feeling it all we get this shoveled in this disenchanted experiences and feelings we get now are both natural and organic\n\nAnd of course now we experienced a virtual meeting hyper reality from electronic allusion it's unfortunate that we're seeing more and more people responding\nTo the electronic illusion they're becoming a non player they're becoming a person who just sits there and watch it watch things or you know go in front of them they they they decide that you know it's better to read the script that it is to follow that follow their own hearts and follow their own minds\nSo there are a lot of people that are getting for the right now\nOver what George Orwell called double speak double speak actually disguises the nature of the truth giving new meaning to words with what appeared to be scripted dialogue and it's provided by the party and it's never ending propaganda that keeps pushing and pushing and pushing\nSee many people who live there not had the the time nor the guess desire to read the book Nineteen eighty four\nOr by George Orwell usually but you know they say things like a big brother's watching you ride ha ha ha you know or you know ignorance is strength or you know that kind of stuff they they know a few lines right\nBut big brother was not only watching in Orwell's dystopian he was capable of brainwashing and skipping the drones or groom to follow the which is the ministry of love\nThe\nGeorge Orwell was a British Intelligence officer and with his ability to see the possible future he predicted a totalitarian world where the government had corrupted the language forced the citizenry to believe lies\nAs if they were truth and they were being tracked with a ubiquitous tell a screen that was basically extent in every home place in business and public facility today we are still the screens there attached to our hands\nThere and virtually every communication device so you're the first thing we look at in the morning there the last thing we see at night\n\nThey are programming the masses with

again I Know you noticed she's she's been coughing and they've been getting it on on on\nOn TV lately\nAnd the thing is is that this all goes back to Pepe the frog which\nWas a character that they were using to a ... that was I guess a precursor to the un PC\nAnd they're saying you're you are at being with the fabric of reality this is black magic please stop you are\n... with powers you don't understand if you keep this up you could miss all out of existence [laughter] Chris geo I I mean is this a form of black\nMagic I mean I thought about that you know I never did talk about Pepe the frog and the reason why is because I knew exactly the frog represented a lot of people have mixed mixed feelings about Pepe ... was another one of these meetings where they used Pepe to represent a lot of things from racism to what have you and it was kind of a ... he was just a stupid frog but it was a menacing\nWas a medicine type of me now they have the monkey ill at this balding it looks like a actually one of the characters that I was too crowded it kind of dreamed up\nWell you know what's interesting is um it's central magic as you mentioned before and essential is when an outcome Mr Black magician will\nTake a series of letters or symbols\nAnd you may not necessarily recognize them but I noticed that this Pepe the frog guy he\nWas he was drawn very strangely just like these

with a similar type of symbol\nIt's being blasted on the human consciousness 'em over and over and over again\nAs a matter of fact I'm Crowley had a spell that he used to do and this was something that he was very famous for him he used to be able to take control of the body of one of these and PCs and he was why there's a story of him walking down the street with a some prime minister or something like that and he says watch this\nAnd he points to the guy in front of him any needles down and the guy in front of him starts kneeling down almost as he is controlling them like a puppet\nNow if one person can do this and matching what's going on through the Internet through the mainstream media so on and so forth and people have lost their ability to think I mean if I can take a political here for just a moment I'm coming into this\nSelection I've just been so jaded by the oligarchy that we've had that I thought I was just going to be the same BS coming through the pike and then when Trump got it I was still a little skeptical but I'm looking at Trump and thinking wow I Can't find any fault in this guy\nI mean you know I don't agree with everything he does but considering what we've had in the past Trump is has actually done a really good job the only thing I can fault him for is that he likes to eat a steak well done with ketchup which to me I think should be an impeachable offense to ruin an outbreak like\nThat I mean you look at his behavior sometimes ... times but you know he's the president and I mean because it's an act that way before I mean Bush act like one Cheney was a bigger one I mean does that mean Cheney for president\nBut the thing is we're not voting at a personality were voting in somebody you can be the commander in chief and that's what I look at is we're not we you know everybody wants to have that swab personnel I mean we had that and we had that in spades with with the with a rock Obama bend to saying it was just something

I think that that that's what organic consciousness all feels on one level or another\nWho were we before we we can get\n'em so I have to believe that and then presumably realized that this whole divide between us has been systematically programs within the matrix to keep us fighting with each other yep well they continue to manifest all of these realities that they once but really to power lays inside each and every one of us to manifest our own reality\nAs I said before I had the CIA document in my hand called\n'em and now it's just an assessment of gateway process and it shows you how to manifest the reality around you so by realizing that we are in a matrix realizing that you have the power inside of you to manifest your own reality what I always tell people as we look at the the huge mountain it's in front of us\nYou know in the church or community and the media community you know all of that and we want to change the world but that's impossible we can't change the world all we can do\nIs just change ourselves but what we can do also is we can pick up a rock and move single rock and then we can show somebody else how to move another rock and pretty soon that entire amount and starts to change that strong\nLittle by little you know I always used to say I used to be a slogan a you know getting the truth about one minute time and it\nIt just seemed to me that that was you

that the dirty ugly truth but it's supposed to set us free but I say hey you know what what you find out it'll pick you up in the in the process so you got to be careful of what used to do what you

I come across book after book after book that's basically saying the exact same thing\nIn a very different language um but we're putting it all in modern terms it's\nIt's amazing I never would've thought that we would be breaking these levels of consciousness or that we would even be waking up to the holographic nature of reality but when science is backing it up ancient books are backing it up a now we have these means that are floating around and\nYou know these and PC mean sure they're being targeted to the left but each rooted in some kind of truth I mean it comes from somewhere and that's the reason why it spreads so so so heavily and the programming is breaking the them at the matrix is breaking and if I can get one more example of how the matrix is breaking\nInto glitches um we have all of these men tell effects where people legitimately believe that Luke IM your father existed in Star Wars I remember Lou ... her father mirror mirror on the wall um in Snow White doesn't exist in this timeline people look at it from timeline shifts and so on and so forth\nI Would say that it's updates coming from this artificial intelligence within the matrix that's hitting our brains\nAnd the update simply are not sticking anymore and so you have a big portion of the population that remembers ... things the way they were before the matrix was updated\nWell at the same time you had the MP sees that are being updated almost on a daily basis especially through\nThe data way states that they put themselves in when they're glued to the television are glued to the phone\nI mean it's getting so bad that they have baby bottles that you put your phone and so you don't have to look at your baby while you're feeding it you can just sit there and be in that data wave state while you're while you're feeding your baby so um it's it's splitting the Vail has\nSplit split right down the middle and consciousness is it's ... it's being revealed for what it is organic and non player character\nI Want to recommend a book and it's a book that if you were paying attention to is in the matrix in fact that the book where\nI remember those guys come to the door the one girl had the rabbits tattooed on her arm and he's looking for a big mess schooling or some sort of drug and eat and a meal has hidden in the book in his book ... the the drug and the book is called similar ... civil liquid and simulation it's a book by John ... yard\nAnd basically he's talking about this he said you know their relationships between reality symbols numbers", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "19"}
