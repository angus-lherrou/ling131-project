{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "I'm ending up with a you know six thousand square foot home I'm going to only four twenty at the end and also the value of the home at that time would be somewhere in the upper nine hundred to a million dollars\nWhat is the ah to go home so for ... and within a two or three block area of your house\nAbout the typical home and there's not really a typical home in our area it's\nAll over the place because the tourist properly there's [noise] you know Fifteen hundred square foot home than than there is also three million dollar homes across the street so I come from my home is about four four ten or twenty\nYeah that one when I was asking I was trying to determine if you're trying to over build the neighborhood it doesn't sound like a no causes scenario not an area that's got this wide diverse a price range and that doesn't mean cause I don't want you get building nine hundred thousand dollar home on a six hundred thousand dollar street\nRight you know and I couldn't get out and we do have a to point three million dollar home just right around the corner and then there's an eight hundred and Seventy catty corner to where I Am at you know one is the baby ... baby it'll do in the end of January\nOkay well sure when it started before then\nNo lower or have you go and play\nHave you got some plans for our own yet\n[laughter] yeah I I've been working on that with an architect um were were you know running around or or we want to do but or just um you know I've never spoken with any expert about this and I'm not sure if\nThis was a building you know I mean there's two or three factors one is um you don't want to build a neighborhood we've addressed that too is you want to seek in your family handle you know construction noise\nFor a whatever time it takes you to put this thing up and shouldn't be a nine day project maybe two or three months can they put up with that well they ought to be able to buy just sets that that's what we're going to do because moving is more disruptive than that\nBy and this project that we are considering doing just because of the the industry that I man or thinking of you know it's more like a fix one project so I mean we're we're considering adding almost four thousand square feet to the home\nOh wow you're just almost rebuilding another home\nWe had to basically tripling the size of the home now you know\nUh so you're going to end up a mortgage when you're done then\nWhy a bigger mortgage or maybe I think we're going to end up somewhere and the four twenty four thirty\nAnd what's your house I am\nHousehold income my my wife makes about ... about fifty five\nTo six grand a month and I'm self employed so very that can go from ... last year last year we were I was somewhere in the ... area\nOkay well you got to worry about her income and you can afford a mortgage on a Fifteen year fixed when you're done but basically what you're going to be doing here is getting a construction\nLoan and then you're going to um reset the construction alone in a permanent mortgage is almost like you're building a house correct\nAnd you can email you when you're done you need a fully you need a regular\nFifteen year fixed rate mortgage or the payment there's no more than a force of your take home pay and if that's where you're going to end up and you've got a process to get there then yes I Would do that um I don't see any problem with it it's just a massive project and you're living next door to it um yeah that probably is going to take six months um\nMost of the time when I think of an addition I don't think about four thousand ... four thousand square foot addition to a Nineteen hundred square foot house to\nGender is with us in tech cannot Hi ginger how are you\nI'm doing All right good how can I I don't\nWant it now and my husband and I we have work constantly out ... and we finally paid off our market share our cars\nEverything everything we own our great we have so much I'm\nStill working that way are we have ... trying I thought OK already amount or a ... a year and me I'm a ... year ... my ...\nAnd up until now we have them play well now last night where they all that and\nIt died last month\nI get hit by we had been putting our income that we weren't at and saving living off of the security okay my question to you is when our retirement or one bite me a out mhm\nWhat are how expensive for a for a year when our income on security what do you think that much retiring and up next year\nYou know how old are you on how old are you I'm sixty six seven okay and how much do you have in your ...\nOkay in or out one we had a hundred and twenty out and our next to actually have a lot at another hundred thousand\nMhm okay that's two hundred and twenty thousand in a dish round numbers I mean if you made 'em ten percent or there'll be twenty two thousand dollars a year okay okay I figured you know\nAnd so if you're in ... and we did that if you invested in it did that and then you add your Social Security too that um I mean you're not going to be living lavishly\nUh I mean you you have a few thousand dollars a month live all but I mean you've got Fifteen hundred Eighteen hundred bucks a month coming up this money as we're talking about here and I'm ... and plus your Social Security and if you can live on those numbers then you can retire if you want to\nBut a ... that's not going to be an easy I mean it's not going to be retiring and luxury\nUh but you should have fairly low expenses because everything's paid off so that's good\nUm I Love for you to have another hundred in there anyway but if you can work a little bit more and knock it out that might be up not be a bad thing but\nIf you guys are just you know you're done and you want to you want to live on that that's fine but I Would not shut up of saying we're I'm draining down that two hundred and twenty systematically just to retire now because that's there's an end to that game called hunger and I don't want to get there\nYou don't want to destroy this ... so you just live off the gold and eggs only so whatever you know you sit down with your\nInvestment professional if you don't have one sit down with one of our smart buster pros and talk about investing there's two hundred and twenty thousand in a way that you do that creates an income that you can live off of that plus your Social Security\nAnd if you could do that then you're in a position to do it and\nUm but again it's not going to be um a a a luxurious retirement you're not traveling the world and uh you know and that kinda stuff on this income uh but but but I think you can do it it just a matter are you willing to live that frugally\nAnd put your budget together and say these are the numbers and I'm going to live on less than this and that's the only way we can retire and then again sit down with us more pressure pro click smart buster Ramsey
