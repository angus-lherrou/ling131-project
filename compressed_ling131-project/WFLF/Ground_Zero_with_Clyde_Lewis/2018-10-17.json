Fox News President Trump calling in another case him guilty until proven innocent\nReferring to the case of missing journalist ... show the harsh critic of the Saudi monarchy was last seen walking into the Saudi constantly than Istanbul three weeks ago the president saying he spoke to members of the Saudi royal family and they denied having anything to do\nWith it and there are also reports that Saudi Arabia are considering saying the agents who unauthorized mother actually kill ...\nDuring an interrogation gone wrong this wouldn't be a major breakthrough also ... shields the royal family from blaming next secretary Pompeo has to address I mean we're ... official and it is worth pointing out that all the details we have so far\nCome from the Turkish government and I said we have an investigation from both sides I think it's fair to say we can't jump to any conclusions ...\nBenjamin hall lenient Danville President Trump is like in Washington lawyer patchy alone ages surveys is next White House counsel to president telling the the newer plays Don McGahn was that he would leave after Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court\nHonduran officials respond to President Trump's threat to suspend aid a caravan of migrants continues to make its way to the ... the foreign\nMinistry of Honduras says the caravan is just political and is trying to upset the relationship between Honduras in the U.S [noise]\nConditions take place\nThis outbreak and the fact that it was so surprising in my opinion is proof the diseases are evolving into the FDA and the CDC or having a hard time keeping up with the evolution of diseases down I Would tell you that bacteria\nAntibiotic resistant bacteria is one of the biggest problems we're facing right now as a nation because many people are getting MRSA and other problems or a flesh eating disorders\nBut a warning went out\nAbout this increase in uh the AFL this acute awe blasted my light is\n\nThis has been a significant increase since twenty Seventeen\nAnd a worrying perpetuation of a disease which there is little understanding they don't know where it's coming from and why it's happening all the cases that were announced exceed you of being confirmed and twenty two states\nUh surges babbled help officials who announced a change in the way the agency is counting cases they also wanted to raise awareness about the conditions for the parents can seek medical care if their child develop symptoms and fill positions can quickly relate reports of the potential illness to the CDC\nBe increasing cases uh started happening in twenty fourteen the CDC was tracking this\nBut every year since then usually in August or September the CDC is logging a spike of it a spike of it's been ... virus but it it's a ... the ... the spikes you significantly high right now\nAre back in twenty Seventeen the C. D. C. reported that a child died\nFrom this disorder instance officials have been able to say I've been able to determine how the disease spreads\nThey're starting to count suspected cases as well as confirmed Jupiter anticipate increases over the coming months so uh I can tell you know it's too early\nTo know whether the total of twenty people surpass those previous years but the data is showing us substantially large numbers\nFor the previous month this year\nSo\nAnd and the bad thing is is there's no treatment for it\nLong term outcomes or a crap shoot\nAnd what happens is when evidence is you know and we were talking about things like equal and several lightest we're talking about all these other disorders that are certainly affect the brain and the nervous system this affects the nervous system especially with a specifically the spinal cord\n\nNeurological conditions like you to have a variety of causes such as viruses environmental toxins and genetic disorders among the cases under investigation\n\nAre basically there are five report it to the Maryland health officials in recent weeks a health department spokesman said that Maryland's first case was reported September twenty first known cases have been reporting Virginia or the district this year but there were three confirmed cases in Virginia and twenty sixteen and that's what health department officials have said\n\nNow we know that medical science is continually making rapid advances we've got new medications treatments all these things are developed\n\nAnd they're introduced at a rapid pace our with supply and demand I often come to play the possibility\nThat pharmaceutical companies can cut corners and they get very sloppy\n\nNow we're always assured that it might be at the age or buy health organizations that our system for screening\nUh is superior than most are are drug screening as superior than most are vaccine screenings are superior than most but now can be argued that I after Jay consequences are not necessarily the fault of the doctor but it may just be the fall of the manufacture of these medications or\nWhatever it is we're introducing to the system we're looking at a toxic environment of drugs you talk to the environment of vaccines kids are reactive them in various ways I don't think\nThe CDC or the FDR anyone would come forward and say that perhaps a vaccine caused this\n\nOr some other drug I mean we know\nOur biological systems are constantly evolving\n\nAnd it would go by scientific hypothesis we also surmise that disease causing organisms are evolving too\n\nAnd so this raises a lot of questions and a lot of eyebrows about whether or not treatments in pills they kill the ills are killing the patient or in this case\nCourting and Tara viruses that cannot be altered\nAnd like I you know we look at biological systems all biological systems ... disease causing organisms and and of course the victims of people they all they they evolve and they adapt sometimes they've all been adapted for\nCertain diseases don't bother them anymore they run its course it's kind of like a virus that runs its course it doesn't say it goes dormant for a while and then comes back with a vengeance but right now we need to start understanding the evolution of what is happening and how can make a big difference\n\nIn how we treat disease\nI mean the evolution of disease causing organisms they outpaced our ability to invent new treatments and it may even al ... or ability to ease pain and suffering\n\nAnd I can tell you that it it appears\n\nThe failures of the passive given wait for the most unexpected successes and some of those unexpected rises or rate raising him disease and biologically altered diseases as well\n\nNew problems of course in ... and this new paralyzing disease is harming our children\nAnd we know the accidents\nRelated to carry a medication in particular multiplied\n\nAnd we've begun to worry about health care and health care professional we we hear about drug induced I after Jenike artifacts\n\nWe hear about adverse effects or even adverse drug events we hear about adverse effects from vaccines and the minute you bring this up somebody says oh I didn't know you were the anti vaccine they start ridiculing you\n\nBut just thinking about all the accidents that all the mistakes that have been made\nWhen the pharmaceutical companies don't evolved with people and don't have all the ... would be a diseases that are coming on board now either we can say that this is all being plan\n\nWe can say that it's all being done for the call the aspects and for the for the eliminating the Fox but you're not helpless to fight it you're not helpless to stop it you're not help us to a new new things to make yourself better\n\nAnd and so we had available many things that they can put us uh in in a situation where we can build our immune systems we can build and we can build all sorts of things that we just know\nThe right things to eat the right things to do is write supplements to take the right drugs I mean\nI I worry now because uh I've heard before\nWe were hearing about the the biological weapons we're hearing about the biological attacks we were hearing about\nMosquitoes actually infecting people and giving them you know equine and several light is or giving them some sort of ah eastern equine suffer white as for some other a disease that affects\nThe spinal cord with a brain or hemorrhaging or what have you and I don't think anybody is is pushing the pandemic button yet\nAlthough we are right now\nAt the doorstep of the new flu season and I would hate to think that the virus would attack a child\nAnd give them an ... virus a polio and on polio internal virus to paralyze them\nAnd so a word of warning that it just seems to me the diseases\nAre evolving now whether we're giving them the point where whether or not we're giving them the push is another story whether or not environment is giving them to push is another story whether or not drugs or after genetic artifacts or things of that nature pushing it but it just seems to be more and more\n... these cases seemed to happen more and more in the flue last year killed eighty thousand people eighty thousand people [noise]\nIt was because of an ineffective vaccine and a lot of people who took the vaccine or got the vaccine were the ones who saw the flu evolved into a very deadly form of pneumonia [laughter]\nAnd kill people killed eighty thousand people last year that is a lot of people to be having die from simple flew [noise] and I worry about these children that are getting these polio viruses [noise] but he's totally like attacks\nAnd the CDC and the FDA and all these other groups don't understand how they can treated or get rid of it [noise]\nIt's once again a history of evolved pathogens evolve viruses evolve diseases that we have not evolved\nAnd gone and so there's a lot of [noise]\nThere's a lot of a worry and suspicion about what is happening in Tripoli six seven three three seven hundred that's AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis [noise]\nUlysses ground zero\nAnd we'll be back started here a day when good morning Orlando sixty nine AM on news radio Ninety three point one\nUm\nWest Nile virus is not causing this way of a rule that ruled out west Nile\nUm\nBut the ... some virus that starts out as the respiratory illness so we have this respiratory illnesses sets in so it's like having the flu and then suddenly you start noticing that your children cannot control their arms and legs\n\nAnd so they don't have a pathogen identified yet that consistently being detected\nInpatient spinal fluid with regard to FM\n\nSo it all goes back to the same old same old idea of washing the hands staying up to a\nYou know is basically wash their hands using insect repellent is this is the thing that's interesting they were saying you must you'd order to prevent this we we suggest the use mosquito repellent\nSo what does it tell you [laughter] well what does that tell you it tells you that this is this is probably being spread by mosquitoes the very thing that we said we'd be responsible for a biological attack on the country or one of the very few things will be used for a again a function exercise would be mosquitoes\nA Bill Gates released mosquitoes one time in a in a meeting that he had a Ted Talk to demonstrate how mosquitoes are more dangerous than sharks\nAnd so once again it's the idea that\nYou know we're we're in the middle of it evolving it's evolving\nPap legitimacy to balding diseases have all the\nUm evolving drugs and and having to having to prevent things but we have to have well I called prophylactic ... protection what you mean to protect us from the beginning or protect your children from the beginning from what it is it's coming [noise] and it's just something that most certainly wouldn't want your children to go through\nTo really fix every three thirty seven hundred that's troubling six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nAre we watching the evolution of diseases\nAnd is the pharmaceutical companies are are the pharmaceutical companies evolving with those diseases I don't believe they are\nI think that they are at a loss for a lot of things eighty thousand people dead from the flu last year I think is proof of bad trouble eat six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six Seventy three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nThis

record for hospital [laughter]\nCrowded [noise]\nWhy I laughed\nTo drink plenty of like\nI'm quite Lewis\nYour let's say the ground zero that it was called and I believe six seven three thirty seven hundred\nThe pharmaceutical companies are not keeping up\nWith the evolution of diseases and they're not keeping up with pain and how pain is evolving as well so what they've done is teaming up with advertising agencies they're creating public service announcements\nAnd they're and they're basically pushing\nCertain attitudes ideas about vaccines and drugs now selling that you you know ... it's trying to sell trying to sell your ability to heal yourself and the reason why is because I think as we speculated last year\n... bio labs have created these new superbug superbug super diseases evolve into something else we have a respiratory viruses out turning into an ... virus we have a flu virus that turns into a pneumonia that kills people\n\nOkay\nAnd so everyone working in the pharmaceutical industry cannot help but notice that it's undergoing a vigorous evolution we're going through an evolutionary period that only for health but for the pharmaceutical companies and much has been written about how you know pharmaceutical companies will need to change in how they are offering the\nPublic uh ineffective drugs ineffective vaccines ineffective ineffective I after Jenike artifacts basically where the cure kills you know CBO affects instead of plus the boats do see boats no benefit at all\nAnd show which is why I I think it's important we should talk about this\nWe should bring this up because I I think that a a word of warning should go out\n\nAnd if you have you ever have you have a compromised immune system\nI Would say use your judgment and and and perhaps use your better judgment maybe get a flu vaccine I I'm not sure I don't think a flu vaccine is for everyone but after when I read about what happened last year and how people who've gotten the flu vaccine eventually had a flu that evolved into something else\nI'd be really really really suspicious of this because you can't sue the pharmaceutical company\nRock Obama put that into law who's Baxter International course was one of his major contributors and back to international course makes the flu vaccine several other vaccines that of course we're being pimped in pushed on the American people for the longest time\n\nNow here we are with everything they tell us get your vaccine get does get ... get busy and nothing's working\n\nYou know none of our children are now getting ... viruses non polio internal viruses where they first start out as a respiratory illness and then they're paralyzed same thing with the ... as you start getting assuming a sick this isn't your paralyze me to gain a function exercises where people are getting rice in sent to them\nWhere they end up getting sick and and they end up uh you know it's like\nWe're we're in the middle of this right now we don't even realize it's happening but the CDC says well this is happy we don't know what to do but will tell you about to watch your kids to make sure they don't take up the symptoms and get them an owned by the way the way to prevent it put on something put on some sort of a mosquito repellent so they don't get bitten by mosquitoes\nBet you speak volumes to everybody shouldn't it especially when we talked about this before and how it's being done\n\nThe mainstream as I can report this to you they're just not\nI mean they'll report it probably eventually but Dr reported like were reporting it and they haven't been following it says we've been following the Kleenex exercise from the beginning to what has been happening slowly but surely the gain a punctured exercise viewed everybody's sick

it looks like Roseanne by the way Roseanne pretty die [noise]\nAnd I knew she was going to die the way she was going to die because they want\nTo make opioid epidemic or an opioid overdose a moral

companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders\nSlowly but surely she was like all biological systems so disease causing organisms admitted victims evolved it happens that's how it is and we notice it's with the uh the change in the flue last year or the flu mutated into something you know like um pneumonia some ...\n\nAh [noise]\nWe look back at some of the medications that have been used by the public that have led to\nA lot of bad effects that Philip am I a situation in the Nineteen sixties I Believe was one of the perfect examples of a sedative ... it was anti ... medication medication pregnant women were taking in pregnant women who use the drug costs serious congenital Mao formations and their babies\nNow today they're still drugs that are on the shelves right now but when misused or when they're taken responsibly can cause accidents and you can get anything from the justice intolerance a dying and that's why they call it I after ... artifacts\nAnd physical dependents can happen with the chronic use of any drug including many prescription drugs you would have taken his instructed physical dependence in of itself is not constitute addiction but often accompanies addiction\nAnd it stinks in many people cannot or discern the distinction it's difficult to discern particularly prescribe\nPain medication switch the need for increasing do just dosages actually represents tolerance or worst thing underlying problem as opposed to the beginning of abuse or addiction\nI've always learned as a general rule but if you're taking a pill to kill the pain you're dependent if you're taking a pill after pain is gone you're addicted\nBut if you're taking your bills was directed in the paper says your body has gotten used to them overtime or the worst case scenario would be that the drug companies are doing the equivalent of watering down the alcohol and I've always talked about that as well be advocacy\nOf of a pain medications I Believe the yo yo wing of the dope I mean is what is causing\nOpioid crisis and so what we're getting is adverse effects were getting opposite expectations outcomes it becomes a no CBO effect\nSo called pandemic of opiate overuse may be seen as ... as a no see ... ... know see what effect itself tonight and I'm going to give us more there 'cause I don't really give a damn about the TV show it's called ah the Connors are used to be Roseanne\nOn ABC Roseanne he said that in the show they were going to kill her off\nThey were killing off the program a with an opioid overdose they did it they actually killed her off from an opioid overdose everybody said how does how do they know how do they know they're trying to cover up the fact that she's spoiled at for everybody weeks ago\nAnd I basically had said well if you're following the Roseanne program she was actually are in need of a knee surgery in the show\nAnd it she'd been taking pain pills from friends and others and having a stash around the house so he was a given\nThat it would kill her off by giving her an opioid overdose and see this is the thing that bothers me about the opioid the opioid problem in the opioid overdose in and out the opioid up\nOverdose scares that they're giving everybody that is if you are addicted or if you overdose\nOn pain medications it's a moral failing\nPeople will have you believe it's a moral failing of propaganda will have you believe that you're ... you're an addict\nWhen you're not\nAnd so the killing off of Roseanne with an opioid overdose in my opinion is exactly what they were expecting is exactly what was going to happen\nAnd uh and that's why it was done so tonight I wanted to bring on a friend of mine who uh I've I'm I'm not sure we haven't had him on a long time\nBeen Fuchs and he's

so so ban I mean what is it with a propaganda but when the world today making people who are using pills for paying give give making them\nA treating them like moral a pariah I that's what they did when Roseanne denied they actually killed her off the TV show a said she had opioid addiction and she died of an opioid overdose boy what why are they\nDoing off her twenty six for you I answer a fool according to his father you know people are so silly ... it's just ridiculous how we had this idea\nThat uh we're okay to judge people or whatever their behaviors are OK to captains Persians on others\nOr whatever their behavior is back to the human body is hardwired to be addicted to substances as hard\nWired specially can be addictive substances that are already inherent in it and that's what opiates are they are analogs of bio chemicals that are already in your brain so when you take an oath and say that you have you have a pain problem and you take opiates an opiate tell what all immediately happen is your ... your brain was down regulate\nThe production of its own in ... and you'll in Athens become decision by taking artificial opiates you'll end up being the fission which we'll put you in a deficit state and if there's a there's a pills in Iraq right and the almost impossible to resist them\nNow I Know that I Know that we have a a sort of a psycho social context\nSurrounding the patient Dr relationship the patient foreign minister pharmacist relationship but I I think people tend to ignore the fact that you know right now if you're using opiates you become pretty much a ... you become a dark and NPR why we're what's that or\nYour award you're awarded the state yeah you belong said you belong to the medical model and that and they love that yeah\nWell now what are you going to do you're hooked on August ... you you have to go to the doctor you have to go to the pharmacist even if it even if it means of Dr pharmacist shopping\nYou ... your compound and become to be a part of the model paradigm once you get on and said that once you get on the drug ... shut illegal drugs too by the way that people get that's how dealers and and a drug drug dealers get you hooked on heroin\nWell and that's the truth or you know one of the thing I did a show one time about crocodile and it was interesting because ah I was talking about it was cheap heroin and many people that look very attractive to use this cheap heroin\nAnd uh I was saying you know be aware of crooked deal because your kids may be using it and blah blah blah blah blah and boy did I have an education I had people calling me all over the country in their sixties and seventies\nSaying to me that they were addicted to heroin and that they are they're the ones that ... that the they worry about that the that uh they said you should be worried about grandma and grandpa or have gotten their pain pills taken away from them\nAnd they have to resort to using heroin or they have to get heroin and they get like a really low dose of heroin but if they can make cheap crooked deal in their kitchen maybe more than happy to do that get rid of their pain and the stories I heard were heartbreaking stories of like a guy\nCalled me and said I was in a motorcycle crash and I was in a lot of pain and the doctors gave me my medication and one day they just decided we were going to give it to me anymore\nAnd so I had to use heroin\nAnd I'm going wow you do that and I never thought because I always thought you know be where the kids taking drugs but no be where grandma and grandpa who aren't getting their pain medications that doctors don't know how to treat the pain\nIt's a terrible situation it's absolutely terrible situation as you our talking before a lot of it is based on the fact that we've created a society and we've created a culture that is conducive not not the physical damage the psychic pain to to ... pain and guess what opiates work on that too\nYou know it's not just work on physical pain they work on a spiritual pain on Hanks\nAnd now I ... I Believe as a pharmacist and this is really take part of our our addiction addiction problem is we are in hey we are such a ... a culture that rule or its its citizens for being alive or just citizens for participating in society we live in ...\nAnd just ... culture and our and our addictions are just a symptom of it\nSo what it is is that there's something missing doesn't that doesn't give us a I I like to use this raid the dope it means squirt if you will\nI caught reward Delaney square is what when you hit a job and your brain does yet the like you won the lottery it activates the reward center in the brain and we are inherently designed by a chemically by our nature to have this this yet the ceiling whatever we want in fact\nWe have to get the feeling when we reach for the door knob and open the door or you get a little hit a do I mean so we we have lots of things that we're supposed to be have a lot of the ways that we're supposed to be an actor doping square as you said but we've created a culture\nThat drives this and it's an incentive members the members as a society to living here yeah let her have it in ...\nBeds trauma they they they induced the right amount of trauma for the right amount of time and people need to find\nThat holds its missing in their heart and they're sold for like you say we were talking earlier about excess central pain [noise] this is something very real and something that I think everybody should be listening to tonight just to let you know the Connors air tonight on ABC used to be the Roseanne show and is Roseanne and predicted that killed her off for using an opioid overdose\nI guess it's a degree of penalty with drugs if you take a if you take a pain pill that's okay\nIf you if you take heroin your bad or if you are now you're bad but they're all they're all there for a reason right happened\nA client that there's some drugs became good in other drugs he came back I mean well how did that to her and what are they exactly for example marijuana how many people are in jail now because of marijuana but now or or jail today 'cause they were selling marijuana five Fifteen Years ago but today's okay\nToday in Colorado you can just you can buy marijuana just walk off the street by marijuana see what ... what\nGets me is that there is also people that are uneducated about what is legal what is it legal now with the use of cannabis of course the cat it was a schedule one and a lot of states federally but ah they have now are pretty much said that uh things like CBD oils and it brings to ride from hemp are not illegal and they can be used\nAs well how how well this prohibition where a quiet did not want her to do it's obvious it doesn't work it never worked\nYou'd want to do drugs what is the government to create a police state around people desire to uh intoxicating themselves you know animals like when talking themselves monkeys love ... love alcohol ... loves warning Laurie see\nEven and she was a marijuana plant and\nAnimal blood to change their reality actually considered by some people some research scientist to me a dry\nWell now now they want to bring back ...

and identified with Mexican immigrants and this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and\nA government got his great idea to a to a better\nWay than marijuana along with alcohol and we really complain about marijuana 'cause nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made up and they created the campaign around reefer madness this idea that if you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's just a funny movie now wasn't funny I'm calling from Madison talked about all the stuff\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is create something called the marijuana tax act which I don't know if you heard of that a marijuana tax act a ... put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana\nAnd they put a tax on marijuana ... didn't declare tried marijuana and taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... nations warrant drug they actually completely may marijuana illegal and it's been illegal ever set but the fact of the matter is is that\nPeople have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our draw our jails are ill with people who are they are simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing\nAnd like you said earlier we created at least a police state around are around people are just around people who simply want to get high whether
