there's a drinking game out there so please get your drinks ready\nWhen I was in South America and I lived there and I lived there in the middle of ... that we read in the middle of it was toward the end of their civil war there was there the dirty war but it was more of a civil war\nI saw civil war in a whole new light it was different than the two sided civil war we had in the Eighteen hundreds it was or something else he was civil war in contemporary time it was it was civil war in a in a in a major city\nWhen I say when the Saudis I'm sure many of you think that it's just some backward city in South America no it's it's actually a south America's Spain\nOr France or or it it had the feel of Italy or France or or Spain or any of the European cities it's it's an amazing city\nVery urban very er advanced but advanced technologies there because they tried to bow down there seemed to work down there they do they move up here sometimes it's the other way around\nAnd so the biggest concern\nFor a lot of Americans is what's going to happen to this country what was going on\nAnd when you speak of bike civil upheaval in civil war and you say to yourself well it's not there yet ... people would say quite it's not there yet but I'm Wondering you know duty know did they ever lived through one do we know what it's like to live in one\nAnd I said\nTo myself that maybe I've waited too long to talk about the reality and and and how we're smack dab in the middle of a reality that uh is out of control\n\nI mean we have new laws the executive orders that pretty much been able to president\nTo act with the emergency Powers Act I mean he could make plans any time to just\nArrest people you know and I've heard the rumors that that's probably in the works some sort of a\nArrest structure somehow they're going to go after they're just making the plans to see a big illegally go after people who have been creating problems in this country that would be a more or less involved with what I call this this this island or or this or you know very soft coup\nOr the the soft espionage or you know it's all it's all get soft espionage soft\nCoup other behaviors with or you know certain people\nAnd how uh you know they they try to say that it's a constitutional behavior when it's not I mean\nBut I Know that if you\nSay that if you say well maybe the president's planning on doing this he's planning on exposing all the way back to twenty sixteen some of the problems we have even during the Obama administration even before that the Bush administration or a response to that would be well here we have political sour grapes\nAnd with political sour grapes get political splinter groups and with political splinter groups you get the uh marginalizing fragmentation of our republic\n\nAnd believe it or not as the fragmentation of our republic that destroys that it will destroy us for sure\nAnd there will not be and there is not I repeat there is not a unanimous front\nAgainst an abusive government does unanimous front against ourselves\nAnd we're easily exploited easily exploited by political Jagger nuts that have been hijacked by neo\nCons anarchists socialist anti ... black lives I go down the list\nOkay and the media basically\nAll the American people like sheep and it being joiner is and what they're doing is they're basically encouraging what I call divisive colds\nAnd these groups do nothing to further the cause of change\nIt solves the entire process as it appears to be mired in nothing but fanaticism\n\nWere stuck in this Myra fanaticism is beyond protest signs and pepper spraying people camping in parks or a pepper spraying the homeless or what have you or feeling here in America\nIs that it's wise to have a gun\n\nOr everybody's saying the gun violence should be curbed that you should you know revisit the second amendment there are many people who say that that are still wanting armed\nSecurity and they think it's wise to be armed to have a gun concealed carry the overall feeling in the United states is if you don't have at least\nA gun\nThen you should have at least some stored food batteries radios you'll become swallowed up into the onslaught of attacks in the homeland from an unseen enemy but be unseen enemy has been seen we're identifying the enemy all the time the enemies within and the enemy is among all of us\n\nBack or what was it um yeah so a few years ago\nActually show this program I says I think it's wise to know and and find out just to your neighbors are\n\nAnd I said you know maybe we shouldn't organizer neighborhoods on her own or the or else someone will come in and do it for us\n\nBecause the cloud that hangs over the United states now\nIs it no group in safe unless it's legally armed organized openly advocating a return of more localized government state constitution rules against the federal government run amok um\nI remember it was a civil war of the Eighteen hundreds that brought us the bloodiest conflict on American soil and that was our first war veterans right there\nYou actually they were having Lincoln an Eighteen sixteen was the final straw for many southerners in an all eleven states or the ... states that the the seed it from the union for these Virginia Arkansas and North Carolina Tennessee\nDid not succeed until after the battle for Sumpter that occurred on April twelve Fifteen sixty one five additional states were border slave states\nThey didn't succeed from the union Missouri Kentucky West Virginia Maryland in Delaware now we're not talking about secession tonight I'm not even though there are a number of\nStates since that basically says they want it to you know form their own governments maybe like California's been what they want to separate the three states and in Texas has always been wanting to get out of the union and then they have a you know the constitution says they can\nBut Americans have been angry with government from from way back I mean\n... when Obama was president they wanted us to see now with Trump president they want us to see they want to but they say they want to move to Canada and all this other stuff and see now that's just trivial path that they like to spread out there to make themselves look important\nBut\nA lot of this has to do with the end of the the the thought that ah there's a part in the declaration of independence I want to jump to a historically an actor but I think it's um there's a I'm\nA part of the declaration of independence that says something that the

really yes liberals are doing it more so we're seeing more of the liberals doing it because of the unpopular votes and the unpopular choices that they don't particularly liked and yet they are going psychotic\nBut there are some been responding but are just a psychotic ... those are the right to responding so yes everyone\nIs driving a nail into the cockpit of America\nMore so one sided with the other teams actions that we're ... we're basically motivated by sure emotionally doubt been motivated by fearless rage it's beyond most you know it's all about rate and this is getting dangerous why that would be proven to tell people\nThat perhaps it's time to heal and choose our battles no one will listen because there are been debt is to be settled and revenge is a dish but his best serve cold in America\nYou whenever I speak of civil war ... civil of people in America I often get told that it will never get that bad Clyde and then I fear mongering for the sake of clicks or ratings or whatever you think I'm doing well I always say back\nTo people but it certainly cynics better there in order to keep telling yourself in America is still United however it appears that that ship has sailed and they're living through a civil war in South America can teach you what to expect and\nIt just a real experience but I talked about that in the first hour\nI mean I don't want to make it clear that during the civil war in a modern day at a modern city modern needs to be like when I ... I mean life was normal except for little things would make you wonder if you would make it through the day or if you will be able to do routine things I mean I can imagine the United states the civil war would be similar\n... that we have the Internet that's the difference the when the outbreak of a civil war in the United states would look all that different to the normal news cycle regularly you know and that's\nThe thing that I think people don't understand it doesn't look different than the normal news cycle and would they would regularly report it's the same thing I mean he begins with something like a politically motivated mass shooting\n\nAnother example would be a biological attack on the United states either in a major city or directed at Congress or to the president\n\nI Know I've talked about the final blow I don't know if that was the final blow but it's certainly send the ball rolling\nBecause it was a political attack using rice and a poison that was aimed at certain people including the president the United states if they would have sent all that their members of Congress we would have had an attempt to the decapitation exercise\n\nWe all know that the anthrax attack happened in two thousand one after the nine eleven attacks\nSeattle we have the rights of the fact that happened just before the cabinet vote\n\nWe talked about the Russian each cult an al ... tried to use biological warfare is a way to get people not to vote or to somehow change the direction political you have an area here in in Oregon I mean these are simple politically motivated attacks\nAnd these attacks are usually supposed to not only change directions politically but they're also there to generate copycat attacks\nAnd\nThese can be both domestic terror attacks in foreign attacks whose sole purpose is generating a backlash they're simply done in order to provoke a response if the response is overwhelming and police department's going to keep up with a politically sectarian violence then we will see the next phase of civil warfare\nAnd that is the domino effect if there is an insurgent\nAnd the domino effect is in play military crackdown on any kind of insurgency will be inevitable this will be your martial law scenario except it will either be the military working within already militarized police or the police working against the military\n\nThere also be restrained to start with how or if there is an insurgency there will be some re straight at first but then the insurgency military weapons martial law all these things can be applied to a situation I\nDon't know if that'll go that far but it can be applied I mean there's a misconception that in a modern civil war there'll be two sides\n\nAnd the reason why we think is is because we look back in history and we all know that it was the union believed to be into less slavery and the confederation really being more slavery but most people are thinking right now but if there was a civil war in the United states it would be two sided and that's it\n\nLike Republican against Democrat conserve against liberal no on how it's gonna be\n... with civil war will be in the United states if this happens you know it's not\nModern civil war would have many so called side's seeing the dirty war South America there were several sides that we're fighting there were the parent is kind of nice there's the radicals are out of college the communist common east is the Nazis the Catholic Church the Jews sewn into the police\nThe moderate plaza I could go down all the list of who are

things going on and no one's going to call it it's a civil war I mean what what what do you expect that\nShow if you compare it to our first so\nOur civil war was the first civil war this is Don unconventional what you want a Confederate in a union you're not you don't get a get it it's not going to conventional is the way civil wars are fought in the twenty first century\nWell I think a President Trump acknowledged it when he referred to the angry mobs and\nOh well that's another thing you know civil war President Trump has no power let's he wants to enforce a sedition what'd you

same way it starts the domino effect if one person decides to harass another person or another person or another but it all happens\nIt happens it happens I mean you know a ... wouldn't mind Maxine Waters said to harass people she should have been taken in and she should have been talked too but she didn't she got away with it and now people are doing it\nWell Maxine Waters and uh what's the guy's name Corey Booker or something like that Cory\nLet her know but anybody who sit there and encourages this type of a yes\nThey've been encouraging this type yeah anger\nYou know immediately to the media doesn't to encourage you to\nWell I I think it could lead to assassinations because\nIf you look in our past oh remember we used to have abortion doctors that were assassinated mhm and and this is the level of hatred that we're at right now\nThat it you know if you're confronting somebody in a restaurant or at their whole who's to say that they don't have a gun and they're not going to
