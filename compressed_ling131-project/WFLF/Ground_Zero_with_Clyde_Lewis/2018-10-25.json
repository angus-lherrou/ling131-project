{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "Right okay so your question is what\nUh what can I Do they try to help him get on the right track as well as making sure I'm preparing myself for my financial future so I don't end up and and what he does yeah he's an\nOkay well I think you're already preparing yourself for your financial futures Seventeen years old you actually know the day Ramsey show exist go figure\nSo I mean that that alone is is um put your way ahead of the game or most people so you know what to do and and and you're obviously observe some things you don't want to replicate from your dad even though there's probably some things that he does that are good\nThings not necessarily the money but but and he's probably got some good traits that you do have a really Kate and carry forward [noise] um so uh um\nWell the first thing is is that you learn to stay on a budget you learn to stay out of debt you learn to save money for emergencies and invest for the long term\nYou don't spend more than you make 'em you don't get credit cards and carry them around so that's how you prepare for your future and obviously you're gonna have to handle your own a school\nAh and you know on the show you have a lot of work ahead of you but that's okay you'll be fine as far as you go now as far as him um there's not many men on the planet that will take financial advice from their Seventeen year old middle son\nAbsolutely\nYou have the powder bud syndrome want someone who's powdered your but they really don't want your opinion about money or sex so he's not looking for your advice even though he knows he's probably wrong uh so you're probably not the men to speak up and caused this to happen that's my guess\nShow what are we going to do well there's a couple of things you could do um one is is there a person in his life particularly another man that he respects is their\nBusiness ability their money ability or even they're just they're spiritual walk\nA well definitely our pastor and I pastor has tried helping them in the past but it seems like no matter who's talking to 'em or what or how they're trying to out and he just doesn't seem to either comprehend any of it or want to replicate any of it and he's very stubborn and being his own man\nMhm Mm well I think if I were you ever talk to your pasture again\nUm you know I I find people every day I've been doing this for a lot of years and I found people every day who\nTwo years ago ... wouldn't listen but now they list a five years ago they wouldn't listen but now they listen so all of us you know the stubbornness comes and goes with all of us and be in our own man comes and goes but\nIf the past or you know just a leans in and and I think I'm most pasture as if they're going to make an error it would be on the side of being too soft not too hard\nAnd so I might if I were you ask her past her to turn up the heat is just a little bit more\nAnd just spending time with your dad and push on your dad on this subject and not mentioned that you are involved because you're not involved\nYou can't fix it and you keep your mouth shut down you're not going to make things worse very true yeah because he's going to go you're going to do whatever he wants to do\nAnd and then you know at the end of having done everything you can do I mean you know if you wanted to give him a total money make over ... book or something you can do that but you have to be real\nI was thinking about doing that for like Christmas or something I Would just say this is something I read that I liked I thought you might enjoy it because you like business or something like that not like hey you're really fat here's a book on how to not be fat\n[laughter] that doesn't work right that's insulting you follow me\nSo you know instead you would just say are just kind of blow it off and make it not might not make it a big deal that it would change my life I Would feel so good if you would read there's no don't do any of that crap\nDismissed kind of keep it nonchalant just go hey I read this I thought you might like it because you like business stuff or something like ...\nAnd and just see if he picks it up he may throw it away he may put it on the coffee table as a coaster for the next two years and then open it we don't know how this was going to work but at least on their outside expert your pastor is an outside influence\nThat does have or could potentially have the credibility for him to listen to\nSome people aren't listening to anybody and so you have to be willing to go I Love my ...\nIn spite of his um incompetence than this one area of his life and I'm just going to be more is it's all I can do and uh you might you might do that your whole life you know he may go to his grave doing this\nAnd [noise] and show your love is not conditional upon you know whether you handle money well or not your respect for him there's not even conditional on that\nBut you're not gonna take financial advice from somebody that's misbehaving with money so he's not speaking to your life on money issues but that's all that's all\nYou know I don't speak into people's life I'm growing hair because I Can't seem to do it on top of my head\nSo I don't tell people how to grow here so if you can't do something you shouldn't tell people how to do it right\nYou shouldn't have any even have an opinion that is wild about it but people try all the time so just kind of keep that in the back of your mind or joy hey thanks for calling in open phones a triple eight eight to five five two

Orlando news radio Ninety three point one WFL a and I heard radio\n\nDo weeks ago we discussed the arch of bail the horn God bail we talked about the heart the arch was set up\nSo by the Washington DC mall\nAnd how it supposedly influenced\nOr at least have some influence over Washington DC during the cabinet urine or we've seen children's suffered out from paralyzing diseases it's simple illnesses killing them while we sleep\nWe've heard about sexual harassment sexual promiscuity sexual misconduct perversion all that stuff all part of the new streets\nSo it's about children being sacrificed children dying and sex\n... exactly what the ancient worshipers have bailed it they had or juice or they killed kids they kill children sold Invictus hoping that the sun would come back so they would it would bring children to\nThis God torn God they put\nThe baby or the child in the arms of this foreign gods ... fired its feet and then pull the lever and the baby would fall\nInto the fire\nBrings new meanings rocket bye baby doesn't rocket bye baby with the cradle falls that will come baby by kind of thing you said you know it's um it's a lot of darkness to the things we weren't as children we don't realize how dark it can get\nA\n... year of carbon gathering in New York to curse both Donald Trump or chief justice cabinet I\nMean who would even think that it would be part of the mainstream to say which is gathering from all over that area are banding together\nTo\nHer son Donald Trump but something more than a binding spell on Donald Trump cabinet though got the worst of it his was a harm spell\nHis was the harm spell\nAnd we had a cold writer Thomas shared it on the program exist Sherman in the cold writer and he said\nYou know he called us we're on with him he was in Ireland we were talking with him and he says these spells will somehow backfire\nAnd cause harm to America cause harm to the families cause harm to the children cause harm to America he said this is what will happen Paul ... last night remarkable show that was Paul ... appeared on the show to talk about the dark wave of parasitic demons\nThey were\n... whether he says are in fasting in the world's causing people to become possessed and acting like monsters to one another and while some people may not see a spiritual form of Armageddon taking place\nThere are those who see the material world crumbling would geopolitical tensions that went analyze you know when you analyze them thoroughly it would be considered civil war in other countries\nI mean they'd say well look at every ... we're on the outside looking into what's going on here we'd say ooh that country's in civil\nWar today I woke up uh with the news about these suspicious packages that allegedly contain pipe bombs were sent to the Clintons the Obamas and CNN's offices in New York and this happened today after George Soros it\nTo be out of suspected explosive device putting his mailbox\nWell this has created some mass hysteria and the news rooms that are predominantly left wing and and and and the the the left wing mouth pieces are simply speaking for the resistance now and it's all Trump's fault again\nBut this is happening it's got to turn down the rhetoric stop saying the news is fake all these they use the excuse is just ... I mean the attack is similar to but rice in biological attacks had happened before the cabinet decision was made it is I reported there would be a final blow\nEvent\nIt was certainly affect us remember I said that the final blow and I said it would be a biological attack and I was asked to be on the Alex Jones show and I declared there I said it will be a biological attack\nAnd when it happened I was suspicious of it because um it failed and and it didn't you know it was a biological scare okay\nThen I was thinking that this would be a trigger that would create copycat attacks so I was asked to go on the uh go up to begin to go into the ... one of the infowars again and Alex asked me what is next Clyde what do you think is going to happen next and I said well we're not have an event that would start a war footing in the United states\n\nAnd he said I agree I agree well today I was notified it'd be tempted bombings and was sent an email that featured in October third at twenty Eighteen article from the Daily Beast and this was a headline said Kevin are could be the final blow\nFor Democratic Senate everything happening around the issues the final blow\nIs about cabin on Senate war what comes with is asymmetrical leaves me they symmetrical attempts at a decapitation strike all is it appears to be perpetrated by deep intelligence conspirators within the opposite agencies and you can call it an inside job if you want\nBut in order declared a false flag which I hear everybody calling it there has to be a suspect in order for the accusation to stick to what I mean by that is we need\nTo see what they decide or who they decided to bring forward as a suspect in so far there is no suspect which it makes it even more suspicious that this\nUh this is a bad day false flag but if it's a false flag it'll pay it really did happen yes the pipe bombs were sent me didn't blow up any one but I Want to know who they decide dependent on and then we'll know just how keeping 'em any gaping\nHoles are are in the story there already gaping hole in the story now and I'm sure I'm not some guess on the\nPointed out we have um a few people that are well you know well versed in this stuff they're not conspiracy theorists they're very uh important people and you'll be hearing from in soon but the final blow issue you know whether or not you know we reached that point now I mean\nWhat does happen today I mean like I said you can call it an inside job I mean no Bob's were detonated it makes the entire attack a bit of political theater in order to create a terrorist bogeyman that attacks the left in order to gain sympathy for the vote and this is what they do and the third world you know they just in third world countries and most of the time the suspects are always traced to rogue intelligence or rogue military actors\nI mean like the guy who um fend for the rice and he was from Logan, Utah and I think it was an ex marine\nBut yeah rogue military actors are rogue intelligence actors that do that somebody who was involved with intelligence or military uh is usually the suspect they they they choose or they they use a scapegoat or a Patsy and this is where the false flag starts to ... starts to materialize\nMean these extra always carried out for what are called decapitation strikes which of course is a military strategy\nWhich is aimed at removing the leadership or command and control of what is perceived to be a hospital government or group so it's a tactic of civil war or strategist with other government plot to eliminate military generals or even political leadership now if you recall the rice and attacks\nWere aimed at the president and military leaders and the latest bomb attacks are aimed at Democrats who are former leaders\n\nSo this is a tit for tat exercise this is the copycat exercise this is part of the final blow affect\nIt all started back when Kavanaugh was appointed chief justice it all started the you know and it it it it lingers\nBecause of the fact that there is is is Hillary Clinton said she said something the effect how can you be civil to a government and the civility we'll come back if you just allow us our positions in the Senate\nAnd Donald Trump says well no there's going to be violence if if ah no matter what happens the violence\nIs happening and I still argue that if if we were looking in on a country doing what we're doing we would call it a civil war\nI mean thing about it you got people in the streets that are fighting with one another and you've got you know presidents and generals getting sent poison in the mail you're getting pipe bombs and and I don't know if they were even capable of exploding when you get pipe bombs or what looked like pipe bomb sent to officials\nNow how are they able to do all the addresses these officials were to send them and how to send them\nThere are a lot of give away is here to tell me that somebody is not very bright and then it looked at some of the ... of the ... or or the ... if you want to [laughter] what are the bombs below 'cause if you will uh the bombs below HP's better there don't have any post mark on them\nAnd it's like how can you get a pipe bomb through um the male when we can't even get damn CD you aren't patriot on good subscribers right Ron\n[noise] granted I have had such a heartache would we sent montage CDs [noise]\nSo you are a patriotic subscribers [noise]\nThey never get to where they get all hatched up or eaten up I mean how did a pipe bomb ... true that that ... what I Want to know [noise]\nAnd how to get through with no postage enjoying it I mean we know postage stamps or or whatever it doesn't make any sense [noise] it was all\n\nNone of the devices went off their lethality has not yet been confirmed by bomb technicians we have not heard the lethality of of these so called bombs other pets wouldn't disclose a drink any of the press conferences exactly what was in the packages they said well it's consistent with the other packages let's just put it that way\nSo we have the investigation is ongoing of so many\nCrazy things have been done a lot of what we call security theater happening I heard something about New York and the national guard being called out why how's that going to prevent the mail from\nRefining its ... it's just I just find it interesting now do you remember back when we were doing the Russian report\nRemember that remember that I was talking about the rice report and how it's going to you know all those people that I said wow this is a biological attack I guess I I I predicted and I was all over it and I was reporting it there was not really that much of any type of reporting going on in the mainstream\nFrom CNN or or or MSNBC or any group I I Know the Fox was all over because this was an attack on the president\nBut now this has happened to democratic leaders this has got you know this has got the most attention I've ever seen and the truth is\nIs that the rice and that was sent to these uh to the mail rooms with these leaders was activity could've poison someone and made a few staff members of Ted Cruz's opposite sick\nBut not one of these bombs went off\nSo they were sending a a pipe bomb with the triggering mechanism on it you know they weren't there those those bombs were there to take anybody out there were there to scare people they were they were they were basically scare type of of tools they were there do ah they weren't there to a a kill anyone\nAnd uh and so that raises my my eyebrows just a little bit but I also saw the John\nBrennan or ... or bumble oh they they said the bomb below John Brennan Time Warner CNN ten Columbus Circle New York New York just sit there\nAnd apparently all we have are just maybe six stamps there are no post marks on the\nOn the package so I'm Wondering if it was courier hand delivered or what [noise]\nIt just there's so many things that\nI have to get to tonight to make this a thorough report as one of those situations where\nI wanted to get on with Halloween and uh I'm\nI'm committed to getting the story tonight I got gas and everything lined up at the store do about what's happening what's really happening and what to think about here what this is meaning for all of us so say would be to nine and a like to hear from you as well your thoughts on this trip believe six seven three thirty seven hundred\nTripoli fix it with three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero we'll be back he left that lay\nOffs News I'm Carmen Roberts the FBI confirms ... second suspicious package address to a democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters is similar to find other than to Democrats and former CIA director John Brennan at CNN and President Trump tells a rally in Wisconsin the federal government will find those responsible\n[noise]\nBringing however says the president is responsible for the hateful political climate\nOr

said knowing when you uh read headlines that are\nWell for example let me go here this is a headline I just shot a mainstream media blames Trump Alex Jones pipe bomb false flag infowars mid term as\nIt's like uh okay I Want to make some things clear and this is why I waited day usually went away to date 'cause I don't want to go anywhere near Halloween with this nonsense I Want to do it on the same day but I Want to say this first and foremost local and federal ... would you look at local and federal authorities here\nThey're investigating this now\nThey have not commented on who the bomb maker was bomb makers may be they don't know what their motives would be I mean we can gas with their motives are\nTrump\nCondemned the X. today for the White House was it or not built for CNN no but he did a\nBut the whole lack of evidence the whole mystery I mean there are holes in the script\nI agree but\nYou know the fringe voices on both both right and left make this a prime opportunity for misinformation\nAnd uh\nYou know eight Chen or on the Internet said that something was going to go down in fact they said it was some sort of a plot to stay just shooting at a\nRally or something like that and that there was some sort of political stunt in the works up and even though you see the media going after chewing on and you go after all these others or you go after a Alex Jones\nThere are a lot of liberal people too and they're they're just as quick to pin the blame on Republicans without knowing anything about the barbers identity or motives\nYou know I saw ... do you own this GOP every last ugly I oughta but structure of our democracy you oh this this is insanity okay\nThat the other person a Philly eh Philippe rhyme who is actually a Clinton advisor said President Trump visits argue this is all about due process not thinking about the rice and attacks\n\nAnd know condemnation of the rights but that's you know President Trump was the target even with the generals were target\n\nThere's also some report of a bomb being sent to the White House there were no bumps into the White House\n\nCNN reported it and then of course CNN being the factual news organization they are we're wrong\nOkay and then of course governor pale and Sarah Palin she shared it wrong so I mean uh nothing happened but the home of the president it was all these democratic you know outspoken kick it when they're down ... they've got that stuff\nSo\nThis is the first and foremost thing that I Want to kind of cover as as soon as this is my job I guess to be a conspiracy analyst or misinformation buster take these bumbling hopes\nThe bomb scares all that this is going to create a perfect storm for misinformation\nI mean what you get and that I Am I'm being\nKind of an an a and

wake up call\nTo wake up call\nFor good I I I decided that I figured it'd be wise to turn some time over to a a good friend and informative the program we we ah we've had him a on before John ... and he's a veteran law enforcement officer over twenty five years\nWorked for the U.S Secret Service San Diego police department us been police US Customs service in his capacity within the secret service in Nineteen Seventy four the Nineteen Seventy seven he served for over three years John was directly involved the protection of the president first family the White House the vice president and his family and bastards embassies and has a stake\nThrough the experiences as well documented whistle blower within the U.S customs service regarding corruption management abuses John has been interviewed numerous times on television radio shows talk shows many newspapers nationwide ah affiliates regard ... vitally important issue since Nineteen Ninety five John Carmen welcome to ground zero\nGood to be back blood or are you doing today\nI'm doing great I just I I run into a a a I guess you could call it a quandary a kind of a confusion here because\nYou know when you jump on a story this soon especially something like this that appears to be\nA bear I say at an inside job but it inside job from the standpoint of who the players within the intelligence community is responsible for this you know people tend to want to play politics again with this and it's not it's it's an attack on the Republican we've had Republican a leadership being attacked with rice and we've had\nA congressman attempted assassination attempts throughout all these things going on and people are saying well since nobody died it's really not a civil war but no this is this this civil war would you agree\nThat those type of response as you're getting or for from the left for educators\nThey're just trying to throw a monkey wrench into your relation you are the four runner and if you are the best of the information I talked to and I'm telling you you're hitting so\nOn line with this stuff that's all they're left to do is to try and you know the people to tell other responses this stuff has been going on for years I mean I I keep thinking 'cause I was quoted in some other national magazines about uh some news will this\nSchool year ring a bell yeah a friend of mine Gary where this goes back\nAnd there was another reporter Gary Webb dead I mean how many hours you kill I say ... richest Gary Webb that's another reporter John ... I mean a copy editor anywhere all arrow yeah Danny capital narrow he he got killed I\nMean you did it on the legs this takes me back to the nineties\nWhen I was working close with my group for LAPD who helped expose John Dory show the CIA or the ... of the ... about the cocaine being infiltrated is black communities where the ... freeway Ross the rap for an area where\nI got a picture of me and Maxine Waters page on these two cars scripture dot com she didn't do anything to help us out really related Feinstein I'm Sorry there's a big D right after each of those names right right\nRight well where did you see we're just seeing how you know ... we had to be rising attacks just to just a little while ago and there wasn't much commotion with rice and the tax and even at a suspect within you know what a day or ... yeah\nYeah the um the uh miss using my words or the special being the rice and beans it's I'm seeing\nIt wasn't actually the process or being you know the castor bean that's right so when they're shoving a tons of castor\nBeans in the mail is like wow really I mean let's say hand but this goes back years so if you pick the part\nOf the stuff like you do and I do and I know rod those you sift through intelligence and information you guys are on top of this stuff and that that's good because that means that\nUh I don't have to explain too much but it's like with all my background and training I mean I was within two or three hundred yards of explosions at the Russian embassy or sixteenth street which is two to three blocks away from the White House of Venezuelan embassy ring a bell yeah yeah and also outside the White House\nA couple of times Seventy five Seventy six right around that time frame that was four and then\nSo are we to say is it safe to say that this has all the earmarks\nOf a criminal element within the intelligence operations that allowed this to go down to that was somehow\nPut together by um a number of aerobics I guess you'd call them rogue agents or I mean I hate to use the word deep say 'cause that's kind of you know he made a\nLeft wing left wing Democrat socialist or is this what you're saying is that we believe yeah that's what those guys are yeah\nOkay so you're ... so do you believe that that's what this was it was it was basically staged by what eight extreme left group\nThey're stressed out they don't have anywhere to throw a little arguments like Maxine you know block this block that they'll let them do this create a crowd or you know why it riot and also the ... I'm Sorry but that's a that's a felony and that's inciting riots\nWhat do you think though that you know I Know Donald Trump has been also raising the rhetoric and I find it weird that with all the rhetoric has been raised elsewhere immediately be seized upon Donald Trump Donald Trump is contributing Hillary Clinton actually contributed to this is why when she said well if you want civility you gotta put Democrats in the Senate\nAnd then Donald Trump said well if Republicans don't make the Senate there will be violence so you have the president saying there'll be violence you have a you know who the one who wanted to be president saying that there would be violence in the balance will continue until they get what we want\nNow we have bombs being sent to people I mean it's like why don't we get the equal opportunity to everybody that's inciting the violence and and actually encouraging it\nRight and they've had assassinations already already brought up Seth Rich I'm very familiar I was working on something that I'm not going to talk about\nUm there were some other cases where people were assassinated then um it's all tied in with the shooting at the fall or is he sees as a thing so all these things are excited but when they talk about violence and things like that there is a philosophy from the left\nThat it's okay to lose its a communist philosophy it's okay to lose half of your country or half of your population as long as you with\nJohn Carmen with us on ground zero for you know the former Secret Service us Secret Service for doing customs us employees or has background he also served the President Ford under President Ford and President Carter\nUh all kinds of other explosives ah syntax and his mother key words I won't use so that they can sniff it out those are high tech okay so they can ... it comes to sex addict X rays they can use other types of machines that as a ... or ...\nSo that there's a way to scan it is to focus too big they are going to open it for their going to look at possibly opening I've discovered packages right I said the British embassy in Washington DC to in the morning\nThey had to come out or TST tickled security explosive ordinance state would come out and they were for the Affordable X ray benefits really in doubt they'll take it carefully with a bomb a person who's properly dressed they'll put it in a special take and they'll we'll it off with the U.S army or something and exploded somewhat\nSee what I find interesting is that you were talking about the rudimentary nature of these bombs being sent out\nAn diet it kind of makes me wonder about that ah when what was it just a few weeks ago Venezuela or their leadership or someone tried to assassinate their leader and he tried to do it with a drone or just to find drawing they were going to use it to to kill the Leo yes\nAnd I think there are plenty of other ways but then see\nThat's why these pipe bombs I think are effective because they're there to scare\nThey weren't there to kill their their to scare and they're they're in my opinion a to a you know pork or at least change the views of elections and political moves is no different than when the uh uh the the by one rushed me she's in Oregon put salmonella in salad bars to make people sick so they wouldn't go out and vote\nThis is the same thing they did with before cabin out with the rice in ... the the and they get older the vote barrier to simply there to be distracted and it also happened now would be a just before the vote happening in November\n... did you get a look at the um a website I sent you was twenty four hours auto none of us weapons\nYeah bandleader autonomous weapons that are okay\nYeah three rats three grams or something like ... just used as a possible\nThen and then they throw him in the air thousands of them even just one and they had one that was a a different type over by the White House\nMonths and months ago and that's that's a violation of the air space over there but that's a separate discussion kind of just right at the same technology which means that they target you and it's got recognition on it\nThey can take your picture off the Internet and they could let it go in there and if you're in the area it'll zoom in and it'll attach itself or shoot that thing ready for\nThat Senate forget it they just taking a ton of his throat and he said it your way and then bam you're gone [noise]\nSimple ways of doing that there are a lot more I guess you call them advanced way he's doing is not that\nThis would have been good at Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred will be back on\nFox News on Carmen Roberts on national search for a bomb maker\nSo far the ... the devices have been what appear to be a pipe bomb it might\nBe counter terror director Jon Miller under Saddam packages CNN former CIA director John Brennan and Democrats including the Obama and Clinton were sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters President Trump calling for threats despicable\nWere extremely angry upset\nAbout what we went to this this morning and we will get to the bottom of\nThe suspicious packages weighing on stocks down for plunging six hundred and

[laughter] ...\n[noise]\n\nThe safety of the\nHis my highest absolute\n[laughter] I've just concluded a briefing with the FBI\nDepartment of Justice Department of homeland security and the U.S Secret

number to call then I come away six seven three thirty seven hundred and six seven three thirty seven hundred we interrupt Halloween [noise]\nOr what could be called in domestic terrorist attack [noise]\nMuch like the rice in attack was the domestic terrorist attack but ... nobody got even reported that they just\nGot a yawn data but people are telling me it was quite usually when reporting it yeah I was there was the only way to report it finally decided they'd reporting was all over the news the mainstream like two days later after they found a suspect but it wasn't\nIt wasn't as much hysteria as we have now because so many of the Democratic leaders were mailed these packages or the Obamas but the Clintons dead you know Eric Holder is Maxine Waters says she got one or so a number of people who have gotten ease and uh none of the bombs went off\nOr they said the one that CNN had some sort of a logo on it it looked like something from ISIS\nAh which basically was it was kind of a parody that says get her done I'm basically a ... this is all something that uh it sounds it it just got the earmarks of intelligence written all over at night and I'm going to make a prediction that if they find themselves back\nThere are certainly going to say that he had some connection to the FBI or the FBI knew the guy was going to plan on doing this I mean that's what always happens is that right John John crime and my guess been\nHere ... and you were just reminded me of a bunch of other things so because you know I it it just showed nearly job to be with for the White House and they said that his six\nYeah he was used as a field trip to Florida so\nThey've got their lists they've got people that they can use that they could just go over to tell them that go to this hotel sit\nThere and wait for focal and there's something there's or Pat's ... everything you're saying\nYeah I mean they had their Patsy they have the list they have you know a number of uh you know it does have a number of things that they have that they they can always go out and go out of each other and that kind of things so you know say you go if it's something that ah\nYou know they always seems to be a pattern I say there's a pattern where to go to the calls right now to go to Brian in about a high Brian you're on ground zero with John ... go ahead [noise]\nAll right turn down your radio Brian thank you hello [noise] one or two [noise] okay Brian turn down your radio [noise] I'm going to wait and see if he's getting figure it out [noise]\nAnd I were going to put him on hold yeah Brian is really smart we told me to turn down his radio and he didn't do it but if you go to art in Massachusetts I argue in ground zero\n[noise] are you on ground zero [noise] another\nOne that

that you know that people say that project protests that they say things going so far so they eat out so much and\nAnd at the end of the day what it will boil down to is the police state cracking down yet they're going to use this to clamp down on people like you on Alex Jones that don't care about\nThe the line of the the government and the establishment media they want to make sure that that people don't disagree with what they say anymore and it will give them the justification to crack down on people that are getting out there and telling the truth and then they're not telling line that the government once said\nYeah it is difficult for people to see a lot of people think in this country that we're too big to fail there were two big\nCivil wars are way more we are way more fragile than people at me look at the ... the velvet revolution in Ukraine Ukraine was relatively stable\nYeah back when I see happening this is like Ukraine you're very correct this is the same time\nJohn McCain talks to the neo Nazis and now they everybody here supposedly a neo Nazis\nThey use the neo Nazis there to destabilize now they're using you know that the leftist claiming that that we're not

are groups and so you know hey Soros rioters really you know when did you ever hear about stuff like that back in the fifties or sixties have right\nNow the question I have to is is that what is it always been situation where\nI guess Soros is the draft is kind of private no one really knows where he lives\nAnd yet they're evil yeah onto his house I I always wondered about that because you know I guess maybe his addresses common knowledge but I'd never really knew anything about George Soros we've kind of like that phantom and then when he gets a bumped into him do it right to his mailbox I'm thinking\nAll right that's interesting\nI'm sure somebody at Google that right yeah I mean ... can you really get that easy to get\nSomebody address like George Soros his address\nThat depends\nOn how much information 'cause most of those people don't even have a real regular address\nI used to represent the bodyguard work for a movie stars and stuff like that they usually go through their attorney so if you looked him up yesterday through attorney's office let's they actually give you a physical address which I've\nBeen given to go visit a somebody's house then that's different so unless somebody on the inside is given a law\nChances are came from these talks and unity to pause a false flag\nSo that they see for target I haven't heard anybody that were Republicans it's sort of you\nKnow but that was done with the rice and the fact that there was a rumor that the president got bumped into him but that was immediately taken at CNN actually reported that and uh they made a mistake there was no bumps into the White House\nWhich one I mean the president I mean it gets touched so they don't want you to know about ready to\nTrim it didn't ... didn't he get a bomb Cindy him for a while ago about ... of course\nI I ... through and actually had an assassination attempt across the street at Blair House that's part of our training then there was at least one White House

we\nUse is our cornerstone of law and order in this country\n\nWe trust our system of government enough that we abide by its outcomes even though we may disagree with them it's always been the case

his balanced and uh and and that's something\nI think we're lacking right now I mean we're writing off people because we disagree with them and that's nonsense\nIt Eighteen sixty one\nThere's only one time in our history meeting sixty one where\n\nWe distrust of the system so much that we decided to have a civil war or we had a civil war I don't know if we decided that the civil war broke out because we didn't agree it's such a disagreement about how our system is run and we have a ... we had a civil war\nThere was so much instability at that time the civil war broke out it wasn't declared he broke out there were divisions on on a on the front lines there were a you know border divisions and things of that nature it was clear cut as to what a civil war was back in the Eighteen sixties were not living in the Eighteen sixties Demi Moore America's instability\nIs increasingly an undercurrent in political discourse right now\nBut I Know it's difficult to see the civil war is happy because we always thought it would be an armed conflict that one day President Trump or whoever would step up to the pope and say what about your guns guys we're going to war here in this country\nWill be established with a battlefield America had already been proposed during the Obama administration is proposed by none other than John McCain who now is a political hero of the left for some reason\n\nWe always thought it would be an armed conflict where we would be shooting other Americans every day with the police would be forced to shoot Americans every day we're martial law would be declared\nAnd all that can happen but at the moment\nThe symptoms of civil war have not been diagnosed by the majority of the people and most of the diagnosis that you'd get about wars are from history not declared by the president but ... we'd be declared it'd be aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military\nIdentified illustrated the point by point sign post as to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on contemporary standards not the standards of Eighteen fixed\nDo it comes from history and I said sometimes you don't know what
