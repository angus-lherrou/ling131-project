I mean I assume you've got good healthcare coverage\nI Do but they won't cover it\nBecause I don't like talking about that I'm saying if you had a major health issue\nYou know that that would that lead up forty grand but it wouldn't really wouldn't I mean you to get through forty grand if you got you know the doctor both co pay it that's a lot and I thought that'd be a million dollar expense you know so I'd be very and I think you're okay at forty grand\n\nAnd if you declare that then we don't have to declare there's an emergency I'm I'm just process and this with you because I'm trying to figure out what to do it\n[noise] okay um\nAnd if you want to super emergency upon backup later you can do that but you don't have to feel like you've violated\nA ... a principal the process to do this then\nOkay that makes me feel better\nI think so yeah I think so have you got a good\nFriends or family or pasture some counseling you and\nWalking with you on the just the whole process on this from the decision making and everything\nYou know not doing this so what I've been told that don't have to worry about it but I Am [laughter] Bye bye good counsel was that what you're saying not necessarily good counsel but friends and family say oh you know\nIn front of me don't worry about that crap I'm Talking about somebody that loves you enough to look in your eyes and go really seriously what are you doing here I mean or or yes you should do this you know but it's not just a I mean if somebody really thinking this through with you're not just casually over coffee going\nGood accountability good counsel in the multitude of council there's safety and that's what I'm looking for but\nI don't I don't hear anything holding me back here in your situation very interesting question though very interesting situation thanks for calling in and we appreciate you being a lister Rami is with us in Columbia South Carolina isn't rummy rummy\nIt threw me high romey high how can I help\nYeah I um I wanted to reach out to you I was on recently called called by a\nKind of a a major insurance provider and they were trying to sell me on a farm insurance products so I'll let you know term insurance and uh with ability which I agreed with and that I needed and\nUm but I don't like the prices they quoted me were rather high so I went ahead and you know reached out to one of your recommendations and whatnot and got some uh some other coach there were a lot better ... and ah and reach back out to them and mentioned it to them and they had mentioned yeah well those are those are kind of like\nThat those insurance companies aren't good they're on their their ratings are high financial you want to go with the more higher expensive\nInsurance companies are going to they're going to be around in the next Twenty years\nYou know and I'm going to show you know I was like oh okay um so I Need to buy the basic discredited the Mercedes of insurance either by just said if you don't want to be in like a you know a Chevy yeah how do I wanted to get your thoughts on that well um\nThat's an absolutely ludicrous way to solve the objection okay there are financial ratings for life insurance companies if they do not meet a certain level of financial criteria the state that you're operating in will not allow them to sell insurance they're\nSo they're almost broke the state will let them sell in your state\nTo have to make minimum criteria to just financial solvency you to do that number one number two if you have terminal life insurance and your term life insurance company goes broke\nUnless you're sick and can't get insurance you just go buy more insurance it's kind of like if your car is your check to financial stability of your car insurance company lord no [laughter] right now they go broke you just go get another one\nYou know if you've got a recipe and progressive goes broke you just get a different one you don't think about this progressive have the money to pay my claim\nYou know but you can look I Am best ratings of someone at Zander insurances website and they are all financially solvent as much as this group or the ... on the other stuff that's a that's a complete learn of BS rum Rome is what it was\nOkay with that make you feel a lot better because I yeah I went ahead and went on the the less expensive option anyways it's like well I wouldn't because like I wouldn't do that for my family was like oh yeah\nYou know ... and by the way you called called me yeah [laughter] right right yeah that was when they call you that's one thing right there but [laughter]\nYeah if you are doing investments with them if you were doing the whole live life insurance with them which we don't recommend so you'd be a lot more social stability because you have a savings account there then\nThat's a lot more important than with them or like\n... times and senior executive producer of the day for him to show\nThis hour the show's over free to

remembering the dead or ... or offerings down November first you know the real ... you know we focus on the uh\nThe darker side on the thirty first and then of course November set aside for the sacred November first set aside for the sacred a lot of people forget that even though we see a lot of schools that a lot of you know that kind of ornate\nA type of decorations for you know all saints day or a day of the dead or did it was mark those people you know many cultures that belonged believe that\nCommunication with the daddies possible and throughout time\nMany people have claimed to speak to those who have shaken this mortal coil I experience CBP I've I've been in you know goes and goes Hans ... goes done subjects Thursday BP I felt what um\nI felt that uh to me\nSeemed like an attack by an entity um so uh I was on the year when it happened and um it was terrifying and I and I uh I always tell a story that when I was there and it was all going down\nUm\nI feel a little sick to my stomach because it was like a something was or some of these surrounding me and I could not break away from it and I started crying I was on the air when it happened\nBut I always tell people the reason why I was crying was not because of the fact I was scared I mean I knew that something was going on and it was like it was uncomfortable with the thought of not being able to say goodbye to your wife\nBecause I was in California and I was on the air and uh just the thought of not being able to see my wife\nAnd if it was going to be the end of me I I just thought it would be so devastating that um\nYou don't get a chance to say goodbye to both my mother and my father\n\nMy mother and her own little way had a chance to say goodbye to me before she passed away and my father said goodbye to me twenty minutes before he passed away\nOn the phone\nHe was in good spirits are just there was told that he'd have to have\n'em\nAs tube removed and it's a two was going to be removed to die and he didn't want to be\nResuscitated and so he passed away\nAnd uh you know a lot of people have had those moments where after a loved one has passed away they have contacts somehow in a dream or they seem in a crowd or some even have claimed to you know gotten a phone call\nAnd a lot of people of course you know\nThey say hey you know this happens but I never got maybe it's because I got the goodbyes from my my parents before they passed that some people aren't that lucky they don't have the goodbyes is so sometimes I'm sure\nAnd they say sixty percent of the time this happens is that most people you know come in contact with a dead loved one within days after they pass away that come to him in a dream or they appear to them in a room where you see them in a crowd or you know something indicates that there with you that their presence was there\nAnd\nYou know a lot of people say well there are new such things as ghosts will I I Would I Would beg to differ there's something about\nThe other side there's something about the spirit realm it's it's fascinating I mean go shores spirit and amount of communication they show up often in classic literature including mythology there in the Bible\nUm I remember Shakespeare utilize go a lot in his place\n\nAnd you all it back to uh go back to a Victorian England and it was fashionable then in many circles to conduct stances\n'em and they had ... boards back then I mean you go all the way back then they had something similar to read you a three legged tables candles\nA table tapping all those things they were used to try and contact the dead Edison actually Thomas Edison created a um he's tried to create a ... we could use reviewed contact the dad and what happened was instead of contacting the daddy he he created somebody can record the debt\n\nAnd what I mean by that is as we listen to a Jim Morrison album we know he's dead but we can still hear his voice Patsy Cline like a ghost us into her on a record and she's singing crazy\nIt's like you're listening to a ghost mean prince Michael Jackson are both gone but yeah we're hearing them on records they're like goes\nGoes on phonograph dose recorded for posterity something that Edison had done rather than communicating with that we are able to keep the dead in a bottle we can play them or listen to them or talk to them in that way\n\nAnd then of course there are those who say that they preserved a lot of what the dead thinking a lot of what the dead possessed by writing pages and pages\nOf what can be called automatic writing I mean the psychics hands allegedly guide the goes to convey these lengthy handwritten messages and sit since that time since the time of all the you know the communications\nYou know go seem to have lost their will or ability to writer even communicate effectively now so we have to use electronic voice for them we have these ... electronic voices and so the spirits can be channeled through mediums or they can be channeled through electronic means that can come through your computer or your phone and it was had this experience because we've done these shows about this before\n\nBut see a lot of the time\nWhen you're dealing with the spirit world to get this big nebulous information and always leads to\nInterpret it moment where the so called experience or the medium or whatever is given a word or science which is knocking or tapping that indicate that something from\nThe serial round\nWhich is to make some sort of contact now horror films they began to reflect the public's believe I'm concerned the contacting of a dead could not only be the gateway to a more simple ... neck romance the but invites possession by evil spirits\nYou remember The Exorcist I was actually watching the Internet on the Internet they look at the some of the scary moments in people's lives and they always talking about The Exorcist I mean talk about Reagan McNeil the little girl um she was first contacted through a seemingly innocent encounter with ...\nAnd the end of the she thought she was communicating with and who were mother chalked up to as an imaginary friend calls himself captain howdy\nBut later we reveal that he's the demon so so or the demon ... and what's interesting is that\nThe demon ... also\nKept in how to eat a lot of people after The

I'm just an average person\nBut I had some celebrities talking [noise] and they wanted the board and one lady who who son committed suicide had the board and she was rejected the board was just\nThe same image but I put it on would ... with ... you know what I made a coat copy ... [noise] and so I Would in a lot of people in Los Angeles used it in one very famous actress\nSunday killed himself and she reached down to us meaning me and my friend and I sent the board and she said she had spoken to him repeatedly and thanked me and she's a very famous ... now a convention or if you if\nYou know here go ahead who is the\nWay she was from that Dick Van Dyke show Mary Tyler Moore and she was very sweet very kind Rosemarie no she was Mary Tyler Moore Oh Mary Tyler Moore was on the Dick Van Dyke share show on her own show who's Mary Tyler Moore\nNow [noise] because she was very she was searching for ways to communicate\nAnd just understand so it is it so in other words what I'm saying is this ... not just the evil if you can ... you know to channel what you want\nI think Bob [noise] was naive and he put he put this together to talk to his victims and then you realize\nThey're going to come and they come back and haunted him and he kept on driving around at one point in my grandfather was he was it was in one day and then a month later he was in the town another town and then it caught up to him and that's um I think that's why he just and it killed ... drowned themself\nAnd they sent a letter along with it with the board and send it to 'em they'll set of copy that letter to the to the Boston Globe so it was published\nUm but also the president sent a letter back and he wrote back and basically thank them for the which board\nAnd he said it was you know really made it was it was made out of great ingenuity\nBut he said that he will hardly think I shall meet the test is power disclose the path to forecast the future\nSo we know that the industry of do the talking board enter into the community of the spiritual Smith meant and also it in the United states only that it was an Eighteen Ninety the ... board that we know today got its start\nIn Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point so there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada bought some rights from us the United states to sell their own version of the leader board and so they started making boards and Eighteen Ninety two\nAnd the rest is history and so bored such as Bob board which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the ... makes it a prominent glass into\nThe market I mean everybody was buying them and using them at the heyday I mean this this has been a spiritual moving with going\nBig time and I was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat boards and started doing different types of their own type a board and of course we get the trademark patted her name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a suspected serial killer or making a board ah basically it's ... it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he\nWould feel right about himself or what have you ... or ... his own special way I'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned earlier people do make their own start customized selling them\nUm but the degree of this type of story no I have never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money I there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case\nI'm In it I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted\nA legit or we don't know if he really whether or not\nYeah we we don't know if you did you reach tricked into somebody mental institution right in fact a you know\nThat's that's the that's the thing it would be avoided or any kind of prosecution because we checked in a mental institution I mean in in since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted and you have any information to the authorities and if so did they take it seriously\n[noise] well which is kind of awkward because I haven't really [noise] you know this is really just a small thing that I was just showing only only are we just put the color a Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy\nWho used to work for ... which is an old TV show or\nOn the which has only channel five or something right in the east and um [noise] he was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board\nAnd he worked on hated like um the show he could like producing I think mhm\nCurrent share and then he was the one who introduced it to the guys that make these ... company called allied board and they make different games and things and they took it to another level like the same image to same exact [noise]\nYou know but then they took it and they just put it on more quality thing with boxes and everything you know\nI mean in the background to write the background history\nYeah and they will I told him everything you know and they put it down to they made it more like a sophisticated I guess but I'm the same story and it's a very good I tell people you know got to I'd I made them put on that you can't be under Eighteen years old\nAnd\nYou\n\nFox News I'm Carmen Robert detailed investigations went into finding the alleged package bombers stays are they all ...
