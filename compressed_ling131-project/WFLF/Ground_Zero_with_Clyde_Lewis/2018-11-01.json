to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure you're not facing either one of those are you would have mentioned that\nYou just want your car paid off here's the problem you pull money out of a four one K. they charge you a ten percent penalty plus your tax rate so if you're on the twenty two percent tax bracket as an example in the year twenty Eighteen\nThat would be a thirty two percent hit on your money so that's the equivalent of saying Dave I Want to borrow money at thirty two percent interest to pay off my car and the answer would be no that's stupid and so don't cash route retirement\nNo that's stupid don't do that unless it's just unless your backs against the wall and you can't breathe which case might be a need to sell the car actually if that were the case not\nStill not casualty

are the priest threw himself down the steps and killed himself in The Exorcist kind of a creepy a landmark they want to have in George to I think it should be a landmark it's kind of an interesting in fact while I was in Washington DC I plum forgot\nAbout seeing those steps when I was in Washington DC I mean you know we we'd have enough time I mean we were walking most of Washington DC is walking ... part it's like um you know I was seeing you could drive the White House you drive to watching them on your we\nParked at the Washington Monument we walked all the way over\nTo the south side of

all about it's certainly a tradition that had said\nI don't know Halloween is sending some mixed messages this year and what I mean by that is is I don't know if you've heard of this petition\nBut parents want to petition that Halloween be the the last Saturday of every October\nInstead of the thirty first asked me last Saturday in October and what's interesting about that is is that I I think people to do that people are saying that you don't know that Halloween has traditions that are well Steve better you know the data all the way back to you know the sixteen hundreds\n\nAnd Halloween of course of the day before all saints day or the ... the deal is one of those the day of the same day of the dead and so it's kind of like a tradition that the day before uh we pay respects to the dead the dead walked the earth and we pay attention to\nNot only the spirit world but also some of the darker genesis or the spirit world we we um we make jak letters to ward off evil spirits but of evil spirits\nYou know they passed over our house as we do it we're supposed to that's what trick or treaters are supposed to be it's supposed to be the evil spirits if you don't give him treats they do tricks and that's why it's called trick or treating\nThis year I just think that there were a lot of mixed messages being sent it seem to you know\nWe're living in times were where there's this devil does your hiding in every discussion dealing with politics and religion\n\nI mean this year in particular I I've had well I really late heavy on the devilish aspects of the holiday because from a social studies perspective I think we've reached a time in history where we are definitely in the shadow what can we label be gotten anti Christ\nMeaning that you know even though people may not be able to identify the anti Christ a\nBitch that will bear humans in heat right now let's just put it this way I mean I I don't mean to mince words but it just seems to me the dog that birth the anti Christ is certainly in heat right now and and people are just waiting for this to having a legend of the darkest one of all\nWhich is the anti Christ that came out of a desire\nTo better understand the last judgment and the science specifically those that Harold the arrival of\nThis tyrannical figure this this anti ... we were told that to be vigilant we watching the science we're told in the Bible watched the signs that they may warned of a coming of the ... days watched the science they may be the warning the coming of the anti Christ the come and go to the ... the apostrophe\nOr many men fall to to the ills of evil and scripture and ... cool commentary and never fully addresses a exactly who\n[noise] who is figure is who who would proceed the coming of Jesus I mean it's really an anomaly and and everyone who has a particular celebrity or politician they hate will often choose them to be the anti Christ especially the average have there\nBecause they've been rolling the dice and say my bets on this guy by bets on this guy my bets on Trump my bets on you know and you just go down the list I remember when bronco bottom was president many people thought that he was the anti Christ\nBut\nI I Would say that this study or\nRevelation of a modern anti Christ is a truly hard sell for most people mainly because in\nA secular world and we're we are in in you know ... to them the anti Christ is simply a marketing term it's a it's a buzz word for\nFor Christians who see that they are being persecuted in their faith is being destroyed by any number of groups\nAnd therefore

everywhere\nDon't you know this the devil is everywhere and this leads to\nNot conspiracy theory but the idea that a conspiracy exist a darker conspiracy exist but is here to bring down mankind\nAnd so when you look at conspiracy history you have to take into account biblical history is well this is something I mean I I think this gets confused sometimes when people say well when you're thinking of America you gotta figure the Christian values that America stands on well what it is is you need to look at the Christian conspiracy\nOr the conspiracy against Christianity because here we have this this you know this all out battle\nAgainst people in America we're fighting against the I mean and when you're looking conspiracy history it all has its roots in biblical over ... ritual is world events are not simply circumstantial\n\nBut they are the result of an organized campaign by an elite group of unseen in widely unknown world leaders\nAnd of course we pointed out that they have beliefs in Egypt symbolism\nSecrets aside a little cold does it mean ritual magic and that affects us and he it's done about what I Believe it's about what they believe they're the ones in power and so if\nYou say to me will you talk about his all time you must believe it it's not about how how I Believe it or what I Believe I just don't which there\nAnd I know that causal engineering and ritual magic effects everyone regardless of religious beliefs regardless of what you practice or what you say you're ... that'd be\nThese groups I mean these groups they um [noise]\nThey ah they answered

is because [noise] what he does is it [noise]\nExploits what it's called the invisible indefinable enemy\nIt's an enemy that comes from a place that we wouldn't expect it and it winds up attaching

being fed movies that appeared to impart\nThis is fact rather than fantasy\nAnd so now we start seeing that non fiction or the to the fiction becomes non fiction and you know this is where I become a born again dispensation with this is where I become\nA you know a man who focuses on his guitar allergy because it's thrown into literature movies\nSo much I mean many believe these movies have been a a a detriment to the faith because well much of what he's shown a written in these books or are these movies putting these movies are not based on any scripture canonize doctrine and that\nYou know that that that the scene and and uh it's actually absorb so much of the stuff that was as been written about the end of the world that much and stuff has been written about the anti Christ performed or shown\nCan be considered heresy\nI mean many movies and many uh stories around Halloween take liberties with\nPassages or scripture and with interpretations of apocalyptic themes I mean you can take a look at Nostradamus for example know Saddam has been bastard I so much who knows what\nYou know Saddam is just teaching us any more I remember back in the seventies they can you remember what I always say look what know Saddam is has to say look what no and I don't I barely hear a beep about Nostradamus now\nPeople are now back to the book of Daniel people are now back to the book of the apocalypse the revelation\nPeople want to read apocryphal books but to try to determine what the future hold some guy called me last night and said that he started reading uh Anton the basic Cannick books his Bible and that and that's what I mean look what ever the future is\nThe echo of its thunder is rumbling now into the president it's ... it's it's an ominous future\nAnd it's causing this it it just causing us to think that the end times are approaching into some you know we hear those trumpet in this guys you know the ones that make the trumping noises\nAnd we hear those were wondering I Wonder if that's something we should be paying attention to are those the trumpet\nThat are blowing by the angels and we just kind of ride them off of something else science tries to explain them but in reality they are the trumpets being blown [noise]\nI mean [noise]\nWhen you're looking at the blurring of events in our reality and the exploitation of science and religion and everything else it's always making us wonder\nIf we're really now in the midst of in times reality or in a sense of hyper awareness because it's\nHow we been desensitized your baby and brainwashed with Hollywood and then maybe you know people speaking of his stuff I mean when you're reading about how the Vatican\nStories in the news about sexual scandals pedophilia in churches and corruption young people today are now becoming more in tune with the alternative views on things like socialism communism Nazi as a rule do witchcraft in satanism\nThere's something to say that was social media and the lack of the faithful to keep the trust of the youth the devil\nLooked like it inviting dark father\nAnd speaking of the devil tonight we have the ... with us he um this is probably is a I don't know maybe his third or fourth Halloween with us sometimes we bring them in on Halloween dabble strikes work on the ground zero strive for having me on now I used to introduce you is the\nWhat do you call the magic or a bad just drove the church of Satan\nI was a master and the church\nSo you're a manager that you're just said now you've created the carrier the chaos imperial yeah I have my own my own order now you know what kind of order is is it a six eight and a shorter is it a witch order wizard order what kind of magic order is\nThe case I'm hearing is the most advanced black magical order in the world and essentially we\nSee the prince of darkness as a a ... a bean that doesn't exist inside of physical space time is outside of that is not involved\nUm and does not center around the idea of worship but that to this being can actually be contacted through a actions involving um the highest forms of black magic\nAnd uh we see this being something that we can learn from directly because we can become like it it's the our position is to become God like beings\nAre in a in the elation of\nHis first foreign principle which is responsible for all things in life in the cosmos\nSo we're talking about a dark figure that you have this contact with but it's on it's dark has its mission it's undulating right it's not Satan\nSaying then in of itself has a has a a\nA kind of a dumbed down I'm a\nIdea of this super consciousness inside of physical space time it's a and this guy stiff 'em rebellion\nAnd a a decadence and I'm a heating ism but uh\nThe ultimate elevated form of this is a stoic looser furry and for which is where we are\nAre actively involved in so I'm forever action as an opposite ... equal reaction so as you see manifestations of ah forms going to a a higher spiritual forum or as a decision to to forcefully moved the intellect and the psych\nThrough physical space toward a higher\nUh form you're going to the replica ripples\nIn in its back wash that are going to manifest themselves as decadence and degenerate but we're also living inside of the cyclic nature of the Kelly yoga which is a ... and understanding of cyclic time in this position that's happening right now\nIs the degenerate I'm a sales oriented\nUm cosmological construct within ... the human physical ... of action and form that is at its lowest uh a continuum it's it's the worst possible position we can actually live in so they're going to see this like all across the board politics\nPhilosophy art music\nUm you know a cultures et cetera\nIs this something that ah the chaos because some very him do they relish this or were they like to see a higher form of been lightened ... there would be more refined satanism runny absolutely ... absolutely\nNo interest in what happens to the rest of the world no interest at all no we we're we're we're Paul bearers of western civilization were just watching it happened the rest of us are just moving toward something that's a continually outside of that\nSo you're waiting for all of us to destroy each other than you guys move in and basically will be the you know\nWe're not even interested in in in the earth we're interested in transcending beyond even that position so during Sandy one thing that they are really unhappy about is the fact that there are so much\nA destruction of the beauty of this planet and a lot of that it's manifested in things such as an animal abused child abuse is I think we think this kind of thing is really a a really horrific actually animal abuse even worse as far as we're concerned because of the true\nI'm a ... a ... of the of the planet\nYou know they were here before we were and we've come a long and we've like eradicated\nOr their land um\nAh their position in the world you know they're they're ... they're simple rights to live so well actually I don't really buy their points to land well I guess is that the you know we've we've completely overrun all of that and I just think that there should be some kind of vengeful action against that type\nOf thing bench will actually gets animals using childhood oh yeah absolutely um you know it's interesting because I said that statement earlier I said satanism now it's harder to find black magically well yeah I mean you will for more you are you're talking about ... black magic\nBut I'm Talking about how now the ... the definition of what satanism is it's not easy I remember when I first met you and I talked to her back when you were part of the C O s I uh I I was trying to put a handle on what's sameness believed or at least the way in St Louis bleed\nAnd uh before it wasn't easy to find satanism is getting even more difficult to divide and said that the actually say that I Would say this is anymore because we go for like a like I said we go for the most ridiculous definitions to them more psychotic definitions of what it is\nAnd I was just curious is this why you left the churches say\nNo let's say in satanism which is a a fairly universally and philosophically recognized as the first manifestation of a true a church and devoted to satanism to 'em and acknowledgement at the devil\nI'm as a a as a symbol for um a form of personal internal evolution and that each and every man and woman is their own satanic ... moving to try and become something greater than what they are\nUm there's\nWithin the like the last Twenty years there has been literature that has flooded a literal a\nCottage industry of books that have come out claiming to have been some type of\nOf former age old undiscovered um
