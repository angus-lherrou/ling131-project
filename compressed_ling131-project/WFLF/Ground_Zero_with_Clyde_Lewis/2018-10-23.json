just don't know where to go sort of funny [laughter]\nToday I was I was I was looking over my science articles for my clippings service\nI saw one of the most God awful looking creatures today oh my gosh I ... is with skin crawl was thinking about it okay so this creature looked like a bright red chicken without a head and\nIt was swimming and writing in water [laughter] liar or at it gave me the creeps it really did\nI mean this\nThis creature okay I'm not kidding he looked like a floating chicken with its head chopped off\nOkay it's strange it was it was it was pinkish read it was an entity with a body like a slump breasted in decapitated chicken\n... and they called the Hitler's chicken monster this is true it would be my eye that science clippings it I mean scientists that ... if it's all you know\nTrue science 'cause you have to look in the true science as human beings real earnings bake so I saw this thing and I'm thinking there's gotta be CGI it's gotta be crazy right but no [laughter] I spent\nI spent the whole afternoon literally\nReading about the headless chicken monster\nYou're probably laughing but it's true headless chicken and ... chickens those who have listened to my show\nKnow about the famous ... if I can find it I'll play it they know about the famous chicken rent but he'd say well known story it's a legendary ground zero story about how I went to a Halloween party\nAnd I came back just a little bit tipsy went on the air first time I've ever done that 'cause I don't\nGo on the air and drunk or you know high or anything\nBut I went on the air this was when I was local and I was feeling a little bit so you went to a great party in the afternoon it was one of the afternoon parties thought I'd be okay came on the air\nAnd I just started you know talking shooting from the hip shooting from the hip I started getting to how terrified I was of chickens okay and the reason why I'm terrified of chickens is because when I was a kid\nI once tried to sneak in my backyard from a field okay and there was the barbed wire fences next door to this this family that we can 'cause we lived out in this rural area called mid veiled Utah\nAnd next door to us was this a Mexican family I mean they were they spoke Spanish they just beginning it was kept the kids spoke English but uh just barely\nAnd are are you saying that this kid named junior but he was really Jose and he spoke English ... broken English but I decided to sneak home from school go through the field crawl through the barbed wire\nBarb wire fence to keep the roosters and the chickens from getting I crawled into the barbed wire fence got attacked\nBy the head rooster just poking my face [noise] just you know the debt tacking me and it was like I'm bleeding I'm getting attacked it's like something out of Alfred Hitchcock's the birds right but it's chickens chickens\nMost or just attacking me right\nAnd just talking at my face\nAnd Iran to my mom Iran and my dad I'm bleeding\nAnd so my dad goes over of course the old man's over there man he's\nDrunk and he's just drunk and my dad says you're rooster my son in law is new and so I guess Miguel who is one of the older\nKids\nSaw me bleeding and he said that's it so we went and he got himself a rake and he went any chased after the rooster would the raking finally hit it and there'd been goes and it just stops\nSo he grabs a knife and he grabs the nicotine chicken ... ... head off the chicken right and then\nThe damn rooster comes after me [laughter] you know you're a little kid writing things coming up you were the way they were ...\nHead chopped off and they were bad enough\nJose found it was funny he went he grabbed the chicken ... the chickens foot and he found the nerve on the end of the chickens putting pull on it in the chickens that she can handle it would it cost you know the cost of these foreign when they're terrifying it was a kid right terrified\nI haven't had experience with ... and we went to a place called we were farm where to go visit my folks at Christmas Time I told him that was the Thanksgiving went to go totally am and said hey we'll get a ... a a a nice ah ah you know pumpkin pie good wheeler farm hang out go see the animals there were horses they're ending and so they weren't chickens\nAnd certainly um it's like what four or five years old six years old at the time and he thinks the rooster chase after me scared of the ...\nAnd I said you know what you like me\nWho just like me man we have problems with chicken so we're we're going to do is we're going to go to KFC [laughter] and get some chicken he went and told me he has his great idea for a horror film with chickens so he and I both bad we we've had our experience with chickens but seeing this\nHorrible\nPink breasted ... David chicken swimming through the ... I spent the whole afternoon just looking for information on this creature because how terrified I Am of chickens and I was thinking of this creature was from my nightmares materialize in the real world and after a whole afternoon of obsession\nI found out the creature how to name it was a real thing it wasn't some you know optical illusion CGI it's called\n... and see mia\nAnd it ... me that's a Spanish he does and it ... states and it being asked is ... or\nThe sea cucumber it's called the sea cucumber\nApparently scientist recently caught video of\nThis\nSea cucumber it's bizarre hen mimicking aquatic deem and in the southern ... it's what it looks like it's like it's quite a demon uh it's in the southern ocean Near Eastern Antarctica\nIt's ever been seen that before they've been seen in the Gulf though from what I understand so footage you're showing this\nColorful\nSea cucumber drifting through the water fans at the top of the bottom of its TBI translucent lab body so it's like but it looks like the wings and legs of plucked pink frightening foul ready for the pot\nI'm so they called the headless chicken monster\nLike I said found in the Gulf of Mexico recently detected by scientists will be Australian Antarctic division part of the Australian department of environment dedicated to invest in an article in the southern ocean on average they call it ... uh\nUh they measure between two an eight inches in length adults colors can range from dark reddish brown to crimson no juveniles are typically pale a ... a shade of pink according to a study published in Nineteen Ninety in the journal Smithsonian contributions to marine sciences\nBusier while most types of sea cucumber spend the majority of their time on the seabed swimming sea cucumbers like ... uh uh they land only defeat researchers reported the Nineteen Ninety study I now I don't\nWant us to sound like some [noise]\nNational Geographic description of course the Democrats have a tendency to make anything that looks strange in paranormal sounds so mundane [noise]\nBut [noise] man [noise] scary for me I was watching in fact the video is in my article tonight if you want to look at it it's pretty amazing Tripoli it's six Seventy three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six Seventy three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis you listen to ground zero and we'll be back\nAmerica's first news when Gordon Deal every day five to six AM news radio Ninety three point one [noise]\nFrightening foul here's what they are\nAnd they do fly you know that they do okay don't let anybody tell you different chickens fly they just don't like to fly obviously they're lazy good for nothing chickens and they only fly when they need to they only fly\nWhen they wanna piss you up the only fly where they want to scare the hell out of you\nHow one coming down swooping down on you and flying as they jump off the coup on to you that is when they decide to fly chickens fly\n\nAnd they attacked children they're worse than there were those damn dogs those bulldogs are worse than pit bulls\nOkay she'll keep your chicken under lock and key [noise] five oh\nThree five three five ... back in the old days when\nThe yo ...

and somebody made a joke about it I wouldn't joke about the chickens but I certainly am terrified\nOf chickens and that they're not cats they're not dogs the chickens so um I just have this I guess this chicken bigotry I have um three bigoted when it comes to chicken anyway coming up I got a story I Want to talk to you about and speaking of strange creatures are strange things that don't

time to get here\nDark reddish brown to crimson bow juveniles are typically appreciated pink according to a study published in Nineteen Ninety the journal Smithsonian contributions to marine sciences so they're really fascinated by the sea cucumber gave me the creeps ... really weird is\nThat uh it got me thinking about second genesis\nAnd what second genesis is is well scientists have set\nSome have suggested that there is there was a a there is was there was a second genesis that took place in the beginning in the beginning God created having the euro got also created\nIn heaven and have been and having and heaven and earth and earth and earth an earth meaning there\nWere several genesis or beginnings several different ones\nAh where\nThere's a fifty percent chance of of the life forms which opposed the norm and they do exist and sometimes they show up and when they show up we don't know what you call the window to do with them and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster I'm not going to any of those things I'm Talking about things that you know you look at them and you get a second look\nLike this chicken that swim so it's a chicken feed is set chicken monster type creature that I have in my uh\nUh I have in my article tonight\nUh but when you're looking at the multiplicity of creation and you're looking at how little diversity a multi versus unseen in the multiplicity being chips would call that the underworld creatures from the underworld they'll come up with ... like the Demi Moore gone from you know stranger things or you know I don't know anything that\nExtreme but still I mean stranger things called the upside down we called the abyss a timeline of creation and the ... we here too are the ones that have been handed down through millennia and each one of Judy gets interpretation or the concepts pretty much\nAre the same wherever you look so scientists are speculating\nSigns are speculating that strange organisms that might be alien in nature exist on the planet\nAnd ... there isn't\nA very far jumped to suggest that stranger life exist on the planet that well you've never seen before\nAnd yet if you were to blow up in the shadow biosphere lurks every monster invite opening that no one even wants to see or or take on or have contact with there was another creature that I saw that somebody was kind enough to actually send me a picture of this thing it's called the penguin\nI don't know if you've ever seen a penguin but I saw ... today for the first time I've never heard of a penguin in my life it looks like a mini Godzilla with armor looked like something from a Japanese horror film tiny thing it looks like a cross between an anti during an armadillo\nAnd uh so he says well bring up the ... will apply to push the ... isn't terrify but I I think the penguin it's cute but it's also scary looking because they have this armor all over its body and it kinda like conscious over like God village looks like a good pick out a ...\nYou know it it was big enough he could take out Tokyo they'd that's how we are to this\nSee these ... we're creatures that nobody has seen before\nOr they've seen them or they can identify but didn't know what they are and this is what I mean by second genesis these are things that\nYou know you've heard of unicorns yeah right well you know this is a lot different than ... I think there's a lot of different in that okay you know and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster this is beyond my band is beyond the fly would monster these are things that you see and you're like going what the hell is this and it's something that's never been seen\nOn in search of someone who's never been talked about on coast to coast day I'm not saying that uh you know I've talked about really that I Know about that I've seen and you know that ... this reminds me of the myths gave the movie the mist remember the missed\nIt was a it was it novella and it was also a a movie okay and the idea that\nYou know there are some quantum joke\nScience can beat us with dimensional theories the point to the possibility\nThat there are areas of planet where the veil is thinner or\nThere's some extra dimensional ... second genesis occurred parallel to our own and their locations throughout the planet which suggested to be the most powerful due to their position in the the appropriate ritual perform there by the right to fish it could actually be a cleansing moment for the planet\nIt could open the best new creatures could come out and take I mean we're being warned\nThat there are ... are portals that could be open through ritual or through the auspices of super collider is like CERN and those real into these can pass through and haunt mankind and change the direction of the future\nAnd as I said you know the mist they had a project they're like ... it was called arrowhead euro had project and the whole catalyst for the story was a dimensional breach\nProject arrowhead actually creates this myth and rain than enveloped the small town and during the night large insect like creatures are seen and Tara doctor like creatures attack livestock and small pets eventually these creatures attack humans as well\nThose horrifying creatures from the film we're known as the great with orders and you can only be described as deadly spider like predators each about the size of a small dog\nAnd these creatures produce corrosive Web strands which burn through materials like coughing flesh eating both the book in the film great widower is simply killed their prey would they're acidic ... put it in the film\nThey also have the ability to capture and hundreds of eggs in living human host\nThe eggs say goodbye the data hatch and they multiplied quickly now the looks of these creatures were terrifying and there were even some\nThat were the size of a human being rubber ... remember the there was a show called mimic I didn't know that they'll Toro did this show mimic is one of my favorite scary movies because of the fact that this this Roach or whatever it is\nGets to me the size of the human and you get to see it looks like a man and black standing there in the subway but it's not it's a big mop like creature scary looking creature see when you're looking at these creatures in the midst are you looking in in in\nThe movie like mimic these creatures are terrifying and and and you know if they're the size of a human being even worse than it was explained by the producers okay of the movie\nAnd then they said we based many of the creatures\nOn supposed a second genesis creatures that were proposed by ...\nThey were based on real animals but from an alien ecology admittedly dangerous wild animals from a more brutal ecosystem that we are not familiar with but still\nBasically just animals made of flesh and blood nothing supernatural about them okay but they are from a second genesis ecosystem\nBrutally good system is the same ecosystem that the scientists at CERN and when a guy by the majority rows\nHave talked about\nWith regard to opening dimensions and allowing these vile creatures in for study Jody rose is a co founder and chief technology officer of the wave which is the Canadian company sewing machines that he claims exploit quantum mechanical effects to solve certain problems hundreds of millions of times faster than traditional computers\nAnd rose is also the c._e._o. of kindred systems or kindred AI which is to sell the start up your bonded with others\nThat was back in twenty fourteen any dedicated the whole company to delivering advanced tell operated autonomous robots but\nHis goal is within the way of quantum computers he wants to summon a suit non me up demons or aliens or whatever they are the equivalent he says to the old ones spoken of\nBy horror Arthur H. P. love craft so the concept of opening the dimensions for some love crafty and like creatures to come through\nSounds very much like he wants to open the realms\nOf where the second genesis took place and and I mean I played the the the ... before we talked about this I don't know if it's for air because I think the squares in it\nBut he says something to eat that he says well when I'm going to tell you is is that we have the power that we are going to bring things over but they're not going to be like us\nHe says alien you know or you know different beat the things that we're building are not going to be people they might be really smart they might be really good at all sorts of things but they're not going to be like us they're gonna be aliens they're gonna be I'm Sorry to say way smarter\nThan every single person in this room in ways that we can't even comprehend so this of course triggers a lot of a worm with people right\nI mean you know one must says you know if you're playing with a guy you're opening up these dimensions you're unleashing the demon the little guy with the ... you're going to have to throw your holy water on it you're going to have to wave at it and say by God it's going to do exactly what you say not anything else but see that it doesn't always work out that way right\nSo your coffee in the attitude that something will happen if you don't mess with Mother Nature\nSo opening up the wormhole letting these creatures through a very very very terrifying prospect\nAnd it's something that we really really shouldn't be doing what they're going to be doing it anyway and so the question is what is out there that does not fit the mold that we can see that one day we do see and when we see it\nIt's it's it's just too much [noise]\nHave you seen anything like that [noise]\nI mean have you seen something I mean look [noise] I'm not asking you to tell me about something that's the supernatural I'm Talking about real monsters here I'm Talking about things that you've never seen before he can explain [noise]\nAnd uh you know I've had that happen before I've come in contact with something like a bug gr or or some creature being that I didn't know what it is it takes off of it was what was that it is nothing like you ever read about\nNothing like you've never seen so uh we have a couple of minutes before the break but I Want you to kinda describe for me for the moment um so what exactly when did you first see these and where where do they come from\nOddly enough I bought my dream home in October of last year and that's when it started my dream home became my absolute worst nightmare and I'm\nLike you were talking earlier about the genesis and the portals it totally at home even more so for me because when I'm\nAt a video of uh what was on my window screen construe it looks like this catalyst character holding something underneath it arm is one of the pictures and videos that I was telling\nYou as you send a video because I'm trying to find a video and people are demanding a C shape ship big data like credible evidence you know\nI've been trying to send it over and over and over ...

arranged you and get them to her\nAnd uh that we will get a logical scientific explanation now that doesn't hold on to go further we're going to uh probably up some goes to the theaters or maybe in some other investigators ... just to go and if there's something demonic going on there\nUh but uh you know one of the things that we do on this program and we've done it many times is that we actually have to vet the stories about the thing with Barbie is but she came to a news press conference\nOkay and we were at a news ... press conference in Oregon uh some of the tour went to Seattle and beyond she came to that press conference to ask the news department\nWhat could be done about the home and ... how could be inspected so it was not\nBut she had me she asked me if I knew anything about it there was something paranormal about it I was at bat I thought I don't know what George my audience and find out of the biggest paranormal or not\nAnd so this is why I brought Barbie on the show this is not\nTo try and convince you something paranormal this was an investigation and process now\nUh it's also I thought appropriate for Halloween to talk about this the reason why is because I don't know about you but creepy crawly crap coming out of a house whether it be spiders or any other bugs or or whether it be rats mice or anything else are terribly creepy\nThey are terribly creepy and a and this is why I uh this is why I wanted to talk about this tonight\nSo uh if anyone you know if anyone has had this happen to them or if they had something that they can claim that they've had happened to them I'd like to hear the story because you know things that are out of the ordinary things are anomalous\nOr certainly worthy you talk to you about especially when the Halloween and so I said the chauffeur around this time because I wanted people you know because it's all part of our we write the creepy crawly easy we the spider things going down up and to the ads crazy but there are these are things that happened\nAnd uh but I'm going to talk to ... this is something that's really a B ordinary Jason calling you from California how are you tonight man\nHow are you doing great now
