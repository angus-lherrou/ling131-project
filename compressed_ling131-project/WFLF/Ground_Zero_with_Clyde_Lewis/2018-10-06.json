{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "Well very well done sir you are way ahead of the curve congratulations thank you well what we teach folks is to follow a plan we call the baby steps we think it is the shortest raped shortest route to wealth okay\nAnd a baby step one is a thousand dollar saved too is dead free but the house you've obviously done those three as an emergency fund of\nThree to six months of expenses you've obviously done that\nFor five and six you do simultaneously that's Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement as baby steps for five is kids college doesn't apply here six is pay off our surely so that brings us into our question\nNow the way I look at paying off your house with a non retirement non emergency fund money which is sounds like if I heard you right you've got fifty five K. and miscellaneous investments that some non retirement and not your emergency fund is that right\nAs crack and you oh eighty on your house did you say is that right\nYup okay and um the uh the way I look at that is if\nYou owed thirty thousand bucks on your house would you go borrow fifty thousand to invested in stocks and bonds and my answer will quickly be no\nYeah and in essence if you do column of your assets and a column of your liabilities of what your own and what you owe that's called a balance sheet you probably heard that before and uh uh the balance sheet says that those things offset so it has the same mathematical effect\nAs if you had borrowed on your home to buy the stocks\nThat I may ... if we don't if we don't use that money to pay down on the house now I Would not to clean out your emergency fund I Would be willing to take it down a little bit to three to six months of expenses it you know twenty three thousand or twenty two thousand or whatever was might be a little sick\nI might pull that down to ten or something you'd be safe as a single guy making fifty with a ten thousand dollar emergency funds so I'd probably pull ten or twelve Thirteen out of that and I take the fifty five throw it at the house and you know that house paid off in a year what's the house worth\nOr if there were about a hundred and ...\n... ... only ... years old with a paid four hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nIt'd be pretty nice\nYou know and then take and then you take that old payment you used to have and all of the freedom that you have mathematically now in your budget and you use that that fifty five will be back in twenty minutes\nYou'll be amazed how fast you can rebuild and how fast you can build investment portfolio when you don't have any payments at all and that's the reason for doing it plus here's what's kind a weird you've made really unbelievably wise decisions for twenty two years old I mean you you're just you're killing your head\nAnd I think you know what else will happen is that you remember when you signed the mortgage\nDid you feel emotional weight\nOr ... I started off with I've actually already refinanced once\nI'm done I mean when did the original deal the first time and you went from debt free young debt free with money in the bank to now I got a mortgage do you remember feeling the weight on that oh that\nYeah especially when it said Thirty years in front of it yeah\nThat's what I'm Talking about that because there's more going on here than simple math there's complicated math that entails risk and go home and even even relational and I'm\nSpiritual things the borrower is slave to the lender that's the way you felt Thirty years I Can't stand as I got to get rid of this well the same thing will happen in reverse but on the positive side of hey when you don't have any\nYet no wait nothing on your shoulder it changes the way you play\nIt changes the way you do you're investing it changes the you get so I got I got so enthusiastic dude when I got free with my investing and with my generosity both that both of them went into outrageous mode very quickly and so they will get that fifty five back so freaking fast\nThat it it'll it'll it'll come back faster than in the first time you've got a lot faster it's not gonna take you five years this time I'm much you've got more income now too so that's not fair but I mean mathematically relation Lee spiritually emotionally\nWhen you're free you just do better\nAnd use make better choices and you're already making really good choices so all of that to say yes I Would cash out the investments that are non retirement yes I Would take that emergency fund down to about ten uh that doesn't quite get us there so you got to lean in and out of your budget and cash flow out\nThe rest of that thing and finish it up within you know four or five months the debt free on this whatever it is six months or whatever it takes and then when the house has done than you than you if you want to build up that emergency fund a little bit fine but then kick those investments in the bud get them going again and you will prosper you are on your way sir\nSo honored to talk to you very very well done\nWayne is an Indianapolis Hi Wayne welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThanks day and I just want to first say God Bless you for all the work you do it's really made a difference in my life\nWell thank you ...\nWell my wife and I have been a leading lights on for about two years now and that we've pretty much become that free other than our student loans which we were working on and then\nWe ended up getting a now I got pregnant with her first child and April so we took her by sending a stop putting everything toward their debt snowball and started a bank and all that good and ah\nAs a ... month we we now have enough for her to take her three month maternity leave um pain free for us which is a great time\nAnd that but the problem that the Murphy has decided to strike at\nThat last week we got a bill in the mail from our city here and they replaced and sidewalks here on our lots and or the bills for forty four hundred dollars and a\nWith a baby on the way here and another a few months we don't have that kind of money in our cash flow to pay that off and twelve months before they put a lean on our home so my question is uh what would you do it in that situation that we we ... our maternity leave fun and pay that off or what do we do when somebody do\nA December the beginning of December\nOkay well the game plan that we usually outline for folks is push paws on your total money make over your debt snowball Kobe becomes pile up the cash when baby comes push play again and take all that cash and throw it at your debt correct as long as maybe a mom will come\nAnd then everybody's cool but the cash is just to make sure everybody's school there is no issues and we're not it's not really for maternity leave unless you have to have it to eat with but I mean it's not um it it's so that we can use this or how much cash every got piled up or will you have piled up by the hour what\nSeventy five hundred dollars a month and like I said she's going to cheer wanting to take the three months off the phone with a baby outside and we can't do it on my income alone so um that's why we're smart about this and said that\nGold and make sure that you know so we got from now until December to continue to save right correct and what other debts do you have in your debt snowball how much I'm just about a hundred and fifty dollars a month as what we have that in fact um other than our car payment I kind of do you have you have actual that balances you need to pay off\nNo not on your car\nMuch your your car alley [noise]\nTen thousand dollars okay well then the four thousand would be your that you pay it all up out of this guy and then as far as set aside enough for her to Texas three months off\nDo you have the cash you should\nTake guys this is James child's producer of the Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now carried on six hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you had to Dave Ramsey dot com slash show [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each has dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed paying for the mortgage\nUtilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day\nI talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to Sandra insurance dot com recall eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible\nCan say with confidence that God and science or neither enemies nor partners but rather that God is unnecessary foundation for mathematics and therefore of every science\nWhich uses it\nRe argument is that mathematical laws in order to be properly ... relies upon\nMust have attributes which indicate an origin in God and they are true everywhere which makes them on the president true always or eternal cannot be the fighter defeated which means they're omnipotent and are rational and have language characteristics which makes the personal that's on the president on the ...\n... journal personal all the attributes we give to God or the same attributes you can apply to quantum physics and this is why we have things like sacred geometry or the\n... out in the mirror codes and snipers were words with identical numerical values bears some relation to each other or the number itself and when one looks into symbols and their meanings\nThey also tend to look at the numbers in words and then the values in order to try and interpret the word Scott has given them through contemporary basis and see the other night or last night I I'm just a lot of a ball blurred together there were those who are trying to tell me that the Internet\nIt's six six six WWW six six six and what that is as bad as\nYeah kind of a B. Y. ... type thing and so\nI was thinking that if people are going to call the show and they're going to bring into the mix this idea of six six six or the idea of six cubes I thought it was time to\nBring in a few things and talk about a few things and talk with a few gas because in recent decades the private in philanthropic sectors have carried out experiments\nUsing mathematics and other Kodak's to find a detect technological signatures and frequencies of what could be extraterrestrials or could be God or could be any of those things I mean look what they're doing at CERN you'll go there would be\nThe wave computer I mean they take these numbers in inner jurors they take mathematics even consider the number pi for example three point one for\nThis number equals the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter\nAnd its interested a philosopher versus the days that have a bag or is\nHe and many other ancient philosophers thought of numbers is having a higher reality above and beyond the physical world\n\nI don't know if anybody has seen the movie ... movie Nineteen Ninety eight this is one of the films but in all of its confusion touched me to the very core spiritually because it was chilling that an independent film had such an impact on me and my balancing between science about ... and God pie tells the story\nOf a mathematician named max he's working in number theory and his work attracts the attention of a sect Orthodox Jews strongly interested in neurology and the ... computer turns out there's two hundred sixty digit number\nBut apparently as some special powers significance ... or the dock sect believes that one particular two hundred and sixteen digit number properly translated he's the true name of God and assumes a mathematician has found it and the struggle for control of a number of ... a coincides with the map British and some descent into madness\nSo the number two sixteen is the sum of six to ... to find the cube of number acts we'd raise the number ... to the third power or the component of three making\nSix six six six times six to sixteen\nIn the book revelation chapter to actually chapter Twenty one for six to sixteen we read this and he said to me it has done I Am ... and omega at the beginning in the end and that was given to him that is a third of the fountain of water of life freely\nNow which most intriguing is this voice of God Speaking from the cube meaning that it is done I Me up and omega the beginning of the end equals to sixteen and full reduction English ... or drop drip\nSo voice of God's speaking is the sacred number of two sixteen or six cube the code or key in the biblical tax has a relationship to the number two sixteen and the Cuban six six six and this is the key the cube or the black cube was the cube\nIt's found in the holy of all these you know I Know of one man that knows a lot about this black cube and uh we wanted to come on and ... to a request with it Ryan gave all of course veteran radio personality the secret teachings on the program was that we bring them on right now Hi Ryan how are you\nI'm doing great quite as well I'm Glad to be here thank you very much for having me\nSo I'm sure you looked over a ... my notes for tonight you have your own notes oh this is very important because I think people are beginning to see that like we were talking about the arch of bail and how that has a representation that it was directed during the time to a vet Kavanaugh forward a discussions\nDid it represented sexual perversion uh the killing of babies and sacrifice\nNow we're getting into the numbers game we're getting into numbers and we're getting into a what is coming maybe a a footing a war in the future and these numbers are all adding up give us an idea of what the black cube is and what it represents and how it is\nSort of a a a a voice box or recorded for what is going to happen\nFirst off on the subject of ball or bell ball or bell in relation to sexuality is interesting because ball or bell is a fertility got ... of the black cube if we look at\nReligion and we look at history we fly if we find the black ... all over the world we find the Jews used the black cube called the ... a little kid where they have a piece of paper inside of it with a prayer on it\nWe have the holy of holy and Solomon's Temple the perfect cube we have the ... is a black cube located centrally within all ... all around the sacred site of Muslims that mecca\nAnd then we have the cube in a modern day Azerbaijan which is a fire cult I'm an area where there was a fire called\nA in historical days and that Cuba's representation of those fire deities so you see this throughout a religion you see this throughout history but when you start to break the cube down it takes you into more magical and more a cult studies and one of those studies is the study of what is called the magic square\nSo you have each of the seven classical planet that has its own magical square which is derived\nFrom the number of that planetary intelligence and it said that each of these intelligence is has a\nForm of consciousness that is free from the body free from flesh it's immortal ended assists and all things that are\nThat are of God if you will and so physical son is typically broken down for example into the spiritual Sunday intellectual son in the material sun and in the Hebrew ... ... you have a mix of Muslim and Jewish believes there\nThe intelligence of the sun is called ... which is a name and the ... equivalent to one one one the spiritual son is known as so Ross\nAnd that's new at that numerical value is six six six and both of those numbers both of those spiritual essence is are derived from the magic square of the sun which is a square with six columns and six rows\nEach line all of the numbers in every direction add up to one one one and every grow every line one one one time the six\nColumns in rows equals six six six so that is a number of the sun\nThan they are of course is the magic square of Saturn which is a square with three columns and three rows each line adds to the number Fifteen and numerically the number Fifteen if you look at that numerically and apply it to numerology when you count to ten and just start over again one two three four five six seven eight nine\nTen is one again and so on and so forth the number Fifteen become sick so Fifteen Fifteen Fifteen for each of those three lines equals six six six and that's where we get\nThe magic square of Saturn ... six six six Saturn is the father I heard you and Alex Jones earlier today and you mentioned Jupiter and it's interesting because Jupiter is Jew Peter and Peter is popped her father as in the dark father or the dark lord the lord of the rings center and the black cube is a representation Clyde\nOf the material world and it is on the hero card both a magician at the beginning of the deck and the devil tarot cards a representation of man's binding to the material world\nWhat was interesting is that I was very ah fixated on something of Fort Night or in one of the seasons Liam play sport night I was noticing that there was a a black cube that showed up from out of nowhere that was in a uh the area there that are leading was trying to figure out how to conquer it\nIn the book revelation Wi Fi to one third of the angels rebelled against God's the remaining through surgery made with God in the bench they became man\nFor the one third rebelled against a God ... well actually where the ... angels\nAnd with the numbers and the secret is he's been written in America are fascinating because what you have is\nWell just quickly then we'll go to Ryan a hundred and forty four thousand divided by two sixteen get your six six victory for item\nTwo thirds or two divided by three six six six six cue districts types expects fixes to sixteen you divide wondering forty four thousand by fix fix fix you get to sixteen to sixteen to sixteen adding food item so the numbers when you put them all together treats the big black Cuba or the oracle\nOf God's some say it's the I Would have been able to God's some say it is the eyes of Saturn Ryan gave all with us on ground zero you know there's a lot of indications Betty sat in return or some things about the fall of this country\nWe're looking at ah the changing of the guard and the beginning of what is called the war footing ... what do you see in the future and ... and and how does the black cube applied here\nAll the black you've applies to Saturn specifically because for many reasons one NASA GPL Cal Tech took an image in fact many many scientists have or\nHave had to look at these images many researchers had to look at these images and found the famous hexagon storm on the north pole of the planet Saturn that was photographed by Cassini the one I'm looking at here in two thousand and twelve\nAnd this is a huge massive hexagon storm while the hexagon has six sites and inside of that if you take the corners and you draw a line to them you get the ... the six sided star the number of Maine is six\nSix sided star otherwise known as the star of David is combining of the upright and the downward triangle the upward and the downward triangle represent the Dallas and the challenge\nIt represents alpha and omega the merging of the masculine and feminine it's\nA symbol of alchemy it's the symbol of the merging of two polar opposites that come together for a unified hole and that is the\nGoal of helping me to move through these like the seven classic planets the seven shock risk to move through these different gates in order to be stripped of worldly uh desires and worldly things materialism\nAnd to be reunited with the gun head [noise] now I think that's a this is a we have to take a break their stopped there the guy had because this is a this is where it gets even more interesting and we're we're we're just basically it's just

guide Ryan welcome back to ground zero now you were talking about the God yeah do you were talking about a number of things and and I had to cut you off let's get back on track here and talk more about that\nYeah so my radio shows called the secret teaching my website is triple W. dot the secret teachings dowden\nAnd the secret teachings focus on the elevation of the soul spirit from materialism the four corners of the earth the cube the square\nTo a ... if you will\nIt as a form of transcendence a form of al chemical trans mutation and when you look at religion you find in

the black cube magic squares Saturn adds up to Fifteen Fifteen Fifteen in three rows and three columns and that gives you buy\nI Am a ... a utilization of numerology Fifteen equals six so you have six six six and when I was saying before break was that the cue breaks down as David Was saying in your in your compilation their ICU breaks down into the hexagon six sided figure the hexagon\nIf you draw

I mean sure a lot of property maybe dark a lot of prophecy may not be good but there's always hope that his lent does well am I correct\nOr I think the hope is the real thing and I think the ... the minds of the men are given hope and working for a positive future we can we can make major changes in what's happening right now in the world and it's not like we're\nNot we're just one person or whatever\nWe can work together on this and we can make big changes of the skull or you know when you some people see it they say they don't think of it as something positive because they have these thoughts in their mind about a ... calls but when you see the ... and Michel ... and you see the workman ship and the love that went into it\nAnd it uh it just there's this special energy that you you can you can feel the energy and it's a it's a really really neat so that's what we do\nYeah and every time I mean this is an amazing ... this is the one that ah I've always\nAdmired for its work with ship and how beautiful it is and the power it's certainly possesses ... cents through and uh with the power in the room we have tonight and what we're feeling\nIt's certainly a is inspiring a and and I guess for people who know nothing about the schools why is this crystal skull so important and why is this president so important in the room tonight\nWell it's a considered one of the ancient skulls and\nLike you say the skull stores knowledge for everything it's seen been around for all the years and so uh it's believed to be a risk ... of mind and if this were skeptical of mind has been programmed by the ancient masters with the knowledge of the universe so\nUh it's it's here and it's it comes through is very\nVery a shuttle but very powerful\nYeah certainly I'm sure it has a lot of things to tell us I'm sure it has a lot I think that's a night we have a of course we have a lot of things a lot of uh I'd say uh\nYou know people who want to join into the program tonight we have Carol Davis coming up\nTonight to we've had on the program before she's a medium or and also uh\nI guess a psychic can away she's she's she is a person who communicates the skull\nAnd she'll be on the program tonight we have Stephanie Phelps who wishes to come on the program tonight and of course we have with is also a we have a a ...\nVon ... eat and is it easier and that's and that's it and and

that's the name of that\nLike ... like you know at a\nBecause the key words I think as soon as you start working list crystal skull is\nConsciousness yes we're mentioning and that's absolutely true you also work with material that calls for a mother earth so it links and to the earth but also links into the fact that the ancient people\nOr putting information in a system is while the best systems or you are without tech knowledge or you can put information and that is quite right or they use these ancient courts as a storage of inflammation that'd be now try\nTo access bailout and blood the interesting things and that is is\nWho we have not being very successful yes there are channels and this and that are that is far more information and officials call [noise] so people are searching for how can you access even this information he got them in jail and just skull\nContains Charlotte's inflation I remember a story of a company which which a company was working with these

remember the crystal it was court soon crystal that provided\nA the means by which we could communicate now with one another using crystal radios crystal radios were the first radio is that where we can broadcast information\nTo and from each other long distances there were ... you know people like Tesla Marconi there were very much aware of using crystal in order to create that sort of a communication not only that but to get records\nSuch as what we had with the idea of the photograph or the or the or the digital recorders these are all the technologies that came from the original crystal from the original\nPorts and so it's important to understand that some of the ancient technology like what we find in the crystal skull is not being utilized in our technology today a doctor

go home and how you're feeling so far about what we're talking about the I mean there've been many people coming to students like\nPutting their hands up against the school and feeling the power\nI mean these are experiences that I remember one time I got my hands there crystal skull and it came towards the end it in when I walked away from a move towards me\nSo for some reason I had this magnetic attraction to the school that it does that signify anything in your opinion what's your magnetic personality [laughter] I [laughter]\nI don't know eight certainly a happy a completely mesmerizing\nBaffled I had never\nHad an experience like that with any inanimate object so that the school moved towards me after I put my hands near it um it it certainly had the healing power in a a you know I remember when we first had a Shonda Roscoe in the studio I Would not convinced that this would be anything you know worthy 'cause he was in the sky\nOh itself is a visual thing okay and\nWe will be doing a uh we will be doing a a a a will be doing Facebook\nLive so you can see this but it it is a visual thing or you have to see it to believe but first of all then to be near it is to feel it\nAnd that is the second part and many of you are not going to be able to feel it and then comes the idea of communication inexperience in that comes with both internal tell a path to feeling and spirit\nWhich of course you get from it and of course tonight we're going to also bring about the new technology with the old black cube so we're going to have the best of both worlds here and bill
