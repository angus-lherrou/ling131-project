phoned in place\nSo that means you need to write a check today and pay off your car and your credit card and cut up your stupid credit card [laughter] okay okay now your debt free right okay yeah okay and that was foreign to\nI get so six thousand so I'm Down to twenty four thousand right yeah okay and your land is paid off and it's worth sixty\nAh about Fifteen about fifty and uh we need sixty so you need ten thousand that's where you're getting your twenty percent I see what you're doing okay uh well we're gonna put fourteen thousand an emergency fund\nOkay so now you have an emergency phony what ten thousand with the land you get a construction alone with the takeout loan a permanent takeout\nAnd your budget cannot exceed or a three hundred thousand dollar value that does not mean a house that you spend three hundred thousand on the house okay the value of the total package can't be more than three hundred\nRank sense huh so that means you're building up two hundred and forty thousand dollar house maximum\nOkay because the packages were three hundred and that gives you the twenty percent down if you spend three hundred on the house now you're at three sixty and you don't have twenty percent down anymore\nOkay you see how that works so you're getting\nAnd corruption alone that is tied to your new mortgage that is your final mortgage good called your permanent mortgage that's the mortgage that takes out your construction loan and so you're construction lender will require a take out letter\nWhere you're for or your permanent mortgages already approved sometimes you can just package all that together and with increasing interest rates are probably would package it altogether checked Churchill mortgage they could probably help you with that and you can go in lock in your interest rate on your permanent mortgage\nBecause he's a mortgage ... picking up and a good idea to lock 'em in when you can by the way if you have a ... and you got a higher interest rate loans folks this would be the time to go or Joe mortgage or it is taking up\nAnd I would lock in rates if you're in the middle of a deal right now walk your rights in\nAnd I probably would lock 'em in like twenty minutes ago like four days ago would lock them in period but we are in a rising interest rate environment nothing to panic about but it is going up\nAnd so you might as well take advantage of the lowest possible ray you can get your hands on for refinanced were for buying or in her case for building and um\nThat's by walking in current rage 'cause I don't think you're going to see rage come back down dramatically um you know in in in the foreseeable future in the next say six to twelve much they're probably going to go up\nAnd so given that environment um you don't have to be an economist to figure this out it's fairly easy to look at the trends\nUm then then I'm going to walk everything in as fast as I can get in touch with Churchill mortgage today and get this done Barbara is weather's barbers in Salt Lake City Hi Barbara how are you\nHey babe during gray area doing\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nSo we are a month and a half away from bay and gotten a baby step too good and um yeah you know I don't want to live that momentum that we've had kept\nGoing toward ... ... and and going into baby step three there's like a few curve ball they pay 'em that are happening that we want to get the three ... my husband is also wanting to go back and to go to get a bachelor's they get a better paying job that would be maybe step three\nOkay Rebecca my question is you know we also want to start a family that we need them that that it's like a defined 'cause we want to cash flow that\nWhen you have a baby on the way you will build up a baby fun no\nNeed to do it\nOkay to build up the emergency fund for\nYou finish first for you do anything and then you start doing other life goals I wouldn't worry about saving for a baby you don't really need to save a bunch of money for a baby um if you got I got health insurance\nYou know and you should have health insurance and um you know you've got your emergency fund and blood and you know you'll be able to budget the present and believe me your work it out um but yeah you don't really need an extra baby savings account unless you just want to save up enough to cover whatever normal labor and delivery is out of pocket\nYeah that would be it would be around a I think we pay like Fifteen hundred dollars toward you know the labor and delivery\nNurse that's easy enough to do during that's easy enough to do during a much okay\nYeah so you can just do that whenever that happens when when everybody's on the way you decide well run our cyber for that and and then you know anything you want to do that to an upgrade them move on and whatever comes after the emergency fund 'cause it's not an emergency him go much goes on emergency\nThis Fifteen hundred for the baby's not even an emergency or you can cover it it's a luxury to have that as extra savings or maybe came on my way right\nIt may be got here before you had to say you'll be All right\nOkay yeah you know and they're not curve balls are things that happened after baby step three\nAll right thanks for the call appreciate you joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five cliff is with us in Chapel Hill North Carolina Hi cliff our you\nKnow I Can't complain hair you'd make no\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\nWell first off I Want to thank you for what you help me and my wife to help pay off five thousand dollars worth of debt cool\nAre you are and are not next question are you in a way to find out and fight 'em right now we have about thirty thousand dollar down and on our house we got to land\nWe um we get land to build our own and also we're in an area that we really want to live and there are a lot of family around here great\nYes sir I can hear how much how can we afford what our income ... contract that we've been talking the recommended a U.S alone and you're not a fan of that\nAre absolutely not no I Would never do your do you\nKnow it's a it's a subsidized loan and if you ever sold the house or go to refinance the loan at any point you're going to pay back all the subsidy and in some\nYou can get really trapped in these things and they're nasty bad no I never would do with us the law I have had more problems with that loan working with people that are in trouble than any other loan I've dealt with\nWhile while no stay worthwhile as far as how much how you can afford we always say I'm you know put your down payment whatever that is the end of the formula rights and then the loan amount on a Fifteen\nYear fixed rate\nLoan which today is about five percent interest loan amount on a Fifteen year fixed rate loan is no more the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay\nAnd and that put you right where you want to be shown what you've done some really good stuff open

I mean there's also the small problem of not knowing exactly what to look for\nAnd I think you know while we've had many people saying well this is what you're supposed to look for these are many UFO researchers and writers that of take it upon themselves to researchers and writers scientists are like we don't know exactly what we're looking for\nSo they're arguing over synthetic lives are arguing over extraterrestrial biological life they're arguing over small cell organisms are arguing over aquatic life maybe like on cell it is or you know\nOther um ice planning it's icy moons like hop in Star Wars intelligent life does exist beyond our solar system\nI've always wondered well okay you want to communicate with alien ... how are they going to communicate with us I mean I'm would they even communicate like we do I mean would they use radio transmitters that use other forms of technology communicate I'm probably not\nAnd will be will say well they should be a bounce left in our language not necessarily I mean there are plenty of\nSmart or intellectually advanced human beings who don't speak the language you speak and sometimes we if they don't speak our language of misconstrued is being not as smart and that and that was one of the problems I had\nWhen I was learning a foreign language and uh you know as a young kid and I was like you know\nI was learning a language but I forgot that you know when I'm listening to someone else speak English from a different country you know they're trying to speak the language\nAnd sometimes we say well listen to them the way they speak they they don't know language enough so we we misinterpreted that is not being very smart but the truth the matter is that the fact that he can foreigners that they can even formed sentences the fact that they can even formed sentences that are even intelligible makes them intelligent\nIt's like the argument over whether or not millennia Trump was smarter whether or not being an underwear model made are stupid and they were comparing and Michelle Obama and I thought well God you know yeah I'm a shell has her good points uh and she's pretty smart but then they said no millennia Trump stupid and wait wait wait wait wait she speaks like what eight different languages\nAnd uh you know it's so ... I don't know how many that that Michelle Obama speaks but come on I mean if a person can speak that many languages are really smart and if they're able to keep track of those languages they're pretty smart in fact I envy one of the producers he speaks Mandarin Chinese\nHe speaks Mandarin Chinese I Would love to learn how to speak Mandarin Chinese because then I'd be able to say I speak English I speak Spanish and I speak Mandarin Chinese\nThe three languages that most people should learn if they want to get ahead in business only got two of them Spanish and English\nAnd Spanish is the language of labor\nOr English Mandarin will be the language big business because we all know the future and we all know where China is in our future so Mandarin Chinese baby\nGotta learn Mandarin so you can get around and you know border things on the menu other than general ... chicken so that's that's important of course if you want to be in business but the that's the thing you know communicating with daily and so that's a bigger deal\nDoing if we were you when languages but there are a lot of other people's ear on this planet ancient languages would be difficult I don't know if anybody speaks aromatic I'm a you know made up languages I guess that's Broncos made up we're going on is made up but you can still speak going on in Esperanto\nBut ah using radio transmitters using other things are lights signals hell even smoke signals these are a ways of\nCommunicating and so this seems to be what the preoccupation is right now\nI mean it used to be well we want proved aliens have arrived we want them to land on the White House lawn will Saturday and Medi\nCourses ... intelligence and many messaging extraterrestrial intelligence international\nThese groups are don't care if ... sign on the White House\nThey want to be able to get a signal a techno signature they want to be able to get something\nThat can prove that they're out they're communicating they they and and believe me I'm I'm going to tell you this today I was looking over notes and what prompted me to do this show tonight was an article in business insider\nOkay Business Insider talking about what we were talking about a few nights ago\nWith regard to extraterrestrials with regards to um the numbers with regard to techno signatures with regard to listening for the communication looking up and this guy seeing what ever it is is out there keeping your mind open\nLooking for extraterrestrials in space or\nLooking for a you know that moment you know we should be looking for those moments because those moments are happening more than we realize\nLast night there was a um there was a a\nHuge media I guess the crash in a place called ...

witnesses lasted forty five minutes\nThe eerie scene was filmed by a man named Renee ... back in December but only recently did he catch the attention of paranormal investigators according to the B will do witness Mr ...\nNoticed he basically noticed that there was this odd sound in northern Sweden he said that he was after snowstorm big snowstorm covered mountain top beautiful area quiet morning\nAnd get pretty ski it said this is really the says that the humming noise was constant and seemed almost by breathing the air above me although he expressed certainty\nThat the humble is coming from the sky ... Pinsky conceded that he couldn't quite determine from which direction was emanating from as it appears to be coming from every direction in the sky above me also noted the he had visited location before\nAnd that it's unusually very quiet there which was weird because that home could be hurting a quiet area which made the ... it would just be the more mystifying for him and he's you know what it what\nHe said that after about an hour you said the noise dissipated as debated a move somewhere else\nYeah how\nMany of you probably if your Internet uh ... it probably already heard that song because it's it's making the rounds cause it's an amazing sound especially when it's out in the middle of nowhere in in the snow in in northern sweet\nSo here is that sound it is a pulse wave sound that came from out of nowhere and uh we'll explain more about this pulse wave sound in what might be going not listen to this or we go [noise]\n\n\nSay that ah [noise] what's going on right now is the city is setting us up\n... up to mayor setting us up for it [laughter] yes ... up on the other day a week this setting us up I think for disclosure or at least to tell us so we have detected something but they do not know how to report it nor do they know how to identify it [noise]\nBut yet the sounds are skipping in these little rumbles these horn sounds all this stuff happening [noise] makes you wonder if they're all connected Tripoli successor three thirty seven hundred will be back\nDuring the day when good morning Orlando six till nine AM on news radio Ninety three point one [noise]\n\n[laughter] I'm Ron banks for closing on how they even have confidence when I signed for home equity loan only I let them\nShe's a victim of a devastating crime called mortgage fraud\n... title and mortgage are kept on line where these foreign and domestic hack them it's simple things for your title and borrow every penny of equity you happen to your whole life this police officer I Know about title fraud sorry register with home title walk and discovered some states had already taken over title\nThank God I found out on time no bank identity theft program or insurance protects you host title lock will for pennies day hold tight a lock puts a barrier around your homes title and mortgage the instant it detects tampering there on it helping to shut down\nFind out if you're already a victim of title fry get your hundred dollar shirt free with sign up they stayed home titled luck dot com\nHome title luck dot com\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it seeps are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet wouldn't it be great if there was a seats that had to look up a beautiful antique so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino\nIron works safe at rhino safe dot com American Made an antique styled our shapes up part art part furniture and all security\nAnd if you liked the classic look of our rhino iron works apes we also feature beautiful matching tool chess and furniture with hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers had to a huge network\nAcross the U.S we've built our reputation on having the best built best looking and most convenience sake splits great surface and warranties and you can get online financing so go with the best\nAnd get style convenience security and true peace of mind with rhino safe dot com today that's rhino safe dot com rhino safe fishing [noise]\nJeremiah in Oregon Hi Jeremiah on ground zero [noise]\n\nI don't\nCare if\nSomebody if I were on her way home from Cub Scouts over here and we saw that in your bed\nSo it is ...

S C I didn't know what it was a and then\nBecause I've never heard of ... when I Lived in Oregon for nearly a teen years a little town yeah\nSo ... and then uh other people said they they saw it in other states have big fireball so it must have been huge must be came in\nOn a trajectory out pretty huge and then uh and then of course they said that somebody had said that it was impact there was impacted style so somewhere ... there was a very very very valuable rock that came out of the sky and blew up\nNo kidding yeah yeah we kind of break apart and then move on but you get you to bring it up\nIt was okay with their any rumbling with dirty pop was there any boom I heard booms to is there a boom you heard\nWe were we were in the car I'm Sorry we were driving we just saw the light attack okay and it looked like it broke apart\nBut so I'm the only guy to report of this [laughter] a little\nHard we can tell right either\nOkay well titan what'd you think what what did you think what you thought\nOh I only got fire way out fast by about ... ...\nYeah I feel like it like so you didn't think it was an alien or anything to do when you first saw now I thought it was like doughnuts good old Tyler how old are you know you're almost ten was that your first fireball you've ever seen have you seen them before\nOne twenty\nWow what'd you in and that's an amazing thing you first think it's a firework men when you see it explode and you go wait a minute that's a firework what'd you think then\nYou got a little scare\nYou did well yeah I got a little I got a little scared when I saw my first fireball\nToo I was a little scared that was it was because I thought oh my God this is a big fireball is going to hit the planet and we were gone we're Garner's so that's good you're still around to talk about you'd be able to tell everybody about oh did you make a wish on a goodbye here if you make a wish that you get your wish did you make a wish\nNo okay\nI figured maybe we're wishing that the ... the parade is destroyed our planet\n[laughter]\nPretty big Well Tyler I really appreciate your eye with this report buddy\nYou for letting me\nOh you bet you bet buddy and Jeremiah thank you for the time was a I Would this report I really appreciate\nIt [laughter] to hear you better take care Bye bye Bye bye\nWow [laughter] iron Jeremiah saw the [noise]\nThe a big old fireball came down over ... county Oregon I I got a lot of people who set up all over the United states is western part of the United states is on his fireball\nBut it wasn't until it was reported out of Linn county was thing came down with you and some people so they heard a boom and bust and so obviously I hit the ground\nOver in ... S C I owe a ... a truly except for three thirty seven hundred extra believe six seven three three seven hundred meanwhile we're trying to determine what those sounds were heard out there in ah\nNorthern Sweden during the swing the guy who was recording some weird sounds coming out of out of the sky\nThat low rumble\nOf it he says he's never heard before\nDidn't sound like a car or a train or anything in the middle of nowhere mountains beautiful snowy mountains but of course there's this weird strange that noise coming out of a Utah in August of from Doug boy proving grounds was very where they may call the new area fifty one so we have to wonder if these are spaceships or if this\nIs part of a techno signature re\nWhen the sounds the patterns maybe the thing about many and setting and they're not telling us about it because they just don't know how to identify it were communicate back with a troubling things every three thirty seven hundred will be back [noise]\nMessaging database ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nYou know and I'm going to be there for him beat as a partner for his there's\nThis whole horrible storm passes overhead\nAnd so it was my little shot up can I drove people there in Florida and Georgia and all the places being affected by hurricane Michael so anyway so we were talking about today let me just to\nGet back to what we're talking about nine so I'm really I'm fascinated here and I am not going to let up until I get to the bottom is okay I'm fascinated by the comments coming out of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence\nAnd the\nMessaging extraterrestrial ... and they're beginning to act as though they are located something okay they're not telling us they've located something that I've had several meetings one in California University of California Irvine they had a workshop in Texas just a few weeks ago on how to identify\nTechnical signatures in space it's one of the reasons why we brought the black Cuban skull on because we wanted to talk about this type of signatures and maybe some people be up and we can pick up on low frequency higher frequency whatever so\nWe have to look at various ways and aliens will be will make contact with this or how we make contact with that money on this program as well I mean not just the black you but we've also at times even Ron brought this up would you do to reduce\nWe'd blow into did reduce and we'd blow them over the over the ... over the years in hopes that the signal would go out on all the radios all over the country and all the signals all over the country which some huge orange found this ancient sound\nI'm sure aliens would understand and listen to and uh\nYou know and and nights we do this we've had like UFO's sightings you had all kinds of cool things going on just last night we had a a a huge fireball come down out of the sky silent Oregon in Lincoln county\nUp you were telling you about it or we just got tired and Jeremiah calling the program and left\nAre seeing the base that was the only guy reported it makes me wonder if anybody else thought\nAnd apparently had had an impact a little bit of boom there\nBut see I've been reading a lot of things lately about this whole techno signature clue stuff and for more advanced um\nYou know what they're looking for more advanced civilizations using these types of signatures\nWell I also was reading that there are some people that are bitter believing that uh there's more to it than just listening for the techno signatures that we may be\nUnder the control of some of these techno signatures of the human ears picked up on the signals and unbeknownst to most people it's affecting them in different ways so far there's been no need to panic because they don't know which is how the struggles affecting people but it certainly is affecting people in the truth is\nThat there are plenty of extraterrestrial singles out there the world's it'd be the whole universe is awash in extraterrestrial single so we can't even perceive\nOr do we even know about unless someone else ... basically says listen that you hear that that's what we're looking at right now the end so city and many the guys that runs city and Betty spend a lot of time wondering how these messages are being transmitted\nThey're hoping they can find the source before more people pick up on that sound at the moment there you know because it buried actually buried in the\nBackground of earth noise but uh\nLike I said some people were already hearing this pulsing sound I recently there was a a story out of Sweden where mysterious humming sound was recorded the sound is a constant pulsing home\nAccording to witnesses laughed at forty five minutes to an hour\nA there was there's a film on the Internet going by right now a snow covered mountains ... out in the middle of nowhere you living out there are a bunch of guys on a\nOn a snowmobiles and they come by occasionally but what you hear is just a really low frequency home and here's that sound this is from a northern Switzerland\nOr a man by the name of Renee ... Pinsky\nHad a record of this back in December after snowfall just recently got the attention of a paranormal investigator sitting here is that home really\nNo that's not the home a straight another ... it's a wait a minute [laughter] here's behind that was from Utah here's another um\n[noise]\n\n\nSo this was filmed by a man named Renee ... Pinsky back in December mysterious humming noise that day he picked up on he said that uh it was rattling the house she said that it was a blanket was rattling the sky\nOr very missed it by you said it was like something was moving from one end of the sky to the other\nBig could not figure out what it was it was like some invisible seeing move across the sky was rumbling a sonics out\nIn August that was reporter of another home near ... proving grounds which of course segue proving ground some people say is the northern arm a very fifty one it's in Utah I've been there it has a lot of ah gates in danger signs don't go in there and uh\nSo here's that sound of the home at Doug way which is a little bit more aggravating to hear but here it is [noise]\n\n\n\nYou know earlier I had talked about how a sound like these the humming sweet and in the ... in ah Utah Doug way reminded me of a well known a recording of police officers in Saint Helens Oregon\nUh they said they saw white a bright light on the Columbia River at four thirty in the morning or for twenty three in the morning\nAnd they wanted to be able to record the sound of this ship the spaceship as it was taking off from the Columbia and I wanted to play that moment against you can hear how it compares to the other sounds you've heard so here's the recording the police officers recording to take off his UFO\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] so you have it says the Helens Oregon police officers watching a UFO take off from the Columbia king up their microphone on the radio so you can hear your the home to the sound and this is why you know these sonic sounds or whatever they may be\nA these strange noises that were picking up on in the skies not just the orange anymore these homes these lower homes these are these pulsating home now these could be experimental aircraft but then again they could be as I've said before\nSome sort of techno ... signature technological signature from extraterrestrials okay [noise] some extraterrestrial intelligence [noise] sending pulses [noise] and the setting them through space\nOr the setting them through the skies and were picking up on [noise] and ah [noise] we don't know what kind of effect it has on people but he certainly amazing [noise]\nHere's what speech crafted their craft sound like a what the Homs sound like when we play the [noise] so uh I mean if you've heard them and you've written off as a as the night is I like to talk with you wouldn't let you and ask you both actually where you've heard the because there's wealth [noise]\nThere's also possibly the elites we'd be trying to connect us or contact despite some other means I'm going to talk about bad as well triple each accent mystery thirty seven hundred

for closing on how they even have documents than I think for a home equity loan only I mean\nShe's the victim of a devastating chronic called mortgage fraud\nAnd then there's the ... brewery neutrino observatory located in the former in a mine complex suddenly Ontario and it's operated by a group called snow lab okay so\nHe's neutrino detecting facilities exist and they're in in various places around the globe but I find interesting is that they have one in an article called the ice cube\nAnd they're they're they're trying to detect neutrinos but recently there was a story in Scientific American that indicated that something was happening ... actually was happening in in Antarctica\nMay see the even seal the deal on ... communication or actually a signature left behind by extraterrestrials or there are bizarre particles\nTo keep flying out of an article size and they may shattered modern physics reserve neutrinos there there are special kinds of neutrino and physicists don't know what what they are exactly but they do know\nIt's a ... it comes about and some sort of ... high energy particles blasted its way through space in the beer and then back out the poll yet and and so this isn't an article something comes in at the top of the planet comes out of Antarctica\nBut the particles that are coming out\nA physicist are saying this is going to change the standard model of physics if uh we find out\nOr why these are these particles are doing or somebody they don't normally do I mean see you know when you look at the standard model model of particle physics these nano particles with these neutrinos or whatever they may be\nThey shouldn't be able to do what they do but they're doing so I mean look there are low energy neutrinos that can pierce through miles upon miles of rock and affected but these are high energy neutrinos\nAs weather as well as fighting a detecting other high energy particles\n[noise] they have large cross sections that means they almost always crashing something soon after zipping into earth and never make it out the other side but [noise] it's it's been going on since March twenty sixteen [noise] okay [noise] march of twenty sixteen [noise] now do you remember what happened in February [noise]\nWell a refresher memory apparently there were a lot of people who fought but aliens and landed\nIn Antarctica and maybe they kind of have\nBut ah [noise] I'll tell you about the timeline here\nAbout a month before the discovery for the month after the ... with a month after the discovery\nOf of these nano particles something bizarre happened we had a number of people we had\nA Russian patriarch few others go down to Antarctica to visit this may be why we'll be back\nOn the News I'm Carmen Roberts hurricane

having in Antarctica at least seven it's been going on\nSince March twenty sixteen [noise] February March twenty sixteen\nSo okay so let's just go back to the timeline for just a bit go back to the timeline gay so December\nI'm twenty seven teams we heard these homes gay August of twenty Eighteen we heard this strange comes in Utah okay well we go back to twenty six team\nDo you remember the focus everybody had on Antarctica research into extraterrestrial relationships twenty six feet before march twenty sixteen and the discovery of these strange particles emanating from Antarctica\nHe's alien neutrinos is causing signature in an article Russian patriarch here real visited a Russian outpost in Antarctica he reportedly went there to see the penguins are blessed the penguins they say\nWell just over a month later on march twenty third President Obama visited the southern orange and China resort of ... and some say that he was there also to investigate a moon communications outpost it was going to be built in Patagonia by the Chinese\nOh he was also rumored to have also been washed away to Antarctica now why well November ninth twenty sixteen\nElections right secretary of State John Kerry lands in Antarctica just after the U.S presidential election we have to hand off between Obama and Trump\nBut why is John Kerry flying to Antarctica what was said that he was there to observe find conditions brought on by climate change but why would you go out of his way to sci fi and conditions brought on by climate change to avoid\nThe election\nDoesn't make any sense does it doesn't make sense to be plans to go there during critical time in the United states in\nA secret trip to Antarctica Apollo eleven astronaut Buzz Aldrin he was there now why would they call it an astronaut because why well they wanted the astronaut\nTo see it so we have a president we have a secretary of state\nWe have a Russian Orthodox a patriarch and ah we have astronaut Buzz Aldrin but he got there he got sick he got a cold altitude sickness as long as we're filling up with new cars\nAnd they had to fly them out of Antarctica so\nRussian religious strict you're a U.S secretary of state and astronaut president all went to Antarctica after scientists discovered what could be evidence of extraterrestrials I'll be a communication and our life forms that that live off the air there\n\nOkay we talked about the species that they found there from Boston\nSo uh I mean\nI don't know if you remember back when we talked about they found this new bacterium in an article that can survive solely off the chemicals in the air um they can live off for the high other other things would be toxic in carcinogenic to us are really bad for us but uh these organisms\nIs it your stress said whoa whoa whoa distressing All right it all all\nBut anyway he Charlie space where did you go you\nKnow they're originating in space but coming out in an article on the planet\nHe's somehow being used as a transmitter for these\nBeyond the model neutrinos are coming out [noise]\nClimate the south and which is kind of funny when you think about so John thanks for the call of\nGoing in coming out the other side\nAnd uh they're saying this could be a techno signature of some kind of [laughter]\nFrom extraterrestrial intelligence [noise]\nIt does not fit the model of a [noise]\nYou know some of the things we and I'm also thinking maybe certain has something to do with this but then again you know [noise]\nI like to sing and failing but you know certain can be responsible as well I mean we could be released you\nNeeded to plan it could be coming out reading [noise] during the neutrinos that we've never seen before because of the experiments were done I don't know what do you think
