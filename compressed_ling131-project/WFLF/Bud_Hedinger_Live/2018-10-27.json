capital gains taxes I suggest you listening and calling from family members listening now too\nAnd we have Brian Evans here when I say he is a nationally published author radios CPA and personal financial specialist\nUnlike me he did get the ring the bell for the New York stock exchange celebrating the launch of his three broad market exchange traded funds which has been doing fantastic ever since\nHe's been a CPA since Nineteen eighty six and investment advisor he has some books out somebody might have read the prosperous revelation any of the new one out the news release complete book to a retirement which I read which is fantastic\nThe radio show he has he's been I guess a analysts on CNBC Fox News a regular contributor to clip injure on line so he does he's done and we're on\nAnd he's here to talk about real estate because this is the one thing that I Know all my listeners asked me all the time should I buy real estate which they do and so we're here to answer some of those questions and get some ... thank you so much for being here today\nYou bet I I got tired of listening to that ... maybe a vacation or something here doing some cool stuff than [laughter]\nUh yeah but you know what we do is very important and and basically with the real estate here or what I wanted to uh help contribute on your show is a problem facing a just\nMany many of my clients and your clients and and people across the country is they've done well in real estate they've invested they've done the work they've gotten\nIt to a point but the one thing that they don't have the one thing is they don't have an exit strategy\nSo they've they've got this real estate and here's some of the issue is that some of that but it was a I got this phone call or from the fella and he says you know I have on this apartment complex for\nForty years my cash those terrible because Everytime I get ahead I have to put it back in Seventy moves out I got to replace a roof I got to replace carpets I got to do something\nAnd says I don't want to show and pay all that income tax I'd like to do and exchange\nExcept that wouldn't solve anything but I'm Still going to be a property manager I don't want to show it before I pass away and give it to my ears because that can get step up and basis if I if I you know weight\nBut he says I'm tired I'm eighty years old I don't want to do this anymore\nWhat's your solution and so that's that's what I heard it talked about his ... anybody that owns investment real estate and watch an exit strategy wants to have really good cash flow watch appreciation day they like owning real estate\nDon't want to be a landlord anymore don't want to pay the income tax wants newer properties are there more diversified uh this is a solution that uh we're going to be talking about here on the show today\nVery exciting and very exciting I'm can you tell us exactly the storyline and what it is um that might work for people that are listening to own highly appreciate it real estate\n[noise] yeah basically uh the the kind of real estate I'm Talking about is investment real estate and that can take many forms it could be a farm in Indiana it could be peace overall antics me apartment building rental houses office buildings\nWhatever something help for investment which means that wasn't a vacation home or your primary residence essentially and so do you yell this property for investment and it's probably gone up in value even if it hasn't you'd probably depreciated it\nDown to the raw land or minimal\nAmount so if you sell it there's a huge tax on waiting for you typically so what I'm Talking about is just a a typical for people in real estate they'll know what I'm Talking about but ... it's called the section ten thirty one exchange where you sell your investment real estate [noise] the proceeds\nTemporarily go to an attorney say that's listed as a qualified intermediary McHugh I recall so you sell your property the money goes in escrow temporarily and then you go out and you find a different kind of investment properties that you want to invest in\nWell again the problem with that as you don't want to be a landlord anymore and maybe there aren't any good deals where you're at and it's you're done with that part of your life fear here at the distribution phase of your life not at the building phase of investing and so what we're talking about is just ten thirty one into a different kind of property passive real estate\nAnd what I mean by that is real estate you don't have to manage\nIts real estate that may be and a new or multifamily apartment complexes or self storage or\nLong term lease medical office building or something of that nature and you can mix and match and the only way that you can do the section ten thirty one exchange into a passive real estate that you don't have to be the landlord is here's something called a Delaware statutory trust at B. S. T.\nOkay very interesting and that was a mouthful so basically\nIf you have a highly appreciate at home and it could be a thirty year old home and they're going to sell it basically they can take the proceeds and kind of do roll over and now they're not paying the capital gains taxes so\nLet me follow up with that so typically when somebody passes away there's a a step a basis to the beneficiary what happens in the D. S. T. for beneficiaries that he passed away and you've done this\n[laughter] yeah that that has retained the ability for the step up because if you sell as say a million dollar property and you saw it a month before you pass away you know you might have a two\nHundred two hundred and fifty thousand dollars of income tax to pay [noise] but if your heirs inherited they\nThey don't have any income tax to pay at all or they get to step up and basis or won't be any income tax on all of the games and all the depreciation recapture that was going to have the income taxes assessed on it up\nBuy or sell any financial vehicle pet performance is not guaranteed to result investments can fluctuate in when redeemed maybe worth more or less than when they originally invested than you will the ... the ... management healthy or not a billion with nor endorse by the Social Security administration\nOr any other government agency and do not provide legal or tax by please consult with your attorney accounting ... concerning your particular circumstance I knew the guarantees rely solely on financial strengthen claims paying ability of the issuing insurance company does any wealth and WFL a are not affiliated\nFor listening to today's edition of the retirement coffee talk radio show don't forget to tune in every Wednesday from eight to nine PM and every Saturday morning from six to six thirty right here until you F.

show sixty minutes captivated audiences around North America with a special segment of the French paradox\nDo you remember the French paradox this is a counterintuitive concept that says red wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best activates genes that control our weight\nOr energy healthy aging and even longevity\nThe holy grail of medical research and what did they find out of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was written vierra troll yes Rosemary troll the active ingredient found in that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nOur guest today says that's just half the story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce for over Twenty years Dr precedent is the institution of New York radio host these old highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a long time product formulate her and high level advisor for purity products Dr ... welcome\nAboard mark ... speaking to ya\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's talk to them as ... phenomenon those people out there who just vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is was very ... why is it all over the news today\nWell first of all it sure is all over the news are specially the Health News\nYou know I read about twenty help journals a week and every one of them seems to have an article about virtual basically erodes virtual is what we call a collie feeding all it's found in red wine it's grounded purple grape juice it's found in berries founded\nAnd the interesting thing about Roseburg ritual is it's actually produced by plant\nPlants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury and it kind of infection and against any kind of radiation\nAnd the scientists really first became interested and resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when raspberry ... first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that ...\nIt's very rituals seem to extend the life of fruit flies of worms and even some fish well anything that extends the life of anything is going to pick the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow well\nBy two thousand six tatty and scientists discovered that resveratrol extend the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and an even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand sex and here's what really got them interested a hobbit researcher David Sinclair\nReported that resveratrol counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice bite thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seem to protect the intestines and the colon definitely supported normal ... activity in the body it improved in ...\nIt was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved enduring storing aerobic activity and it even proved to support brain function great study from Weill Cornell Medical school in New York I was just reading that even neutralizes free radicals\nBut the reason the bottom line reason market that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any perceived health threat like not eating enough\nCaloric restriction your body feels threatened this switches on what they call the longevity gene in your body it switches on a sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a cellular level metabolism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the tape according to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard no this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening in all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWow this is amazing but let me just sit back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years of their co Q. formulas with your co enzyme Q. ten would you say is just as important as reservists role especially your heart healthy and you also see some ways it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs you
