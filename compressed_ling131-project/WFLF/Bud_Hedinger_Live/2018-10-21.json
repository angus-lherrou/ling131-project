I'm Pam who sales Fox News the fatal shooting of a police officer has authorities in Georgia looking for a teenager officer Antwon Tony was killed yesterday in ... county\nPut them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derives so it's kind of like you can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and\nThat's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both\nAntioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies and protect our organ systems so they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this\nIs really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial\nOne product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging but what are you seeing recently in the press I Know you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased\nPlasma anti accident activity in whole blood get assigned you recap\nSome of these headlines and tell me why you're such a green tea advocates\nWhat you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity\nIs really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume ... don't actually wind up in the body in any signal the green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nThey improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is you get this great concentration of antioxidants\nSubstances which a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells\nOf your body your organs every part of your body from premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants are\nThese produce more of its own super protective compound called\nGlue the thigh bone so you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue to thigh on so\nIt is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nAll right let's switch gears and talk about this for human which is number two on you listen by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula will be offering free bought on a few minutes but talk to me about the human which is spelled C. U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of it\nBut scientists and researchers know it's one of the most powerful super feeds on the planet you can positively influence our DNA maintain joint comfort healthy inflammation in more can you share some of the incredible headlines on human and tell us why you use this patented\nB. C. M. Ninety five formula of Kirk human which seven times greater absorption\nOkay well first of all I think well people might not know the term Kirk human they may well no ... which is a yellow spice and it shows up in curies and\nIt's part of the five thousand year old Indian higher ... system of medicine I've been studying tumor Rick and its derivative Kirk humans since the Nineteen seventies\nAnd I'll say this right off the bat that they are almost no plant materials in the world as extensively\nStudied is this a couple of thousand\nStudies can be found in the scientific and medical literature we know that Kirk human is powerfully antioxidant we know that it has a remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon\nIt greatly enhances joins health so people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse\nThis really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective\nIt helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol and one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that Kirk human actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so\nIt causes your body to produce these\nAgents in the brain that protect the actual issue of the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this and specifically the B. C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned\nOffers about seven times the absorption of any other Kirk human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion\nIs one of the most life and Hansing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just decades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nNow Chris I Know that we talked about the green tea in the current human in your new green tea GR liquid ... formula which purity is given away for free today but tell me about the third nutrient on the list the risk ritual which is super hot right now here was on some of the headlines and the science behind was very ...\nI Know it's from red wine and French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds that I just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does\nIt is found in wine grapes it also shows up and cranberries what we know about resveratrol is that like green tea and also like Kirk human extract it's profoundly antioxidant\nBut more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body if that happened during aging as a result of\nFat accumulation in tissue and insulin\nSensitivity resveratrol helps to protect against those things so it's a powerful immune regulator\nAnd you know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this\nIs why it's considered one of the key is to the so called French paradox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health but is there a trial appears to be\nKey in that and additionally there is a brain benefit like\nThere is with the current cumin with blood flow to the brain so when you take resveratrol you get rain blood flow this means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that would just plain take too long to explain\nIt again we're talking with Chris ... also known as the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well chrysalis laser in on this wonderful formula you created in conjunction with ...

originally Fifteen Years ago when the renowned TV show sixty minutes captivated audiences around North America where the special segment of the French paradox\nDo you remember the French paradox this is the counter intuitive concept that says\nRed wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best activates genes that control our weight or energy healthy aging and even longevity\nThe holy grail of medical research and what did they find out of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was was there a troll ... the active ingredient found in that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nOur guest today says that's just half the story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce them for over Twenty years Dr president has been an institutional New York radio host in his own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a longtime product formulate her and high level advisor for purity products Dr ... welcome\nAboard mark ... speaking to ya\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's turn to them as ... nominate on those people out there who just vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is was very ... why is it all over the news today well first of\nAll it sure is all over the news especially the Health News\nYou know I read about twenty health journals or weekend every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically reservoir troll is what we call a poly feeding all it's found in red wine it's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries that have been found in ...\nAnd the interesting thing about Roseburg ... is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation\nAnd scientists really first became interested and resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when raspberry ritual was first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms that even some fish well anything that extends the life of anything is going to the attention of scientists\nYou are absolutely wow\nBy two thousand six fatty and scientists discovered that resveratrol extend the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and an even increased their swimming of go well also in two thousand six and\nHere's what really got them interested a Harvard researcher David Sinclair reported that rich ferret troll counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice bite thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seem to protect the intestines and the colon ... definitely support it normal and it's a matter of activity\nIt improved in ... it was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved enduring storing aerobic activity and it even proved to support brain function great\nStudy from Weill Cornell Medical school in New York I was just reading that even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason market that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any perceived health threat like not eating enough caloric restriction your body feels threatened this switches on what they call the longevity gene in your body it switches on sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a secular level but capitalism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the tape\nAccording to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard no this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking ... pretty much every day\nWell this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years of their co Q. formulas with your co enzyme Q. ten which is just as important as reservists role especially your heart healthy and you'll see in some ways it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs ... ... what exactly is good for\nCaloric restriction eating less slows the pace of aging\nThat's pretty darn impressive and what they found in laboratory studies of animals is that an extended lifespan\nAnd it appears that caloric restriction eating less food and you're eating right now by a certain percentage\nIncreases your longevity you'll live longer it increases the activity of what we call a longevity gene they get switched on they help to improve metabolism it increases your ability to cope your ability to adapt in fact this\nGene helps increase tissue repair and\nSwitched on by a group of genes called sirtuin now they found two things at Harvard number one caloric restriction increases these longevity genes these ...\nWell so does resveratrol at least in their animal studies and this is exactly why ... been making all these worldwide headlines because if it works in humans as it does and these animals and I'm optimistic it will\nIt represents an entirely new approach to managing health and wellness where we potentially use any traditional compound like Reza ... target the exact genes associated with these various areas of improvement that our health and our aging and our longevity\nWell now that the person you say that took you ten holds an elite status in the nutritional supplements industry because it's been so well documented and so well researched maybe give us a brief overview of the research and explain why co Q. ten research is so widely respected\nWell let's go back to Nineteen fifty seven University of Wisconsin the Nobel Prize for Peter Mitchell in Nineteen Seventy eight\nThe University of Texas Medical school Purdue University in Indiana University of Grenada in Spain talking about co Q. ten being a powerful anti ... major studies major universities right here in the United states and abroad the bottom line and these studies\nEnergetic mitochondria without co Q. ten you don't have an energy combine that with resveratrol I'm telling you pretty darn amazing\nNow that you present purity products occasionally does these free bottled give away with this one sounds really special wasted is so important\nWell I mean you really get an opportunity you get a chance to see for yourself what I'm Talking about I\nMean you hear me say some pretty amazing things and you say well that's pretty interesting but until you know and you try it for yourself by taking too soft shelves a day of this co Q. super boosts formula\nYou're not going to really appreciate what I'm

talking about ... but you've added vitamin D to this and you've added vitamin B. twelve yeah\nNow many people go through life not knowing that they've got to co Q. ten deficiency with vitamin D vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these factors\nWell right now I think at this point in time there's more research being done on vitamin D that pretty much any other vitamin or nutrient and the reason is listen to this one\nBillion people worldwide do not get enough vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine well I mean that's a lot of people now listen to this\nWhen most people think of vitamin D day of bone and bone health you might think of sunlight as well or vitamin D also plays a very powerful role as a supporter of the immune system\nIt supports immune system health in fact it also helps support brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and a great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function it supports a healthy colon on top of all of that\nAnd a great in the study at at the University of Hawaii talking about vitamin D and colon health I mean who thinks that those\nThings right yeah that's amazing\nSo I think it's a welcome addition to this amazing formula co Q. super boosts formula in addition to that I said that you can look we should put some B. twelve and here as well and it's called ... and I say that because the

measures at Mexico's border with Guatemala we're about two thousand migrants just fine police orders yesterday to turn back\nKorea Team is the premier sports nutrients so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach is of course they knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there but there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating that it might be considered too much of an\nEdge but back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee they came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here\nKorea Team can be used by athletes\nTo enhance their performance and now that it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing that for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff is amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it every strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in space stronger with hundreds of human studies and it's the purest\nForm of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat the problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat and he's like four pounds of red meat a day most people aren't going to do that right and what about vegetarian they can be Korea teen deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient and I put 'em on average strong they noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low on it you know if you're a person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general this is for you you definitely want to add that average grow\nSo obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teen is going mainstream a lot of studies are showing the folks in their fifties sixties seventies and beyond Korea teen can be a cornerstone compound to help people stay strong stay healthy stay sharp stay vital right\nOh exactly I mean this is the ideal muscle enhancing strengthening muscle protecting nutrient for folks as we get older fifty plus or like you and me pat let's go to a couple of studies on seniors just to show this we'll do one on the guys and one on the gals when I\nFirst on the guys love the title of this one Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older men\nStudy done it several American universities a group of men get this pet age fifty nine to Seventy two hey you know we can do that is not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week stunned\nPeople need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works get this the guys on Korea Team\nThey put on four pounds of lean mass that's muscle tissue for those that

about\nChange and the God\nMaking the cross of Christ you're alone will change your whole outlook on life will bring you into a relationship a friendship with God the kind that God wants to have with you\nIt will give got his chance to make you more and more the kind of person that he intended to be [noise]\nAnd that's pretty wonderful\nConsidering what God has got to work with in the case of most of us\nDr Hoffman messages titled\nHello I'm Mark I sure thanks for joining us today your gifts and prayers help the Lutheran our bring Christ to the nations and the nation's to the church thank you for your free full support\nRapid technological and social change is not new it was already taking place more than sixty years ago when the sermon we're about to hear was first broadcast here's how Lutheran our speaker Dr oz won't Hoffman expressed in this message from Nineteen fifty five\nAt the close of his last session of the United States Congress representative introduced a bill to give the name astronaut to a new object not yet in existence the latest addition to the family whose birth has been announced as being about two years off\nIs the satellite which scientists hope to shoot into outer space\nIt is expected to revolve around here it's about two hundred two or three hundred miles above the earth's surface\nAnd to keep on going around for several weeks or even for months\nUntil it finally ... our atmosphere and is destroyed by the heat which friction will then create things are happening pretty fast these days when the dreams of a decade ago become reality so quickly\nPeople dreamed about flying for centuries for example before flying actually became a reality and then it didn't come through the flapping wings there's some people thought it would\nBut right up through the application to power driven craft of the principles which enabled birds to fly by simply flapping their wings\nAnd by gliding about motionless in the sky all of this took a long time today even to move more quickly Frederick Lewis Allan titled his book about the years Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundred and fifty the big change\nThe biggest changes however have taken place since Nineteen hundred and fifty during the last five years there is the prospect of even bigger things to come with automation industry for example automation was a term coined by a Ford Motor company executive in Nineteen forty five to describe the new industrial revolution\nIn which machines are being developed to run the machines that we already have several a of Canada has a machine to city blocks long that completely processors motors and the assembly of automobiles\nThe telephone dial system bank clearing houses and other enterprises are in the midst of automation right now\nWho is to say how much our lives are going to be affected by these developments as well as those in the field of the peaceful use of Atomic Energy\nWhich are coming along a lot faster than most people recognize right now things are happening so fast but it is impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better\nIs there no way to get a grip on anything in our rapidly developing civilization someone has said that our world has been so quickly inoculated with Christianity that very likely will never catch the real thing is there a real seeing something you can hang onto if so what is it\nI Want to talk to you for just a few minutes about the real thing\nThe one that never changes is what we preach about on this program we preach Christ crucified\nSt Paul said that he went on to say that wherever he preached Christ crucified he was met by in credulity and skepticism about we preach Christ crucified he said on through the Jews that is to the people who took religion seriously\nA stumbling block and under the Greeks that is the people who were intellectual foolishness but under them which are called both Jews and Greeks without discrimination Christ the power of God\nAnd the wisdom of God it did not bother St Paul's that people could not seem to understand the simple fact of Christ cross or did not even want to try to understand it he did not modify his preaching a water it down because of this fact\nHe just said this is what we preach we preach Christ crucified\nTake it or leave it but when you don't even remember what you are leaving behind and what it is going to mean to you we preach Christ crucified at St Paul's way of saying that sin or whatever other name you wanted to give to a departure from God and his law\nIs a costly business it costs some body crucifixion\nIt costs us most of all those of us who are singers and whoever else is not her center\nSin makes cowards of us all and it makes us enemies as well you've heard him and say I'm In the doghouse these days what do you mean to say is that he made an appointment with his wife to select wallpaper for the living room and then forgot all about it a promise to bring home ice cream for dinner\nAnd failed to remember his promise he came in and out of the rain and track ... over the living room run\nIt takes a good case and maybe a bouquet of flowers the next day to get things straightened out all too often\nBeing in the doghouse is not only a matter of our having incurred the anger if somebody else but it's a matter of two of our setting up a wall between them and us through our own feeling of guilt we don't want to give we don't want to admit that we were wrong\nIt only makes things worse to know that we were wrong and that's the situation in which every man finds himself with God\nThe meaning of Christ cross is that God took the initiative to break that wall down to get us out of the spiritual dog house and this was known me or tactical maneuver on his pot\nHe loved us he pity dies he determined that nothing should be allowed to stand in a way of that love is even if it meant taking all our guild upon himself God so love the world\nThat he sent his only be gotten son all we like sheep had gone astray we turn to every one to his own way but the lord laid on him the inequity of us all\nHe was wounded for our transgressions\nHe was bruised for our inequities upon him was laid the chance to summon that made us hole and with his stripes we are here we preach Christ crucified\nSt Paul said that there is if there is a connection between the cross and our seeing and there is a Saint Paul said to the collections\nGod has forgiven you all your sins priced tests utterly wiped out that damning evidence of broken laws and commandments which are\nTongue over our heads and it's completely a noted by nailing it over his own head toward across\nAnd then having drawn this thing of all the powers ranged against us\nHe exposed them shattered empty and defeated in his final glorious triumphant act and that of course was the right direction [noise]\nDo you have a sense of personal inadequacy is there the annoying feeling at your soul that you on to everything that you should be constantly irritated by your business associates your friends members have your family or your father by temptations of one kind or another\nThat keep coming back no matter how hard you try to dispel them I can promise you that acceptance of Christ crucified\nWill solve all of your personality problems will solve any of them immediately but this I say with complete confidence\nMaking the cross of Christ your own where change your whole outlook on life it will bring you into a relationship a friendship with God the kind that God wants to have with you\nIt will give you got his chance to make you more and more the kind of person that he intended to be and that's pretty wonderful\nConsidering what God has got to work with in the case of most of us\nIt's pretty wonderful all around at a godsend his son and that he died to bring us back to God\nBecause the glory and the wonder of it which caused St Paul to say to all of us price did not send me to see how many I could baptize\nBut to proclaim that gospel\nAnd I have not done this by the persuasive nest of clever words\nFor I have no desire to Rob the cross is power\nThe preaching of the cross is I Know nonsense to those who are involved in this dying world to wash who are being safe from that debt it is nothing less than the power of God it is written\nI Will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the ... the prudent will I reject fucking city or what have the philosopher the writer and a critic of this world to show for all of their wisdom has not gone made the wisdom of this world foolish\nFor it was after the world and its wisdom had failed to no God that he and his wisdom chose to save all who wouldn't believe by the simple mindedness of the gospel message", "year":
