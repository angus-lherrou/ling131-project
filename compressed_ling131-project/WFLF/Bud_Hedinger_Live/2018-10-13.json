October fest\nA new book called beer hacks one hundred tips tricks and projects offers a lot of conversation starters and raised eyebrows it's written by Ben Robinson who's also entered and editor in chief of the observer been what inspired you\nFrom day one or maybe I'm you know you're Twenty one let's call it\nAlways loved the stuff but as far as ah the book I think that a lot of ways that came about from just picking up these things over the years I think I could look back um to college when you have a beer bottle of beer that fat a twist off but you don't have it opener\nUm but somebody always had a bit later on them and I got taught a kind of the party trick of being able to to wedge a bottle of beer open with a lighter um and then you know kind of accumulated some others along the way and then you know like was\nSilly enough to talk to an editor um themselves was silly enough to say we should make\nThis a book [laughter] the\nThe big lighter that's if if I follow along correctly in the book as a matter of using it as a wedge basically right against a tightly gripped finger around the bottleneck\nExactly after grip correctly or it's all laid out there um with illustration diagrams\nAnd everything you need to figure it out but yeah you're actually using a the lighter as a as a lever a lever and your finger as a full um so it's all highly scientific as you can go\nRight [laughter] end up for those in desperation mode even holding up a piece of paper super super tightly can function the same way\nI think yeah that's a great one that one's actually um something of a bar bet to where you tell people buy buy chicken open this\nYear with a piece of paper that way you can uh you fold it six or seven times until you have a thin very stiff about hunk of paper um and use the same principles and then somebody who is your beer [laughter]\nWhat's been Robbins and he's got a new book called ... tips tricks and projects he's also editor in chief of the observer what about the some of these projects which put together on that\nUm in some of these are really fun um a lot of them in all of\nWrapping a empty beer bottle with a piece of string that you've doubt in Africa and lighting it on fire [noise]\nUm so that was you know one of one of the more enjoyable testing phases of creating this book um but it'll basically sever its way through the beer\nA and you can turn it into a glass of drinking glass to then put beer in um I'd recommend you know standing heavily\nOr just to protect your mouth\nUm they can create tiki torches or that you can put outside to ward off ... which unfortunately um scientists haven't figured out exactly why I don't know that they've been spending all their time on this uh mosquitoes love people who've been drinking beer so you gotta\nGotta fight 'em off um [noise] yeah there's a number of other you can make shot glasses I'm with the\nBasically the the bottom next um that you've severed off from the bottle and yeah I think there's like some it's some fun stuff to do and I think all these things or you know better than getting five cents at the recycling center\nThey spend ...

I'm Gordon Deal thanks for listening to this weekend [noise]\n\n\nAnd basically I ladies on the phone and she says this is Karen I have something interesting to tell you and then hangs up so everybody has a framed sprinting Karen rider thank God I'm like semi from Cannes to cheat on his cell phone because it's a basic tended to number\nLike eight or nine to wait for eight seven six but he's a numbers from like um British Isles Jamaica to many ugly when you call the number back Randy they charge you long distance\nColleen a fees and they're really really large so I'm very careful folks now that we're talking about the phone scams there's always a new scan out there almost every day and um don't call miss Karen back [laughter]\nIt's a lot different than have your refrigerator running yeah there are better do catch it yeah it's a little different than that it'll cost you money right\nYeah a lot of money from what I've heard so far are writing it's a retirement coffee talk with Sharif wherever Smith we always you know if there's a new scam out there we always like to highlight it because people call and say\nHey what's going on with this and that's something that we handle regularly and when you have a financial advisor on your team you can call with those kind of questions and that's really a valuable resource to yet\nSo here's one thing that I Know that Sharif loves to talk about a little bit it's football and that's what we're going to do today and we're gonna we're gonna you know if you if you look at the best coach in college football's people might say Nick Saban they might say others\nIf you look at the best coach in pro football no doubt people are going to bring up build ... and he's of course the coach of\nThe New England patriots won a lot of Super Bowls\nHe was just recently interviewed on CNBC the financial networks and he talked about\nBuilding a game plan\nThere's a lot of things that are similar here to building a financial plan to take a listen\nYou know what you're doing and you have an idea what they're going to do with it\nOnce you get into the game and those are really\nEasy but relatively easy or more manageable situations review the communications [noise]\nTry to make sure that everybody's on the same page with all the way it is probably not going to work or if it's just simple\nThat might not work either because it's so obvious so here's All right we\nGet we get a plan we reviewed the plan we make adjustments if it's too complicated no good if it's too simple no good we have to have good execution ... Sharif sounds a lot about what we talk about every week doesn't it\nYes preparing for that game plan so whether you're playing baseball or your football your football coach or soccer coach or wherever yeah there there was a game plan to everything that you do and you have to strategize and you have to look out for your opponents and he got to be off and said you have to be defensive and you're always changing up the plants and nobody\nUh figures you our ... personally but I mean that's the same thing when you're preparing for retirement Randy you want to review often you want to adjust when needed to be addressed and\nOn and you want to execute so it it there's no difference whether you're a professional athlete or a code you\nVersus being professional retiree right do you plan to be a professional retiree because you're gonna live twenty Thirty years and retirement and so you need to have that game plan on that tax plan the state plan you know Social Security plan when do we take it\nSo I take my pension from my lumps on our lump sum option from my company do I sell my house I have a couple of homes I keep the rental income to all these questions are part of preparing for this game plan I called the game plan to retirement\nAnd every moving piece in part is just an important as to the ones that prior to that and there's many steps to it and so you want to be prepared\nYeah I think about uh I I don't know that a lot of people think about the opponents that they have in retirement to who's my opponent well\nYour opponent is going to be a market decline you want to protect against that your opponent is going to be inflation you want to\nProtect against that you're in your opponent is going to be a health so bad you want to protect against that as best you can financially speaking and there are things to to fight against when it comes to retire but we have to be ready for whatever that opponent throws at her ...\nAnd it's kind of what you talk about being prepared and having all of those those game plans to go around those things\nYes I recently had somebody come in and they've only sat down with a couple of advisors in their time\nAnd they said ... you really do press on this inflation issue I Do think there's going to be hyper inflation and I think I don't know I said oh they know we can prepare for the worst case scenario and the best case scenario and they said well if I Need Seventy five thousand dollars now why in five years and I need eighty one thousand dollars in income I said because\nUh purchasing power changes and today here ten thousand and not worse ten thousand in ten years so we have to plan for that and if you look at history on the average inflation is three percent over the last thirty or so what's the state's gonna be any different or worse or better so we might as well planned for it just in case\nThose opponents that we haven't retirement we don't think about them but we want to prepare for them and that's what our tailored retirement plan does really it is a game plan going through all of those pieces that Sharif was just talking about\nIncome you're four one K. your IRA how do those become paychecks how do they pay you in retirement Social Security we're going to talk about that and just a second here what kind of a strategy would be best for you and your family tax plan and we're going to talk about that today as well having a tax strategy many people don't do\nThat maybe the number one expense you are going to have in retirement\nIs taxes would it be to put more of that money in your pocket we'll talk about risk we'll talk about fees will talk about estate planning we'll talk about that market and build in a game plan for you it's called our tailored retirement plan we would

forward if you want to\nGive us a call and let's go through the process and give you a look at where you stand right now eight three three three six eight three six zero eight three three three sixty three six zero asked for the tailored retirement plan\nWas to read one of the things when we talk about the tale of retirement plan we talk about having a Social Security strategy and people have heard over and over again the longer you wait the more money you get so why not wait till Seventy well\nWe got a guy here who has a completely different thought on that his name is David Bach and he says you know what if you don't need the money don't wait take it\nI recommend if you don't need the money this is very counterintuitive he donated money ticket early and people go why\nAt sixty two sixty three sixty four year in the best shape of your life\nAt least at that point you can take extra cash you can travel first class you can get embarrassed weed on a cruise\nAnd you're going to enjoy the money and give it to your grandchildren are so many things that people are sixties can do to enjoy that money so if you don't need it if I can just take the early unfortunately if you're doing it it passed away because it's worth so much more money and that's the part that's unfortunately unfair for those who haven't done a good job of saving\nNow that makes my head spin John honest a little bit ... but it like that idea is kind of makes sense doesn't it yeah\nYou know what one and a blue moon walk up in my office and that's exactly what we do this has to be something we just we we talked about on the radio today Randy because [noise]\nIt's not cookie cutter retirement planning is not going to be the same for your neighbor or your your your your sister or your brother your uncle um it's different for everybody and one person can walk in and say hey why is my neighbor whether Social Security check up so much higher than my Social Security check\nAnd there's a lot of reasons why can't explain it and I sit there and talk to them but this is another thing we tell folks maybe it's best to wait till Seventy to take Social Security 'cause you get a nice big larger benefit guaranteed a percent every year that you wait after full retirement age to collect it but\nLet's let's say you have plenty of money than you have a great pension and the passage to your wife or husband and then you have this big chunk of money and you have to pull money out every year specially the IRA moneys and you just\nDon't need to delay or Social Security than by golly taken taken away your healthy banded reinvest that once in awhile I haven't ... listen to have an old time with it\nLove it I Love advances that just shows you right there there are so many different scenarios and how are you going to know what's right for you unless you have a real good animal is Asian of where you stand right now and that's really what our Taylor retirement plan you know Randy I don't mean to interrupt you\nBut uh we did have a caller commit Colin last week and she was\nDebating or want to know if she should take it early sixty six is around the corner for her she didn't need the money but she was curious you know is going to be here you know you can sit back and you weigh all these options but we've got a really neat program at our office that you can plug and play different ideas in there\nAnd it will give you different scenario so I wanted to throw in there on the Taylor financial plan that we offer that is that something that you want to throw in there to plug and play whether you need it or if you don't need it ruin would would be the best of the optimal\nTime to you and then what would you do with it would you like the the gentleman said family cruises upgraded

the budget meal and we're sorry I Apologize so\nMine when she was beautiful blonde\nAnd I don't remember ever remember that was down in the times that\nKept that Social Security piece really is an important decision is one that if you make it you've got about a year to take it back but after that it is locked in so we want to get that one right\nGive us a call ask for that tailored retirement
