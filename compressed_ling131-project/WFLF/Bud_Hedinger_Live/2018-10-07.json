support memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it looks like athletes have been using Korea Team for years to enhance their strength and performance and tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you've used at body builders know about it athletes know about\nKorea Team is the premier sports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach is of course they knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural for the body it was supposed to be there but there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid\nIt might be considered cheating that it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee they came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now that it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing that for adults\nFor people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff it was amazing\nAnd purity has this incredible new formulation we call it every strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger and stay stronger with hundreds of human studies and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat in like four pounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarian they can be Korea teen deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient and I put 'em on average strong they noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low and if you're if you're a person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general this is for you you definitely want to add that

we get older fifty plus ... like you and me pat let's go to a couple of studies on seniors just to show this we'll do one on the guys and one on the girls when I first\nOn the guys love the title of this one Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older men study done it several American universities or group of men get this pet age fifty nine to Seventy\nTwo hey can we can do that is not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week study people need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works get this the guys on Korea Team\nThey put on four pounds of lean mass that's muscle tissue for those that don't know that it shows they built the muscles and they hydrated the muscles nicely they increase the strength of their chest pressed by seven percent they increase the strength of the leg exercises they were doing by Fifteen Percent pat\nThey could get in and out of a chair more times faster without using their arms on top of that they could generate more power on a stationery bike pat\nThis happened in one week when I think that it's really quite incredible\nAll right but what about the women out there did they get those kinds of benefits to as well below that actually help women\nIn their fifties sixties and seventies get stronger to\nArabs are loosely let's go straight to another study love

heart\nGrace mercy and peace be unto you from your lord and savior Jesus Christ or certain insects for today is found in the beginning of scripture genesis chapter one verse twenty seven so God created man in his own image in the image of\nGod he created him male and female he created them let us pray\nAlmighty God heavenly father your generous goodness comes to us new every day\nBy the work of your spirit you lead us to acknowledge your goodness to give thanks for your benefits and to serve you and willing to ... help us to see the world as you see it to see others and remember that they too are your ... children\nGive us the courage to see your hand in all people in the farmer the migrant worker the store clerk the butcher the Baker the refugee the c._e._o. the politician but yet to be born\nAnd then all of those whose work makes it possible for us to gather here today to sit\nAt your feet in your word less us and keep everyone in your care through your son Jesus Christ star lord oh man\nIt's right there at the start of history the start of it all the genesis as it were in the beginning God created\nThat is our heavenly father will to create to give life where none existed or exists it's there where God for nothing brings everything into being\nYou know the history you've heard it many times before from darkness comes light than water than land than vegetation then sun and moon and stars\nThen see life followed by life on land\nWe see God's handiwork bringing life into its very first existence and God made the beef up the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind and God's saw that it was good\nThis account alone would be a magnificent event to watch ethics for sure\nBut God wasn't done no his crowning achievement was still to come then God said let us make man in our image after our likeness again God brings to life that which never was it's the creator the one who is life bringing into life\nOr is\nIt begins first with one man then being the loving father seeing how sad man is with not having a fitting partner he puts man to sleep and takes from the man a rebel and from it\nMakes a woman then the man said miss that lasted bone in my bones and flush of my flash she Shelby called woman because she was taken out of man\nHere it is where to become one again Adam is completed as his wife who was made from his side is at\nHis side again and God Bless them and God said to them\nBe fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth\nThe giver of life now gifts the couple with the ability to create more of what God loves so much and let's not misunderstand\nAs even though man and woman have the ability to create a life together is only one God gifts that to them\nThat all life is actually created he is lord after all [noise] so we're wants no lights existed now life in many forms exists today and God's crowning achievement that of mankind has since grown to over seven billion people\nIn such a huge number it is hard to not feel a little in significant I think families who are blessed with three four five or ten children and how some of the siblings feel as if they aren't even noticed among many others in their own home vying for the attention of their parents\nAnd as a parent it can be challenging to give equal amounts of time to each child\nSome demand more than others and it isn't wrong it just is what it is that said though\nOur heavenly father has no such limitations no he is greater and he has kept a watchful eye on his entire creation and each individual he's created with the attention is if we were the only one on earth\nBefore I formed you in the womb I knew you says God each life before even coming into existence God has cast his gaze upon delighting in having hear his voice and that we would be led home to him\nNow if you don't know the story it isn't only about the good stuff\nNo there is the part where death entered where God had created so much life\nGod's enemy the devil the great liar and deceive her chained to destroy that which God loves the most you see the devil cannot be God nowhere take his place in fact when the double tried God banished him and send him away from the heavenly places\nHating God as the double does though knowing his power list that beating God one on one the devil targets God's crowning achievement seeking to hurt God by hurting those he loves\nJust as he did with the first man and woman in the garden the devil continues telling lies that\nWe can be like God creators of our own destiny is that we should focus on what we want and try to get it at any cost and don't worry be happy for that is what you see can trust me I can show you how to get it\nCreated in the image of God our lives got twisted and turned upside down and where once we walk with God now are natural inclination is to walk to the beat of our own drum\nWhere before we would have seen the value in every one who was created in God's image\nWe now see them as a means to our ends obstacles to our goals or simply inconveniences war is now exists among people's tribes and nations as we seem to get our own wants Matt\nWe may lie and cheat or speak poorly of others to get the promotion we want or something else of value that we have placed the lives of others\nThere's over\nWe may see those who are born with physical or mental challenges as of less value than those born typical maybe we think there must be a curse from God at play there the parents must have done something wrong in their lives to be given such a great burden\nYet to think this way we'd be wrong the disciples were so you'd be in good company\nAnd the gospel of John we recall the account of where Jesus killed the blind beggar getting their travels de Jesus and the disciples pass by and saw a man who had been blind from birth and his disciples asked him", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bud Hedinger Live", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "07"}
