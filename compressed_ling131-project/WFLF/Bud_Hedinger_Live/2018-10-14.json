entered in editor in chief of the observer been what inspired you\nFrom day one or maybe I'm you know you're Twenty one let's call it\nAlways loved the stuff but as far as ah the book I think that a lot of ways that came about from just picking up these things\nOver the years I think I could look back um to college when you have a beer bottle of beer to try to twist off but you don't have it opener um but somebody always had a big later on them and I got taught a kind of the party trick of being able to to wedge a\nBottle of beer open with a lighter um and then you know kind of accumulated some others along the way and then you know like was\nSilly enough to talk to an editor um themselves was silly enough to say we should make\nThis a book [laughter] the the big lighter that's if I followed along correctly in the book as a matter of using it as a wedge basically right against a tightly gripped finger around the bottleneck\nExactly after grip correctly or it's all laid out there um with illustration diagrams\nAnd everything you need to figure it out but yeah you're actually using a the lighter as a as a lever a lever and your finger as a fulcrum um so it's all highly scientific as you can do\nEnd up for those in desperation mode even holding up a piece of paper super super tightly can function the same way\nThink yeah that's a great one that one's actually um something of a bar bet to where you tell people but you can open this piece of paper that way and ah and then you fold it six or seven times until you have\nA thin very stiff battle hunk of paper um and use the same principles and then somebody owes you a beer [laughter]\nProceed with Ben Robbins and he's got a new book called ... tips tricks and projects he's also editor in chief of the observer what about some of these projects which put together on that\nOh man so these are really fun um a lot of them in love\nWrapping a empty beer bottle with a piece of string that you go to an actual tone and awaiting it on fire [noise]\nUm so that was you know one of one of the more enjoyable testing phases of creating this book um but it'll basically sever its way through the beer\nA and you could turn it into a a glass to drink a glass to then put beer in um I'd recommend you know standing heavily on the\nEdge to protect your mouth I'm can create tiki torches or that you can put outside a\nWard off ... which unfortunately um scientists haven't figured out exactly why I don't know that they've been spending all their time on this album mosquitoes love people who've been drinking beer so you gotta\nGotta fight them off um [noise] yeah there's a number of other big shot glasses I'm with the\nBasically the the bottle next um that you've severed off\nFrom the bottle and yeah I think there's like some some fun stuff to do and I think all these things are better than getting five cents or the recycling center\nAnd he's been been Robinson again the book is called beer

winning\nHave more limber flexible Joyce they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal\nTo make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do and you see this skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course Kurdi product for years now has been talking\nAbout ha and they have a new formula just for the joint\nH A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints to people are looking for alternative we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray all he's doing is measuring the space\nBetween the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an inch space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone that's what age eight is it's the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief\nThe more pain relievers we use the\nMore we're going to use these joint and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed this people who chronically use pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that what ha is that doctors call it ... flew it\nThey actually inject this ended joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you is a listener there well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement purity products was the first\nTo introduce it now it's a great big long molecule pat it's big you can absorb it and purity found\nA way to knock it down so that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at the laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but\nWe proved that it's orally absorbed\nAnd more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives or their joint health and of course this isn't a drug at the dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as we think of it\nNow bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nI think the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself item in the mix college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha\nThe body is Seventy two percent water\nAnd as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of ourselves begins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose the substance the scaffolding the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we being getting their wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the brain a shriveled up and the ... and so on all of these things occur with age and you know tons of daily on was looking for a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and of course the fountain of youth the water and of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello because it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies but as age goes on we're going to lose that we're going to see the wrinkles that thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're taking glue costs the main supplements you just took Thirteen Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue ... sulfate at the regular dietary supplement noun drugstores health food stores people ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about ... gas it well it took Thirteen Years for all the costs of me it'll be on the front page of time magazine it's just going to take time\nAnd it'll get there because patients are going to take this through the doctors and pointed out as they did glue costs I mean the revolution starts with patient\nNow do you bring a great deal about the role of highly want a gas it in the bodies connective tissue sound as each a work in the joints and the connective tissue ...\nIt's a natural cushioning agent and pat we're talking about between the bones it also surround the nerves there's a sigh addict nerve there's an owner nerve there's a carpal tunnel nerve all of these are going to need the special cushioning\nThat ha can give them there are people that tell us this stuff works here's Bernie writing to me who's actually teaches and plays golf in Dover, Delaware he found this purity joint formula and were telling you it worked miracles for him why\nBecause purity is not only taken the ha but they've taken a brand new substance called Hydrox that's taken from all it was not pat you notice\nYou can put a bowl of olives on your table in a year later come back and except for a little bit of a shrinkage due to just the loss of moisture they're very stable they're still there they didn't shrivel up and waste away due to fungal contamination so\nThere's something very strong and all as we've known it for a long time\nDr Roberta Korea an Italian researcher who is now here in this country\nDoing some research on hide Roxy tier is all\nExtracted from olives and found out that it does some of the same things that the molecules to that trigger like estrogen does the production of ha so we began to think why don't we combine this wonderful strong antioxidant from olives\nInto ... new ha joined for a meal you know we're getting results like we've never seen before this is why bill of rights to us this year saying I'm taking ha from my knees it's done wonders for my joints so\nWe get these letters from people there unsolicited\nThey just can't believe it here's someone writing to me this is a doctor ... saying he looks like a man\nThere's Thirty years younger and he says people can't even believe his level of fitness and youthful appearance and he says I tell you to tell them it's just the H a formula now this stuff works fairly quick much faster than glue costs I mean\nAnd it's all safe all natural its purity age a joint formula and pat most of the people who write to me or call me or not people who regularly fall for you might say radio commercials they don't buy stuff off the

Hoffman\nPeople say religion has nothing to do with real life maybe not but face does faith in God is real life\nPeople say faith in God is not as much use until you are in trouble maybe so if you're talking about that religious feeling that comes over people and make them say pious things when someone is taking to the hospital or someone as they say passes away\nFaith in God however is not just the religious feelings for pious words\nIt is knowing God having confidence in God crushed in God expecting guard to do his thing come good days are back\nGod is good for the good days and he is good for the bad days guard is strong on the successful days and strong on the unsuccessful day's gone is our refuge and spring are very present help in trouble so dishonest\nIt must have been a day of

serious high blood pressure heart attacks and possibly a lot of other things\nWe may prepare for ourselves premature coffins in graves forgetting the one who can make everything different for every one in this wide world of hours but there is all it was God no matter what may come there's always gone it's always possible to have faith in him no matter how dark the day or how bleak future\nSimply because he's God God is already huge and strengthen the American president help in trouble therefore we're not we fear do the right to be removed\nAnd do the mountains be carried into the midst of this see what kind of talk is dead anyway when we're surrounded by all kinds of possibilities that strike fear into the hearts of people and even terrify them to death\nWith all the other fears there's always the fear of death it hard to people from the cradle to the grave children are afraid of death and so are their parents in fact\nOne of the great fears of children is that their parents will die or that they will go away and not return or they will break up with one another and rent a beautiful little family or something will happen that will bring about change\nWhich almost always producers fears in children just as it does in older people\nAll the fears are really members of the ones fare the fear of debt that explains\nWhy people don't like to talk about their heart they talk about it they tried to make it seem present when they know otherwise\nThe Bible does not blink at talk of dead it faces dance with a clear I call that an enemy talk about change their changes everything it changes things for people who die and it changes things for people who are left behind\nFear is a fact of life is not all bad it keeps a child who is burned his finger on the stove from

pretend that the pain isn't there are they act as if it\nWill soon disappear fear and be a gift from God it can wake you up they can jog your loose from your complacency it can turn you from fiction the fact it can bring you back to reality but fear will never make you strong\nIt takes something else to make a strong\nFaith makes people scrawled\nNot any old kind of fate ... faith in God that is for real it's not just a big feeling about God\nBut actual face confidence and got crushed and God even closeness to guard which is more than ... piety because it is a deeply felt conviction on which you bank your life that face when did this faith in God\nContrary to what some people say and think faith does not eliminate fear faith in God Shakespeare and channels it in the right direction fear destroys and face saves\nFace saves people by overcoming the frenzy of fear which is unhealthy and destructive turning the face of fear in the right direction which is called God\nFace turns people away from themselves toward God it may sound unrealistic and foolish to some people but actually it's the only real an intelligent way to live\nI Wish I could tell you how often I prayed with people\nWho are scared to death as someone close to them as being carried into a hospital unconscious and placed into the intensive care unit hovering between life and death [noise]\nThe whole family stood around in the horn way young and old not knowing which way to turn for all kinds of fears were all over the place\nThen we prayed to God quietly confidently\nAltogether\nHave to experience something like this to field a piece that settles on that same fears may still be there but they are no longer in control something else has taken their place\nIt takes over and people put their fears into the hands of God [noise]\nThat's not just the religious feelings are pious talk when fear is so thick that you can cut it with a knife face cuts through and then there's light to again no matter what may happen there is gone where God is no fear [noise]\nGod has a refuge and screams very present help in trouble [noise] therefore we're not we fear though the earth be removed and do the mountains we carried into the mix of the city [noise]\nFaith in God hunters disappear and pointed in the right direction the direction is toward God\nFear of God becomes a healthy thing when you have faith in God with faith in God and a godly fear that goes very well with faith people begin to see things again with a clear I entered take things with a clear mind it's a good thing to fear the devil but you've got to know where he's at\nWith faith in God you know where he's at\nThe great thing about God is that he shows has where he's at where the devil is at and where we are at in relation to God and to all the forces which arise to deceive into trouble lies that great God sent his son Jesus Christ into the world\nHe rainy came the story is there for all to hear all to read all to see their mysteries about God that none of us understands\nAnd mysteries about Christ that nobody can explain but there's no mystery about who Christ is and what price did there's no mystery about who Christ is and money's always doing he died for the sins of the whole world he did that for all of us\nThat's gone doing his thing and his son Jesus Christ\nFor the sake of his son the great God gave
