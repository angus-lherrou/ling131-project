Gordon Deal thanks for listening to this weekend\n[noise]\n\n\nSo here's one thing that I Know that juries loves to talk about a little bit it's football and that's what we're going to do today oh we're gonna we're gonna you know if you if you look at the best coach in college football's people might say Nick Saban they might say others\nIf you look at the best coach in pro football\nNo doubt people are going to bring up build ... and he's of course the coach of\nThe New England patriots won a lot of Super Bowls he was just recently interviewed on CNBC the financial networks and he talked about\nBuilding a game plan there's a lot of things that are similar to here to building a financial plan to take a listen\nPreparation you know what you're doing and you have an idea what they want to do with our spring we are [noise]\nThen once you get into the game and those adjustments will be\nEasy but relatively easy or more manageable situations review the communications [noise]\nTry to make sure that everybody's on the same page of the complicated it's probably not going to work or if it's too simple\nThat might not work either because it's so obvious so here's All right\nWe get we get a plan we reviewed the plan we make adjustments if it's too complicated no good if it's too simple no good we have to have good execution ... sounds a lot about what we talk about every week doesn't it\nYes preparing for that game plan so whether you're\nPlaying baseball or your football here football coach or soccer coach or wherever yeah there there was a game plan to everything that you do and you have to strategize and you have to look out for your opponents and you gotta be offensive you have to be defensive and you're always changing up the plants and nobody\nUh figures you outright and supposedly but I mean at the same thing when you're preparing for retirement Randy you want to review often you want to adjust when needed to be adjusted\nAnd he went to execute so it it there's no difference whether you're a professional athlete our coach\nVersus being professional retiree right but does plan to be a professional retiree because you're going to live twenty Thirty years and retirement\nAnd so you need to have that game plan on that tax plan the state plan you know Social Security plan when do we take it do I take my pension from my lumps on\nOur lump sum option from my company do I sell my house I have a couple of homes I keep the rental income to all these questions are part of preparing for this game plan I called the game plan to retirement\nAnd every moving piece in part is just important as to the ones that prior to that and there's many steps to it and so you want to be prepared yeah\nI think about uh I I don't know that a lot of people think about the opponents that they have in retirement to who's my opponent well\nYour opponent is going to be a market decline you want to protect against that your opponent is going to be inflation you want to\nProtect against that you're in your opponent is going to be a health event you want to protect against that as best you can financially speaking and there are things to to fight against when it comes to retire but we have to be ready for whatever that opponent throws ...\nAnd it's kind of what you talk about being prepared and having all of those those game plans to go around those things\nUh I recently had somebody come in and they sat down with a couple of and visors and their time and they said Sharif you really do press on this inflation issue and I do think there's going to be hyper and\nI think I don't know I said oh they know we can prepare for the worst case in there and the best case scenario and they said well if I Need Seventy five thousand dollars now why in five years and I need eighty one thousand dollars in income I said because\nUh purchasing power changes and today you're ten thousand and not works ten thousand and ten years so we have to plan for that and if you look at history um the average inflation is three percent over the last thirty or so what to say it's going to be any different or worse or better so we might as well plan for it and just in case\nThose opponents that we have in retirement we don't think about them but we want to prepare for them and that's what our tailored retirement plan does really it is a game plan going through all of those pieces that Sharif was just talking about\nIncome you're four O. one K. your IRA how do those become paychecks how do they pay you in retirement Social Security we're going to talk about that and just a second year what kind of a strategy would be best for you and your family\nTax planning we're going to talk about that today as well having a tax strategy many people don't know that maybe the number one expense you are going to have in retirement\nIs taxes what if you could put more of that money in your pocket we'll talk about risk we'll talk about fees will talk about estate planning we'll talk about that market and build in a game plan for you it's called our tailored retirement plan we would love to get on to you that is our gift your radio list or this is free\nThere is no obligation here you can come in and take a look at what we have\nAnd see what we have and you can choose to move forward if you want to\nGive us a call and let's go through the process and give you a look at where you stand right now eight three three three six eight three six zero eight three three three six eight three six eight zero ask for the tailored retirement plan\nMost recent one of the things when we talk about the tailored retirement plan we talk about having a Social Security strategy and people have heard over and over again the longer you wait the more money you get so why not wait till Seventy well\nWe got a guy here who has a completely different thought on that his name is David Bach and he says you know what if you don't need the money don't wage take it\nI recommend if you don't need the money this is very counterintuitive he donated money to take it early and people go why\nAt sixty two sixty three sixty four year in the best shape of your life at least at that point you can take extra cash you can travel first class you can get a bigger sweet on a cruise\nAnd you can enjoy the money you can give it to your grandchildren are so many things that people are sixties can do to enjoy that money so if you don't need it I can just take early unfortunately if you're doing it it pays to wait because it's worth so much more money and that's the part that's unfortunately unfair for those who haven't done a good job of saving\nNow that makes my head spin just a little bit ... but it like that idea I was kind of makes sense doesn't it yeah\nYou know what one and a blue moon walk up in my office and that's exactly what we do this has to be something we just we we talk about on the radio to Randy because\nIt's not cookie cutter retirement planning is not going to be the same for your neighbor or your your your your sister or your brother your uncle um it's different for everybody and one person can walk in and say hey why is my neighbor whether Social Security check up so much higher than my Social Security check\nAnd there's a lot of reasons why can't explain it and so I sit there and talk to them but this is another thing we tell says maybe it's best to wait till Seventy and take Social Security could you get a nice big larger benefit guaranteed eight percent every year that you wait after full retirement age to Clinton\nBut let's let's say you have plenty of money saved you have a great pension when the passage to your wife I'm an or has been and then you have this big chunk of money and you have to pull money out every year especially if it's Irene moneys and you just\nDon't need to delay or Social Security than by golly take it take it away you're healthy span dead reinvest it once in awhile I haven't ... clients and listen to getting going to have an old time with it\nI Love it I Love it and see that you're just shows you right there there are so many different scenarios and how are you going to know what's right for you unless you have a real good animal is Asian of where you stand right now and that's really what our Taylor retirement plan you know Randy I don't\nMean to interrupt you but we did have a caller commit Colin last week and she was\nDebating or want to know she should take it early sixty six is around the corner for her she didn't need the money but she was curious you know is it going to be here you know you can sit back and you weigh all these options but we've got a really neat program at our office that you can plug and play different ideas in there\nAnd it will give you different scenario so I wanted to throw in there on the Taylor financial plan that we offer that\nIs that something that you want to throw in there to plug and play whether you need it or if you don't need it really would be the best the optimal time to take it and then what would you do with it would you like they the gentleman said family\nCruises upgraded flights you know the list\nGoes on and on Iran's he doesn't like upgraded flight and no\nI I totally agree but I Will say this\nWhen it comes down to a long flight and I'm sitting back next to my wife to the left who has window seat because she has a window seat and I'm In the middle seat and there's a man or female to my right I find myself leaning up against the person I don't know falling asleep and they budget meal they will sorry I Apologize\nSo you don't mind when she was beautiful blonde I I don't remember ever remember [laughter] that was down in the times they kept\nOn Social Security piece really is an important decision is one that if you make it you've got about a year to take it back but after that it is locked in so we want to get that one right\nGive us a call asked for that tailored retirement plan and the Social Security piece is a part of it a three three three six eight three six zero\nEight three three three six eight three six eight zero let's sit down find out where you stand and build a

in fact our story originally Fifteen Years ago when the renowned TV show sixty minutes captivated\nAudiences around North America with a special segment on the French paradox\nDo you remember the French paradox this is the counter intuitive concept that says red wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best activates genes that control our weight\nOr energy healthy aging and even longevity\nThe holy grail of medical research and what did they find\nOut of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was was there a troll ... the active ingredient found in that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nOur guest today says that's just half the story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce them for over Twenty years Dr president has been an institutional New York radio host in his own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a long time product formulated and high level advisor for purity products that your freshman welcome aboard\nMark ... speaking to ya\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's turn to lose ... also nominate on those people out there who just vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is was very ... and why is it all over the news today well first\nOf all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News\nYou know I read about twenty health journals or weekend every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically reservoir troll is what we call a poly feeding all it's found in red wine it's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries it's even found in ...\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation and the scientists really first became interested and resveratrol mark about\nNineteen Ninety two when raspberry ... first isolated from red wine it\nWas also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well and this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms and even some fish well anything that extends the life of anything is going to the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow well\nBy two thousand six Italian scientists discovered that resveratrol extend the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and it even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand six and here's what really got them interested a Harvard researcher David Sinclair\nReported that red beret troll counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice bite thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seem to protect the intestines and the colon definitely supported normal and cinematic activity in the body it improved indoor and\nIt was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved endure and storing aerobic activity and it even proved to support brain function great\nStudy from Weill Cornell Medical school to New York I was just reading that even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any perceived threat like not eating enough\nCaloric restriction your body feels threatened switches on what they call the longevity gene in your body switches on sort of a protective mechanism that gets on a secular level but capitalism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the tape\nAccording to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard and this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWow this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years of their co Q. forming\nIt was but now they feature co enzyme Q. ten which is just as important as reservists role especially your heart healthy and you'll see in some ways it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs co Q. ten ... what exactly is good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak or what our co enzyme is\nA co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects\nWell co Q. ten is the nutrient that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart your liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy wow that's amazing\nYeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful antibiotics and\nAnd I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's awhile ago while I was teaching for the first time physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin where they were looking for what makes the heart beat well they found out that was co Q. ten", "show_name": "Bud Hedinger Live", "year": "2018", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "06"}
