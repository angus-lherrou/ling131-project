... patients Fremont or Orlando news radio Ninety three point one WFL a and I heard a radio\nStation [noise]\nYeah they're well I'm just trying to do a quick math uh\nAll right here's the thing I don't want your house payment to be much more than a force of your take home pay is about a third of your take on by today but I think when I had my four oh one K. back and you're pretty helpful a Gemini on those four O. one K. it sounds like\nSo I'm going to temporarily stop the four oh one K. your house is not the problem you're toys or your problem and your student loan is you're probably a hundred thousand dollars worth of toys when you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year as backward\nGuy because they're all going down in value you shouldn't have toys stuff was wheels and motors that add up to more than about fifty percent of your take on gay or fifty percent of your income now you did just cut your income down substantially when mom I came home I got that part but still you were over you were at a hundred percent even when she was working\nSo you got too much tied up and things going down in\nYou that's a bigger problem than your houses and you're staring down the barrel of a fifty thousand dollar debt that you need to clear I Would say you ought to clear that and it's probably going to take your three years in the setting if you stop everything vacations eating out and for one gays and sell a toy or to it's probably still gonna take a weapon on which toy you sell\nBut um you know I'm getting all this debt\nBecause it hasn't benefitted you\nNumber one number two I'm getting out of it even if it had benefitted you even if you got a fifty thousand lawyer raises because of it I use that fifty thousand declare that that the first thing first order of business but I really don't think your house was the problem I probably would sell some toys\nOr no I Know I Would shelves from toys I shouldn't say that so lightly um that's where your problem is you've got too much invested in depreciating assets\nAnd on your houses it's generally OK I'm temporarily would stop my four oh one K. and I would beat on this debt with a hammer until it's gone\nBut I Want you to do what you're rolling stock and stuff with motors and it to be less than half your annual income now if you say your income coming up very dramatically in a very short order and you want to hold a couple of these toys or something that's fine but still you need to keep it around fifty percent or less\nA because you just got too much juice taught up and stuff that's going the wrong way it's all going down you look up and that hundred dollars' worth stuff's going to be worth fifty thousand about a blink of an eye\nAnd then scratch your head and wonder why you're broke you know you got stuff
