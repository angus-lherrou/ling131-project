going to end up I mean this is volatility we haven't seen of course way before you and I were bored even before grad for its you know Nineteen twenty nine\nAnd that was what they had to compare it to and it was this month's ten years ago\nIs that depression is you don't want to tell you there was an anomaly in October in Nineteen Seventy two for all those his history buffs of amazing man was born\nOctober twenty ninth at about six I think he him at night\nAn okay some people think that was a crisis too but that's another\nShaun [laughter]\nMy birthday is on the twenty fourth so I can share there with you so they're going to go All right so ... over here one of the things\nThat we talk about is we don't know when it's going to happen markets have been going on for ten years I imagine that does come up with the class Sharif is this the time for me to get defensive with my money what do you say to a question\nLike that so there's no time right now to play defense because often says always there people always trying to make money and and they buy the stocks and it goes up it goes down but defense right now is probably the most important um because we've had a ten year ...\nI just tell folks especially if you're in retirement and you're living off this money you you've got to decide\nOn key never know when you wake up the next day what happens to the market and you might be making a bunch of money at but capitalize on it and do something with some of that interest you've earned and\nPreserve it don't get too greedy you know a motion fear and greed get away and a lot of that decision making and I'm you're sounding board here to tell you\nHey okay we're emotional maybe getting greedy now encourage him off\nAnd I say that because they see all that time\nAnd there were several people in in in a way they did exactly what we're talking about right now sitting right before a wait and the markets for to an absolutely fantastic they could not lose it didn't matter where they did where they put their money\nAnd the conversations probably at the time with the same thing you know hey you know when are you thinking about maybe Carmen some off but because greed takes over and we think to ourselves well next week I'll do that next week or maybe I'll do that next month [laughter]\nBoom it it'll it'll it'll come out of nowhere and then it'll devastate\nYeah and now we got mid term elections come round the corner I'm PE ratio they're high I mean there's so many things preparing for them is probably the best thing I think today Randy and that's being defensive and your strategy\nA lot of people remember black Monday that's Nineteen eighty seven and the market went down\nTwenty two percent in one day okay now the in the clip you heard somebody say a six hundred point drop will now it's six hundred point drop that would get our attention but that's very little from a percentage standpoint\nA percentage of twenty two percent drop in one day would be almost six thousand points now imagine ... ... if the market where to go down that much in one day it can happen but even if it went down ten percent in one day that would be a drop of\nTwo thousand six hundred points so these things do happen and we need to be prepared for them and taking a defensive posture and\nFisheries we should probably make this clear right now that we're not saying pull all your chips off the table like they do in a poker game you know I'm all in I pull everything off that's really not what you're talking about is\nRight where you know I I truly believe we should have some money in the market but we also have some money on the sidelines either in real estate or annuities are at the bank or you know some other creative safer on titan investment that helps with inflation\nUm bonds right now are just becoming a little bit of issue in portfolios and you can't have all your money wrapped up in corporate bonds and your portfolio as we can just bringing them down and say you got to look outside the box and that's when I'm here for\nTaking a defensive posture or should you be one side of the other you know make the uh the metaphor of use in the freeway and the fast lane is on the left lane and the slow lane is on the right lane and you want to be somewhere down that middle\nAnd that's what we would love to discuss with you and
