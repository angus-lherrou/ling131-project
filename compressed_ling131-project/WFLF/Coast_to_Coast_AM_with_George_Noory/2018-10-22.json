it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it\nIn the last say seven eight years focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like they were when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big foot Wildman and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago\nWhen your first year can you recap the ... project how you got started on that what you learned and how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains of the fear of\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence they started talking about Bigfoot and they've found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter and they said you know Dave\nWe yeah Twenty years of a police officer ... years investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance you go about it at your own pace you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do

where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approach them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that there would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nI'm Mary how

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and studied them year after year so they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it's never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have how I'd while or giant human bones found\nAnd that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions in the articles are\n... are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining it must have been old Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown here all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation [noise]\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows huh how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from a middle aged Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you really not going to find that you have to dig really deep and and find out what maybe some explorers wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so\nBut again in tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an explorer from the latter day church\nWas coming across country on a horse\nAnd he wrote in his explore notes\nThat this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked him I die and actually spoke to him large hairy by ... he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with the latter day church butter de saint church and it's in there\nSo to say that these things haven't happened ...\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from\nSeptember Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wild like mass landed in a field releasing a huge here cupboard being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive\nUm big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter]\nYou know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on or about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this summer fell over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this\nAnd uh his book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big topic it was a starter I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear this\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and it's a tremendous book and people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking with Dave ... about his latest work big foot Wildman

still all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like in in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nOr these look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people I'm just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's the general consensus that are\nSort of matches what other tribes have stated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to the to find a group that says they're an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson ... film I and it's you know if people can argue about it all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but that that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or ape\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up in this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nSo when I did with ah the given one film it and one thing Harvey has the ability yet\nIs let's say somebody goes into a bank robbed the bank has a beard on as a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving larvae have this innate ability to take the beard off the face\nSeeking the with the face looks like so you can identify the suspect so apply that to the Paterson given film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad it's in tribal ... and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your ... accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are [noise]\nAh in my presentation to conferences they sometimes will take\nA variety of photos of Amazon tribal members ah people from northern Ukraine of people from China and I put these pictures up there and it it's phenomenal how different human look\nIf they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah if you're a space aliens you came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ... you know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from a ... it's because we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I ... I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just sign of playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California [noise]\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nThe um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things doing an unusual things other times or they're seen them awake\nPlaying like kids in the water um it's again the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well must be a young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big but that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who side how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I never found a big foot nowadays that\nConclusively killed anybody and when I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on pick for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never\nHop and yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and some people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies of people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth\nAnd you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big what the kidnapping people and I I Would have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where\nThere are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children\nYou know there are never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who shot and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it and say it\n\nSeems to be a there are instances where and in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they describe them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd\nThe number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to human\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that\nAnd I've heard the human side of it from a fireman a policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history\nOr so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him or apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one\nAnd I don't have\nAny idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some uh reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and hey invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents [noise]\nSo they own a huge cheer for anyone out there and talk to

world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven\nShips survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd has a lot of other research still researching the story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of Lebanon non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nTo be here thank George\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen most teenagers are Thirteen or not reading about the US's Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carry the bomb in sunk [laughter]\nAnd I had to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [laughter] imagine that and you know\nThrough looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I thought oh someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I sought out what I could but thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it\nAnd yeah flash forward graduated from college and then we'll know ones pulled the story and you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to meet them the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid who was meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was the theory hiding project for me the way I got involved was\nI had actually been praying I'm I Do pray that my work\nAnd I had been praying to have\nAn opportunity to work on an iconic for over a two story and all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this\nEmail from this young filmmaker named Sarah Vladeck\nWell what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that I'm being Indianapolis the storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay\nAnd she actually did that she wrote a an eight part miniseries than she pitched it to a major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we stand for others\nBut we only base mini series on foot\nSo you're going to need the right stuff while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff though for your family and friends she reached out and and made contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I Am a navy veteran she didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story like this one\nUm [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting was advice and I wanted to help rewrite the book [laughter] so uh my\nJoke is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or into letting helper but uh eventually over the course of several\nMonths we finally met and then ah\nWe agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest into twenty four and um and then when we did it I guess the project pick a three and a half years\nTo Syria where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know like I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story\nAnd no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprint commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaigns that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did um besides being sent [noise]\nBut I'll tell you you grab ... my father was a at Okinawa and he ... he drove a landing craft from those ships took good troops on the shores so of course you know that the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that did you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned more with the fifth the Fifth Fleet flags shed and I'm a small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle with us now where your father drove the landing craft\nAnd I'm\nThe weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent her on the fateful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the

we were able to really develop its personality a lot\nHe was a manager who cared for his men he was the commander who was very very frustrated with state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nYeah not at all I mean you know the the shark population in the Pacific at the time was much more concentrated and from the report from the survivors you know there were hundreds of sharks are circling them at any given time and you know they would there would be frenzied attacks and I think you know and and I both heard\nYeah tend to stories of just men and you know having their buddy right next to them taking you know and they they didn't know who the sharks were going to attack that was not a real rhyme or reason to it and so they were always in fear\nAnd one of those harrowing stories was where you know there were\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that they're a rescuer arrived the men were really in ... they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark ... attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks ... things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um attack increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think saying one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported there were so thick they could walk on their back you know from shark to shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them there's one account you have a sailor who you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking down things drugs thinking oh there's food I'll just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young and by the name of John wolf than he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to learn the sharks and and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized\nOh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put his talk back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship that everyone knows it's almost the end of the war and they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines the\nUm and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a sixteen rap\nBetween there were there were four groups within three groups that they were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right\nSo there there were so any water that was available with only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and they\nWere starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were than men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others who although they knew that the sun and the ... and the dehydration itself with perversely causing them to\nLose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could drain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up the torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into this into his now and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't and then others would you take small for it is that the water\nI'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of the mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called ... and\nBlood vessels bird\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they die very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it did so quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere as pilots who winds up testifying at the court marshal waiter or an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention are we going to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... survey you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit within minutes late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see this you know kind of explosion coming from below and\nThere's no reports coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah he I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it and he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still went to you know he asked a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know this gentleman richer live Francis have passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and coordinate the one he saw this\nAnd it did line up with it but he didn't find out until a few days after\nWhen word was released about it that he would\nWe're talking with Linda incidents are about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but so there were survivors and what came next is a really amazing we'll be right back\nTo ... just going to

one\n[noise]\n\n\nLynn Vincent I Wonder if you could discuss for me in a broad sort of strokes are the sequence of improbable will bands that seemingly combined conspired to make things worse is if things just sort of drop through the cracks or they made their survival even more improbable\nWell as Sarah mentioned there with the the um\nDeparture message that didn't go through from ... to the Philippines there was there was a tenant on the Philippines side who had received a message saying that if\nA ... is a combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well\nHe wasn't the brightest guy in the world and a as a matter of fact had received a a fitness report saying as match that he thought well\nIf I don't have to report arrivals the combatant ships I guess that means I don't have to report non arrivals either and then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the impending invasion and the Japanese home island\nSo all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combined to make it says in Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until I PT one venture a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when\nI'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors just find it in the water\nThere is a very poignant story you tell in the books or a about these pilots do dropped all the supplies and trying to uh give these guys in the water or something you hang onto their they can't do any more they're out of supplies they have to hit back and there was one guy who's swimming way out\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I I don't know where he was swimming too or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left in your plane to help this little loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to in a leaves men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives like they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take it for you know our ship or else the VP the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't say one more man and he's still alive and you know that was a burden they carry till the end of their lives\nYou know it's war time as when the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and um there's a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but uh he's in an accident that the story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day a well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the time they do not believe that it was an accident so the rescue occurred\nBeginning on August second\nUh Nineteen forty five and the war ended on August fourteenth that between the time zones fourteenth and fifteens Nineteen forty five [noise]\nAnd they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk in these papers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it\nUntil the jade de until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five and Seventy two point headlines\nYou know Japan quit the war is over and then maybe below the fold in a very small article you at the Indianapolis cruiser sunk\nAnd reporters that time believed that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that was you know resulted in lots of almost nine hundred men on the very brink at the end of the war\nSooner or talk to me about the captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and saying was the court marshal inevitable couldn't let him slide given that the war is just an did or did they have to pursue this\nPoor really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is\nA tremendous loss for the navy and you know so many people and it was a very public you know\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan was announced to the world and people are out celebrating this in the streets but there are families now grieving that their son or their brother uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so\nYou know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset but as the investigation started\nYou know revealing things and who is involved in who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to this thinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the\nSinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one knew they were missing and that they were left out there to die you know someone needed to be to blame\nAnd a lot of people got blamed right\nThere were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there was a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that\nThese are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented the situation and so really you know\nAt the time these names the you know admiral king and ... limits and all these these men who were essentially the rock stars of that area you know we won the war and\nAnd the American public no holds these men on this high platform and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom and have them testify in tarnish their name pick I don't\nThink that the navy wanted to take that route and essentially the captain is responsible for the vessel so the moment that he was brought to cart court marshal there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA little is to talk about the court martial of our mentioned earlier uh the unusual step of bringing the the Japanese commander in to testify that had never happened before and then uh I guess the main thrust of the argument against the captain is that he failed to the exact the exact thing could have prevented the Japanese from sinking ship\nThat was one of the two churches um and not only what the unprecedented to bring in command her how she might have to testify but it was unprecedented that a captain with the court martialed at all\nFor having his shit sent in World War two there were hundreds of that for fun and captain Charles McVeigh was the only happened here was court martialed\nExcuse me and I'm\nSo glad he did have to charges against him one was invited way and maybe we we found in a records because we went to the national archives we went to the library of Congress Naval War college and so forth and we found these records where\nThe navy was actually casting about to find that charge that they thought would pick\n'em and as Sarah mentioned there were all these leading lied to the Pacific war who were involved in this you know the the commander of the specific forces the commander in Guam and these were men who had really been the architects of

year that the Indianapolis had been found a there's a mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill ... who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier the some commander of Indianapolis\nAnd you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and since there they found the ship\nI didn't know what he was talking about it for in the morning of and so you know\nDating my faculty and\nYou realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before the ... group which has the vessel that recently responsible for finding the ship there'd been several attempts and they were the first one is to be successful\nTo tell you what Joe that's quite a bit to chew on their let's let them tackle at least the last part of that question a nobody on the ship I mean really no one really knew what it was\nYeah even uh even the cap and didn't know what it was that this was\nThe most closely guarded secret at the entire war and the most highly classified naval mission at the war\nAnd so even a even as I said even the captain didn't know what it was only major from and it was and his uh his companion happen again no one who was along to monitor the radiation so\nThere was a little chance that a Japan would have now and and I don't know that extra precaution with taking\nBecause ship with traveling so fat almost at thirty not that they cut it out ran any Japanese submarine that were to try to target or\nSome funny stories about speculation among the crew about what it might be a because there was a fairly conspicuous package that was delivered there and in fact as you noted in the book the the the uranium the\nThe radioactive part of it a ... element was carried on to the ship in a briefcase but there was a lot of these stories that were told about what might be in their right though Sarah\nOh yeah I mean again these are teenagers and they have this\nLarge crate that delivered which is really a diversion to everything but they brought you know they see this crate come aboard and it's surrounded by a marine guard\nAnd of course there first gas is Rita Hayworth undergarments or sent in toilet paper for Douglas MacArthur [laughter] you know [laughter] no one guest anything close to the bottom [laughter]\nYou know I thought it was a a an odd post script sort of the the ship itself got blamed in the court marshal they were a thrashing around to blame somebody into shifted self got blamed a which you would like to tackle that\nWell they were in effect blaming Indianapolis for her own own demise so in one one case in point is that no distress signal got off the ship\nSo they were saying that that was kept in baseball that ship fault for getting hit by torpedoes and having her power you know flown out\nI'm also as a treaty cruiser as Sarah mentioned she had a single through back that went uh all the way through a from bad stern

court marshal about why that was the case why she why she would open like that and because of that because of this question because of their reporting on those questions\nKind of the families who had

you you are listening to America's poorest news this morning when the\nWeather is walking into Monday in a year where Democrats are considered the favorite to win back control of the house many of the races now tightening or in districts where President Trump won modestly in twenty six teams still Republicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot\nAt a pair of Nevada raises it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christine explain is\nWhat I was looking at in particular where races that were kind of ignored at the beginning of the cycle and people didn't think would become competitive back in the last sort of final stretch here have become closer than\nThan people expect that they would and seen that in particular in a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge in that maybe at forty nine percent victory fifty fifty three percent for districts you know that he comfortably carried but where there is more room for a Democrat [laughter] to pick up votes if people have the kind of dissatisfied with the president can\nDrive to one of them was like in a in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two races in Washington state all year and they're at the third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people end up coming up very competitive\nAnd that the district currently held by congresswoman Jamie How Arab butler [noise] um she has been in office she was elected in two thousand ten and that sort of cruise to victory\nIn recent years here has a significant challenger has been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats and garnered more votes than congressman\nButler and Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm [noise] the incumbent advanced as to the\nHighest performing Democrat who is a woman named ... she's a political science professor so ... it's an unusual and waste there and that um it hasn't been considered you know one of the swing districts but Carolyn longest campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points\n[noise] um so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight great\nWell All right how about the Long Island New York with the the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nProbably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger and democratic female opponent and the year when it does candidates are attracting a lot of energy and then can let them from voters especially female voters um our poll and other polls have shown a gender\nGap and and it reveals that women\nAre show more of a preference for a democratic controlled house and are often more energized this year so you know it's a truly them of terms that it comes down to turn out to but if\nIndeed the case it looks like a women are more poised to turn out and that could help some of these came out challengers and in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty three percent of the vote to not a huge blow out for him there\nDraw to speak with Christina Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter or piece was called house races titan is mid term elections near to down south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman rub what'll\nYes this is an interesting way to connect with all its definitely being outweighed by Carole and a boy do who is also a professor at Georgia State university and I'm In the suburbs of Atlanta this could have been some one of more like classic suburban battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar for a while\nOne of the factors that could be at play here and set Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost for their down on the ticket and that um but go could benefit from that\nAnd so and ... as as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\nSo this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um [noise] there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats and a sort of you know they can see the Republican feel they have a better shot rather than an feeding a democratic incumbent\nI'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crescent hardy [noise] uh and then the second ... the Republicans are optimistic about it's currently held by congresswoman Jackie rose and had a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada [laughter]\nUm you know there are more abortions happening it's um that there's actually a decline in sexual activity on the rise and birth control so it's um you know think including methods like you know having inter eater and divisive and things like that so it's you
