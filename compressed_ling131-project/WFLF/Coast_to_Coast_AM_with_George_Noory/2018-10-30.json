I I Can't do that as a human being or anti Christian but I think that fast\nChristian and a woman I wanted to see two things Tio first of all I'm he called her a horse face\nShe was trying to jump start her career uh um the porn star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that warrior is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he put Ron and possibly win\nA presidential nomination for the Democrats [noise]\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys yet and all they had\nWas temporarily side track 'em a booming economy or try to bring down next man but more importantly it man has kids actually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one but a young white and crude and catch quite and\nWe had a president and did something so by all it\nCan't even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I was aiming for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that was over a decade about so\nI don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you'll pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature and the second thing I disagree that is sad\nIs that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm I'm not that old guy there\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than the things is that and it should be run like a business\nI have started to successful business myself is that men and women don't have time for now it's time to get a deal done we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then that and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy that's known as the death when ward they'll pull him if he doesn't have money we need a businessman I voted for him\nBecause he said no nonsense that is that anyone that would bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity to get back up and get on the horse\nI I I I have\nIncredible admiration for people that are fighters in an issue and he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what than it is hard and other people know that ... I ... it does that matter about this policy she knows who she is as I as a man and and uh and as a prior to that so\nI disagree with you on both of those um things\nTurned let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think he did to run the country as a country that's been the single biggest enemy to any country in period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilet a fair market value or even try to get it the less I think when people say let's let the country run as a business they're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that uh our country is a republic with a constitution and the constitution works what we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a bit a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to come as young as you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney or self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nNow but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas um a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them about what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in their punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know I think what he has done his dignify but it is the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow what I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that could lead to it who pushed it who knows but\nIn ten years from now we can sell it on

launched by\nGeneration y that this monster generation that's fourteen to thirty three years old that it's going to start households and by dish soap and and by vacuum cleaners and furniture and

[laughter]\nGood good day already killed so old lady in Arizona for crying out loud\nYeah well in the trucking trucking won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks that we don't have\nEnough truck driver you know what that what we\nWould you like to have a truck behind you would know driver's city none of\nThat going to do it might you know we I have many many as little mini Cooper right\nI Am a mini Cooper GDP which is a ... and I'm thinking to myself I the first time I pull up next to a a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one tactical full paw just one it's\nGoing to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's where the truckers are telling me the people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out of school bus it's over it it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway and they're you know the truck is parked there in the truck driver guy is a loading everything in the store\nArguing how's how's how's the driverless trucks going to do that\nIt's not it it just not going to do it they'll say hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please\nOkay one of the things that that a A R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million uh um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military and the it's the there is just a ton and and that that's what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing with\nDo you see another major war breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ...\nI just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth is the Americans and that is a you know counting the United states Mexico central and South America or we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need their oil\nWe got water\nYeah we've got water we got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know I\nAm one who's always missiles well Kenny\n[laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for ... for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening in ... in fact I say I what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of\nThe north in the south the you know that the south is not having children there for her that I don't like about one to\nHere's my concern although not from a country but from some terrorist groups that obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and try to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you know possible it has to grow\nSo I don't know what's going to happen there with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... their their right it or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina he Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher I guess I'm Hi my question is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and west coasts like Florida is now the third most populous state\nOut raking New York state and also the Knicks has become the largest city out raking I filled out here people are moving to the warmer weather Bruce Kenny\n... that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the pound demographic shifts the head we cover every single state if you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California Nevada or a\nArizona and a New Mexico or the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million while or buy real estate bite in Florida now\nAnd just sit on it and\nSaid I ... the the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist or give me a bus and she said one is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to if you're not going to ask what if it meant when will begin to\nYou know ... and I told her I said listen it hasn't started if\nYou're not when it does it's going to be huge\nWhat is going to be off the charts what's the same thing that's happening with healthcare elder care and death care\nFor a Vegas is that a good market\nHuge off the charts huge can't believe it I it it's a for one uh it it's cheap there are plenty of jobs or a ...

thank you for that and\nFor sure be my friend I really appreciate that well\nUh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you got to tell me what I mean what did the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's the paranormal it's been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experience it was an ... experience a near death experience\nAnd just from that point on it just the these things have been happening randomly but quite frequently and uh I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book and a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or\nFamily Matters but to to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college I'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nThere's a lot of people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences has this been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nUh it it hasn't been I I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nA word that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching 'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most\nNegative thing I can think about there was a a a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic\nSuicide [laughter] you know that was the\nPerspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\nYou'd only as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the seal the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community of of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist you know historian\nA but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean ... who's\nThe chief scientist at ions good guy he\nUh yeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there is only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities\nAnd from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the J. B. Ryan Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is an eye confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and then you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research and very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWell and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting or on the Internet uh there are other podcast result they're dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I've made contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just had a ... it's just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building that night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's I I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people express their interest in and their support I think it's going to it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce old sol high in his latest book is called timeless paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in she tells me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner\nOr because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things uh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there and the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and ... and ... in the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point at which to do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I Would and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for live there about nine months so it was a winter time and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a I\nGot very sick very suddenly I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally stiff I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little map and was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBut the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep or you know crying myself to sleep I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd a ... I felt\nLike I it it was an engineer like presidents ... ... it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be okay it took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my\nMother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had\nHad saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never question did I just said okay that's that's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic a right to see 'em\nThere's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a a small plane or buy a ferry boat\nWhat the island the north end and there's a middle island called path silent and we always used to stop there when when we went camping and and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you can overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and\nOf course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on ... yeah exactly\nAnd I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then\nEverything was I was just like suspended in in in in

base\nAnd uh we were on a tour when the sirens went off and they closed off the base and we went back to the ... education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so\nSo that was my um my pre cognitive or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nA the you know a in a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event\nAnd later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific than mine but that very morning that this happened\nThere is my daughter had nobody wants to we didn't know what you're saying yeah we didn't know what it was bruised but ah she she she had the vision she was in the in the city were ashes falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep\nUm but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was a yeah yeah some people\nHad it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people around the world who have who has a verified that this that this happened to them and\nSo there is something to that this this the ... that people had since that and and and I'm On a massive scale so which is and it's been studied uh I think\nThat dean rating talks about in one of his books I I I Can't remember which one of his books but you know he

would ah try to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have a card should look at it and send me the you know tried to send me with what the card was and uh ... well above chance we would get\nThe the suit right we would get the sometimes the number or this or the ... you know\nWhether it was a king or jak face card a very often we get we get a right\nTo the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter a blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it\nNo more yeah he did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop a and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and I\nShe's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from its ... it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but I think I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big split experience [noise]\nI I did uh I well I think it was a I'll tell you this it was a ... near Oric\nWhich is northern California and the red woods highway there and are driving south and uh my girlfriend was was asleep in the uh uh in the passenger seat and it was dark and we were driving to you know the big tall trees it's\nVery hard and as I was making I think it was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit all of a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark\nBut it was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat\nAnd a ... it was just kind of leaning into the truck is we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot and and she ... she said what what are you talking about big foot I said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she she [laughter]\nShe said no no that's okay just keep drive me and I said well we got to find a hotel there is one here another miles from here and she goes no no you keep going keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later I found

you had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it is someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket or\nThe title alone we kind of makes you shiver\n[laughter] well I grew up in a in a um [noise] in our region American\nCommunity and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me [noise]\nAnd uh as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know that that all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket\nAnd he was so to me and he said\nAh ah Bruce it's it's it's OK I'm OK there is nothing to be afraid of\nUh uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut ah I didn't actually ask her about it but then he said it again there is nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then the typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um\nIt it it was kind of comforting in a way but very uh uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird wasn't it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is\nAnd I wasn't quite sure at that time uh I I think I Know now but uh uh often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals justice check everybody out\nSee what the suit was they're very curious I think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kind of paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh well do you have to fight for it I didn't\nReally have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like\nFor college transfer credit but it is not ... at\nThe college and I am a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they say well we've never done this before but we think it might be pretty popular\nI said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and so I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could've accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues\nAnd and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California or younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it\nBut there are a couple that are a little skeptical including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks and the nurse seven weeks in the course into the course um\nAnd uh it it it's been a wonderful experience it really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different

thousands of ads Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie biker which has been looking at the data Julie what have you found\nThe bottom line is that both President Trump and minority leader Nancy Pelosi are turning up in quite a bit of time in terms of advertising\nAnd take to President Trump we found that he it's only topped by two other issues terms advertising in that health care taxes [laughter] um so he went to them or three in a common in terms advertising right and then\nIn terms of those themes he is portrayed sometimes positively and sometimes negatively\nThat's right and there's actually there's\nA surprising amount a positive Trump ads out there when he found that even on the Democratic Senate and turning\nUp in a positive supportive way not in places like Indiana\nWest Virginia where a democratic senator trying to hold onto his seat that Trump won quite a bit and twenty six types of advertising like Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly thing when he Hoosier\nAnd with him and another ad in\nWest Virginia has\nA candidate you know kind of saying I work with President Trump when he does what's right for West Virginia so they're supportive cone and that type of advertising one thing that really interested me about that stayed away from that although you think that President Trump with is\nLower than typical favorability ratings and how much she dominate the news would be just blowing things out of the water in terms of negative advertising President Obama actually far and away surpass him as a sort of milling in advertising back in twenty fourteen turns during his\nPresidency and that you're fifty percent of all Republican ads were anti Obama and two parents purposes Trump opposition type ads make up to ... percent of democratic ad\nAbout that and then I'm speaking of Democrats for Nancy Pelosi practically all the ads that I have a negative reference to her really difficult\nTo find anything positive about Nancy Pelosi and advertising and that carries from not just a\nRepublican advertising but even democratic advertising that a little bit here and there during the Democratic primary races and\nWe found that about nine percent eight nine percent of all ads out there have a sort of an anti below the message so that really shows that Republicans have found her to be effective\nAs I get is tails person for the
