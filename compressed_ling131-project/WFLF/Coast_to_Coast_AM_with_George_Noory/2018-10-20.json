the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that\nUs national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly are pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I treaty because they have\nNot only build but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that a wave tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nThat has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria now of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow cause of concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a port strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world\nThat I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S we're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok\nTwenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states well it\nDoes and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly headed commission on military technology that is of course being shared a\nSignificantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system\nAnd the Vostok a chain exercises you indicate you know it had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against show me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have arising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their their passion\nFor for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nKnow I think you're correct Richard how are we did come and of course we've continued to do that they consider a Ukraine the breadbasket of Russia and of course they're continuing to fuel the\nAnti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland\nHungary Romania that'd be entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have\nA brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir ... and you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has you know really fueled\nFor the Russia's constitutional court who even started to hit\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow pool in this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\nYeah this past march they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\n[noise] you're not exactly painting potent as\nAn evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal why should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at\nPolitical coercion predatory economic strategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and\nThere's a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators and which do things just come out alive and they they like blinking red light and they suggest very strongly that yes we're representing their interests\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently and their parents ministers just met for his time over the top\nSorry for the interruption I gotta jump in here will pick us up on the other side alliance of evil lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis serious Jimi

dominance in space our satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do well there are rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why you know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue\nCompetitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military it's economic it's diplomatic ah it's\nAll these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things on the use of the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a pawn in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I ... to the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these friends\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states uh to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a ... um\nAnd how that might mean there is there are dominoes at play here obviously I'm Wondering ... with what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his little Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary a situation is is tragic\nYeah but if you've been watching my mom had been so solemn and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nThe so called Davos and the the desert which you know he was expecting all these\nUh donors in a investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so we can develop a a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology you they're totally dependent upon our arms that of course they could go to the Chinese and Russians but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA and and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese are all lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime um there ...\nOh they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west where not all excited about uh but the reality is that um\nYou know a friend of my you know my friend ... what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is you know my friend or something like

live from coast Toronto, Canada affiliate in depth radio news talk ten ten lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis days with is the book is a lines of evil Russia China the United states\nAnd a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived there had been\nA ... obviously some older patients with the Russians are particularly\nUm ah well I wouldn't call them Russian regular troops these are more like mercenaries in Syria the United states has certainly encountered or had heated battles with them or there have been some near collisions in the south China Sea with Chinese vessels how do you see this\nOr what is the the danger of this breaking out into all out war and perhaps as you point out morphing into the unfathomable uh the end and then time scenario\nWell certainly the confrontations or on the uptick current Richard you know we had one here recently with the U.S if a Decatur a destroyer\nA in the grave and reefs in the south China Sea um the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it\nAnd just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos fetish flew over um you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um [noise] these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here to fence weapons and [laughter]\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers but they practice from that these are claimed by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well\nAs the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nNext door to them it's really in the middle of it to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air as I indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to Ford station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or of the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we killed a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we call them and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent a the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians wife their hands out even though we know where they came from and what they did [noise]\n[noise] well Syria uh obviously that looms large in any end times scenario uh is is is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight we're really talking\nUh [noise] the big dog in ... uh and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president of the sea of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president of turkey is really a fix to be the collie and\nTo establish a cow of fat and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but\nYou know the release of the American pastor Brunson here recently\nWas after great pressure we put on him a air do on a to cooperate with us but yet we find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places current cologne Germany what was he doing there\nYeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque now that's not very\nThe goal of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA and he consistently has had over the years a very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so these are issues Syria is\nYou know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there is some friction there that they are working together uh and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together\nYou see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of our lives the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here a confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nEven care to one and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nThat's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her want her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to\nTake all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait um air to one is not being cooperating of course they're purchased the U.S for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the med\nFrom the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they

not do one you're going to turn this year we're still aren't very good he did the ... ... ...\n[noise] yeah well I certainly had a question in there [laughter]\nRichard ... it is it is perspective um you know I think that the the history of the Russian a Soviet Union certainly in where they killed millions a hundred mile\nIn China where they kill millions a and their foreign policy where they provoked all sorts of proxy wars um the the types of values that they support ah yeah we do sell weapons her defense security cooperation agency has done a robust year this year double what we did last year\nWe we made mistakes with some of our alliances and the like\nUh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is a we don't have any friends we just have interests and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself and to prosper\nUm sometimes are in the eyes of the beholder it is is evil or certainly in my perspective when I you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I looked at their history and I look at what they want today and it's certainly not what my country once\nAnd I do believe a United States\nIs not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and care for our interests over there\n[noise] particularly because you know people talk about democracy and and how that is really what protects a freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization\nWhich I look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world they don't have rule of law it is the wild west and there are no protections afforded the individual you can be literally swept off the street in the middle of the night and executed\nUh for for no reason in most places in the world\nAre and to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims that are incarcerated in West\nAnd a western China today and that's a un report or somebody can look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong and we've acknowledge that\nWe do bad things but the rest of the world you know I have\nI've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world I've seen some pretty bad places\nUm and yet you know it's always wonderful to come back home to the United states where we enjoy the rule\nOf law we aren't afraid as Richard pointed out of being arrested pulled out of bed and shot and they had 'em for families being carted away and yet ah unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and\nThe likes of the Chinese are doing some of that to their own people and so they're all\nGotta jump in here and thank you so much for spending two hours with this\nAlliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold
