piece together\nTwenty eight pieces and they concluded that three of them that\nDidn't know was a forgery\nA forgery yes means I'm I'm going to ask you to do something\nBecause in light of this news I Would say the content of the letter\nAnd I remember the content of the letter the content of the letter was in my opinion very very suspicious ... uh well I'll tell you what I said about it at the time that it could've come straight out of the White House press office now\nDo you have a copy of that letter and if you do you read it to us please\n[noise] uh\nOr have I caught you by surprise that just a matter of reaching across here okay well I figured somewhere you'd have that uh I'm telling you what I'll tell you know I mean\nLet me read it I have it right [noise]\nMaybe I should look at the table of contents\nAnd and I'll tell you what this is a good place fine I'll take a break it's that important I'll just give you a couple of minutes to find it\nI doubt it you got yeah go\nI made mistakes from ignorance inexperience nova work\nI did not knowingly violate any law or standard of conduct no one in the White House to my knowledge violated any law or standard of conduct including any action in the travel often there was no intent to benefit any individual what specific group\nThe FBI lied and they are important to the ... the press is covering up the legal benefits they receive from the travel off\nA GOP has lied and misrepresented its knowledge and its role uncovered a prior investigation\nThe ushers office plotted to have a cough incurred taking advantage cocky an HR the\nPublic will never believe the innocence of the Clinton and they're loyal staff the wall Street Journal editorial editors live without consequences I was not meant for the job\nOr the spotlight of public life of Washington Here ruining people is considered a sport\nAnd that's it that's it [noise] the\nPart that really grabbed me was they I just in a suicide note it I don't think you would say the public would never believed the innocence of the Clintons well\nIt was interesting missed often said you know he said any time you have a note that suddenly appears when they need to be such a duck and then it seemingly benefit from ...\nIt's just the immediate cause for concern\nAnd of course here you have so many just trying to state and federal only experts believe that the statement had been taken from other documents that he had that maybe he had written and other contact\nAnd had been put together a good word you will always try to imitate known writing\nSo they're trying to port well of course of course so you what\nWhy the letter doesn't mention suicide or death because it's been foster apparently didn't right I'm going to kill myself for good by world\nAnd yet that sounded like kind of a summary note nevertheless I mean some are rising everything to this point with some something in mind without having said suicide it did sound kind of final summation of the failure or however you want to look at it\nAt the press conference there were a number of reporters the number of TV network I don't think that ran on any of the television network\nWell there we come to a very interesting question now Reuters ran the story had been ... to me all day long there's a lot of excitement up about it out of their writers ran the story you say the networks were their\nCBS and NBC\nOh really yeah\nHow could they possibly ignore evidence of this sort I mean I guess CBS could choose to ignore it or protecting its sixty minutes division but what about the other is and what about the Associated Press and what are you know I mean does the\nPractice the major news outlet the country and they didn't send a reporter\nAnd then they got a copy of the report and they said they were going to do a whole new story here at least the dispatch I mean here Reuters did a major dispatch twice or like that they usually do on these types of stories and the a\nP uh editors for Washington were telling people yeah we're going to do a story and it ends up they do what the classic bury the story\nOr they save\nCuckoo paragraph literally at the end of a long story on white water hearing but nobody's interested in Washington a panel of experts to declare that the foster noted notify us\nUh from Mick tenth otherwise blah blah blah but\nThis is now all of three international forensic experts and they are saying apparently now you tell me without qualification it's a forgery how do they come back you know OK\nWell before they even get to the issue of forgery and they're also saying that the FBI and the park police totally mishandled that had nowhere and forensic examination do you ever come here a note like there are any no one document\nTo make the turn of vacation which is exactly what a park police and the FBI did\nFor the big question mark is why did they in the normal procedure and I quote in my article would you have the FBI crime lab assistant director and the former head of the question document unit the girl thank you know he wanted a minimum of ...\nWell the only that was funny that\nYou know the out of their own vi crime lab as as we all know is now under close scrutiny there's going to be an international a panel put together to look into the FBI crime lab\nWell who knows they may be a lot of crime going on there\n[noise] [laughter] well sticking with the note for a second the declaration that it is a forgery he is a blockbuster I mean if that's a forgery then the whole damn thing comes apart\nWell there's a couple of reasons why first of all the with the great quotes for fishing because\nThe note is found in a briefcase search the police said that they were suspicious of the fact that that brief case searched twice and was empty enough outlook that\nSecond it um benefited or people at the White House than ... the owner if up proving the suicide third ... was born and apparently the experts at any time you have a a document question document that is corn\nMutilated crumple from things build on it it is often prompted effort to make it come power that\nDifficult difficult sure\nSo already you have a primary face a case that the English experts at a physician then you look at the no\nAnd the first of all the donor if you look at a no which we have a photocopy if we had a huge blow up a right and comparing you can see that it is not a match that the way the stroke structured are done the flow the slant of the letter and it's not the fame\nSo then from a clear handwriting expertise point of view which is a good science it's a forgery\nWell it is a forgery and the other thing is what they were able to show in large blow up was that certain letters like when you write a letter let's say to let her be right you might only write that letter lower case B with one stroke start at the top down at the bottom\nYou've rounded out and then the last stroke is going over the next letter the end of the stroke\nBut ... born here will not do it that way he'll ride the line down he'll stop the stroke it might take the boat to let her be and start from the top of bringing around\nAnd you can see that from a large blow up and that's what they were able to show that for example\nUm was done in three stroke structured unlike officer who had a very\nTenuous the style of writing uh-huh what she's saying oh we had a dolphin document that we compare to three different for a very very clear that we ah that that that they will eat is Mac\n[noise]\nYou know uh this is starting to get very dangerous for some people Chris at this point\nIs like you like me\nLike anybody who's got anything to do is saying what we're saying right now but this has got to lead it's got to lead to the next step and\nPractice there were three experts here that came in and gave their opinion of the world's pre eminent handwriting experts came into this country\nKind of the doctor leave handwriting\nYeah mhm uh well actually he has a ... baggage and Dr Lee [noise]\nAh frankly\nAnd he's not and I'm On my doctor Lee um he accept or he asked for no fee to do this or an hour\nOh now that's interesting ah so so in other words the there could be no other uh external motivation other than trying to get to the truth\nWell the funny thing is I'm Dr all to knew very little about the case I mean he's been hearing a lot about it today and he's quite sure about it but he looked at it just as a matter of looking at this note and comparing it to a dozen document that\nFoster is known to have written and he said that it's not a match\nIt it was it was a forgery and you can see how the ...\nWrote the documents because the Ford you\nNever know how someone exactly right how their stroke well\nAll right hold it

that this is consistent with the fact that they had no fingerprint for only impression bummed these papers is consistent with the person who tore it having on gloved\n[laughter] [laughter] so it's a forgery so we've got a gigantic stories so the Associated Press now you give me what you can I Know this is touchy territory Chris letter\nWhile the eight page today promise the number of people that call and the media world here in in Washington announced that they were going to do a dispatch may have been you know short story but it would be a story\nJust published a story this Sunday laws and carried on the a P I Wonder why\nAbout a witness that was important Marcy on the night foster died he came in he was the first one to spot forced his car and he told the FBI and the park police that there was a Hispanic man sitting next to post his car watching it menacing him with very menacing looks followed him and the current edited the park\nAnd this um witness left immediately I'm a park police never went and visited him to interview him they spelled his name wrong in the police report you know\nWhen the FBI visited with him the FBI civil who was this man they gave you manage thing works with a Mexican American man and the FBI interview statement states very clearly that the witness was unable to identify it would be unable to identify on the line up work posit sketch who this man what\nWell there it is and the London telegraph this Sunday a composite sketch of the man he saw the park the FBI out and out lie in a new report\nOut this would maybe be a mistake\nIt happened one when we have so many instances in this case you know there were two witnesses later in the park it sought to man and then around ... car they set it on the record one guy was standing with long blond hair in front of false does harm to but the hood up just before the body was fat\nAlright look Chris you're pushing this one to the edge and ah you're beginning to now camp you know if in other words if the worst case scenario is true oh which seems now more likely than ever to me based on the forgeries thing\nThen you're tampering with forces that have already\nGone an awful long way here and and have a ... an awful lot at stake and even though you're a big time reporter I'm I'm not convinced that you're safe\nUm well you know there's there's risk involved in anything you do I've taken those risks and will continue to take the thrift because this is a very important story and uh uh you know the trip full half full\nMay they fall on me that I'll just take that\nTake that to want to come you know\nUm I take it you've given some amount of thought to this though I mean what were\nSome look if in fact it was a murder I Am one of the crime people behind expose again\nYeah I guess that's what I'm saying\nWell look and look what you know here Mike Wallace at the teeth but I think that the tea on the last time you know my brother called me up after the ... you know I've known you your whole life you've always been an honest person you've never won a lot of money never want it to a big job on Wall street type person\nAnd I just watch this and it makes you sound like you're a ally or be or Charlotte and trying to make money yeah\nI took a pay cut to continue doing this story [noise] um [noise]\nI don't want to say I mean how do you how do you argue against Mike Wallace knew that they knew that I'd never reported that foster with left handed a first that was both blown up\nBut I was going to be held responsible for every era than any paper ever done in the case I'm only in the Cape people out there that to look into it\nThat I'm On the right track and only indicates to me I'm On the right track when they have to make fun of me or when Mike Wallace seems almost eighty years old at the dean of American television journalism has to bring down a thirty year old reporter that's how old I Am\nAnd try to destroy his reputation\nThat shown that I'm having an impact\nWell if we look at it from the other direction\nThe implication is that I'm not making the charge but the implication is that the administration has control of very large segments of the media and I'm not making that charge but\nYou you could almost begin to believe that could be so because of the Associated Press under reporting because of sixty minutes going after you as they did\nI'm an because the news now is so shocking\nThat it just it has to be out there and it's not so so what does that say I mean if you look at what it says it says a large portion of the media is in bed with the government\nWell or the came media I don't know if everyone but came media the leaders of sixty minutes elite program you know Don you it has gone on the record producer sixty minutes saying that he helped get Clinton Clinton elected\nAfter the Jennifer Flowers thing then he edited that tape and such a way that he remained recast Bill Clinton Kennedy\nUm you know ABC very close association with the ministry of former Clinton campaign advisor\nOr what does that and to do for a while Rick Kaplan um you know you have these these connection with the Clintons are not good at governing uh but they're very good at dealing with the media handling\nThe seat in is spinning and [noise] All right look I'm going to end the interview here and I'm going to give out the number to the Associated

five\nChris thank you thank you\nGet some sleep That's Chris ruddy investigative journalist for the Pittsburgh Tribune review the Associated Press number twenty four hour number in Washington\nIf you want to see this followed up on is area code two zero to seven seven six nine\nIt's just um\nUnimaginable that she would not have put the you know even if there'd been a car in front of her which some say there may have been\nShe would not have hit the gas if necessary pushing not car and her ... into the intersection rather than collide with the train that was doing fifty miles an hour and had zero chance of stopping\nWhy didn't that bus move only she can answer it I guess\nA but just an absolutely an unbelievable tragedy\n\nIn Dallas a very interesting federal court decision\nOr a federal

race so I guess I'm a pragmatist you know me\nI can read the handwriting on the wall and I know that Pat Buchanan has been winning a lot of a straw polls and that kind of thing but I'm telling you now\nIt will come down to Clinton Dole and I think Powell Powell is going to run how\nIs for all we don't know about and we know a little bit about him now\n\nHe is pro choice\nWe know that\nWhat else do we know about ... he's a strong leader\nWe know that\nHe's brilliance I think we agree on that he\nTalks about some gun control or sensible gun control laws\nI Would have to hear that define before I Would um be able to make a judgment there\nBut in a number of areas he looks to be a fiscal conservative and a social middle of the rotor\nMoore a Republican or Democrat but it's getting hard to tell these days you know so if we get a Clinton dull Powell race I guess it might begin to be appropriate because I think that's what it's going to be to ask you which way you would be inclined to go\nSo why would you be inclined to go [laughter] [noise]\nI really think that's where it's going to go Congress are getting ready for a historic vote on the budget be attempt by the year two thousand

among the ...\nThis is just typical I suppose miss bill Mr ... only chance of surviving used to slowly\nRelease information which may involve other officials and so on and so on and the people are killed for a lot less he says you'd better watch your back as well given the reported scenario be willing to take care thank you note in Seattle typical well\nYeah you know I've thought about it and um\nSo what\nIs not exactly a cavalier attitude I mean I I have thought about it believe me or if what seems to be true is true then obviously powers that would do what they are alleged to have done or now seemingly have done because where it is a forgery lead you\n\nTo one of two very destructive plans for somebody\nVery powerful and there's been a lot of pressure and there's been a lot of manipulation and I'm no fool I Know what could happen but uh if I don't do it\nThen who is going to Chris Ruddy doesn't do it and who is going to\nThe Associated Press doesn't do it as they should then who is going to have sixty minutes doesn't do it as they should then who is going to\nGet somebody should and um there are um\nFar less noble things to die for is not is what it comes to then I'm exposing the truth or chasing the truth\n\nSo there you are\nBack to the lines west of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nHow are mourning mourning\nA you know it it's interesting the way the press is covering this thing whether that foster deal when when I was ah in service during a a a\nBreaking up to a ... story I was overseas Germany ... hours reading a European newspapers get more information sure that I was getting out of the magazines that I was describing to\nThere are there are certain similarities in the way the Washington Post had to doggedly pursue under criticism um the story now that is what is happening here now how long is the ... been in this condition I don't know he was well is it laziness I don't are back in\nThose days I think uh you know nobody want to report on what Kennedy was going or because they're with those guys to the the spirit of the times in those days was that we leave the president alone the dirty things about the president won't go our way back to to uh\nNot not quite true we leave the the woman ... or the bruising or the personal things\nYeah out but not this kind of thing\nBut over time the the scrutiny to which a public official has been hell has has gotten more and more you know we we kept FDR's wheelchair out of out of uh many people didn't even know he was in a wheelchair and nowadays you know we know what kind of underwear president whereas my\nCare yeah like we're supposed to care as wrong\nBut it was interesting I used to have to give an update to my friends back in the states about what was going on with the Watergate ... out because I got it out of the London paper and I got out of the uh uh English a printed a German newspaper\nI don't know what else you do with this look you don't ignore it that's all you don't ignore that I I guess maybe according to a lot of reports on getting of the Associated Press may have switched off their phones or they may be so overloaded that you know who knows I Hope it's true\nYeah this whole thing just thanked pretty badly it has for the whole time\nOr have had quite an air to quite there's too many unanswered thanks now who bumped into Princeton [laughter] ah there's just I guess at the age of unanswered questions like who was it that bumped on the back of ... will always be the unanswered question you know and who was it that are late that's foster out with no blood\nYou know it's almost tiresome sir and nobody wants to see another presidency falter and sale you know as Nixon did nobody wants nobody wants that for American nobody in their right mind could want that\nAnd I know ... ... feet\nI Know this is going to be seen as art bell or Chris Ruddy are both you know going after Clinton with an agenda but damn it that is not what this is about\nNow it's not about that at all I I understand it's not about that at all but ... you know we put it on a tasteful as it is if it is something that needs to be dealt with it is something that needs to be dealt with\nWell Americans have got to sit down and have a conversation I think after something like this with themselves and say are we still Americans really\nAnother one coming back from a second home in Oregon to Danica heading back to California and I never listened to calm like aesthetic canine with an interesting topic and ... and it was a young man who had flown down to LA ticket\nCan can you remove the powder that was put out there yeah so did you hear about that no they can act\nCalled toll free one eight hundred six twenty eight to five five\nAnd he's making a Disney movie\nOh well I'm sure than a lot organization being very sensitive to that sort of thing I'm there will be repercussions but I I was very interesting\nBut I Can't let me tell you what let me confirmed that story and I'll get it out All right yes\nAll right it today and you can do I think I mean and the way\nI can I I I Will know what their stance would be man thank you let me please investigate that story before I ...\nA because that is a very a very very serious charge and I'm not down in your word or but should you be wrong about something like that or there would be very serious a legal repercussions [noise]\nSo let me find out about that\nBut even if true or is it is certainly an isolated incident I'm not significant compared to what Chris Ruddy ah seems to have come up with here\n[noise]\n\nYou know ... reaction of course I guess I you know I guess it's going to be typical of the liberals\nAnd I guess there is going to be no way no escape from the accusation that I Am and Chris Ruddy is\nSimply going after this president\nAnd maybe it is that the midget liberal mind the myopic mind to the average liberal like Charlie cannot react in any other way even too serious\nOr not mid level but high level forensics expertise that absolutely demands an explanation demands an explanation and they can talk it away by saying that it's um I'm conservative not ball rhetoric\nIt isn't even close Charles ended really reveals a great deal about you as a person that you would approach it that way I Am quite surprised quite surprised [laughter] first time caller line you're on the air\nI hello a\nDog can barely hear you there you're going to have to get into the phone and shout out is\nOh okay I'm In here and yes ma'am\nAnd that last night and then one card but\nAt that uh I'm hanging on by\nTelling my comment yes right in the head of the ... it did yes\nAh oh I don't think you mentioned that last night the kid there are\nNo idea I mentioned it on several successive nights\nRight but that you had asked well we get a warning I did\nWell well I mean in in sort of a general way I have yeah sure if a comet where to hit earth would we know about it yeah\nWell I'm On a\nApril twenty third on your program plan what Helen\nYes and hear the topic was Catholic [noise] profit yes correct\nAnd he said that the boy they hand without warning with the great act of mercy and now by car would appear and the guy that might have wrote there\nUm well All right thank you it may be ma'am it may be and uh there was interesting you should mention that because of course I'm assuming you heard the facts I read last night about the piece that broke off which by the way is not\nIn the shape of across or anything like it right now there is a spiral\nUm and that has been noted by recent Hubble photographs a very strange spiral shape to the debris there is a piece that has broken off that is not thirty percent of the comment or somebody worried [laughter]\nIt is a piece that simply is reflecting probably because of the amount of material burning off at you know you take the dirty snowball if that's what it is new break off ... and you got fresh snow\nAnd so then that begins to get bright\nThe question the good question is\nWhy is it bright at All right now in other words it's out beyond the orbit of Jupiter and whether you're talking about the nucleus of the comet itself or a piece that breaks off there should not be enough energy from the sun to be melting and scattering debris as we are now see\nThat part of it does not make sense and again we will question or Richard ... about that when he's here friday night Saturday morning I don't want you to miss that program\nFriday night Saturday morning he's got a lot to say I'm not so much about the common but we will again ask about that because there must be energy to create the burn off that creates the reflected light that we see\nAnd where is that energy coming from east of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nGood morning to Tim calling from peeking\nUm uh the lady called not too long ago about the other guy produced or directed powder yeah that the true story

what was this since ... science fiction story\nThat people don't think of Frankenstein as science fiction that you know sometimes it's sort of like a big morality play but it really is in many respects ... one of the first major\nBig selling science fiction works and that's because um if you really if you think about the ... like it was like a I robot both the\n... version and then the robot that came before as most they're all kind of play on the same themes that are that are explored in Frankenstein between you know the creator and the creation and in fact in the very

I I think what was I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence ended the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... eventually let out of jail that it's kind of you if you can test and said yet was really sorry about that then you go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get ... and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying but for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them did anyone\nI didn't write it as an avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their beliefs on things are told to do in your life and it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible that's a great works of literature in place is because he kept right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing\nAnd by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of the rope on a hill O'Neill America\nWhich the or the end the population you said under about fifty thousand but of balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... ... a month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumped like that or is it just it's like it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but as this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up ... really\nThey've been getting warm all year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of\nYou know arrows and their host or to call a tourist and happens their biggest one is October which will never go\nWell I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a boots at a state there they can make their entire year in the weeks that the teacher is open so I I I Would never guess their shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but it but the other but the realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nBut now they're starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museum so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round us down grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem would it ... or their rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are ... you know ... or to or how they want\nPlace it is that those narratives are so good and there are so valuable but why and that's what I study [noise] and\nOne of the things I learned that sets true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy and proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers\nSo the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result\nIn somebody not getting a fair trial this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged in allegedly and how it is choose\nMainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the census right that sensational journalism the kind of news riding that stresses emotions over information risks rattling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history\nNot even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public\nInformed but at the same time call and letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part\nIn the injustices regarding the story of the men from the tree\nUp but [noise] this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime before death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule\nAbout the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer worked a fetish size the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn right they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think\nSo I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the ... that not run for your life by\nAll because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell\nAnd the unintended consequences that can happen or these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly the majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter but take it from me and my experience\nIs on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name\nBecause once it hits the wind you'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true there's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so\nNot everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things I've ever happened not everything is die hard to that everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy devil radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about people who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today say a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talked about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too late to get justice next on coast to coast am

I had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is\nAnd I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime bucks but very often the serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes and he would cover his track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd it is fresh crime happened to occur in the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston\nHis first crime occurred scrape west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered it in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it\nAnd it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the uh with uh with with all the last last murders and the series\nSo ah we ... it was just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argue that this was ham and almost nobody doesn't believe it\nBecause it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crime just for the prototype Chris Rock he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime\nThen excessively after that it is is the years went forward and yet ...\n... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times over guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five\nThe uh I think that he while he used an axe to commit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his\nBelt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and confronted him but um it was not what he was trying to do but his wife would do if you had to do\n[noise] I Want to get back to some of the U.S most of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was it that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... lead all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\nThey are what the general answer the question is the crime stories are fascinating to us because they they\nCome from the parts of our of our ourselves that we don't like to talk about\nA all crime stories are about lost and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but\nThere are part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we cover them up crime stories exposed those parts of ourselves\nThat we are ashamed of\nThe uh uh that's that's the general answered why I'm

wrong\nOr the uh I I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry go there surely a hit\nAnd and one of the things I learned from reading that is that what America walk off or was a an avid reader of crime stories uh Charles Dickens was going to have them at an avid reader of crime stories or Henry Fielding was it's it's very common among writers to be avid readers\nTolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because the ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nHuman nature that you do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from sports to me as I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand that but

energy\nAround people involved doing positive community things and writing demands from the train 'cause he likes to write about crime so do you want to finish that\n[noise] you're you're eating out I was not able to hear a lot of them\nAre fading out no Canada that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day and writing crime at night\n[noise] the thing that crime stories are very good because they they come from the parts of ourselves that we don't like to talk about going on\nTalk about in the case of the man the train I didn't make a deliberate and thoughtful entry into the subject I just got up like a fish\nUh I was I was I saw a documentary about the murders and below Scott Iowa called ... living with a ministry it's an extremely well I'm a documentary and far above the normal levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was missing\nWhich is that it's relatively obvious\nThat the ... murders are a part of a series so I started I was just going to put an hour and to\nAnd to trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a week the week eventually became five or six years or so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a true crime booked sure yes it is yeah you know and that's the interesting piece too is is that true crime [noise]\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research she goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the ... circuit writing preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution and they would do a sermon just before the execution\nThat we tried to provide the context for why this person was being executed and wide to community overall would benefit from his or her desk\nAnd became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their executions sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime near and is it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in it even though it's a hundred plus years later in some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of um a a a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities maybe this this lingering sent some some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On a new jak Lee what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were just they have it happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who uh was a\nA a ... his great great aunt had been was one of the victims of the crime that he had always believed that uh uh the man who\nUh was accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released always believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book bag and our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief to wherever\nThat was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that but it was it was a shy he said he was a tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was this other fellow at I don't know why it was important to him\nToo well I understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I I I don't know that there's a lot of different\nBut it still does have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think I could go ahead go ahead no please no a lot of the book and a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all all good books our church for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago\nAnd uh I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these ... that these murders occur to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's ... it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was a watery ... well what how people lived\nThat they they lived rich meaningful live\nA papal\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that happened ... who happen to us happened to them\nUh and I was trying to create a a picture unfortunately\nIt is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they died terrible Beth\nI'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town\nOr a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the tone for\nThe um the things that people age or the way that houses were constructed in their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St story telling and a journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThey ... they want it to that that always sticks with me that illustrate the party or just bang bang and that has to do with the the taco and the cases taco invented that it a lot of them I think it was ... ... where I had an alibi for the time of one of the crime is one of the crime was committed on December twenty four\nOf I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors\nAnd Italian community um a\nDeal because pickled ... were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflict in testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nSee a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right now or never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian or the way that the tally in America\nAnd he's lived a hundred years ago [noise] except that it's important than a crime story ... that's what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details of uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYeah [laughter] but I think that brings us very effectively ...\nIowa and the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a ... a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers or there's an effort to try to so it doesn't even have to be like a statue\nBut it is interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics piece that explains everything you know that\nThat's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um the one of the maps and trade crimes with the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder to families and whatnot and then joining how the uh uh but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell that to house right there um but it still has not forgotten\nOr many places many places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally I'm absolutely forgotten but at some of the ... still quite well remember [noise]\nSo I Want to you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because [noise]\nIt was

of the men from the train to research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy genes and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it just said that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so [laughter] so it goes wrong [laughter]\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different pockets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nSo somebody who might have grown up with a very dysfunctional household\nTends to clean toward dysfunctional relationships not go the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship to know how to act and so they keep re creating that until they break the habit [noise] um so fractals theory often that explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and you said\nYou know somebody from being destroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so did you spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment kind of thing so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate\nBy recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\nWell ... that there is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was\nA his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to them and that he was simply recreating at the ah ah again and again and again with more\nSome variation but more specimens specificity as it got went along\nSo that you know the ... the early patterns or not that tight but the\nThe later patterns get closer and closer to the first crime that's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that\nThat's who he was that that's a that's how he knew himself I don't doubt that Mr Miller had been the victim of terrible abuse has young person a he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHe had tiny widely spaced teeth\nOr he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look and he said he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd it's a terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and he was outrageous not that is in any sense of justification for what he did that but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] and the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the corps if that's what happened um speaks to\nThe age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've done and this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know do some barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation\nIn the book because a lot of things we don't know about you how are you you're going to have no after you're gonna have speculated of answer it's up to you I wouldn't speculate\nThat he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newt and family and in Eighteen Ninety eight I I ... I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because there is an obvious lack of planning and\nI'm preparation for the event live I don't doubt that he had committed pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I was very much would suspect that he had been adding inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a well he had it had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy and he said he ... it is his the documentation of his life around around the time with the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried it carried a tanker pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents\nThrough and about his life the um uh but I don't think the\nWhole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that's that's a great point we're headed gone into the navy do you know\nWe don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which he grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there have been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge\n... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who is the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy's sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they they just you know the ... thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not um [noise] he he didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... generally is uh\nArming right motor often well spoken\nTruly makes a good appearance he didn't do any of that maybe he was he was a true cycle a psychopath have no fear\nEver grab the norm at did not have normal fear and one thing that's apparent about this the ... and the trade is that from his crime he it was not\nEven not acting in fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with so I just probably not that I should've made this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller metro train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in ten years\nOr Fifteen and going to say well here's what the James's ... famous this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed the whole story about this crime and it when that guy Illinois and uh\nThe I don't we don't have any doubt that they are going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached

most elusive serial killer Bill James is the author and it's a it's just a terrific read very good writer a and a and yet you know until bill\nThere was not a lot it means he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was like ten or in longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know I mean just like even today we don't think about this people just driving around going up Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder but there are there are they get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through in a couple of weeks at a\nBill I got a couple of questions first of all I Need you to answer for me again ever seen any evidence ... saying like well we'll be accurate\nYeah what any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe uh I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the less murders were committed they ah it it's still\nIt's still around and and the has been the ... guide to the to the murders and the uh uh but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAll right uh you know what all will will buried by nature\nWell we don't it disappeared ... it was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be but he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much go at all it took her he might have worked for the road because he got to every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but a ticket for being on the air and I appreciate destroy\nThat you might actually she that hey you know actually that's a really good question though about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\n... ... what a in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal could make the murders on weekends this is taking to be a sign that he's employed a if a ... and if it happens a lot actually out there quite a few serial murderers who will who committed murders on\nWeekends or the or\nBecause they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to the um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working himself into the\nPerhaps stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that it's a lot of stocking but uh the just war game itself into the frame of mind that he could get where you needed to be\nA ...

and the fear that was part of his\nCriminal Jane is they ah they ah but ah so it is his crime and the unplanned crime and Eighteen Ninety eight\nDid buy a ticket to leave the town and this this led to
