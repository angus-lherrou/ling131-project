offensive if the president prepares you for federal offense you could still be nailed by a state court a gamble versus the United states could count the sort of multiple prosecution of double jeopardy and make it illegal\nSo the gamble case could read a ... a power the president currently does not have the power to ran an absolute pardon a burden that applies oppose the federal and state level this extended pardoning power could be very useful with members of the Trump team\nLike Paul Manafort or Michael Cohen and if the president decides to pardon himself equipped protecting them from

... flu virus now is called age three and two and the ... it's the big hitter especially on the the elderly but George\nThe numbers fly all over the place so the CDC is scaring us that a hundred and Seventy five children died last year but fifty percent of those had preexisting condition\nIt look on the flip side twelve thousand children died in accidents like cars fires and so forth the

story on coast to coast am shooting them before I even\nDid it [laughter] and I know that that that\nSounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology are going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said we're of course that place turned out to be Harriet fifty one from\nLas Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada and um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me\nUm it went viral I mean I I made the international news with this discovery I've had with the Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas that area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd so it seems to me that there has been a space force all ready for a long time and that space force serve the dual purpose I mean it can make\nA the defense of earth against other earthlings I'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps\nAll earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them that are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would have destroyed is already\nIf you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country\nThen why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do with ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nYou need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving\nUs better to be safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be few tile I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are being out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but you know here's this is getting dark this this is very dark but I honestly this is all a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien a fear us talk about\nTalk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel [noise] um if they they come back and they want to enslave us again because\nA lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever if their goal is to come back here to flavor it might be a better fate for\nUs to commit to global suicide in other words and again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back and put you know callers on us\nAnd and work like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other\nAs we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan I'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might've been before\nThe un jumped in what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nWhat did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people who are banding together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to raw as well and um you know the the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep\n[noise] I mean there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some ah beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against and they're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do\nAnd so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps presenting that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them a few little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings have run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah thank you it's it's this Saturday it's October the thirteenth this is going to be my final\nWishing

Nineteen years old and he's\nA I had an uncle had passed away and they were having a little little selfish blank check and I wasn't that close to him but I just said yeah anyway I I went I was late getting as so I had sit in the back treacherous\nAnd services going on and all of a sudden I felt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the pushing the check and I looked up and it was my uncle they just passed away\nAnd he\nTold me he said John ... your car and I wish I was shot at it and what to do and then again he said John don't value car when I was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up very late and what he was gone but\nStill I was ... and ...\nAnd so I got it right on our friend of mine in the next morning I called my cousin which was the man it has to wait\nAnd asking the tape it and then bringing my collectively and I get him right back home he shouldn't matter though so early in his go and get my car and the key to pulling that anyway\nHe um got my car they pull that the ... fault line and they were hit by a truck and they they weren't killed but they were extremely you know I mean they had ... votes and that\nBut I never told anybody this ad was reluctant to see anything that it would it till two of my close friends and I'm Out of a leg late at night with the show and they have the I guess you know up until now I haven't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the\nCar you know what I didn't want to do that and he told me down and\nSaid you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no that was the idea\nThat they would be and you get my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was a time I ever had anything to me like a safe stage goes to get all the same thing as for CNN\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks among us right now who where are you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like that song by the police\nAnd so when you are spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presidents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see the future to a degree that you cannot\nOr it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle ah they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms\nThat are coming that the aunt can't see but the aunt is more sensitive to what's happening I'm On a lower level\nSo anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who passed over my definitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation\nAnd see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point live like a king and and and this is very funny because\nStill do them yeah yeah\nYou know I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous ads are Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there\nThey were taking him out and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations on him and it was when the shock wave of curses and\nBad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this dog here and you know\nRobert who is fighting back\nYeah and it's because of that that um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful\nPeople now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people who were going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace and I think it's in part\nYou have so much of that which is creepy around western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes having a conscious that so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these ball the white\nAre just merely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or they might also have some sense of intelligence and uh this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua his website Joshua ...

I perfectly\nAnd he's looking at me and I start mop and they continue mop like okay this kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering it seems like since I've been working there for about a month like\nHe think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit to really show theirselves and he\nWasn't supposed to be there or was he\nI I don't think so I talked to see in a in a couple of the nurses and they told me that they\nEveryone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people that they feel like someone to watching them and I was just wondering might huh\nJosh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon because of the full moon I can tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHow do you know a little boy died there\nYou know I I asked them and they sent from what we understand no owned died there but they said we don't know a full history\nOf Illinois in ... where do you think Josh\n[noise] well ... thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to what I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being\nMagnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder\nDrier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet and touched the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating Loomis life forms making objects move without any visible source a creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro steady charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm and that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible filled around that that creates a physical effect\nBut then the third and final point of course is that this time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that it again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something go sleep spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nInsurance don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody is becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat ah I every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent in North Carolina then there are in Scotland and uh we should remember that the very first attempt at an English settlements\nWhat's in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Roanoke Island\nAnd they all vanished so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mystery the ah last calling me and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating Sao on Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited and I'm sure contributed to the fact that ah I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your ability to get more and more time\nOr I go to Joshua pie Warren

got it ending out but\nAnd he writes the anti matter column which looks at\nFringe science and the paranormal for the online magazine uses his experience in journalism\nAnd his interest in both go slower and the paranormal to collect and tell stories all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard talking about some haunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much thanks for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that way\n[laughter] on Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up\nYeah thank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't interested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned ah I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature story a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or did Halloween cut into your birthday when you're you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday ex financial I refer to it as the season of Matt now\nI Love it is kicking off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell I after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to find another project to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek [laughter]\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nA and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural\nSo I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any good stories and and sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple ghost stories with\nYou know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a hunted World War two ah it turned into beaches to really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these goals stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to regular kind\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university ... stories haunted rock and roll ghost stories of country music there was there sort of a light hearted aspect of those stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower\nUm and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of atrocities and World War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities\nSo there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what they they brought\nOr the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research hunted World War two was that um\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think go stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect into history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nA you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops enormous during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nIsn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere\nBecause I had um a friend who just went through the little big corn oh we're customs less than ones and you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg we know is on to write I'm sure there are other battlefield that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting does it because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\n... there there are a lot of theories about\nWhy battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they say that this in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma\nOf war ah causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nOn the other hand there there are some a theorist that also say that you know\nThe shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plane to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what\nThe skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal ah activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nLose their own specific battlefield that you would say is the most talented a bowl\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say ah Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories\nAre especially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourist there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications uh seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker and when\nThe daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunker they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she sold these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe\nTheir uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff immediately recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that away from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what\nCould have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and uh his name's Tom put do and he told me that uh he investigated the R D end battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany\nJust to like that yeah yeah like you want to do a different time war or something right\nAnd the reason I looked into the these are\nA ghost plane stories is when I was young my parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they\nWere starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy or you can make it sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Erie\nThat watch it with my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well\nEngland was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any any stories similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handles hundreds

rock and roll ghosts of country music more haunted rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest onto the world war two soldiers spirits ghost planes and strange synchronous cities Pearl Harbor is it haunted or not\nPilots were trained bomber pilots fighter pilots a fighter pilots for a night I'm fighting a squadron were documented some of some of the most startling run ins with these UFOs\nThere's a story of alone be Seventeen crew that watch to UFO track them for miles I I think almost a about an hour and then of course a lot of people consider what's known as the battle of Los Angeles\nWas a great story of those\nYeah that's an amazing story and a and usually I think the was the story was the moving Nineteen forty one with John Belushi they made it seem like it was just based on what the war department called war nerves in other words this was\nA shortly after World War two I think er I'm Sorry after the bombing of Pearl Harbor I Believe it was in February of Nineteen forty two\n[noise] and aircraft gunners anti aircraft guns started firing in the air there was all kinds of pandemonium a and the war department just said the the people were nervous but I found a very uh an account from a very uh good witness\nWho are actually was a ... a professor\nAt occidental college um later he was just a kid at the time and he said that uh what he witnessed was a huge object that was pretty much just standing at ... sitting still in the middle of the uh right above the ocean\nThat these guns were trained right on it and it didn't seem to have any effect and then it drifted it almost sounded like it drifted right over his head so it was a to me that was more of a story about something weird happening in the sky let alone a war nerves\nIll and and they shot against the Matthew people could hear ... sounds yeah and we're getting something\nThis this person actually said uh some of the shelves were landing a few feet away from them and they had a the spotlight trained on it I think there's a a pretty dramatic picture that shows\nIt is dramatic\nMatthew swing with us his latest book haunted World War two where do you get the book after you\nYou can get it at Amazon dot com Barnes and noble dot com go tea or a a local bookstore and see if they have it in if they don't shake 'em down and try to get it in for me I'd appreciate it\nWhat about haunted ships from World war two\nWell I didn't want to just I didn't want to leave our our sailors out\nNo nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside\nWell yeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so the interesting thing about uh after World War two was you had these battleships\nYou had a aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that it was a shame to just got all them or to reduce them to scrap it uh luckily for us a lot of\nPeople got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports\nThey brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the one sitcom shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy [noise]\nUh there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing the shadow creature around the uh the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship based uh audited sites uh there there\nIs a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform\nWho wanders around the deck some of the battle ship the USS North Carolina I worked with a uh a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal and they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there\nUm and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those uh and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved um and have him back here ghosts and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seemed\nTo all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy ... for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\nYeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element of uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but uh when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of\nOf country these tragedies just seem to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a\nInteraction between consciousness of reality or maybe they were just so primed um to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew Swain we're gonna take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of your haunted rock and roll stories those ... those are fantastic too\nI Love them that's one of my favorites\nAnd they just keep coming more and more and more they just never stopped like you know people like Michael Jackson who passed on now when prince and folks like that have they come back you up to a ... as a ghost\n... well there are definitely go stories about Michael Jackson uh there were a few a video anomalies\nWhen a when I Believe his brother I Believe it might have been germane was being interviewed people said they so Michael Jackson walk up behind him there are stories from a neighbor's of a former home owned by Michael Jackson who claim to hear music coming out of it at odd times\nWhen there shouldn't be anybody at home so that definitely a\nMichael Jackson coasts have been seen there are starting right now a lot more good stories about prince who just died I think back in two thousand sixteen I'm\nHis Paisley Park has his recording studio several of the workers they claim to hear people shuffling\nAround they hear voices fans have also blogged about how they believe like they've had an encounter with that goes to\nPrint out they seem to be everywhere will come back we'll talk more about some of these altered rock and roll stories and take some calls next on the coast to coast Dale\nJoined the

that Hitler was a a cult practitioner throughout his life but what I found through my research and this is pretty controversial and I'm sure there are people have different ideas and I'd be glad to entertain those thoughts too\nBut it sounds like Hitler's early a philosophy was influenced by a cold groups like the full society in the real society very prevalent in a pre World War two Germany in that area\nBut what I think happened was that Hitler was of all things are not in a coal theorists but more of an incredible sociopathic nurse assistant I don't think he could think\nThat there was any type of power a worthy of him I think he thought he was the ultimate power and that the state was the ultimate power and so what you see you later is that a Hitler begin to purge a lot of it is a

rate fell in September from three point nine to three point seven percent the lowest level since the Vietnam War\nWhile hiring cooled slightly one hundred thirty four thousand jobs were added Here's Mark Hamm Rick senior industry analyst at bank rate dot com ... what's that number mean\nIt means that there's nothing to see here and move along meaning that uh that number is being widely regarded as being an accurate portrayal of the job market largely because of Hurricane Florence so\nAh we believe the trend remains in place a big cause we're adding about a two hundred thousand jobs a month on this country\nFor Eighteen straight months Gordon ... unemployment rate has been below four and a half percent\nFour years ago the Federal Reserve projected are an essential adjusted\nAbout project it back then that four and a half percent was essentially for employment in our country and we've been below that level for uh Eighteen months so uh the economy continues to grow it a robust rate the job market a continuing to chime in as well and so this was a good time for workers\nEmployers are having some strange from the standpoint of trying to find well qualified workers ah but you know that's a good issue for workers to have\nWhat about the wages now is the markets starting to push those wages up on a continuous basis\nNot to the degree that we would've expected by this point and so in this report a bit of a disappointment from the uh hoping to get more pay standpoint average hourly earnings up below three percent two point eight percent actually a bit of a backtracking there\nAnd so what the unemployment rate now at a level that was last seen in Nineteen sixty nine what were you doing when the Beatles were still together a you know we would have thought that wage growth would have been more substantial at this point and uh it's not the case\nAnd speak with mark ... senior economic analyst at ... dot com talking about the September jobs report\nUm does the wage issue remain a mystery are we just kinda waiting patiently for things to show real progress because I really don't understand why why the wages aren't going up or they are in some cases obviously yeah\nAh well for one that's of average right so that's the old your results may very routine and we think about\nHow ah without getting into politics that we have a political divide in this country that at least to a modest degree as a full informed by\nDifferent individuals economic experience so you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nA and nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is I said as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good place as well\nWhether when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector your work again so I'm\nTo the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that are ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world ah and perhaps none of that changes frankly\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer what it has to be asked\nBy people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left\nI think the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go a ... but you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth unexpected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does it extend another words doesn't mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output for another two plus years\nOr does it mean that we're overheating at some point you just can't improve any further and that's the answer that only comes after the fact but I think for most of us I think the the most important attribute that important question is for now\nEvery year you should be checking around and look at it takes you know with these insurance dot com here while I credit ... out of all those places they're making it a lot easier and by the way we're going to the more that I take care

a state\nIn Austin be at a concert with the notion that true fifty thousand people a which is probably the biggest political rallies since President Obama's to make campaign\nBut the question for Mr O'Rourke and protect us Democrats is that\nHis appeal is strongest with young people and Hispanic voters and those are the demographics that\nAre as we know from twenty sixteen the past election tend not to show up in numbers proportionate to their share of the population really admit trouble elections were in turn out a goes away down compared to presidential years uh and so ah the ... campaign and then Texas Democrats think that\nUh they will have a surgeon voter turnout or like what President Obama did and that may or similarly to like what President Trump did with white working class voters or non college educated white voters and twice sixteen but there's not\nSo far a lot of evidence hurting our data to show that that's going to be the case\nThere was the interesting a data deep dive you did because as you point out Texas Hispanics or Texas Hispanic voters or not the same as Hispanic voters elsewhere around the country\nThey tend to be a little more Republican than a dispatch around the country I think in twenty sixteen it was a thirty four percent of Hispanics where the Republican twenty eight percent and the rest of the country um but the bigger issue is that\nYou have a lot of these congressional districts in Texas are are surely gerrymandered too many Democrats as possible in them and they just haven't seen competitive races are not just for Congress but the can down the ballot for for all races uh you know and so that the general elections have been a cakewalk short one party or the other\nUh and there hasn't been there's been no at that up to that there really hasn't been a competitive statewide race in Texas for anything in Twenty years uh and so there's not a\nPolitical machinery to get folks out to vote or the ... campaign has had to go back on the fly over the course last year and a half a and whether there'll be able to do it\nOr in time for November stick to the big question\nFrom speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Reid Epstein is written a piece titled Beto O'Rourke draws big crowds in Texas but he's voters to not to vote the reluctance to vote is a presumption that a Democrat can win like what we're what does that come from\nJust no I mean if you ask a Mr O'Rourke he'll tell you that nobody's going to ask for a and he is he talks a in his stump speech about having it at all two hundred and fifty four counties in Texas and even the ... the big state uh and some of these counties are very small uh some of the counties that\n... that I was a bit in Texas twice this year to visit him a C\nAnd campaigning and buy in February when I was down there he was then counties a mj having more people show up to his him we hadn't voted in the twenties sixteen election in those counties a and so\nHe thinks that he's able to draw a people out who haven't participated before because there's been a little reason to court because who has been so Republican uh one of the things that he says on the campaign trails that he doesn't believe that Texas with a red state but it's a non voting state\nOr you can just get Democrats to show up\nA then it'll be competitive now the corollary to that is by\nHis house district in El Paso or haven't voted much either so there's not [noise] while he is certainly been very compelling on the um the campaign trail has drawn enormous numbers of people ah the evidence that he can get to
