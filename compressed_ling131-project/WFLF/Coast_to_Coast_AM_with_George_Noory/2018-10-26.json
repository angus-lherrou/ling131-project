G Jonathan how do we explain this how do you explain this to people who are non believers in all this who might say oh you just tap what do you say to them\nWell first I look at him for a while and I try to figure out what might resonate with someone like that but I often start with\nI happen to believe at this point that the past and the president and the future all exists and the infinite realm our human senses only perceive a small slice of what exists in the infinite world\nSo I don't view that I'm a good judge of what exists outside of what I can see with my eyes or ears you know the the basic human senses and so I generally try to start with that and I asked someone well how do you know you are seeing everything that is\nHow do you know that would question the question and often that stop someone because you\nOne can take a book with a pattern on it and move it in such a way in front of your eyes that it goes through a blind spot and then you're I technically can't see it but the image is still there\nTo your to your brain\nJohn do you believe in God\nI Believe in a higher power I Believe in a higher wisdom I Believe in a higher form of energy I find that there's no other explanation for all of us were you angry with that higher power\nWhen this happened you know I wasn't and\nI really had a hard time getting angry I found the most comfort in accepting if you will that has come my way\nAnd my hope is my sense is that this has a higher meaning that I don't have all the details but if I go with it rather than fight it it makes my days a lot easier\nWhat message would you have for somebody drawn who's going through the same thing you went through\n[noise] the message I Would say would be when it gets really really dark that's where you find something that's really really white\n[noise]\nAnd it sounds like you have devoted your lifestyle to this mission of getting the word out about what happened to Ralph the dangers of some of these medicines and of course what's on the other side don't stop or right\nI I don't intend to I Am I'm definitely devoted to communicating what happened to him but at a higher humanistic level their chores there are a lot of people that have a lot of pain and in that pain my message to people is there's a lot of white you just have to look for it\n\n\nOne of the few people who really doesn't need a major introduction to open our doors award winning journalist\nAnd she's been with us since the beginning of the ... program in ... dot com tonight she's got a series of very special programs starting with planted ... story Linda the just the just fascinates everybody doesn't it\nDoes and they keep becoming more interesting it was nearly three years ago at the end of January twenty sixteen I reported or files dot com and my coast to coast AM radio broadcast than that a new ninth planet or planet X.\nWas indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt and the art cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is a disc shape residue of rock dust in ice left over from our solar systems creation and it extends from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto\nTo about fifty astronomical unit from our son and the ... cloud of mostly\nIce and dust goes much further starting where the ... rebelled in an extension for three point to light years from earth in a severe Ikle shape that surround our entire solar system including the ... belt\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at mayor files dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I say planet nine was indirectly found in twenty sixteen because to date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object\nBut Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena here and now it's back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times\nThe mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nProtests around simply called the planet nine because he's the astronomer that got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades and it was\nTwenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called era out in the ... rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that Pluto or should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to a dwarf planet and the hyper belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing a go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object that cluster together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery it's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the ... observatory in Hawaii to find planet nine invisible light and or infrared\nProfessor brown says that it is quote tail like chasing I'd go after more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet to be only seven times more massive than earth and just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update\nOn his search for this elusive planet nine or planted act that he uh is still trying to find\nAnd he told me that he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to visually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement\nAnd for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than that distance from the earth to the sun so that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than Neptune\nAll good way out there but they had narrowed down the focus so\nHe's deliberately going\nOn November first started another search because the new calculations predict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter here now from the California Institute of technology\nPlanetary science department in Pasadena, California drawn I mean professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion\nIs a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellation as up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November the date when you start to remember first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eye because so far the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what your I Would say just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet now and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system perturbation an even keel thing the plane in the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even see yeah\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look at it\nWill be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it will be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized it'd be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets\nSometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or sitting inside of our solar system where Neptune and Uranus are but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but in till we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with this now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what it could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it will be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAny that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter lightly it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and the ... cloud\n...

have devastating consequences\nRight now where computer models showing to do is have you worked on the eye PCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to do\nIt could be substantially worse than even those ...\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact\nIt seems that some of the larger nation the United states included my adding poll now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians\nAssuming that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that short a period of time and it will be somebody else's problem a decade or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes in houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are are having to be abandoned both on the east coast and the Alaska duty rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level rise and forced to migrate as their\nCities become inhabitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you get ... of such migrants at one point five degrees\nBut you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from Lola choose\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war in ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises\nSo does that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law the American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality\nHas taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was ... years ago\nSo global climate change and increasing more gas and we bring more wars\nYes you can go\n... well it it's a terrible future if we can't get this under control and one of the big headline the summer of twenty Eighteen million for at home may see sea level rise flooding\nOver the rest of the century and in fact it is so bad that all the forty eight continental US state\nFor that now has the most property at risk a study finds that three hundred and fifty one billion dollars worth of homes will be risking that title flooding the researchers say if that global warming and sea level rise does continue\nThat in more than one million properties in Florida well have chronic flooding\nAnd that when you look at the map as it is extended by computers over the rest of this century that sea level rise which is already\nOne of the big secret uh kept in Miami by the political institution there is it they get flooding constantly on full moon it constantly flooding on high tides they get constantly flooding all over the time and everybody who live there now is\nIt and that political governments and Mary saying we're not going to let anybody know that we have flooding in the streets of Miami nonsense\nThat got to take the bull by the horns and deal with it\nAnd as you look at the map uh knowing that the Arctic had melted two to three times faster than the computer projection well George when you look at the map of what is expected to happen to Florida\nOver the Next Fifty years and know that what happened with the Arctic was two to three times faster if Florida had water flooding\nLet's say three times faster than the current compared that projection that I mean that most of the southern

channel broadcasts and since then on Monday Wednesday evening beginning at seven thirty PM mountain\nAnd another time around the country in the world I've been in my office where I'm Talking to you tonight in front of a computer is sharing you win the general audience that is growing around the world from my work and they like uh my YouTube channel\nWell John to three weeks ago in October third I was doing update on ... category [laughter] had it with\nThe very distressing subject how cat had a cat around the world was weird\nAnd Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was a car wreck kill\nAnd that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all and then I was also doing an update about the sunspot solar observatory shut down I had received a whistle blower email saying that are actually\nThe child pornography was just funny deflection that he actually involve the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatory computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range and how an Airforce\nBase down below the solar observatory nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then third update had evolved from my asking my or fires YouTube channel\nYeah on September twelfth anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body\nSpecifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately and I had received a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before on this is what I was talking about when\nThe next morning on October fourth floor a Moriarty who manages my are filed\nSocial media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream so I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird\nOr I sent the puzzle to a photo shop a video and also I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a come like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a my er files report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see these videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was that\nHe thinks this is truly anonymous and uh then I asked a that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office and believe it or not\nA second I'm One of these whatever they are\nCame between my hands and up to my right shoulder on October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me emails about their own experiences with the smoky\nFog is it like ...\nI Do not know this is the extremely a translucent and uh when I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt that there were people who were telling me they had never\nMentioned any of this parent to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard and he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida\nBut what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight\nThinking about all of this is provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now\nIs Charles hazards are talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now some city center Florida home\nThis was in the spring of two thousand in age\nAnd I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn sure the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the poverty level my show and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see\nAnd then suddenly I just\nI was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I open them again and through the window I can see this misty gray ball drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was\nThat in this dark bedroom it was luminous and I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling and slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head and I was just frozen\nThe fascination of I didn't know what to think and then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted Ira Glass passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was feeling of euphoria and one is with this living thing that was surrounding me\nAnd then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time I was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers was coming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously and I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it\nI don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was shown loving\nCan you describe the shape of a ... that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of look kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head ... possibly\nKnow there were no words there was no sound the hiring glitz we're almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I can see polar fully these high Wrigley but they had the same texture as the fog good would shadow in life\nBut they were living and I said the same time and they would just float by me but kind of mean\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head\nAnd as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a download information that was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was the super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall this information because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any subjects in your mind or your soul about who we'd be doing and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it made because in my past experience with ever since I was a child I've had psychic dreams\nAnd scientists are all for coming forward and saying that that information about this and and I it it there's anybody listening on ...\nIf you are in the military government whistle blower category or human abducted category and you have any information\nAbout a huge water\nThat could end up affecting our planet\nWithin salad I won't call us with conversations with Linda which is coming up later but we've got more when we come back

production we predicted silver would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely nuts nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now solar\nIn fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown the hall I guess not but could super reach higher than a hundred dollars announce\nHoops you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach its all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach\nOne could that happen over the next\nSeven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate do you have anything that you can send out

our planet probably based here [noise]\nAnd uh I did some tracking down and learned that Zacharias that Jim was working and living in Manhattan I'm over on the East River working at UNICEF and I found out a phone number I had no idea where it was but I had a phone number for the given to me\nAnd I called up a woman answered\nAnd said she was the secretary for Zacharias itch in and I set up a

where you would talk through\nAnd I am being out in the city of New York through a fan how why huge glass window and by then I Know that one of these thirty five thousand dollar a month on\nWhy and uh she uh that uh uh just a moment and she made some kind of a phone or intercom connection\nAnd she said now you can go in to Mr sectioned off it so I wasn't even in his office I was in an outer chamber minutes ago and\nThen I went in and it was a beautiful often with window overlooking New York\nAnd when we sat down to talk and I'm staring at decorate pitch and blue eyes magnified by his black eye
