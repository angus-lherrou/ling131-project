of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consulting Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus from so hopeless\nIs is a Google of a social networking

going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's going on for ages though with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise] really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy on through posts right these are both things that drives people crazy\nHer latest book [noise] so there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have the ads you gotta have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people\nOnto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's been going on but sizes everything with social media of scale is everything at Google just never really got that scale now\nThis brief that occurred well all the right at the top uh they currently found out about this ... months ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise] apparently there is that\nThey really didn't is they found that in a during ... as I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that were that were um theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that a lot of stuff that people have with Facebook\nSo they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation and they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient I won't say excuse\nBut ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for\nSetting into motion the sun setting of Google Plus over a period of about\nA month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place um and uh it would have been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who have been using Google Plus all these years or try to find other places to go we're experimenting with other things\nAnd I'll mention that there the Google commercial version of cocoa puff which operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about

were very surprised to hear that uh but I think as I told people about the evidence that I was referring to people parked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up with the pre cognition tell us a cycle couldn't he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nSo the computer will vary that picture shown sometimes it's a violent picture some time that the picture of a peaceful landscape like a mountain or river want something that wouldn't arouse the body what we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect\nThink Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture is shown\n[noise] years ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chose videotapes of various anchor people and the the one that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired or they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter or with the people in the audience they never got hired\nI I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that type of technology that is being used in present cement experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no cycle can nieces is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm\nConsciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also looked at remote viewing but he also he looked at like ... which is disability for the mind that matter\nClassic study used this random number generators these are machines that spit out zeroes and ones and it totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does is ask people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more one heroes again what do we find is that there is a mall but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible response is during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd and people do people have that ability going up\nThat's right George those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experimenter have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world around an event that we know\nAre produced heightened emotions and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant ... basically at a time I had a single moment\nThat we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers\nBefore the event that\nBefore the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nFor a yellow her you know the name of course an incredible ability or if you believe what he did\nFor ... she had the ability to use have been spoons and keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who say dollars trickery its magic but do you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nCandidate B. taught ... be taught\n\nWell I've heard of of spoon bending parties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually\nBending metal for example and early ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw\n... then and there are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gal her very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I include in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons ending within the context of remote viewing bellies and what they say and this is a direct quote\nFrom a classified document where he was he was put under very I mean they were watching him closely what the documents that is as a result of Keller except in this experimental period\nWe consider that he has demonstrated paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo yeah there has been a lot about him but he documents suggest that studied or run and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the ability that maybe he was able to get things using his mind that down totally crazy\n\n\nWelcome\nBack Marc ... with us and we'll get to your calls as well this hour mark ... near death experiences again and we were talking about whether the brain hallucinates\nShows that light that everybody seems to see going into the tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up short this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond Lucy nation perhaps they give them into a window into a reality that we typically don't eat with our eyes that I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have\nTheir in cardiac arrest ... and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than ... people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nSo these are cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in cardiac arrest is severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is\nFrom Dr Sam ... in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room\nIt was later found to be the difficulty later and we know that that's happened during the time he had no brain functioning because the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body\nThey see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body\nAnd tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard\nAnd it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience memories\nAre but what I've found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual study that the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce great in his one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through a normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities in markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals butts they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see but they're out there\nThat's such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and our ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes Shoah a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned a lot haven't you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid at Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes\nI Am a rational atheist Anna materialist however I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and the ... ah where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes\nUh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil I Would call it an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I wouldn't call it may be seeing your Laramie no space no time\nA dimension but my question to you is specifically I liked it\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded Xanax her aunt antidepressants or major tranquilizers ... [laughter]\n... chemically the brain and their work they do affect chemically the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through that\nTakes the going back to so I Know it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and in the mind and that's\nMy first part my second part of the same one question is Alzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious of the mines dusting that show and here's my question for your doesn't that show that if\nThe mine in the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to that the mine is connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another we\nCan't automatically concluded that one causes the other so here's the simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [laughter] imagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness damage the brain you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver\nWhich similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhat ... what do you think mark reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nAnd in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drumming let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another offensively\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nRight George and I have a question for your gas sure how I thank you for a ban on the show so I'm back in two thousand and one I experience [laughter] I told comment was set on but it was actually six mental tell a path experiences with in one week\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has our he's outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the whirlpool analogy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though there are localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept water that outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us Yes sir so you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's er it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately what me only because of my background it would be no personal experience I a lot of things that I dealt with I including those sightings and everything else I've been able to do something else\nOkay so you're you're basically a skeptic who will believe if you find the proof\nOr\n[noise]\n\nWent on to lose your three on news radio not even going one\nIs on Fox News or the monster gets bigger hurricane Michael strengthens to an extremely dangerous

if everything derived from consciousness that's the same thing that Michael ... talks\nAbout Detroit with consciousness willing sound like you're open to the possibility that there's something very unusual going on\nYes I'm In my work in my work I've often not often but several times over my career I had the opportunity to accompany a rural folks farm folks on ... with water which\nIn yes okay I've seen it work the at work and then seeing the drillers calm and drill right to that\nSame to adapt and there it is on the water and there it is you\nKnow again I'm a scientist okay so it's not that that there is this something there that we don't fully understand\nThen can we say that it's the ... the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's suppose that um the Dow is er and I've seen that with three different methods brass rods willow sticks and ...\nOver a map mhm okay I'll watch pendulum over a map which was the most strangest one of all that somebody could could could find water\nYeah it is yeah up comes to water [laughter] so are is the Dow is there a particularly sensitive\nTo the electromagnetic rocks and the earth caused by the water moving through various layers of conducting semi conducting insulating properties who knows\nWhat can I just had the scientists we need to win science cannot ignore it cannot ignore going all the way back you know your your\nGuest mentioned William James\nOkay all that whole period when all of this a lot of this early early research started\nInto shall we say five to ... and other other sorts of things and I I I I've never seen the U.S I never see what I could call a UFO the night sky I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw when I never did before but I saw two\nYeah so I Can't I Kevin put up all this stuff that has to do for instance a desert tortoises will show up at the mud hole the desert tortoise in the southwest will show up at the mud hole prior to\nWhen the rain comes out within within you know maybe that's something to do with the change in the air pressure and they know that feeling yeah they can feel it it's it's they're reading comic but to the ... the head to the native folks\nThat lived in that country that made that animal pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin say the things Steven just said we're on our way isn't it\nYeah even raises a number really good point about the need to study these phenomena much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough\nAnd that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's a academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on even know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\n[noise] mhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field the physics that has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counterintuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglements\nAnd the very basic phenomenon is you have to particle two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect which suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness\nNow Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light what the faster than anything the travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between ... articles\nThat there are things in the ... of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\n\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do tactically this it opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which if we're all connected and helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that it has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you again in one more time you bought your website and where people can get your book and

book by wrong collecting Maureen would more goes chronicles stories from the role of the unknown the unexplained the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic transfer medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe has communicated with the D.C shut the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which of Salem, Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to doubt only understand but also control this gift at the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adults say on says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more he has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on coast to coast Maureen welcome\nThank you so much for having me look good for to this fine uh Fifteen Years old all this happened for you\nYeah I Know as you're reading that and thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know he's very wonderful one when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was barely renowned and the city and she still is on it now and it's not a high priest ... and you know often\nWhen I was younger you are walking around town you know dressed in her her guide and very regal looking very um you know she tried to come out of her and ... at\nThe time did people welcomed with open arms or did they go oh my God there's a which\nYeah that's a great question you know there are many people that welcoming her with open arms but\nLet's just say the town and family I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the business and you know and the town at Salem and those who really believed in\nCraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed the whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right for the type of season and it's you know go to Salem um so I think that it really worked out well for the town of Sam\nKnow you are a few generations trench medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family your disability what year did to start with\nNo my um\n[noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if she didn't want to scare me she just you know my poor father though he thought just those girls insane [laughter] um but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirits I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by\nUm and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just to you know she told my father she's normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but say in the matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was with talking you know in their sixties she finally told me that Jesus you know what Marlene\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and do readings for them and she said you know I hear the spirits but I just turn up the radio\nSo would\nYou see that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so\nI never really knew her um\nBut my great grand right grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDo the overpass dome stories from one to the other the food you could carry through\nYou know the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and she was maybe\nMaybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know\nThat was her true so she was very unique because that's what she said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand and one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me\nTo tell the story but he's started this story after on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took to try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um [noise] you know he started cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing on goes that his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus on but\nIt's a team of individual that\nYou know over the years I learned you know to me everybody is really\nYou know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to [noise] to want to look into that they're quite\nSatisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain\nAnd people were getting a little freaked out and they need help\nSo it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help on\nHow many people are just off the wall when you go to their house and then you're just using that\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\n[laughter] I'll show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred investigation is um I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time but we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise]\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's good reason why you don't see it [noise] um so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of\nParanormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\n... what do you conclude about what this may be I mean a lot of people have their thoughts about what goes or what do you think they are\nWell I think\nThere are varying degrees of what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been you know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or\nMaybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they pass 'em but then you know you called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs\nItems and being tossed around the house um there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stress from the stairs\nOn you know all these out she'd have something go on in the oven and she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in foil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the plane itself\nBest friend and he said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want you here and I thought oh God I just have to get out of here so\nThat is scary and it will be back in the moment with more on coast to coast\nMoney's going one WFL\nFox News I'm Carmen

his house and the places that massive we've looked like it had been trashed and this guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there\nAnd ah so anyways uh they were pretty big ... ah and ah they kind of got us for a while after we did our thing and\nAh one of them move separated me from the other one and the other one talked marine we later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and uh so he wanted marina comeback alone but that didn't turn out so if there was any fear was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine it's it's one that's left an impression with us I think so what kind of equipment Ron do you bring with you\nA very\nOn on on the particular case uh the you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people more pieces of equipment or the smaller case the lesser amount but you always want to um\nYou know tried to ah bring the proper equipment that you wouldn't eat for instance if you have reports of a ... be unseen you might bring more video\nEquipment are and you're like thermal or ... whatever\nThat you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by audio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies appointing we've gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization\nThat you've come across a I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization of a goal visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it a charges that\nThey weren't really well I was ... times in but more while I was just doing stuff yeah\nI work with a lot of White Houses or a funds for him and we do you know public goes on and that type of stuff and there are two separate occasions or one guy do these goes to his own board of directors of course on top of a White House so we do these haunted toys and one time we were in this um [noise]\nIt's ... uh like an observation tower where it's a square\nBuilding with glass all around you and say use windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and his wife and daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them doing my field and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down the law the side of the wall you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself and she came and then they didn't want her to miss anything so I stopped and waited for a night at CERN continually walk all the way to do it\nAnd I waited and waited and yet\nNobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk in\nAnd yet there was no one here and oddly enough that ... is with the coast got because it's on the coast guard base\nA coast guard reported seeing women walking on the wall in that same location so that was kind of intriguing I'm an I'm perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we did a public a ghost town on uh what Iowa lighthouse and benefit pool meals\nMain we're in the White House ah keep U.S House it was under um renovation at that time we were sitting on the picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen and I saw a dog will crush the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the the there was no\nThere's no sign out so I jumped up and meal you're into the kitchen\nAnd when the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to the woman and she says why would you see and that's just that's already died she says can you describe not so sure absolutely as far as clear as day and I describe the dog she just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so all the\nLighthouse keepers afterward took care of them until the dog actually died in ... Iowa and she says the dog you described pretty much matches discussion the other dog that\nThat of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean his two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it's certainly saw it would appear to me as a ...\nMinute still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back and both of you are old will take phone calls next on coast to coast am runs website of course is linked up the coast to coast am dot com and their latest book is called more ghost chronicles and\nFind out more about tonight is log on to ... dot com\n\n[noise]\nHe left college credit you need transferred to you want to earn a quality degree from a world renowned university if you answered yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is the perfect school for you\nArizona State university operation over a hundred and fifty highly ranked degree programs a hundred percent on line to learn the same degree as you would on campus from wherever you are on your schedule\nPlus assay one line accepts most transfer credits for information tax base to three five five point seven learned for yourself by the wall Street Journal ranks asked you stay in the nation from producing the best qualified graduates and white eighty seven percent of ask you grab recruited within Ninety Days have graduation\nLearn to grow learn to succeed and learn to thrive at Arizona State university to learn more about ASU one line degrees tech space to three five five line seven that's S.

take your phone calls as well more goes chronicles Maureen say hello to run\nA Ron How ya doing she never touched me in the morning there you go [laughter] so how often\nDo you get the calls Ron for ghost investigations\nYou know it it it's funny when we first started we we course it was quite common but are there are so many groups so like when I first started I always say that was\nA twenty ... the up to do was knew that was like twenty four in the country though is like twenty four and a new city but the judge I did want to mention you mentioned the hurricane Michael is just the damage know of the the the center and now has dealt with it I don't know if you've seen that\nYet or no I haven't seen that yeah it has a uh it's pretty that's ... is our number is ... ... dot com but it's pretty cool sorry about that\nMaybe we can concentrate and bring nothing down from a four to nothing\nSo that would be good [laughter]\nI think we've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do any because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to know something would have voted for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to do a where to concentrate you're you're investigating for instance if\nThere are a lot of noise is coming out of ... area you might want to cut your tree your audio recorders serve\nIf for a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I tried to get too much into the details with tour of the coin is for lack of it or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I I Am there for you know strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question because then that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know you know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you hear from people but\nYou know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know that they want help to move on and that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nGo to the person who brings you when do they want the ghost out of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know basically a you know what you expect from us and\nUh and I very of the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house Clinton's is something we're not going to do it though you know are we from someone else um but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls free both to view let's go to brandy and granted big California walking to the program I brandy\nAlright thank you for taking my call and say\n[noise] um yeah I had a question and I've had a really really rough year here at probably the worst year of my life and I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me if you see here\nNext I mean you're being a lot better police things starting to go more my way\nMarine this would be for you\nThat's for sure yes [laughter] yes\nAt what um okay so Brandi I did pull a couple of cards for you um and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding on to a lot of hurt that have been happening around you right um and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but\nYou know and the other kind of poll is you know this was last year in our things that have been happening is like a pressure right so because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I wouldn't tell you is that\nYou can get to a better place\nYou really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that\nI hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that is taking place\nIt's a learning lesson right now for you um and it's a time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust\nThat it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but I'm pulling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying I'm ... but\nYou're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day routine to really try and you put it on the mask but you're not feeling it\nIs that correct or no uh right [laughter] yeah okay right so put ... think of it\nThis way right so if you know I see that there's a hailing hand that you have and I used to me you up and go to person feels like a lot of people when they come to you and they have an issue is that correct\n\nThat you tend to be the ear that people talk to someone I was there yeah yeah [laughter] okay so you need to know that you know\nYou have to have patience with yourself in your situation okay um how many is coming so know that you you are coming to a breakthrough it is going to get better but I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two right so you almost have to feel it\nFeel that strength inside of you again which you're kind of like well how do I get that back um and a lot of it is balance right is finding a balance in your life is what you really need to do at this moment\nAlright thanks good luck brandy hope everything works out for you during this time do you do you find Ron in marine that these investigations are more prevalent during the Halloween season or does it matter\n[laughter] [laughter] it\nIt doesn't matter but you know what even Ron I'm sure would agree as early on I mean a lot of people have that and they think well it's October Halloween season right we need to be out there\nUm and I say over the years that might have started when I joined the group that was more it was busier around that time of year but now I think Ron would say is probably busy constantly\nMaureen what do you

collection Maureen would our final segment here final ... more ghost chronicles Ron where do we get your book\nWell it's a sold everywhere I Am is on and uh all the major bookstores so\nI don't believe in the ghost theme [noise] ah because I've been told stories I'm sixty years old I've been told stories all my wife and most of the goals things have been around tragedies that happen to people who are trapped in Queens I go uh towards the matrix\nThat oh I think the people who are spirits and what their experience and I don't take that away from him but I Believe that the eggs that zero the new law and then they choose to nine or sometime interfere with and we see what we see we feel we feel things move they move but this is my ...\nMy questions and all the tragedy that don't happen on this planet and and that's not excluding things have happened right here in this country if\nThe protocol the goals would be because you have had tragedies\nOr or in your life that took away your life then there would be more goes on this planet and it will be people\nAnd just let's just deal with the United states itself I mean uh I Am part Cherokee and so I'm just saying the tragedy that happened in them and all the people Jews all over the world\nWhat is the protocol to be a goal and if you believe in that\nIf it's not the matrix\nOr could you ever considered this being the matrix and the numbers you just not\n... it's about the way it should be that is my question thank you for your joined or music or their George I love all your new all the way from bluegrass dude so to everything from the years you've been playing your number one when it comes to that\nAll right my friend more to come so what what what is the definition Ron oh what a ghost becomes why does it become a ghost\nYou know it's the sixty four thousand dollar question Georgian\nEnvy honestly we really don't know exactly what a ghost is I mean ah when I first started doing this I used to work with a Franciscan monks and we had a cause of religious aspects of it\nAnd we come up with the feeling that maybe some of this is the perfect terrific not like it's a punishment but rather\nIts place it's a temporal thing versus the and the thing was so I mean that's just going on doing their time basically but that's I mean that's the only one theory there are many three shifts the tragedy thing is one I always worried about\nIn Gettysburg was always supposed to be the most part it then that's why it's the most thing but there are there are battles I mean Nagasaki ... I mean thousands of people will tell like that why are we seeing like all those goes from running around so there's gotta be certain aspects of that we were unaware of have yet to\nDetermine and uh and and really be quite honestly nobody knows exactly for sure we have our theories and that's all it is\nAre there any friendly ghosts like Casper or are they all tied the evil\n[laughter] well well yeah I mean what's what's the guardian angel what's a spirit guide or a ...\nNot the ghost to maybe\n... I guess it depends on what the definition of the ghost might be I mean and if somebody sees their dead grandmother at the side of the bed is that a ghost or is that some kind of entity your spirit or or one of the same\nLevel I always say that number one signing is is what I Believe is a messenger goes nuts somebody who is just passed away and they they come back to see how you're doing or let them know that let you know that they're okay I mean it happened to my mom my mom didn't believe in goes or anything my dad died at a\nCompany I mean they're failing cookout never got to say goodbye

the history\nLet's go to shade in billings Montana first time caller squeeze shaded and go ahead and shit and\n[noise] I've been going George great thank you\nHey I had a question uh last night you're talking about spirit guide a little bit and it really piqued my interest in about tonight vi interest is peak once again I'm actually had a question for Maureen sure\nUm I've had numerous people throughout my life come up to me and told me there's something following an Iraq than what and they can never give me a straight answer I've always been curious as to what it is\nAnd have you have you felt that you had something following you\nOh my entire life you have\nFrom my from my early childhood I felt there was something polling\nOr how to experience when I was about seven years old my back yard my parents were both inside the house I came in screaming because some some things that my name into my ear and it made my ear vibrate while\nMigrants so out now have you ever ... have you felt threatened or do you feel secure with whatever entity is doing this\nYou know it's kind of make a very good field here and then there are times when I feel like it I don't ever feel like it's trying to harm me but I Do feel like there are people in my life but it does try to act in ways\nAnd interesting what let me tell you in the in the short time we have left\nMy experience is that if these entities aren't hurting you uh the the I don't think you have much to worry about Maureen we've only got about thirty seconds left would you agree with that if he's not being heard that the these entities aren't out to really hurt him\nAbsolutely and I was going to say George you get a great job because that was the same thing I Would ask because typically I don't think it's a who I mean what something is wrong I think that if someone\nUm and I think it's more of a relative it's like a guide and all that is looking over you know maybe there will be watching out for you and sometimes not as ... when they speak with you but I don't think they're there to harm you\nAll right both of you thank you so much for being on the program the name of the book is called more ghost chronicles it's

competing advertisements\nRepresenting an effort to grab the attention of the world's most powerful TV viewer President Trump there's also a belief by Washington's influence industry that Mr Trump can be swayed by what he sees on TV here's what's happening from Wall Street Journal national political reporter Julie biker which Julie what's up\nIt's no secret that the president is an avid watcher of Fox News in particular and we know that because he frequently tweeting in real time and he watches particularly found can friend in the morning and then also um\nDuring Hannity in the evening ... little ... over at Fox News channel until the general public notice this until ... and\n... have found that ... way to get a message in front of the president is to advertise during his tape it to the program so that's what we're seeing happen more and more\nWild like ... like for example who's airing what\nWe can look at her story now because there's a big site to that thing going on over there now and so groups that are\nSavoring President Trump increasing the mix of ethanol in gasoline Ben I'm advocating a lot lately and caring Fox News programs and then group said also apparent that are sort of counter messaging to him during the same programs\nAs you know to be influenced by them\nFor what we can see if he ... directly after an ad\nThat popped up on Fox and happened to win a coup a steel workers commits advertising during boxing fan in March you know out there and I came up president started talking about the issue suggesting that he had me at 'em\nAnd then turn it on the other side here if you remember it can't last\nYear in airtime tire constantly and fight with the president can start at an impeachment movement I'm\nKind of was trolling him in a way by putting up an ad during Fox and friends and the president noted that and tweeted about it right away\nWe speak with Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie bike which are pieces called interest groups compete for Trump's TV attention you went to do the ad revenue for these programs that Mr Trump watches on the rise right\nThat's right and and to not only the president watching but the the program some towns have really strong viewership on during the administration to dealership has ah\nAnd and still have the ad rates and we've actually seen some ... ...\nEmail noted that not only is the president watching these shows that people who are highly supportive of your pet then are also watching and so the thinking is not only to reach the audience of wine but perhaps you know out in the heartland Trump's base watching the same ads\nAnd maybe they will engage more on the types of issues that are being advertised about\nI thought it was interesting too you said that a strategist also target early hours on MSNBC and CNN outcome\nWell although the president um\nExpress dislike for programs on on those two channels there's there's no debate that at least they're monitoring how those channels are talking about him and so the thinking there is that\nPeople who are influential with the president may be some type of advertising and and death flag it to him\nThat ah that that sounds\nI guess along the lines of what ah the guy Kevin Mac from that group need to impeach\nAbout how he feels so he just suspects at the president's watching a nosy can targeting what's with I
