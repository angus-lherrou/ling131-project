I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing is to try to make Republicans good\nLook bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made you know things ... he's created an environment so that somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict from our authorities and the intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know\nThat the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about it and the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level America as best we can debate ideas\nVigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate\nFormer presidents and leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on the way in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this air that would give them my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person\nTo say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability in this we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping than I our our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others\nHe was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep their some keeps their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced and our law enforcement uh individuals\nAnd are individuals and institutions in in the intelligence community the entire us an intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and who ever did this\nWith somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd\nBe somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight\nShut up wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who'd done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America you know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stuff done but\nYou have to wait and doing things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said go out they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right Mike Mullen team\nJoined we will talk this week and see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon as described the killing of ... to show me as a heinous crime\nIn his first comments and some of his closest aides were implicated in

networks and significantly boost the fish and sea let's check in with our expert Warren Weinstein on the Internet boy this would be amazing born\nBefore I comment on that I I like to make a technical comment on on the fence today\nUm I Would I Would estimate that the probability of this being tracked down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of a very short period of time as as being very very high um for purely technical reasons I mean these are all unexploded devices that means\nAll kind of trace evidence is available for them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI\nThe UN at some of them were sent through the regular mail for us you\nKnow I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities\nThey probably have that all figured out already the entire ah UFP of network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the ...\nNot teachers or the person if he delivered it to the post office camera that\nThe post offices ... I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the best possible evidence that's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days or certainly in a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this and then some of these questions are are going to start to uh [noise] of the possible\nAnd she'll say that again about a minute left or optics door really like\nI I mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individual I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet\nIs are we going to be able to afford it are the ISP is going to raise the band with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole allocation for the month and in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have tended to put the high speed a new vent system in the ah high rent urban areas they haven't showed a lot of interest and putting them into rural areas\nThere's the question to are we ever going to actually see where you\nAre right but for and Lauren thank you so much will be in touch

sort of retiring or I Am a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagements and ... January November and December\nI Can't believe it two months about going anywhere against my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you we love your stand that I'm going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter in Detroit Michigan my very first\nInterview was with a fellow named stamped and Friedman\nI saw a little clip being in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before a group\nOr at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this\nYou want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my tape recorder out I went to interview stamps and Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis he was the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stamp was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of

your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out areas had there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nWell the latest word gap looks like they're about one point six climates per star that bring galaxy star\nAnd our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion store\nAll that main one sixty billion on it so they're all over the\nPlace and you know and that changed as our picture we used to think we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization or around and we're at the top\nWell we're all over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course from the most important things around because we haven't been around very long\nAnd leave plenty of room in other words for others and we've come to realize that you know get in here from ... not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that the you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and that I Can't be much crepes and back and forth now we realize I with nuclear fusion for example\n... you can get ... hours we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop Russia and thought that the world was created and four thousand ... see that's\nRight can't be too late beings around you know well he was on for a little bit four billion be seen as\nThey are just a little [laughter] that was a little\nUh our ... natural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things the ultimate too you know hurtful thing [noise]\nUm we're beginning to realize that it's a busy place out there and there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place ... as a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization of people are being exiled and all you do you find out of the same but the\nMirror throws a climate that they put in incarcerated people you know\nLike yeah like a personal glad boy guy's been brought on earth [laughter]\nSo you never know the way they've been treating people it's it's it's you're\nStanding you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide yet but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of ... kind of the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that what we think there's one point six planets for stars so I guess like a huge number of planets and [laughter]\nYou know they're probably coming here uh I I'd have been left that there's only a few thousand points you know if there are life out there and we see it ... you know they would make contact pending land on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think a ... it's more like realizing but at North America has more than a few people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd we but makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and there's still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOr or still slapped [laughter] him\nAnd so a ... most of us all learned that\nIf it's a more complex place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced as much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of climate the stars and things like that\nAnd uh hey we're not number all or no [laughter] no and so what we\nAnd you can tell from another thing or the military budget on a blind eye it's about a trillion dollars this year so we haven't changed much have we\nKnow that at all these\nPeople don't get the goodies of our from their work [noise] uh we take the leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature a lot it appears to be

from a swing state uh and was\nKept his distance during the campaign and then even during the first several months of the president's administration Dean Heller stayed away from Trump he opposed to it at a press conference in Las Vegas a in June of twenty Seventeen and said he could not support the Republican health care overhaul\nA and shortly after that a guy he got a primary challenger and his his political uh outlook turned it became a big Trump supporter big supporter of the president's a judicial nominees\nUh and then we saw this weekend in at a rally in Nevada you compare the president can lighter since said everything he touches turns to gold\nShe's so the primary challenger was from Tarkanian correct\nFrom Danny Tarkanian the son of the famous basketball code right or a cherry Tarkanian coach the uh the run rebels you at all the uh his son Danny is a\nPerennial candidate and the Vatican Trump seven times and and that winning for different officers but he has the base of support in the conservative wing of the Republican Party and wash the Senate campaign a primary against our last summer with the idea that at our our walking loyal enough to the president has some of these\nUh in almost instantly within a few days we saw Dean Heller react to it by a revealing for the first time that he voted for the president to twenty sixteen something that he refused to say out loud and he backed the second attempt that Republican healthcare attempt\nA and then he put himself out front on judges that I'm a I'm a ...\nBill going to attack the president signed last December and since then he's been a sort of a big supporter of the ... and the president has\nResponded in kind of this week and it was the trip uh but he may to Nevada to campaign with senator Heller since

is pieces called Nevada's GOP senator bets on his conversion to Trump is him talking about the incumbent Republican Dean Heller or to use it as sort of begin\nOr in the primary versus fellow Republican Danny Tarkanian Vin ah it's continued now in the general election against a congresswoman Jacky Rosen the Democrat\nJacky Rosen is a democratic member of Congress running against the power

with one of those inflatable two men like you see the car dealership with a sort of a big way the uh flying around in the wind that they are essentially they're shifting that our\nTroops in the wind and that he uh has changed his mind on a number of all the the most surplus critical health care to President Trump and his orders and that senator our jak euros now can't be counted on to make decisions about who live at it but it but it's so hard to please and Trump\nGrown arts so how has the conversion paid off what what are the poll say about that race\nIs one of the district within the

for construction workers and what they started doing back in may was to offer fifty dollars a month toward your student loan payment then it doesn't sound like a lot of course you know do the math quick math six hundred a year\nHow's that going to help me if I've got you know forty or fifty thousand dollars just in London but this goes directly to the principal so it does help pay down over
