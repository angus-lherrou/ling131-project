most widely known voices\nOf spirituality Mitch has also in award winning historian longtime friend the coast to coast am a porch and missions are very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and ah it's a big bridge that I've crossed with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explorers here in New York City and the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group\nOr their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my informal motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members some of that club\nThat was probably about five of them they were just a little group on one side of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting\nWith ... and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with this offensive just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nComments at us and believe it or not was a member of the original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan doubled day we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written\nAnd I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts\nAre cause of death I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this\nAnd I wanted to write a book that we give people concrete hands on math\nIs what do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident that was the mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're a very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long\nInterval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a font and the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives they will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found that people who dabble with the dark side tend to do some of this similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities that responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that\nHowever we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in advance mentally and and often these shows up in ways that we don't suspect\nSo my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives\nOf other ... before you came on and he's he was in Israel and of course great mental list\nAnd it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland\nAnd over the stadium they put him in a helicopter and he was supposed to influence the ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved up and the guy missed it or something like\nThat and now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I've and when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor I've and go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I have and when his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know Edgar Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program\nWas talking about a tie class episode he had a NASA tie class and it ... or or type pin and he lost it and you couldn't find it\nAnd he was telling or you bought into and out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping and it was the type class that that fell on the ground it and came out of nowhere the other part of it the part that class ... into the the pointed at the end of it\nWas in ... ice cream [laughter] yellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing ... in there for that [laughter] just amazing but\nBack to these miracles and we take calls next hour I'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but\nBack to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but nothing too but you know people dabble in the dark side the curse of other people they put ... on other people\nAnd in a lot of cases those things happen to these people you know how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum\nAnd my contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you're using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some\nEffect however one of my favorite teachers ...\nGod or to grade teacher in the mind power tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project\nNegatives spell or thought on to another person\nIs if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else if he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection\nAgainst evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we're apt to overlook simple things\nIf you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there was an esoteric and a cult dimension to the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences from cyclical researched quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nWoodward human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't have you ... if they don't work what does that mean\n[noise] you know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people sometimes try 'em out but it works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work that they feel project\nOne of the things that I read about on the book is that we live within a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws and forces belong mind is constant as a law must be a law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you weren't on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative would have affected by math the minder same way circumstances\nAre going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're fortunate that we experiment very clearly and very carefully\nRich we're going to

thought I think is in some respects the greatest power in the cosmos\nMitchell explain what an affirmation is\nAn affirmation very simply is just announcing something that you want to select announcing a reality that you want to select\nAnd a great time to use an affirmation that just needs to be spoke it does not need to be spoken out loud agree to them to use an affirmation\nIs those few very relaxed moments just before you drift off to sleep at night sleep researchers call that the hitting the gothic state it's a state of time when you could not only reprogram your own psyche\nThrough repeating affirmation Z or prayers or holding visualizations but but cyclical researchers have also found that those few moments before you drift to sleep at night are prime time in essence Patel a path or extra sensory activity mysterious things occur\nWhen people hold affirmation in mind or silently repeat them to themselves in those few moments just before going to sleep at night that he is an exquisitely unusual\nSupple suggestible time it's a time that each of us experiences every day you also experience it's just as you're coming to consciousness in the morning use that time that is the prime time for silently reciting affirmation stew yourself\n[noise] and it seems to work doesn't\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my monitor is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positives of mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals and I don't mean on the computer I mean get out an old fashioned pencil and paper and do it\nBecause once you do that you've actually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the things that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life\nAnd you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning\nNoon and night think about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and overtime they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all\nDon't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent\nBecause sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes or they'll say it's nonsense than they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it\nAnd when the results arrive express things that is a method we can all do it is easy isn't it once you get into it\nIt is easy ... the the the important thing is to do it with consistency is to do it with silence and it's to do it with total stark honesty\nArriving at a definite aim in life or a ... a small number of things that coalesce around one aim has enormous power an aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass were prism they become an enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light natural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when his focus which is why I keep emphasizing and the idea that you have to really\nNail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's worth focus comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions that I never could have expected I've done television narrating and and and and written many books\nAnd articles including in places that are not known for their cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics\nIn the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these\nMethods and everything that I offered to the coast family\nOr things that I wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something\nThat I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know it's a dream come true and the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes a justice\nIn period has also necessary\nIt is amazing work how people get this membership in to the miracle\nCollide America club I used to say that anybody can join the miracle copy you didn't have to\nSign your name up any where there is no magic decoder ring in anything and of course that's true everybody who's listening is automatically a member a number of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun if people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in America club but anybody who emailed me and I'm super easy to find throw my name into Google it'll take it on my website my email email me and I will send\nYou your own membership card to be in America club you could find it you could folded laminated carry it in your wallet just something fun to have with you to sort of keep you on course throughout the day to keep your thoughts steady and productive so I I thought it would be fun for people to have an official card\nA designating their membership and the miracle club so send me an email you get America club membership card\nWe're going to take calls next hour with Mitch or what's in of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising how many people have miracle stories overwhelm you know\nYou know we have to understand the Lakers made up of of of joys and and sometimes great tragedies but in as much as we do experience catastrophes in life and let's face it that's a part of why\nWe also experienced extraordinary absurdly unexpected moments of good news there are in fact times George where we get just what we're looking for and I would say that's more than just the turn of the roulette wheel our mind play a role\nIn that again a miracle is a departure from Paul expected and all reasonable circa\n... will come back with calls next on coast to coast day I'll\nMorning noon or night guardian level that you take unlimited medical grade

A. dot com\n[noise] use your smart speaker say Alexa plain news radio Ninety three point one [noise]\n\n\nThat will come back to coast to coast George story with you along with Mitch Horwitz Mitch told me about the power behind writing down the goal women going for it\nYou know it's interesting when we write down a goal in really demand that we pull something out of us that's authentic and that's kind of magic key to all of this material I Would say that absolute passionate intensity and the one that hidden he behind every health health program with it something won't work without it nothing happens\nNow one of my contention is that we really need to have one absolutely definite chief aim in life and that could be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over the course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener is whether you can come up with one overarching goal that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be\nIf you can come up with one chief aim you have arrived at mental focus and mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\nInteresting work Mitch or what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put those together or did you do this all on your a\nToll on my own you know this was really my tribute to the thought of my own heroes and the mental healing tradition or things that they've thought about things that I have experimented with ideas that I came up with myself a you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who are stripers all of us who are experimenter as\nWe are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our mind\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles through that I've heard about was a financial miracle when I had a friend in New England who is recovering from a very serious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left\nTo his name and he was on the brink of losing his health insurance one night I challenged people like challenged people to make a marathon reading a book George that I Know you are very deeply the magic of believe\nYeah and loved though\nYeah and my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happen to narrate he listened to it over and over and over for about five days on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss\nWho said to him you know you left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that you know you can carry thought it was a few dollars and cents\nHis old boss had to have you looked at it there's over fifty thousand dollars\nBeing you know ... ...\nYeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend it truly felt like a miracle\nThat is a miracle it really is yeah\nIt's exactly what the experience and it was quite recent\nThat when you least expect it you know\nYes yes that's why I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of Hackney to say never give up at these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take and as much as life visits catastrophe on it and it does\nIt also visit extraordinary absurdly good news on us and you never know you never know what life is going to take and twenty four hours I always in poor people who feel desperate among other
