I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not\nYou should not ask the person who's receiving the reading any questions I shouldn't say well you know with the mother's name or anything like that why you hear you should be able to tell them that's the first test of legitimacy of what you are receiving\nThe retailer on\nA few days ago I heard it in the great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers of others who are critical of him say that he's just a great magician and and I told them I ... I got to tell you if you're a magician\nAnd you're doing this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons magically if you're a

the real deal\nI think he probably the real deal I Believe he started out doing magic trick because many of these wonderful psychic do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a there than kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately\nAnd then it kinda well close together you can tell the difference but it's wonderful that you're you're falling down frames

magic when I was a kid I mean I wasn't I was a really good at that but uh you know I dabble with that I had a lot of body experience when I was eleven uh which really I think steered me\nInto the field that I mean now I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce [laughter]\nYes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be impressed with a trick I it was a visiting a Web site last night that I thought it was terrific\nAnd there there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking so restrictive and limiting to higher consciousness go into fourth dimension fifth and be on\nLet's all move forward and the people who are very mired in a monetary and other financial interest or very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because we're supposed to be and growing in a

getting on an elevator yes he could see ... and he looked at all these people in this elevator he couldn't see any ... scared the heck he didn't go in the elevator and the elevators the cable stamp and the people died\nYeah you gotta love Casey my bag so absolutely George reminder\nAs a psychic where do you get your Colin Powell where'd you get it from\nA I don't think his power I oh God that

George Will either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go [noise] but they\nDo have a relief as we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but uh I I don't want people to think that to aside\nThat right you're

dream people's energy I Try to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories\nWhere they've changed and people begin to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but I get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's a terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary for that's a wonderful form of

... with the rubber boss was with us almost three years to the ... the day Robert Moss has been a dream traveler\nSince doctors pronounced him clinically dead in a hospital in test mania when he was three years old from his experiences and many worlds he created his school of active dreaming is original\nSince this is a modern dream work with an ancient some Monica mystical practices for your into the rooms beyond the physical though he leads popular workshops all over the planet including\nThree you're training for teachers of active dreaming an online courses for the shift network a noted the author who's got a number of books the most recent mysterious realities Robert welcome back my friend\nTo pay dreaming weaving with George Foy\nLooking forward to this and would this tragedy that happened when you were three would you tell us again what happened\nWell first of all my mother took me from Melbourne, Australia where we live in West straight at to see her on the opera singer and the psychic media and the main ...\nAnd she looked in the ... the old fashioned way and she saw him I said that she didn't tell us she went out room came back white face well she was right that went to in ... Maine you when my father had been friends for the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died and help build the dog oh told my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that\nThat is one of the experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books I must tell you George I don't remember anything much what happened when I was out of my body age three members rather hard living on his uh afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\n... died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions and the sister appendectomy in an operating room in that time I remember what happened that sounds like the classic empty to begin with up onto the field they looking at the the the the scalpel in the ... not money to be around going down\nDown the beach down to living a pack a fountain pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate wanted to do with an old marine nine year old kid would want to do go on the ride or could go into some addresses\nSo I guarantee Luna Park age nine in my astrobiology and I'm drawn into I don't know that goes straight maybe\nI'm drawn into another world and where I'm deceived by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that right and I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bit\nBack adventure the opposite seeming to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked to find myself in the body of a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my life long on the standing\nThere will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about is you try to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something like this\nPerson who could explain to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition and said oh yeah we do that we get really sick we go live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same\nAnd sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences with shrinks by coal dissociation was the buildup to either travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic club drugs quite easily and an understanding that there will be on the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I'm not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army's that were moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you all the things that kept me going is it amongst mind ... companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was the big man and a lot of white hair and a face\nBecoming sit on my they didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and one day or that you can't tell your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and helped him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWhere time travel in our dreams and when we develop the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleaders counselor to them in their own time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a why is the self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nWhere we're leading parallel lives this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis for you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from a relative and right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams of venting conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solo consciousness survived physical death so this is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dreamed travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the snow subconscious and that's all that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous on the standing as lived in my life and told stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who've come cooling those people to come calling my employed glued but loving family members around says to the spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into the whole field of non local mine but science tells us about to get in contact information field to get into it villa teach access sources of information beyond the old ... and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and write them down will notice that they dream of and before they happen one function of time travel we see the possible future we\nCan ... for challenges and opportunities that lie ahead but we also traveled into the past from this my mother lives you've learned about connections with drama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods\nThe multi dimensional universe so this is the key to those hand understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experiences papa dreamed travel\nAnd my story is in the book come absolutely and entirely from my own experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and they're giving me permission to use this story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers them but if we\nDid not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually beyond the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history a valued dreams and dream of they believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like but\nYou can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest sold so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience because dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions in attitudes from Baton and more objective perspective than we can manage for ourselves an indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nI'm probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what it might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience\nHave lost the sense of a deep up to ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding often to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple fall step process the sharing a dream of a story that makes it fun you can get it done in minutes to get some help on the back of your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our opinions I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it to be let out so the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family we think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness between sleep and wake that's a good time to catch it means there's good times ... of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nThink it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost the best time will be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also\nThe life situations the people in far flung places feel proud of your multi dimensional family I'm a bit of an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience but we are connected to dramas being lived in other places in time for a certain point\nOf view it's all going on now I wouldn't be doing what I I'm not doing it on not found myself connect with an Anglo Irish men who came to the American college he's\nSeventeen hundred ...

I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nAnd I was in a grave yet I've never been to before never being in this place and just having a walk and I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it or what I call\nShe's never beat him the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head said he says what do you think of that I said I think it's a great story but very great story I mean that introduced this whole thing about\nYou know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat him to sudden goal is to a certain place might even be an age of the same 'cause that's the day but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given one delivers the story immediately just like that and that these examples proliferate so\n... you know ... how it works is that the the the attitude of the energy you are carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking ... waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in light poles and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack check what you're saying to you so Trump the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs\nAnd be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think there's a good body is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to match up into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us about how to matter of reality as a dense of consciousness so\n... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there's the phenomena but used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize\nWhat is going on the body reacts to something ahead of time ... example I go to the doctor for routine\nPhysical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to to get get some blood for a blood analysis hit the gusher in my blood is boating and it was all I knew\nLived in pants and after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she ended up to try and understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what code and Alice in wonderland beat the white queen ... the white queen scream\nBefore she ... she doesn't have to scream when she actually ... thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to do that before it took place on the doctor said my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden phenomena and present them into anticipate symptoms he says but I couldn't possibly be reported people can guy was looted you well you know I think so I think the ... we know in our body also the thing we knew everything\nWe know what the bleep we know that we know enough about it you know so medic responses we pick up things from a distance from other people and we feel with the feeling in our body as well so that's about the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\n... active dreaming is a way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you and it could take action that will empower your life and bring some elite energy and guide in July from your dream I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's all the method of looser dreaming you would call that ... many clues to dreaming we ... my favorite way of ... loose and treatment venture\nIs to start out loose that didn't stay lose what does that mean that means that we use shut many drumming and the workshop\nOr we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay the romance of the bench is still in the stream let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and I think the scary based on the ground it might mean I Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream yet another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try like state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psyche can intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like a ten to the images that rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the scenes that will come to you the pool to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive dreaming of the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we got the how to look to criticize the outlook for signs of both in the world around you so this is also a program on a method\nOf attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think the dream themselves misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think that didn't think the dreams in themselves as a deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems that are floating around that we don't walk around but you can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my tree but some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront the issue on its own ground you might find that behind something that's scary you know learning\nAnd you and your dream is a power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to a narrow understanding what dreams is about can be very misleading\nYou got a Robert we

dream so here is the man I mean a titan of scholarship and son who is driven all his life by his dream of the stories in my new book mysterious realities is bold films passage into the afterlife and actually what he might be doing now it's pretty interesting title\nBut the part of a ... than the previous documentation that Yom dreamed again and again before his death\nBut he was living in a Bush and all his retreats on the lake on Lake ...\nWhich was called ball and get out the nearby village is living in another balding gun on the other side of death and those close to him said that he lost

gun I follow you on\nTo that possible afterlife situation and actually get some insight into\nWhere how human mind might be working right now is he works on a great new books or in the off the life I mean some people might be shocked and surprised\nBut to Robert his crazy enough to think that you would have an audience with him from the other side of death but you know you'll himself wrote a great deal not always the publication about his contacts with the defaced he talked in his in his mouth and then he read a book about extensive conversations\nHe had with the power to the shape your view of reality and he was one of those are always understood but one of the key things about dreaming is is it gives the U.S had the ability to understand what happens to mind consciousness\nOff to death because they'd dreams as yoga understood we received visitations from the ... I didn't dreams who made travel into the realms where they are at home but very briefly one more thing about him and his relevant to this book in my approach to everything\nBecame late in his life to the conclusion that one of the things going on in dreams is that we live I'm quoting you\nContinue to live in other realities that we put the even dream so I'll dream maybe memories of ongoing life situations nothing this reality but somewhere else\nBut we visit again and again when we when we slip out of the body and go to dream\nSo this is a great a dream sharman of the west to you and the manager of a ... because it ... through a deep and horrifying experience of an under will journey and he paid the price\nOf surviving gotten coming back and adding it's science and his scholarship to what you first and about deeper realities and giving us that incredible model of understanding of all the things we're talking about some of the great admirer of your\nWeren't going to come back Robert in ... minutes and just take some final calls with you ...
