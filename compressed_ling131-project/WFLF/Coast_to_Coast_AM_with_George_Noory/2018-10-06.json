they must have been a shock yeah yeah\nThey they they described it as like America like the lord was speaking to them and it's like what the angel ... it nearly kind hearted man uh you know I went to

get to know you a little bit better you've had this gift since you were\nA little girl correct a well were you\nGrammar realized I was a little over to what I could see and talk to earth and spirits the problem is\nMost babies and children can which she didn't realize that when I was four she started taking me to funerals so that I could talk to the relative that died and Italian ... everybody's related somehow and so you know I was\nGraham a special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gas it\nBut he was fine and he was talking to me and uh you know there was no question but would ask the question\nOr the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had way ... these\nYoung did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOn carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared the ... to me it wasn't the dead person as the live person because I never understood I thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong\nWith that [laughter] did you perfect

cross over\nThe county morgue um gosh there was all kinds in there and I just have I learned how to keep it open long enough and it was\nIt was a learning thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter terror can do this and that she doesn't do it my way because she just don't want to see the people in our eyes she just wants\nTo hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop it and how you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you've been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that has happened\n[noise] I ... this past year has been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five\nThirty years ago that happened a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts in front of my face and and I wouldn't go into\nHouses if I thought a ghost can kill me I Am certainly not stupid but I remember I was in the garage and that acts hit the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door he had no idea how loud that was when that yet\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here [noise]\nAnd then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is give them more energy I Can't walk into a house and be afraid because that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them\nAnd I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal live I've got a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab throw you into the light it still free will\nBut you're gonna leave this health one way or the other and now that I'm older you know when I was fourteen Twenty one twenty five telling a fifty five five Seventy five year old man this is look at van Gogh sure girlie\nNot so much anymore now when I tell them to do

did that every week and I sit there on friday night and watch it and they do it anyway you know it's like oh my gosh\nAnd then people would call me and they'd say why did you let them do that if like I did they did it on\nThere and they knew better right of course they will love would\nCall me up to date because she always got her her script you know like three days before the new one right\nWhen she was good with you she liked you\nYeah and she would call me up and she'd go you should see what they're having\nMe do I do walk oh no [laughter]\nBut yeah no and she she knew that it was the first half hour was usually over the top the second half hour they seem to bring it back down a little bit but it got the information out there even if it wasn't as hokey as they made it\nTo Dr James van Prague nuts\nWell no because he couldn't see the ones that they were filming\nWhere do you mean talking about why not look so we're on phones bears like the ones I owe\nSo no he was a consultant on the show to are also but he did and uh but he really Clinton helps set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do it's like when we were in one of the studios I Know\nWe're doing a um\n[noise] a something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a myth Barbara stand with standing there\n[noise] and I I looked at her and I in my mind went totally blank all I could remember was Victoria bar only from the big Valerie are\nExactly and what she was classic action\nAll while and she was a little whip up I think she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm start offering because it's like oh my gosh\nAnd uh and she was found and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in ... the mistake of some one of the cameraman said who is that and James Mates mistake of saying some old time movie actor\nOh no oh yeah you know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going I literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it and I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's that going for you is anybody listening\nTo you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead\nAnd she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went to the light\nAnd she said huh and I said have you talked to other people live people\nShe said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go the Jewish show up and talk about it in she went in the light so I Hope that one of the people that when I get up there she screams\nDo you remember that movie pulled guys in the the little ... little lady kept shining the light don't go into like why why why did she say that\nI don't know I I had no idea I\nI thought that they possessed or tricked or something some strange way to get the only change their personality\nOr so I Know they they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when he goes whisper was being shocked\nFor somebody to buy it out there in LA and uh the person that would take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house and sell\nIt turned out that they knew who the goal was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't go right\nAnd so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was person on the ... whore house\nHe says and and uh and I helped you know work on that and I looked at him and I said the squint at my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you and he looked\nAt me I says why did you put flies in the attic what could that have to do with anything\nAnd he said we have ten seconds to kill I said\nFlies had nothing to do was go I you needed to exterminate or not a gold\nPerson I says well why did you even do that it's like people just do things that they think it's going to be scary or it should be part of that I don't know where they come up with this stuff\nIs a dangerous Marie I'm to dabble with the other side if you really don't know what you're doing\n[noise] I'll tell you one of the biggest pains in my side is we ...\nYeah I agree with that I had\nNo idea what you're inviting in and it's sad because it's usually teenage girls high school

supposed to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this guy\nEither way either ... direction I mean he was on or off\nWhen he was on a lot of people love to be around him when he was off a lot of people wanting to be away\nFrom ... that was amazing how that kind of energy works both ways positive negative next step we go to rolling in Springfield, Ohio we used to the Rockies hey roll and thanks for calling\nMaureen how are we today\nWe are fine thank you hope you are to\nA Yes sir I had a weird experience at a local like I'm not far from where I live probably within an hour\nHas friends come over that person I worked with and said hey ah or going up to like you want to go and not a well I just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up he I dislocated\nIt [noise] I got well I guess well you might as well get up move around on it all\nAs otherwise it just goes up so I have talked me into it I went and like I said it was\nAbout an hour away and we got up that direction\nAnd then hung out with people but little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably how no maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there and ah of whatever you know I've got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar a they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with and it was just weird it felt like everybody in there\nThat was in that bar well focused on me I didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck stuff about\nLike a bar full of empires from something here exactly as like well I mean I felt like a oh I Am a at the ... right and sign up on a rope or something yeah\nAnd and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then\nThey went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean ... had\nAn old dad gummed CD bar yeah and I went in there with them\nAnd to this by then it was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that hard enough and the air and\nUh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they've found comfortable right\nOh well I've known him because I worked with him um and uh yeah there are to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three is no warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in the car and they finally decided well come on let's go well we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a war off on the farm and the caller won't move forward or backward\nGuards there was like six or seven I was in the car [noise] and uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no moment um so they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk\nSo I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything and I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening\nAnd the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people and and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was uh are farther art in heaven how it'd\nBe like names leaders are\nDoing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer and it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this new that I went up her where\nShe looked at me and I was an honoring a word she says are you pray him and I said yep [noise] and she goes we better\nShe knew what was going up\nI was like oh my goodness oh about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like\nWow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we are in a car\nPulled out of the bomb while we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept\nI just kept that that bothers the lord and\nJesus in my heart what you have these dreams Myers about nothing is going to be stronger than the the like it's in may\nWhat do you think that ... role and what do you think their game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they were somebody and do um\nWhere they're going to kill you\n[laughter] I don't think so no I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to um when me over somehow or another 'em\nLike they wanted your soul it was weird I I had talked to this\nOnly to my therapist one other time but I definitely felt an odd present I'm I'm very uh intuitive anyway mhm and uh it just something that struck me as odd\nI Hope you hang around with them any other time [noise]\nUh no actually you know I'd only run into one of them since then and uh they're still around but um [noise] while it was where\nYou gotta you gotta be careful lot of times you people get themselves the strange situations and they just can't get out and we take your text we take your tweets Tom what do you have forced tonight\nJoe or I was in a state of depression that's actually where
