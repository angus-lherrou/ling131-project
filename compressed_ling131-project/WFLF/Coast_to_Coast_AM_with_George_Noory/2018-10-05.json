I think that we're living in an extraordinary time thing why now and just trying to keep balance and stay on the cutting edge\nHow did you end up doing what you're doing how does that happen\n[noise] [noise] well it started when I was in a rebellious kid in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world that had no way to do that and I had a couple of experiences started with uh being somewhere I shouldn't have been what somebody I shouldn't have been with\nA closing time and the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit by a drunk driver room my body off\nA motorcycle and um I had a real physical tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and\nI think there was something in that moment that suggests that any way that consciousness is more than just their physical bloom\nAnd then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and I lay there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware of the tangles up my lab\n... you know now I have two sturdy legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience near death experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house and my ... and being a good in Paris too which means you investigate everything\nThat you have those little feet pajamas I think so I don't really remember but I've heard\nTales and anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on a kitchen table\nMy God and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids still and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out in ... drinking\nI drank it and that causes massive pneumonia and I almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand consciousness somebody once you were wrong and I guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raised there and left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember in town now tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then uh my first places I was in Taylor, Michigan Farmington Hills\nAnd then worked at all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven and then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to a Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you\nKnow well I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nAnd we still there I have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my motive motorcycle accident\nWhile you're born I really yeah well you\nTold me where cars you must remember the the the street\nOh I don't I don't know who\nWas ... was it a busy street\nYeah it was a busy street but it was late and I think the trauma kinda over\nAre we going to I'm gonna I'm gonna close my eyes and you'll remote viewing now that you were on telegraph road\nMm that sounds that sounds about right\nNear ... during a viewing skill near Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf its roots in your ... year my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach\nShe'll do this all really steer you in the direction where you are no I mean you've got a PHD and social anthropology you've just been elected vice president of the psychological shows usually ended up with this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think it really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and there were timers the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown no um [noise] well I discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Coons book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view a kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this\nYou know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen\nAstronaut Rick and\nI didn't apply for the job at no attic sciences but it was about ... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe ... university no\nThat's right we are looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological lens\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that\nKind of notion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean that its pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer right\nIt is and they were leaving only\nWell it's you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually ...\nBrewery what she'll remember remember the Troy lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nThe ... still college which we're you know I don't know I haven't really uh gobbled up by the national Hampshire\nRight although micro breweries have taken over\nWhat what have you know what have you learned about near death experiences of all the other side what to do what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture take some big rural and defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and\nTouch and taste a sin that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe very definitely that there are\nMore aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nYou people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intention is a very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any during the ... [laughter]\nEvery day more and more [laughter] I think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures\nExpect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the ... are in Ecuador and you know they really do believe that at night they're consciousness leaves the body when they're dreaming and that\nThat makes it really easy\nFree zone email newsletters six days a week it was a great way to keep up on all things coast\nWe need to program recaps moving to the stream upcoming didn't go weekly re audio groups so much for the most recent Oklahoma goes to goes to um dot com home\n\n\n\nSchooled\n... news we're going in the everyday lives on the news radio money's going on\n\nFox News I'm Carmen Robert\nPresident Trump expressing confidence to send it will confirm his nominee to the Supreme Court yet as the Senate prepares to vote Saturday Republicans and Democrats are far apart process he'd been ruled by fear\nAnd under headed gamesmanship or to all\nGoing to stand up to the Scottish without\nAngering by Republican\nSenator Mitch McConnell and democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and just a few hours the Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the highly procedures and sometimes controversial peace prize among the nominees this year the Syrian aid group White Helmets\nAnd Edward Snowden is Fox News\nMorning we meet her studio true among spring to now that you're fine for the ...\nWeek on the wall came down here in the dining room with the basketball\nThe guy\nRead in\nRead\nLate S.

hundred seven one for five\nYears old when he was news out to a point to talk about art news radio ... one WFL or [noise]\nThat was developed out of the work of Ernest backer who wrote that great book a denial of death\nAnd they have found that if people are you know functioning in a in a normal way and they get triggered by some remind\nFear of their mortality it can lead to very pathological types of behaviors\nBut if you can bolster their sense of um personal worth their ... their value in the world and you you enhance their self esteem you'll see that when you trigger them they actually become more optimistic they care about other people\nSo I think if we can approach this idea of death and the great mystery of it with an open heart and that kind of skepticism that is productive\nI think you can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no Juno gr Mitchell before you post on\nYeah very well regarded worked\nWith them for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with him for ... possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because\nHe was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find [laughter] um but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so why is is that he\nFelt it was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving inclined toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nUsed their descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death [noise] if you were like quarter law ... knew this was challenged ducts which challenged or do you prove that there's life after\n[noise] so this would make a great reality show and I love Ina courtroom\nLet's do it [laughter] so you have a judge and jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWhich witnesses the common goal\nExactly giving their own personal testimony based on their experiences\n... put it right there\nAnd then you get into this question of what one shift people's\nMind about that question and is it that data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think she'll to Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please and its role but it plays with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWhy I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness and also\nOur lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts we live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that Shapes Our experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectations\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example\nWe are primed to perceive those parts of the world\nThat we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them and I think that that is a remarkable uh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of a functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can\nYou know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation and to expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness Lou ... outside of the brain\nI Do I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting is reflective\nAnd so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because every ... is filled with life and with that intention\nTo manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain I don't think it's an lp phenomena the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you\nKnow the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the consciousness\nOr the signal or the signal exactly\nKeeps coming ... actually you will will science ever meet\nThe spiritual ...\n[noise] I think so I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time with Sophia the Android she's a robot\nNew Hartford was her yeah she'd be great for you to interview 'em and see if they would do it in a way that doesn't give me one or is the talk show host decision are good I Do worry you're nobody better than your George\nWe're we're coming back with phone calls your calls next on coast to coast or\nWind or more and I just don't go to ... dot com\nLong\nIn\nThe morning show\nThem really were\nThe generations\nYou know\n\nYou secure your home your your car but what do you do to protect your valuables would work in times like these crimes happen anywhere any time\nWe've got a great feeling toys carnivores in the house\nDavid your guy that has overcome a severe issue alive the ball\nAnd on and I started to research on the other two reasons why I was going through capsules enough it made me feel so much better I can only tell you one thing the product war\nAnd not only works in one way or the whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy into the hell of a better way to earn a moron builder everything back into my money in a while\nBut you know on his ... contents and all\nThis is Richard Ross Perot owner for carnival or research international call one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six six eight seven\nThree five or there's a carnival or a dot com so you are and I'm real or a dot com call no\nOne's non ... noon on news radio not he's going one\n\nWill\nCome back Dr Merrill Lynch lunch with us Marilyn and this reality court room how do you think the jury would decide based on his third wife after this\n[noise] I think most people believe there's something there I think people have had experiences that give them a sense that\nI think that there are a lot of experiences that people report you know\nBeyond the survival of consciousness or identity you know people ... reporting things like pre cognition knowledge of the future\nUh people you know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location and the whole remote viewing paradigm they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that\nThe majority of our population in including people with\nHigher levels of education report so this isn't just something that people experience who have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is is something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their lives\nAnd you have written in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and full or and less filled with stress and anxiety and\nHow can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspective and opinions but it's also possible that people\nYou know began to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences can lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious then we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mistakes and we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation and that in that we really created kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHonda were younger people react to these things you know what do you think\nWell I think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of\nUh there's certainly a lot of fascination with I you know horror movies I think you were talking about that last program\nYou know I think our imaginations are very fertile I think popular culture has a

lot of people who believe his his accuser over him\nIn the ... states where a lot of the Senate races are happening this year there's a little bit of a different factors are Republican voters have seen their enthusiasm for the election go up\nA in some cases we've seen Republican Senate candidates begin to open leads races were pretty close\nAnd Cavanaugh is a factor at all of this there are a lot of conservative voters Republican voters who believe the Supreme Court nominee who's been treated unfairly\nThey believe that the media has not covered him in partially and they believe that the Democrats are stalling and the way and rather than try to get to the bottom of the sexual assault allegations and and to understand what really happened thirty six years ago so that has at least for

still there was a recent CNN poll but did have a three but at the point averages he's clinging to have a very narrow it and this could be a race for influence but by the Supreme Court matter\nWith Jim mantle politics editor at the Washington Examiner he's written a piece titled capital fight boost Republicans in red states this probably took a life on its own I Know there's always politics involved with the Supreme Court nominees but is this sort of found material I guess for the midterms\n[noise] oh definitely I I you know it's always a very political process so it's become much more so in

Newman has to be called Trump's strategy on trade rebranding how much of this bill might be geared just toward China and getting them to do something different [laughter]\nWell I think what we've seen in Trump's overall trade strategy is an evolution or where he began earlier this year\nKind of like picking fights with everybody\nOr he picks fights with Europe or he picks fights with everybody who in court steel and aluminum in the United states that includes Japan and of course she picks fights with China with China and with Canada and Mexico so as we progress through these developments it does seem that ... that Trump's strategy is getting more shrewd\nAnd he's actually listening to trade experts who say look\nI'm we really don't have much trade problem with Canada we really don't have a problem with Mexico either the big problem you know the real problem here is China and if you want to confront China you need to make nice with everybody else these are basically ally so why are you picking fights with allies um when you need their help\nTo put more pressure on China so that's actually what's happening\nAt what point or how long into the agreement you think would be fair to measure it against the old NAFTA this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement us MCA how how long is you know worth letting it go and then in analyzing it yeah\nHere's a I mean we may not really no er during Trump's first four years okay hum it it it it was first of all it has to be ratified by the legislatures of each of the three countries\nAnd that is not a given um if it turns out the Democrats take control the house and or the Senate or both chambers next year\nOr that will be a very interesting dynamic because while Democrats actually support some of these protections that Trump are also a favors may may just not want to give Trump a victory on anything so it's possible\nWe can be stuck with the old NAFTA for the indefinite future", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "05"}
