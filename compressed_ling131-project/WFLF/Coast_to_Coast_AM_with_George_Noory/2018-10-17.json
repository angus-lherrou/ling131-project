there's no doubt about it and not only was he a genius but he was a prolific genius he um he proved it over and over again or he was just unbelievably productive and he just wrote so many great grapes shows for for television and film\n[noise] ah one of our friends marches decree I wrote a book about the twilight zone in his subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating an addictive phone while he was floating in this pool\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word\nUm I don't know if he did most of them in the pool in the pool but he's certainly dictated most of his scripts and and us I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly was a rare breed or he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nAt the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced it's just it's just off the charts I I'm just convinced you never slept you just never swept from Nineteen fifty to Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted have is just addicted to it and maybe he got that in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah I absolutely had heart issues and that's what finally did he meant you said that brought the route to well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty others the total shows such crazy isn't it\nIt really is you know when I was researching the book it it's\nYou know this couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well first of all yeah he run Ninety two twilight zone episodes he also worth thirty eight of the night gallery stories ... so if you know they do is that's a hundred and

notch and make a color than to get done you're completely in another universe and you're not for me you're not in the twilight zone anymore\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately\nWhat was his role well\nHe he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even hitched it he's the one who probably pitched it to the network ...\nAfter that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and\nAnd he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell he never a novel he did write your collections of short stories ... sure but I'm getting the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie or they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary\nI'm ... but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with television and he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's going to be removed and the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out\nA is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for it where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be re Andrew reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nAnd it was one of them are on certainly one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to\nWell he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling\nA so he did get coal credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of these is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone that in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a\nHeat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift [laughter] she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago\nAnd he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations and UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff but he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own you'd never saw a spaceship or\nAnything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess mine is commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of 'em yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod certainly could write a story and a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story and twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed and\nIt's very difficult to pinpoint your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said there are so they're so different\nVery hard to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to\nThrow a couple of my favorite at this point probably as it's walking distance rod Serling first season a episode about his kind of archetype or you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know really this youth and go back to a easier less stressful\nLife was that will be the uh it's just like well yeah it's kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to its well spent\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among my favorites and that was that was a big theme is or was this idea of going back to his innocent youth and bring him to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was a classic a\nHand is absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still know to this day they know that and it gets a cookbook you know they that's ever [laughter]\nAnd they're just so many good the what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a average Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nUh he started that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that they think just taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nAll right Nick stay with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite

imagination ticket for a rod Serling were alive today watching television what what do you say about the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time the restrooms renting obviously we talked about some of the censorship but\nNot on the issues but also the language and and just the ... the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there are so many shows that are that are are so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think it would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and here there's certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but um but I think in general he would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you I'm\nSure he he would hate reality TV or on the um he\nAnd and I don't say that just you know that's not just me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television for its time a rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody\nOnto the show it in a normal you know regular everyday person and they\nYou know a trot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just despise the show or you know I thought it was just an invasion of privacy and everything else so it's a reality of it and he would have but [laughter] but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWill an old time television to knock a really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows where you gone back\nOr even the comedians\nAre the game shows they were all older white guys you know in in I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm ... older white guys [laughter] where did the television\nYou know it would be difficult to get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you think of him\nHe was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um\nThe field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be this kind of like talking about a major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and how they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available though in his day there was just the three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that at the gifts to uh to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS\nCBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\n... let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started hiker\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series was in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of the SATs which to me was as far as the visual impact was which was a testament to the summit talk for the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish always wondering for Nick if he knew how many cameras but it used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with Kurt that it that's one of the ...\nStriking things about the series is is that you know of course the production level of in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest a set\nAnd uh so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make you know there's one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like ... of the beholder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back under control\nHe jumps started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon to\nBe Robert Redford part yeah yeah has learned Redford\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on TV [noise] uh and that was a great great show when he was a very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to see what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered\nEpisodes of the series is it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spill person you know a says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery or because everybody thought she was ugly and uh she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there is a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered at\nThis and the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above that fallout shelter\n[laughter] yeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was yeah that was a terrifically both on episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know
