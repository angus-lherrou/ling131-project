don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I get an intention a bit when the several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading towards the Carolinas or they could see it as a category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down in the ... hit a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens it work sending\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep the uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now\nWe've run about thick piece intention experiments trying to lower violence um last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence in the violent place in America which is believe it or not a a a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri Jesse ...\nAnd we calculated the result Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor at ... look at it from the University of California\nAnd she saw that\nCrime went up St Louis has a home property crime went up in St Louis as a whole property crime went up went\nUp in fairground and neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before and it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so it's going on here\nAnd what do you think this is what people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the field but what's out there saying\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy field and what seems to be the case is we can\nShare what's going on with our thought I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy and our thoughts are another kind of energy when there\nAre worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I'm thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make have to grow faster to purify water healing somebody of PATS the lowering violence and\nYou know I'm thirty three twenty nine shown measurable positive significant effect\nDecided to trend that the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that\nKind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug has his good record is that in terms of studies so so as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together\nThere is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power\nTo change things now maybe he'll thing\nThe experiments you been working on all boys are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis\nAnd then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I Lived in the u._k. and we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the Deepak of the middle east\nAnd also very prominent Israeli ... a documentary producer so we had eight and Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know it's the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know I'm just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know ... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was\nAmazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic and it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does added to play ... in the if you're a beach in positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we did an intention once for a kid call Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide is through and so forth of forty foot structure after is he broke up\nWith this for a serious girlfriend and he'd broken everything he had brain damage she had a you know he had nerve damage\nAnd so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live but he got better he got out of the hospital a\nFar quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief and the power of intention was pretty stupid\nIt weren't for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot jar ah Gary Schwartz at the University of of Arizona noted psychologist\nAnd a Jessica too is a very well known professor statistics and has been doing working consciousness research I worked with the late ... rural I I worked with people from\nFrom Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh\nUh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities so we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable and then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up\nAnd some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with\nDr Schwartz we did some seat experiments where we had four sets the seeds and we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientist\nDidn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that\nThey really helped me set up because they're the scientists\nAnd then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate or I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to\nTo do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or on Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results\nAnd the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's going on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nIndeed no bloom the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group for the test why ... why not three Fifteen\nWe'll talk of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of you know groups small groups in my workshop you

ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward\nUm life university the one who studied this the largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nearest scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at the immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this [noise] um but one of the other\nBig pieces of this I talked about it with ...\nWith the University of California Berkeley\nWho did this big study of what goes on when you do something else ... when you do southern compassionate like our piece experiments and they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's\nThe longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on\nUm things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies and\nThen the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we\nWe actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis they found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like a so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be ... that would be an interesting experiment\nWill you know we're doing one this at this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in the mail is county in Florida\nUm we're gonna do something about lowering violence but we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next\nNext spring um we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou talked about a mirror affect what does that\nMirror affect me was the biggest piece of this George because you know we weren't just seeing affects among the receivers of stuff and the receivers of the big intention experiments you know the outcome of\nThe biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened\nTo the participants in these intentioned experiments [laughter] so when we started doing these peace experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly\nI asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like this um I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek remember these are people who are participating\nIn their own home in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment\nTheir lives became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives there were getting along better with their partners they were getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with so that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing\nWhen we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation and what happens to those people need changes their lives being part of that\nWhen we're going to come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for you as we talk about the power of aid but we'll take phone calls in just a second on coast to coast am Lynn Mick Jagger with us the giants in the field with the intention to\nFind out more about and I just don't go to ... dot com\nFritz inviting you to check out the latest I heard radio Orlando can plant spotlight I guess this week is Dr Patrick think your main burn federally and when the\nPatients come in to the office you know in in so many of them are helpless and they don't know what to do if you kill one so you feel old tunes and your body and the new ... the flames\nWhatever it takes for you not just to lose weight but you know at all levels is much easier to this like pushing the manager patients uh you know with all these horrible methods of due to the rest of the life of me\nGood morning or lend money yeah more news radio Ninety three boy one\n\n\nAnd we'll come back to ... year with limbic tigers as we talk about her work the power of each one just as powerful as the age when\nNo I think I think you can even ten for yourself no question and you can have you know you can manifest things definitely um\nI've certainly seen that in my own life and seen it in in many in many instances but there seems to be some sort of scaling up in a group you know\nI I wrote about this is my last book the bond about how we are really need to be part of the community George and you know nowadays are are kind of birthright it's also are feeling of\nOf coming home in a way you know we were always meant to be in groups we were never and we were always part is supposed to be part of the greater whole we've never supposed to be alone and I think there's something about that group support\nThat group feeling that you know you got a load of people who are just wishing you well there you know intending for you for your health for your happiness or something that's really powerful\nAnd you know in many cases with my master classes for instance when I put people in groups there total strangers and they don't meet in person they're meeting virtually you know they're meeting on Skype\nOr zoo or conference call or something like that many of them end up feeling like this is\nA batch of people who are closer to me than my own family never they never unless they've never actually met them in person\nAnd that's the incredible thing about it but it's that idea of a group of strangers you know praying for you basically that's very very powerful\nHave you found Lynn in your studies that these abilities will work for people of certain age brackets assured sex or just a few anything\n[noise] no I mean you can be young and you can be older\nYou know I think that um\nThe people who tend to do this stuff or people who are you anywhere from their thirties to their seventies um it really depends on what they want in their life they I've had young people I've had older people and it it works for them I think it's all about using the techniques\nThat I teach you know in becoming a master in tender essentially knowing how to really focus your mind knowing how to\nWhat kinds of things too intense for and how to do it but it also being part of that group and just meeting regularly and I think it's that meeting regularly that does the trick I mean there's a guy called Michel Dean I write about my book who is a\nClinical psychologist but suffered from depression which such so bad that it was often suicidal that's not a good calling card for a psychologist\nSo he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression and he couldn't and so being part of the group they intended for that\nAnd what they intended for was that he would find the source of his in his depression and soon after that he got a brain wave to go to a Chinese\nHerbal is who worked out that one of his liver filtration systems wasn't working and he went and got tests and they confirmed that he that he was right\nAnd as soon as that was treated his depression completely lifted but the really interesting part of Michel story is what happened\nOver the year not only did that happen but he ended up going back to his fighting weight\nLoss wait the he got back to his you know his his weight that he was as a young man he um he is chi gung practice he was practicing chi gung ... better\nHe got a writer's block and was able to start writing again um he also developed something to help other people with I think it's with depression is special I'm a special kind of technique and\nEverything in his life was getting better and even his training you know his his um his his trainer at the gym and said to him\nWhen are you doing man you're exercising less and you're more fit what's going on with you and it was like everything in his life was starting to improve but he he was one of the people who met religiously\nAnd in fact one of the guys in his group Robert became a really really close with him even though they'd never actually physically met\nAnd there were times when mutual would say you know I had insomnia last night and couldn't sleep and Robert let's say don't worry man I had you covered and he was intending for him to have a you know to to sleep better\nAnd so knowing you've got that constant support is really strengthening in every way\nOver the year when when you do these intention non experiments but when you do these intentions to do something what do they do actually I mean you sit there and think I mean what what do they do\n[laughter] okay well there's a lot of little techniques that make you a good intent or I mean you know the popular view is that you just have to think about it and believe it or ... whatever you do\nYeah um but it's you know one thing to really keep in mind Georgia's that were intending all the time [laughter] you know and we sabotage most of our intentions we\nWe think that we're just having you know we we have a meditation in the morning we do a little power thought and that the power thought is the thing that's our intention and that's the only thing the universe is going to hear but\nUm as I wrote about my book the field\nYou know we are and meeting energy all the time we're in meeting a tiny current of light all the time and our thoughts are another part of that kind of a mission and we're we're kind of leaky buckets we're we're broadcasting twenty four seven\nAnd so we we have this one little power thoughts saying I'd like to have this\nUm but the rest of the time we're thinking no we can't possibly come to pass or on such a loser or I don't like my hair or whatever you know were sabotaging it\nAnd so one of the things you have to do is get used to really having a focused mind a sense of positivity but probably the most important thing of all that no one ever thinks about it being specific um\nYou really have to direct yourself to a ... don't you\nYeah I mean most people think about you know we'll all do something general in the universe will fill in the gaps and that's a big mistake because the universe can oftentimes fit land the gap and a really negative way\nYou know I think of the case of Heather meals McCartney who was a Paul McCartney is a second wife um she was he had lost his\nLove of his life Linda his first wife and he was mourning her and he met Heather who had been a she was a northern girl from the north of England\nWho came from a pretty rough family and she wanted to better herself so she came down to London and she was a model\nAnd she was the glamour model and she got hit by a motorcycle one day and\nShe lost her leg below the knee one of her legs but she was very lucky and she you know she continued to model and stood up for the rights of people who had lost limbs and that's when Paul McCartney miss her now\nHeather meals really wanted to be famous that was something really important to her and suddenly\nAfter pull married her and it fell in love and married her\nYeah well how does he get rid of it Lynn tell us when we come back\nA long long nuts by your radio

doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown that oh I guess that could super reach higher than a hundred dollars announced\nYou adjusted for inflation George sober would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach us all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach\nOne could that happen over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of
