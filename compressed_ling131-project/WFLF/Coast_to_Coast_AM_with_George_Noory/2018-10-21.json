I I'm Amazed and especially listening to some of the you know the ... I mean the variety of things that you uh play and the fact that we're talking that that\nWill determine man does not live by politics alone at least I don't and\nTalk radio across America right now is almost ... you know unless you're a doctor so and so a helping people out with their emotional problem otherwise a talk radio is all politics all the time it's either going to have to change or as the leading format in America it's going to die out\nWell I you know I think\nI think you've made a really good point there as well and uh I'm I've been hoping that you know I've I've been kinda apathetic about it because it's like a\nA price you just got through saying what what do we have to choose from and what do we have to choose from there and\nIt is not a good choice is yours there\nThere's no choice and I was thinking about Nicaragua little Nicaragua I've\nBeen all through Latin America I used to live in Central America and uh you know what I call it placed banana republic but they're really\nQuite advanced tie literacy rates very politically minded\nGet twenty three presidential candidates in Nicaragua right and a very close election monitored all computerized you're at a very well done very very well done I was there and let's see I was there in Nineteen Seventy nine July when the\nSandinistas took over the government and I was in the capital and then I was there\n... ... ... ... right out of high school oh man that must have really done some\nYeah two of my buddies taking a trip down to South America in our a post graduation getaway trip kind of thing you know\nThen you went to Nicaragua when Ortega took over yeah well we didn't know that was going on and I understand all ethically aware now I understand Nicaragua just looked like a nice place to visit\nWell it was part of the itinerary down to ... so we weren't destination\nTo their benefit they did not return Mr or did I get a power ... goodness that\nYou know what was really amazing was we we were airlifted back by the American embassy they took\nA lot of people they took us back out too I'm sure ... we we had an airbase there are ... or something going on there with before we started helping the country's later but uh anyway they um\nI noticed in a photo that I saw in a in a three and a ... I'm pretty article ah what do you call it ... by newspaper down there they had um the that the CIA moral who became the president um she wrote in town and the victory procession\nAlongside of Daniel Ortega\nYou that's right I recall that thank you very much for the call I recall that and the elections or in Nicaragua are definitely a bright spot if we can just do something about a Cuba or the world will indeed in many ways to be a better place east of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nGood morning good morning how are you that I Am fine uh my name's Kevin I'm calling from la fountain Indiana gives her about the cats and Australia yes uh\nI Believe about a year ago um did they not try to get rid of the rabbits and Australia correct okay I have a second they if they were trying to do that you know they like designer viruses down there I see [noise]\nUm there's one thing that a person has to remember amount to voting for a for a do or Clinton this year was that um\nClinton a as a proving judges for um\nYou know he's already appointed more judges and has a first term than Reagan ever did the both terms that he was elected and he's got a lot more judges to a point\nWhere you know I Would say that what you're raising is a good and valid point except for the fact that if you look at the appointments that require congressional approval ones that were made by Clinton and required approval of the Senate almost inevitably a just like rubber stamps or\nYes I I realize that I I I Would just uh for some reason with thing to do with it I have a little bit more conservative uh uh thinking on when when he goes to a point the judges then went to\nWell I Would certainly like to think so but the record would be that he helped confirm those that were sent to him by President Clinton so why would you think that he has appointments would have a a ... would necessarily uh be\nYou know I think both of them are going to be forced if there is a Republican House as there is now

the United nations Mm\nWell the United nations was mentioned I don't think specific treaties\nYeah there there too that um I don't think most people are very aware of multiplied because there's the media doesn't talk about the Clinton really doesn't talk about them but they're there to trade even particular a treaty on the right to the child and the other one is on biodiversity\nYoung actually treaties are not something that Clinton or any other president can just entered into a ... require ratification by two thirds of the Senate if they are highly treaties\nMade back way and probably the reason they haven't been ratified because we've had Republicans in there that have been keeping a check and balance on the\nUs and if we're smart we will keep Republicans in their\nAbsolutely that that's the thing I'm hoping for that at least to Clinton is reelected a\nI'm a realist and I I Do believe he is going to be reelected I'm not here to be a cheerleader on reading the tea leaves the way I think there are dropping and so I my feeling now is to concentrate on keeping the checks and balances in place absolutely um\nI I Would be interested in people uh you know comedy if they have heard anything about the uh the killer a treaty by\nEither trying to get more information about that myself but tap when you up and down there and then find out what they really say ah you know they're

crime\nMama guy Martin\nYeah that was very very chilling and very fascinated Nick [noise]\nHe was right on on about a lot of stuff but when you ask them about the anti Christ and all that I was really my radio started fate and really bad in and out when they started to answer that question started banging on my radio on everything really yeah said oh no I Want to hear this park 'cause that was a really good question and ah\nI Am tonight we drink goes to goes day I'm from the twenty seconds of October Nineteen Ninety six\nNinety until noon on news radio Ninety three point one [noise]\nWest of the Rockies you're on there\nAre ... uh I caught\nYou one day last week and I was a bad bad on the subject of reincarnation and I got the impression you didn't want to talk about it\nI'm pleased to talk about oh well I'm\nAs I I Wonder if you would get a guest on who would be opposed to it and you said you were going to have their priests on friday afternoon to the whole program it never came up the subject of reincarnation\nOh I see well I Would I Would have been obvious so I mean he was a Catholic priest\nWhile I Wonder yeah but I think there are pros and cons to the subject and I would like to hear somebody um has the argument against it\nI don't want it excuse me what why don't you go to make some now what do you think okay\nThe people who believe in it they said that we keep reincarnate ing and ... and coming back because they said that the way we learned yes if you remember they always say that they say that how we learn yes and yet on the program friday night\nYou and the priest agreed that\nThat we are a lot I don't know if you remember that but\nMy point I remember it clearly\nYeah well if if we came three inclined to come back to learn at issue I think we would find our way by now we would not be alive\nAnd well in other words we would become wiser in wiser in wiser is\nWhat we're getting dumber and dumber and dumber ... and now\nThere's another problem with reincarnation and that is that there are constantly more people on the earth in other words yeah more souls yeah right so maybe um those who are learning and becoming wise or because of reincarnation if it does exist are being an effect out voted by the ... coming along as we don't know a damn thing\nI'd out now that now\nWhen you first came on this radio station when you left the station I remember hearing you say that you intended to have a master's is a guest and I don't know maybe you changed your mind but I Would like to hear him talk about it\nFor no I haven't changed my mind at all I had the ruins several times as you know\nOh and then I must admit I hear you I I doubt Michele program that I I never heard him on your program\nOh my oh now\nA boy and then you must not catch

mean you know and uh I I Know you had him before that yeah home or would you consider having him of course I think he's very very interesting and ah or him or any any I guess I'd give the argument the guest reincarnation\nDo you think he does not believe in it\nI I'm not sure but I think he does not\nSurprise you if you uh found out he did\nA yeah yeah that would I I think I heard him at all I I listened to him for Thirty years in a long time ago I heard him say something about that that this would be something that would want because people could keep messing up their lives\nAnd each time and they say well I got another chance I'll reincarnate an opt out do better than the next time and they never do\nIt in with an argument I heard him give a long time ago\nI see oh right oh well maybe I'll have them on how 'bout that\nOh I I'm going to make sure I never miss your ... because I won't know ahead of time you announce it will I usually do announce guess ahead of time I thank you very

Richard Nixon and an angel and there's a lot of territory in their\nExactly and they'll Clinton is acceptable on a morality scale and then has he done the job the answer to that is yes\nAnd that's

sociopath people with sociopath a personality\nWho actually are actually they tend to be great to mass murder but they but the thing about it that people who are executives had was to some extent the route with and be heartless and so if you look at some of our best friends that more morality thing they haven't been very good people but they've been very good executive and that's why I think that actually helped Bill Clinton hurt and it helps him\nWho would you like to be smoking cop\nOh what a smoking cup\nWhat does that nicotine policeman\nNo but I think we're going to need though the page

confidential files of people that they had been looking at and it's not going near the whitewater scan that he was wrong and\nWhy do you think there has not been any similar raucous or even greater

that it would be a state's rights issue and that the Supreme Court ah would say the second amendment only applies state by state I once asked I interviewed judge Bork and that's what he said that's what he said he believed\nIt could be the tenth amendment does give us that\nSo I wouldn't be too much of a hurry especially in the present climate\nBut\nFor for the last three years the Supreme Court has refused to hear any case on the second amendment\nThat's what I said you may you probably ought to be saying thank you because that leaves it in a gray area if it goes to the court that could be it\nYeah [noise] a lighter note [laughter] at that conference call you had the other day with a with a oh two or three people um that was that was really fascinating\nWhat what are you referring to oh

might have been under those things are in the ... or whatever but what was being argued was near term extremely important\nAnd um so like some people were disappointed they said well they want to talk about what was in there and not the politics of what was going to be done to get in there but it's so uh right on top of is that it was an important argument very important\nWell I tell you one of my problem I Would\nI taped major game the other night right and I had an Ninety minute tape and the thing right and at the very end of the tape\nHad asked him about that you have a ... and also the

of it is just the barest beginning\nAnd then he said it that's what they mean patients or within plying that yes okay thank you now I can play can you really\nEven when you imagine that one of those

Thomas heard this wisdom was when he attended one of Timothy Conway's sat sang in the summer of two thousand and five\nThomas's taught a class based on the sad thing for the center for lifelong

see\nGraham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the month for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty four team\nIs the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure [noise] let's talk about Harry Houdini ease [noise]\nUm how should we practice I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that I Know why did that happen\nHow did it come about that that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um\nHe um was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is\nUltimately got him killed because I think that the people these\nFake psychics or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little\nBit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me\nYou know right and there would have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but this time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from\nThis guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for\n'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the\nMagician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer we take a picture and\nAnd uh you know the fake media would be totally surprise you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini him to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics mediums and put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah\nThis writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so I had\nNothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet a Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive\nThe fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spirit you list and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly go and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually\nWell I'll touch on that and just admit it but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked because bath and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine\nAnd I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and\nHarry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in his on putting the word for give an all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit with surviving gap and says this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford\nWas well aware of Houdini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDid it so I got a jump in here

P. line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay I'm James ... this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV [noise] yes\nAnd and he does a little up front research brings it into the sand and says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water for this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and as exciting as it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking\nOr perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredited the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't\nI I just that it it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my account but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once\nA year for one night to do the than it is and I think the last one was in LA I'm On the top of a building you know that first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top one will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know and yours is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and Simon and go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream belief\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine\nAffirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm now someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo the whole world that Harry Houdini still live and they will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and here in trying to this proves the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication with possible [noise]\nI Am now and here in my desire to undo this mistake out all the last debate because of my mistake and lay a whole can of hope and to live with the knowledge that

noticed that a while Africa is around fourteen times larger than Greenland and yet on the map\nBoth are almost the same size Greenland is huge on these maps Brazil another example Brazil is more than

okay\nSo that's what happened in the Pacific as far as that Germany is concerned and I'm not taking our enemies part trust me okay as far as uh as far as a journalist concerned Germany is a food debtor nation meeting they don't create enough food to feed themselves\nSo we set up blockades are around around Germany so we couldn't we couldn't feed them running a food so you see these I may see aided photos of people in concentration camps which has tremendous weight horrible I'm you know he had to make a decision to I feed my soldiers who I feed my prisoners\nSo that's the other side of history that people don't really get we had already broken the Japanese POWs I had a conversation about this with Oliver Stone points Thirteen he came out with a series the other side of history I Believe a DVD sir\nYes yes he came to the exact same thing and this book was was in the middle of writing this back then are researching it waste because I Do all my own research and you know he came up with his own research to substantiate the same thing so it wasn't a matter of if it was just a matter of one\nThat had happened\nAnd so again or did he let it happen duty while in part I suppose he was sort of they were prodding the Japanese maybe cornering them a little bit but how much for knowledge do you think\nHe had the actual attack\nIt's difficult to fell I Know they have at least a week's notice and you know the aircraft carriers mysteriously went out of Pearl Harbor\nSo they were not at Pearl Harbor and when the attack happened which is a little says suspicious you know aircraft carriers tend to be a pretty\n... pretty unnecessary commodity in a word like that and every word actually so you know they had to spare them so they left the harbor if I'm wrong\nSorry but I mean I I Can't imagine a situation where are you would be taking aircraft carriers and ordering them away from a place that you're supposed to be protecting\nSo it was pretty good evidence to support that the you know the same you know to support that conclusion that say they definitely had a as a matter of fact\nThe History Channel broke it I think last year I was watching something on the

Mussolini at first it was an ... Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but\nYou know again I'm history books being what they are that tends to be able to be a little lost um [noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of entry and in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff so um I was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way [noise]\nUm anyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do a stone at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close England came to losing the right one they were lined up\nOn the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this was what their MO was they used to go and laid on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then this paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the British\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them\nI'm of course my previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church shows the one who got the two\nTogether but he he just hated the fact that the Americans\nBecause they were so similar at the time that style and in America and the the American president FDR were working in unison on the show it was great for the war it was bad for the world\nBecause Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we were before on\nSo you know to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand we weren't\nGetting things from Russia we didn't know much about the rape purge I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on he wouldn't have been a strand of course we weren't getting that\nUntil decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times where they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure calling us I mean there's ...\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their faces a ... billion\nFDR it seemed a bit from reading your book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns as Donald was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we needed style and Stalin didn't need us\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and ... and style and hit a pack\nWell Hitler violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mine and they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march\nAnd then you know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now it was leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was\nA delusional dictator if at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go toward styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission\nAnd they were just says well I don't care I Want it will do it so [noise]\nThat one is already beating Hitler he doesn't need us so Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little little hard to get and he certainly was so when we really had to go begging at his style on the table in which they get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran I think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they had even at this point they have their eye and sort of carving up the post war world\nA instill at this point you know I I think she was Roosevelt still looks pretty robots\nOr you know he you know by by standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was in was a relatively young guy um he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three [noise]\nLiterature and propaganda as to how they can transform their archery maybe our country into this wonderful new ideology they didn't know what you're talking about evil umpires you\nKnow in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before so this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings in history going by stone stone is the puppet master\nHe uh he's this guy he managed to accomplish with his wife

to call them\nUm read or what was it comb hundred index card it was to re blur used to make fun of them because she was just so worthless when the party one by one knocked off every one of the party
