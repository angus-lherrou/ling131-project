{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLF", "content": "What St theoretically Jimmy Carter did have the power to change that isn't it true that politicians might do the wrong thing and not raise interest rates when they should\nYes that was the fear that was exactly the fear and and this was the reason why the Federal Reserve was going to be independent\nOf the government but is it seems to me looking at the political situation as it currently is unfolding faith for example within the FBI which is clearly the executive branch\nAnd what's happening is the president is telling them to do things and they're saying no that's not the best interest of the United states\nIf it works on that level then why would it work it's certainly something is it's common to all of us are money\nFor our we've never tried to put it that way and well I shouldn't say that either because in monetary history uh we did a Abraham Lincoln issued the first green decks\nA James Garfield or by William McKinley put his back on the gold standard heck even John Kennedy uh changed the monetary system by the issue of United States votes in Nineteen sixty three so there have been presidents who have tried to modify the way that our system works\nAnd they've not had very good luck if you look at what those four presidents have in common I I don't think I Would want to be the fifth fourth\nI sometimes are like in the do the Teddy Roosevelt and you know he came in with the big boom and a sure he he was a people are comparing him to sort of a grand a lion and he room in the territory but never\nViolated the presidential laws but it's the government has grown so big it it doesn't stop on a dime and you can't turn down a dime and is that people don't understand how difficult it is to get movement out of our government\nWhen you're so right on that and and the one place that we all expect the government to to do its job is in monetary policy now our founders were so very specific\nAbout what a dollar or was it in fact article one of the constitution says quote no state show make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender and payment of debt and that was that we wouldn't know what the standard was when the Congress was charged with\nSetting with that standard is so they decided back then okay a dollar is point seven seven three four ounces of silver or one twentieth of an ounce of gold so you knew what the standard was imagine going to buy a gallon of gas and not knowing what a gallon\nHow short one store could undercut the other by making the gallon a little smaller and so forth\nSo this is a real problem we don't know what a dollar is but yet we're expected to save them if their contracts for them or this is a law ... dramatic flaw in the system you enter into a contract today to pay ten thousand dollars over the next ten years\nAnd by the time you get to the end of ten years the dollars value or substance standard has changed so dramatically that you you can't even recognize the first hour that you borrowed\nThis is a very very\n... it is absolutely the most important critical relevant to the states monetary system what is a dollar if we don't know what it is as our founders intended us to know that it's impossible to responsibly contract for future obligations we need to fix that right away\nI Know I've advocated for Thirty years let's go back to the gold standard or a silver standard\nI doubt that we can get there from here as we say in New York but you can do it slowly and I think that a President Trump's policies are a step in that direction\nAndy we've got about a half a minute here again give them the Web address the phone number and your offer or free\nThree CDs that'll get you started if you don't if you're one of those folks who don't understand how that works you can get those three CDs the Federal Reserve the definition of money and protecting your wealth\nAbsolutely free just mentioned you heard it over Florida round table you're hurting or with Reagan and Michael and I'll send them to you if you call eight hundred\nFour six eight to ... the only cause you know I Would give is that once you start down this path as I did you might not want to stop so it could very well consume your free time and how much time he's been studying\nThe American monetary system but like 'em knowing the rules to a football game once you do that you can play with confidence and and that's something I think Americans need to do so if you want to buy my book the secret world of money and Uncle Sam cooks the books go to your local bookseller\nThey'll uh uh happily help you but if you want to give them free information or at least start the journey or take advantage co eight hundred four six eight tunes fix for six\nMentioned Florida round table or Reagan and Michael and I'll gladly send them to you\nAnd ... thank you so much for all of your time this days there and we look forward to one next is I'm Reagan Smith now Michael ... a wreath closing thought in a moment\nTerrorist acts in shootings often described as great tragedy they are not\nWe live in the world so concerned with being politically correct that they're afraid to call the evil what it is evil man in nature is as old as the garden of the\nMany loved the blame culture of poverty or lack of education and opportunity is the problem they may

I'm a while it was still classified uh\nHe uh is making claims that he oh ran the project that he started the project that it was you know that he brief the president and and I mean these are laughable thing as a\nDid not happen you're saying not true or not true All right uh I'd\nLike to make a comment here as well uh this is Joe uh it has also made claims that I worked for him and uh that sort of thing and those are in fact we not true statements\nYeah he said I worked for him to and I didn't [laughter]\n[noise] All right here's a Fox or Mr mcgonigle as has said that and they all had names was never a remote viewer ah with the government but was simply a person who was employed interview prospective candidates for the government remote viewing program could you please ask him to comment on that\nUm this ... ... let me jump in the halls around this is Paul okay well\nThat's actually not completely correct to this knows Paula Joe's because they didn't overlap ed came in on the scene a long after Joe was gone\nIt actually did indeed do did participate in some operational won't be doing projects however that wasn't his primary function or he was indeed a a\nA more an analyst the task or a managing training and stuff you know he did he he he was kind of a Jack of all trades in that regard you wasn't hired primarily as a viewer and only under exceptional circumstances that you do that but he didn't do indeed\nDid do some operational during I got that he did one ... oh no you argue that charges on for ... for a number or I haven't gone through the list but uh I'd say uh I saw at least six or seven that he was a list is if you are on I was really I didn't have\nThat and I didn't remember that from a database of this is\nJoe I'd like to comment on my comment [laughter] ah that's not an exact quote for what I said All right um the claim was made a um buy at a\nDams that that he was the only person who who was qualified the trainer or teacher of the people remote do and that he was the the most accurate remote pure in up in the project and the only one who was a responsible viewer and my comment was that\nHis primary job while he was with the unit was to to act as a monitor and interface with the viewer in terms of a fan linger setting up remote feelings and that he was not a primary trainer he may have trained or in the sense that he ran practice sessions and that sort of thing\nAnd and that's OK that everybody had specific jobs on the Internet um and every one performed as they were required and I suspect that he perform\nYou know righteously and do the job or very well [laughter] ah or I have a problem is where he makes claims then then attributes them to himself when they're in fact don't have anything to do with him they had something to do with someone who perhaps is not even with this any more to that\nIn a private moments are you gentlemen have have you not referred to it deems as Dr Doom [noise]\nAh this was a nickname that was given to him and the unit before he came to us or he was a he was called Dr Doom over there ah he's been predicting doom death and destruction for years and years and years now\n[laughter] uh\nWould you say that he has seen things that the rest of you have not seen but that would\nBe a perception this is a a\nN and that's fine I'm ... one of the remarkable things about remote doing is that when you when you make of production or you make a statement about something a one would hope that there would be some politically or some method by which you could prove whether you're the brass information\nOr I could certainly choose or pick targets that are completely and verifiable and make all the claims I Want and that's okay um\nThey'll never be shown are proven one way or the other but one would hope that if you're going to be making claims about remote viewing and its in its capabilities that you would be a opening yourself to being tested in some way or producing information that can be verified\nNo right well that ah opens up another topic and maybe a little bit in the sense that games\nUm he's been on this program and said I'm sure you're all familiar with the amazing Randy so call me um and it has been on this program and said uh as straight out he accepted a Randy's challenge there is something like a million dollars are now more\nSitting there waiting for somebody to prove psychic ability\nAnd deems and said I accept I called the amazing Randy so called and asked him to come on he settled facts and said okay there's numbers in my safe tell add to come up with these numbers I said that's not fair\nUm you're in control of the uh uh the numbers and I I don't like that so how about coming on the program in setting up\nA structured test uh with the controls set up here on the program and the amazing Randy so called did not come on the program would not come on the program I'm do any of you feel\nThat the amazing Randy's challenge could be a taken and met\nA as it stands [noise] ah he's he's basically a a magician has a slight of hand and sleight of mind uh and if you if anyone does things on his terms a\nDay when I don't care if you were a hundred percent accurate uh\nDoing it on his terms you you would\nYou'd be subject to a magician sleight of hand and uh I mean it's a it's a gimmick [noise]\nYou know that he uses for\nFor his own a popularity and so forth\nOK buddy that yes but if if the controls were set up a independently ah from Mr Randy\nThen he wouldn't participate\nAnd so that's why he wouldn't come on the program\nSure right that this is Joe I'd I'd like to say something about that he he doesn't except the current scientific controls that had been verified proven and used to cross a nine to eleven labs in the world\nI can remote do things that have already happened anybody can do that or that's easy\n[laughter] oh right oh\nCan you know it's easy to predict things that have already happened oh\nAll right let me let me pull away from this are you guys are going to have to ... have already having too much fun with this [laughter] um let's talk about the past for a second one obvious target in the past of immense interest to people worldwide\nIs whether there was really a man who walked the earth\nWho was the son of God called Christ\nOr it must have been a for you at some time and in evidently tempting target [noise]\nUm but this is Lynn oh I had done a series of uh of decisions on oh Colombian drug lords uh Hussein cut off and so forth and I\nWas talking about Lynn may I interrupt you because we're the bottom of the hour and I I like\nCliffhanger so will come directly back into this when Buchanan German model and Paul Smith all members of project Stargate

point I had asked whether whether anybody had remote viewed Jesus was the ... was he the son of God what are you know if anything\nI'm this is Len yes Lynn a I had\nStarted a a an old war story here uh I had been doing the bad guys for for weeks and weeks and I went into the director and I said look\nOf this is Joe and I'm In in my response I'm going to be probably a little bit more specific I'm All right I one of the problems I have is the definition for alien and there's a lot of construction immediately come to mind when someone brings that subject up\nI I Believe are based on a remote during my experiences that uh the UFOs a real uh let me say that up front\nI have not seen any evidence that there aliens associated with UFO phenomena of not seen direct proof of that however uh within the context of aliens I Would have to say that uh also based on my experiences um I Believe that there are a entities that people would perhaps call Ian\nBut that doesn't get guarantee that there extraterrestrial they could be um it could be essentially time travelers a extra dimensional\nA projections they almost anything and I don't think we possess sufficient proved to say one way or the other yet what they might answer Joe\nI'm very and kind of labor\nAll of you agree there is certainly something out there other than us\nWell this is Joe again I'm ... this isn't a new issue are this is this has been around for two thousand years that we know of and it will continue to be around because those are simply experiences that are that people are having\nAnd a while we may not be able to say ... very much specifically about it other than they are experiences doesn't mean that it should not be properly investigated or or looked at\nWhat happens unfortunately is that a lot of the data is a is mixed with this information or it's collected improperly or poorly and and we wind up with some very interesting uh concepts about it but we we don't get any closer to the truth\nOr are there are there are aspects of uh Stargate that history of you are still unable to discuss publicly\nYes of course they are I Would have to say about Ninety five percent of the\nWell my God really yeah absolutely so when they said Stargate is declassified they only generally meant the fact that it existed\nA generally so yes\nWell here's Paul um the the biggest body of of material is still classified and and probably ought to remain classified deals with the actual projects themselves and the reason for that is not the connection with ... remote viewing but the connection with other intelligence sources and means\nUm if there is material on some of that some of those projects that would that that could potentially harm our intelligence collection capability it might have disclosed the existence of some human source that we have you know and and a\nHuman asset him at risk or you know uh there's a lot of stuff in there that isn't even involved with what we're doing that that is sensitive to end a important to ah American security\nBut I Would agree with that\nYou made a rather startling statement one of you or that it deems you felt disclosed some classified material before it's time\nOh well this is Lynn ...\nI'm not only on a on a few uh T. V. shows uh I think there's one called the other side or something like that and a radio shows but also um I was down in Atlanta one time a working with a student and I had the chance to meet a person\nThe uh Courtney Brad ... who was going to put out a book [noise]\nUh this book was about the Stargate project and he asked me to take a a copy of the manuscript that he had and read it and then the first chapter of the manuscript no remember everything was still classified highly classified\nI'm In the first chapter of the manuscript was the list of names of all of the viewers\nOh I went back and I said a Courtney you can't you can't publish this and uh and uh you know if you do though they'll confiscate your book or something in in any way that got him to take that first chapter out mhm\nOh I ask him where did you get this information and he said well I got it from it\nOh when I was a kid watching you know the old world war two movies and all I knew that the absolute worst\nTrees and that any age you could ever do\nWas give the names and the other agents or I mean do you do you fight the cyanide pill and die before you do that and yet here was the entire list uh\nFor the purpose of being published while this was still a a a clash of a thing now the reason that upset me so much was because um of another incident where it at a meeting\nHad gotten up and told what I had done that oh\nAgainst Hussein and I called him on the phone and I should add\nThese are crazy people with guns and uh I've got a family here and he just blew it off well the only purpose I could find for giving those names to coordinate the publishing the book all it was still classified\nOh deals with the idea of targeting for remote viewing\nOr if you have a name basically you have an address and a the a history of Russia and\nThrough some incredible times they're not all going to be good times that's rocky isn't going to seem well then it gets so that's what we need\nYou were listening to our bill somewhere in time tonight featuring coast to coast am from march twenty fifth Nineteen Ninety seven\nWe ... knew until three on news radio Ninety three point one [noise]\nAlready back now a to my guest and I will ask for the sake of the radio audience once again that they all identify themselves by their first name at least as they speak otherwise it is confusing Lynn Buchanan Joe ... model and Paul Smith all once again back gentleman\nUh before we get started I Would like to ask you my Web master\nIs listening we've got a a link right now\nTo the home page for control remote viewing you if you would like any other links up um a say so now and we'll get them up right away\n[noise] uh yes this is this is Joe I'm the cognitive science was ... blank is a a worldwide Web dot Jay as a as a C. dot\nCom she'll am slash Tilda she S L slash index and the E.

addresses will get shorter and easier [laughter] All right we will get those up I'm now before we leave the subject of aliens or dimensional beings or whatever it is that you all sins and agree or would be out there\nOh one obvious target in this area [noise] uh would have been the Roswell episode and I've got a a person vaccine me from Los Angeles saying uh somebody must have tackled that one has anybody looked at Roswell in it so ... what have you determined\nOr I can I can respond to that first I guess this is Joe okay Joe I'm\nBut I had a private client who actually targeted me against Roswell and uh at the time of course was totally blind to the actual target\nAnd ah what I produced was essentially a very accurate description of the location that was being targeted Roswell which was the believe crash site [noise]\nAh there were some indications that there probably was an incident there but it did not involve an alien craft it involves a a possible miner collusion between uh [noise]\nUh some earth birth bound traffic\nAnd probably involved or some materials that were sensitive\nAnd hence then of course the story about the weather balloon\n[noise] yes I ... the data I had not specifically match a weather balloon but uh it it did indicate that there was probably any bad but it was probably not a ... a alien associated sorry\nJoe I'm a factor you from Orange County art in reading ... book mind track which by the way I felt was a great book he talks about a stage in which he says\nThese creatures or goes for spirits and the person wants to know does everybody who remote views eventually get there\n[noise] uh in in regard to what what their referencing are uh some chapters and near where I was discussing a my interaction with what you might call entities that uh took this took place essentially as an experience outside of remote doing All right I Want to make it very clear\nA while these these may have gotten a personal experience on but I think is bell and [noise] ah they they were not this information was not obtained a piece of the remote feeling [noise] um\nI I Believe it it's my personal belief um based on Nineteen years of participation in the project in in the remote doing that I've done\nIt's my personal belief that um that we are by nature are essentially existing in two worlds a one foot physical and one foot nice spiritual or to ignore the experiences from a spiritual side would be taught them out to cutting off the left leg so to speak\n... ah ah here well then here's another good question other than the remote viewing of Christ um\nKent any of you or do any of you aside from your personal religious beliefs are in in in the context of remote viewing ... or is it possible to\nConfirm the fact that there is life beyond the physical I\nI I Will answer that uh this is Joe again I'm In my opinion yes uh\nBut it's not life as we know the physical and it's it's obviously something else fright and uh I I Believe that uh we do have frequent interactions with or what might be termed as as entities or spiritual being\nAnd that uh they have profound impact on us as a spiritual\nSpiritual beings ourselves in that those types of experiences or had the because of the profound impact of them have exactly the same effect as if you were run over by a Mack truck in the world so they should be paid attention to 'em and that's up to each individual as to what they do with that\nDon't write this is for all three of you are in the process of learning or are in the process of remote viewing is there any danger to the remote viewer\n[noise] this is Paul I'm\nI don't think so I'm In my entire time with the program I never experienced by saw or heard of anyone else experiencing anything that would be considered dangerous or I Know there are claims out there to the contrary but uh um you know I I just don't know where that is coming from\nA well a dangerous to the psyche of the remote viewer in other words that you might see things for example that would drive a person over the edge\n[noise] uh this\nIs land could I jump in here for a second\nYes um [noise] for each\nPerson when you establish a sort of contact between your conscious and subconscious mind sometimes there are things that your subconscious unconscious have been waiting for Twenty years to say to each other and there's a period of time generally when a person gets very sensitive very a\nA reactive to things uh fly off the handle easily and so forth uh but that gets over with\nA any real danger that comes to a person I think is basically\nCaused by the fact that the subconscious is harboring a danger that is then let loose\n\nI have never had any are even actually known any person who has had a a a remote view in session where this session

anyway I'd ... I'd like to add something to that when I I this is Joe I I agree with what when and uh Paula both said\nI've never had a bad experience and remote going but I Would like to underscore the fact that uh this is a very interesting um\nExperience remote doing or being psychic and there are a lot of people that are that are on the edge to start with and when they're exposed to the changes their rather radical changes in their their beliefs or their construct\nOr it can be very undermining or damaging to the psyche\nAnd uh there is evidence that a lot of people do sort of step off the edge and lose touch with reality in other words they become a pretty much in in a involved there\nAnd as long as those particular rules ruining system would be taught them out to impossible to know whether or not remote\nInfluencing is actually taking place as a result of\nA unknown targeting or whether or not by virtue of the fact that person knows are involved in that kind of experiment there actually willing willingly opening themselves to being targeted\nSo it's an issue there probably won't be answered and kill someone has come about a ... an approved protocol that can target individuals without them knowing or on wedding targeting\nOh there's a lot of uh talk going on now about influencing of a different sort of by the Chinese with regard to our present administration and one would have to imagine if there is a Chinese project enters remote influencing is possible that would've been an obvious uh\nA major ah project or would you all agree\n[noise] a little head oh I I I Would agree except that I haven't seen any evidence that the Chinese are in fact going up so it's sort of a moot question and I'm not sure how anyone would would evaluate the results of that\nThere have been there's a power there haven't been a lot of reports about the Soviets having been involved in that in the past\nUm but it's mostly kind of rumors and then and such a again no evidence of course the thing of this nature it'd be hard to prove any way but there were some interesting quite wild stories about what the Soviets could or might be doing\nAll that there are All right gentlemen hold tight we'll be right back to you\nGathering of eagles I'm calling in leading Buchanan Joe ... and Paul Smith all involved in projects Stargate for the U.S government which ran for Twenty years using your tax dollars\nWho are listening to our drill somewhere inside there might be drink coast to coast am ...

I. D. A. L. W. A. V. E. dot net\n\nThat's a RV I as a tidal wave one word dot net right All right and uh you answer your email I take it\nYes you know it I Can't guarantee I keep up or if I have if I get inundated but I Do my best\nUh well uh you're going to be inundated believe me what projects or it in the remaining moments or what projects or have you all taken on after the military I take it you're leaving the national security stuff behind now are you probably had enough of that sink a ship\nA gift or maybe as you I don't know um uh but uh but so what are you doing now\nThis is Joe I'm I'm a research associate still with the economy to science as well that was the original ... and then later as I say I see and uh we're currently working on some very interesting contracts for a\nUh some major corporations that have passed us with doing some research or up here and we hope to continue or pursuing the mechanisms behind them doing\nThat and you talk about it at all I I mean I Am very example our own CIA which wants to spend all its time\nI'm with national security work uh uh you know Congress and oversight committees have been talking about changing the direction of the CIA to a industrial espionage\nUh we we of course it see so are the kind of the science as well have never endorsed uh espionage of any kind\nOf were primarily interested in trying to uncover the mechanisms that supports I function but we've recently done three three or four a very interesting pilot studies that have\nIndicated that we may be on the something with regard to two or three of those mechanisms and if those prove out which we have every reason to believe they will uh there'll be some very astounding a findings that will open the door to a whole lot more research\nDo you guys ever scarier selves\n[laughter] every kind of scares me a high price I Am [noise] uh\nNo longer surprised at at this science but I'm never quit being amazed by it\nI Would agree with that a state visit\nOne of those things that once you have big gun uh I I mean I have yet to talk to a remote viewer who was involved in the government program or otherwise who has said this is lousy I'm I'm On board or I'm only interested am not doing it anymore is it one of those things that once you've done you will always do\nA this is Joe uh it's I I always tell people that if you are if you wanted me to sell my experience in this for ten million dollars I probably wouldn't\nDo it however\nIf you offered me ten million at the beginning to do it that I knew what I knew now I probably wouldn't participate [noise]\nUm I guess and yeah that's a good answer that's really a good answer All right well we're about out of time anybody a water issue any final words here um I of course would love to have you back at some future point um but any any final words for the American audience is intensely interested in this whole thing you've been doing\n[noise] most I call 'em\nSound like somebody else wants to say something to um I I think there's a very exciting process I think it's very exciting time to be involved in this and the and I'm Glad that people are interested that kind of in that case what we were doing in secret for so many years so I encourage people to develop an interest in it and export and find out about it\nSo in other words uh go ahead folks if you're interested follow it\nThat's it that's right Joe this joke and I I just want to add one thing for you know after um I Would encourage people to retain their skepticism and to ask questions it's it's okay to challenge whoever's doing this and and have them explain or open\nA to review and criticism what exactly it is that they're doing uh that's that's where knowledge is developed and it's how we decide whether something is truly valid or not so\nWould encourage continued interest but to be skeptical and ask questions well\nYou know somebody might likely say and we've only got a few seconds All right I Want it instead of demonstration you know arts holding up something tell us what it is that is not the kind of thing that remote viewing lends itself toward is it\nCool said in like that so for two hundred and forty two years\nThey've been trying to get it back and we America has really that's the fight that we see going on right now\nDoesn't still feel out of kilter resolve to you know there's

dinosaurs roamed earth\n[noise] oh not personally oh that is a I'm\nA fairly good training target and uh uh in fact I think maybe I have a in my in my early training of\nYou know just as a as another uh a session to see if you're on target because we have feedback on that\nWell there was a there's a second part to the question okay or if so was man walking side by side with the dinosaurs\nOr I don't remember specifically good in that I have always felt that oh a form of a man was yes uh-huh but uh but I didn't get that from a remote viewing I got that from other studies that have done so simple archaeological footage\nA PS why can't remote viewers win lotteries and I'm a before you answer that I Would have answered a Ross in California by saying Ross how do you know that a lot of the winners of lotteries aren't re most humorous\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] but you answer the way you want when\nAll right we have ah people working on numbers which is a very hard thing to do in remote viewing\nThere is another type of remote viewing called alternate I mean I'm\nI'm felt A R B a alternate remote viewing [noise] uh\nWhich uh substitutes remote viewing targets for the numbers and a allows you to a remote view for instance the pick three now the way that ... normally done is if you are doing to pick three\nYou have a four people working a three viewers\nEach of which will remote view one of the numbers and one person who collect\nThe data looks on the church to see what the results Maine and goes and places the bet huh I'm only ... but it it it's been done and uh oh misspend

is this a security clearance and ah for many other reasons as well\nOr if there's an investigation going on especially on an American citizen\nI Will only work it through authorized channels and so if someone comes to me and says you know uh\nUh my son is missing or or uh [noise] I don't know what happened to so and so yes I'm I Will tell them\nPartially because I Want to cushion they're partially also because it's a necessity that oh if they will get the investigating officer to contact me I Will be glad to work the problem for pre\nFine ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am\nMa'am listen to me listen to me he just said have the investigating officer in your case the case of your son contact him\nThere aren't there is no it's been living here for ...\nYears but there was an original investigating officer on the case\nWe uh ... retired by now\nWe worked a case not too long ago a last year some time that had been closed for nine years\nAnd uh and on the results of our ah our session a male days and I worked on this the results of our session the case was reopened and they've been finding are I hear some uh some new evidence\nSo do that man well how can I get a hold of lane\nOkay that's a good question Lynne or ... what is the best way to get a hold of you\nUh do you have Internet access\nOr I Would presume if she doesn't she can get it\nOkay oh I Would say the easiest the easiest to address to remember is art bell dot com and ah right there's a link to my page and on my pages my address and phone number\nOn right there you are imam and or I might add that if you don't have a friend with a computer who can do it you can go to a public library and I just remember my address a which is WWW dot art bell dot com [noise]\nNow let me also say that right at the present time\nWe are heavily backed up with a signed witness program ah cases and so we're we're really bogged down until we can get more votes years working on these so um oh I Hope people won't be offended if um\nYou know if they call and uh have their police department call as well\nAnd uh nothing is done that day\nAh we have a we have tremendous backlog here\nCompletely understandable a west or the Rockies you're on the air with Lynn Buchanan good morning\nAri yes good morning my credit for that kind of lost track of all\nThey can cover up a fake like already back\nAlright I'm old that that is an awfully good question in other words could for example another group of remote viewers somehow trick you and cause you to see something that would be utterly inaccurate exactly\nAre absolutely in fact one of the biggest problems in remote viewing is that you tend to do that to yourself to begin with oh and there is a thing that a recall basically the neighbor's cat\nIf or someone else whom you respect very much\nA does a session on a target and they're wrong that out of you respect for them you will tend to find the wrong thing as well this is one reason why I never\nUm oh\nI asked the same exact question\nTo two different viewers who know each other\nWell this brings me back to it deems a\nTapes which generally the group earlier including you seem to agree might be or hopefully will be a good idea if it works\nIf it works then I'm all for it\nBut then on the other hand we all of those people out there remote viewing maybe even influencing\nThey're going to be a lot of mistakes made\nA lot of mistakes will be paid and couldn't there'll be assertive virtual anarchy that would develop that's\nMy fear I Do believe very strongly in the show direct effect and I know that the more people who learned to remote view correctly the easier it is to learn to remote view correctly the more who learn to remote view incorrectly the easier it will be to learn encourage\nExcuse me incorrectly ... and this is my big fear with so many of the quickie courses that are out there oh\nI'm afraid that they're going to through the shoulder I could just uh you know the hundredth monkey a Fisher a just a almost destroy any progress that's been made simply because it'll be easier to do it wrong\nYoung well what what was your initial reaction when you heard the videotapes were going to be released it a very or relatives\nThe comparatively inexpensive price\nOh well it was just that I really hope it works or if there's a way that we can get people doing\nThis oh and doing it well then I'm all for it and if there's a way that we can make it available to more people I think that's great\nWell listen we're coming to the end of our actually the entire program uh\nYou've really been a trooper sticking it out through the whole program it's got to be a wall of a sudden has to be back there huh\nYes uh looking out the window it is\nAll right my friend while I suspect you're

just love mysteries um and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go to go into an open mind and I tried to use science and look you know look at it from a\nCritical thinking focal point of view\nAnd so one so partly the answer question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that ... been looking at goes again all\nRight you know they're like well give me a bit of the ... going to go to the beach and like that's really cool are you there was a monster there so I'm

Orlando six to nine AM all news radio Ninety three point one [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am kind of you will is here discussing the origins of Halloween on ... talking with Ben Radford then so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween\nIt really does have an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and gets said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nI'm suddenly the guy that talks about that but a lot of times ah there you know there there's a lot of them are just hoaxes I remember there was a guy I think it was in a in Cleveland or Boston or something about two years ago\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\nOh and we yeah when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you that exactly\nI was just such an offensive of like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I Want to offer but I wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go x-ray your candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where they really take ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen to know I Know that because uh I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist often\nActually at the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually finding anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't yeah\nI don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it in a way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy makers okay but he did it yes so that he can steal stuff that he wanted\nTo point where the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people were mommy for soles of of of you know purgatory this that you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] 'cause it always raises money right\nNo no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin\nFirst making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it was primarily district or the British Isles and then it came over with the with the first and second waves of of the ah the immigrants to the United states\n... and in fact we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course you know part of the uh the trials they have they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years I'm a court before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff\nUm you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know point though\nYou'd actually our families coming together to make a kid's costume\nAnd what you find is that the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in about the Eighteen seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as ornate in your past the oldest and stuff but what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise\nAnd you know it's it's ... it's become commercialized for for better and for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who are you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or\nThe drag yeah and of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have\nA you know you have the princess is right you know and they're all you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fine I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied it so much can you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well on a good question you know I think that um you know ... ... ... mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to\nTo win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we went to each interact with each\nYou know a couple of generations it changed a bit um and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like ours and stuff it's like\nScary scary stuff going on [noise] um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think it really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed\nHum what is like a dress up like a dress up right I mean eight year old kid was just an eighty year old kid like dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just\nInherently a humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and um you know it's still going to be knocking on doors national for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years\nOr ... you know who knows maybe two hundred years now a ... there'll be a sort of your virtual a go if you know where you've got\nLike holographic you got to that that ... the giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to ask them about their say panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm ... and this is really saline tonight\nNever missed a detail on a short just sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com\n\nAround the the biggest draw\nWatch our must see I our radio music festival tonight and tomorrow night an ATM on cw Eighteen\n[noise]\nGot a great story\nWorry about David your guy that has overcome a severe issue\nOf whether the light the light bulb went on and I started to research and I was going through\nIt made me feel so much better I can tell you one thing the product war\nNot only works in one way or to a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy into the hell of a better way carnivores built everything back in my body in a while\nBut you know what it's better and I can't say I don't know\nThis is Richard Ross Perot or for carnival or research international call one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven\nThree five or visit carnival or a dot com C.

we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great things great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so let's I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about it\nBook because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and\nYou know it works with the will of saline theme of goes tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know\nAnd the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness and say panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean it's one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain\nSegment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know mall haunted houses you know reached out and grab the crow somebody or whatever I mean it's there are some of that but\nBut you know that's you for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who are just you know have a good time with it [noise]\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... from the conservative cause a candidate because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient the health I mean they they they they they worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if during summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some corn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the idea what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nAnd and again you know it was before I went festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a say in all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at Texas is coming to a team\nYou know ... not suffer which to live um and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this is fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that's that's one of the more uh obviously comes up\nEvery every year in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing\nIn the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons I'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in a did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to St James hotel in northern New Mexico and I\nWas there during investigation and looking to go in and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is it a where'd you boards are strictly prohibited anyone using a ... will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so concerned but using a word you board was going to open up you know demonic corals or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall\nAnd I'd never seen that like you know in the room you know sign this don't use it and so you know typically the\nConcern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know\nAdults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties that twin because it was centered on kids that were the concern came from and so it was ... and that\nA kid the dresses up as a witch or goal will become interested in witchcraft or wicker or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party have a harvest party so the the the the they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff\nAnd of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you know darker scary\nSo interesting because um you\nKnow everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in that like I said again you know black lights and uh uh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and\nIt got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was all wacky haunted house\nThere was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you'd go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when it came to Christmas and just the way it was right down the\nMarathon bar amount either right away I Am doing those\n[laughter] you'd freeze those have you ever had them frozen\nOh they were great under you're just taking me back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stopped because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ruler on the back oh man\nI Googled afterward on here and uh and uh\nI I didn't know that um that uh what's his face with a lot fewer seats McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way Yeah Yup yup yup\nMember on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on there now\nSo well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and they say ten of part and all that good stuff\nNow another element is is some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know the um\nSo what is new ads placed in honor of outage news radio ... won W at ballet [noise]\nReveal Ninety three point one exclusive forecast rain very warm and muggy for the next couple of days Saturday Night start out with the center for otherwise cloudy\nClose to Seventy six [noise] focus on the Monday we'll have a son with an M ... some places each day [noise] get staying on the ... eyes eighty six the\nNitrogen treated like that so for two hundred and forty two years they've been trying to get it back and we are America has [noise] has suffice it we see going on right now goes on\nThe stove fuel out of ... to go shopping where\nThere's a grand to force the out there that me not just wants to be mean to capture the soul\nThe world but I don't think they're going to win I don't think they're going to when\nYou're Stacey co when was the daily consumer on XM satellite radio if you see a cruelty free label on a package of chicken or beef you're probably more inclined to buy it right well that's good but the problem is the term is legally meaning let\nA new study suggests there should be some teeth behind that phrase so that companies can't use it just to push their product\nThe FBI is warning about bogus emails they appear to come from the better Business Bureau in fact the males are fake and they carry a dangerous virus if you open\nThe [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] Mm\n[noise]\nNine we\n[noise] man [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nIt just goes to goes to a you know here's your guest host ...\nCranberries\nAnd zombies on the coast to coast am tiny Willis here on wheel of saline ooh oh\nMan I don't like hearing that when it's dark blue [noise]\n... candle or something nice in them and spooky more a great spooky stuff to come here of course and by the way I Want to remind you of our annual goes to show that we will have here on Halloween Night on coast to coast that's a Wednesday night by the way October thirty first okay\nSend us your best ghost story and we just might choose used to tell a lie on coast to coast\nThat is so fun George Nora gets all the good shows darn it\n[laughter] it it's a you know I think this was a\nFun night so email your name your phone number and your best ... story to Halloween story at coast to coast am dot com Halloween story at coast to coast am dot com give us your best stuff\nAnd if we like it then you get to tell it on the air was your story\nThat I Love this it's an annual thing that we do it goes to show instead of coast to coast so fun it's so fun\nSo if you need more ... forgotten about that if you think oh I I'm kind of like you know it's late I'm not going to remember this I don't have anywhere write it down simply tomorrow I'll go back to our website\nAnd there's the information it's coast to coast A.

I. T. [noise]\n[noise] where in fact we days not angel noon on news radio nutty three point one [noise]\n\n\nIt's coast to coast am county Willis here\nWill is wean is what's going on right now and we're talking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator of mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating ghosts and it's um\nStuff and if we can hear ghost and if you if there's a mysterious founder voice or something coming from somewhere then that means that that by definition there the material because we you know sound is Adia waves and and you know we are hitting the eardrum and stuff and so you can pressing Adia waves and so\nSo that's that means that they they can be recorded um on on you know audio tape and and and and digital things and so so you know one way of looking at the different technologies that are used to detect ghost\nFor the most part they are ones that the replicate what we can experience right we were all we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghost because people do report seeing them people record you know if they're recording them [noise]\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... filled with actors\nAnd the problem is that there's no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation but ... but there's no one has ever proved that you know that a location with high E.

is ...\nSo to Britain ... born and bred and he's with Iraqi them out to ... as I said but we couldn't ... he was\nHe said we just couldn't understand what was doing it you said there was still a bit of snow on the ground you could see such a rose or the tone as he looking over towards the uh the the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us it's friend who was doing the poaching in the daytime\nThan the lodge hedge homes and things about he said he just probably eight to ten foot tall or they will sell to turn round to speak to his friend and call the ... thing and he's peripheral vision and then looked and saw it on the left over the head ... he said\nHe thought he was a young halls he meant holes so ... H O the blessing authority whether you'll also just couldn't believe what I was looking out so what we're saying is that this thing was as big as a small town in order you you know your horse\nThey sit in the interesting thing was he ... over the edge and just let him that he said wait expects a horse to lend them move forward because the momentum this thing just learned that I'm Still like a magnet\nYou sudden something not to look at that is it and it was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he said he glad them before you run away they said what he was on all fours\nAnd he said if you still do consider being over seven Fulton looked like a body builder he said you know he said he was a tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of a of a boom\nAnd ... that was and he said he ... he was almost sort of Britain tilling cola you know like a box that dog all the ... areas and\nNot what he ... he says well he said I went to him to the edge off to them to try and get sent stave\nSays to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covert crossing the field and into the world or what quite incredible um you know\nThat's four miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast Kony and if you if you go further down the coast towards hole\nIn the

old legends of dogs with glowing red eyes the ... bay and raven Scott ... they took they took the cops thoughts and you know the story is after they've they've come down the behind the down in time ... there's\nThere's I think those grains of truth in the store is so that was a side thing in the Nineteen seventies and he lived in Britain do all his life and he's never seen it since\nHe's never seen it before that and they'd never seen it after that which is quite incredible if this thing I Believe his story but if this thing was native to that savvy you would think that they'd be more evidence of it so why are we only seeing small glimpses of it called me in a mate\nYeah and that's what you're saying that they pop in and they pop out along the way kind of like\nWhen I did people
