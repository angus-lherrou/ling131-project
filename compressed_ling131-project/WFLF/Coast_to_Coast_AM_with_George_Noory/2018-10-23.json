O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this is much clearer freshwater in most places there is a north\nOf Mel oceans fall I bet\nWell planet why there is in\nThose particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um\n[noise] but yes the waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick sealed to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be breed the bull but\nIf we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs formed within two hundred years\nAnd my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with the Robert what country but\nThe Martians\nOh they're going to do with themselves\nNo when we talk about competition I don't see Russia does really pushing it space program which I mean they want you as soon as I as a and they bring us back\nA rumble set a tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that the federal board but I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well ah here's the thing I'm the revolution\nIn space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question [noise]\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies [noise] my guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy\nUm but Russia [noise]\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a a private space launch companies but allowing space lunch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government\nUm and because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean\nYou know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise] and uh the the uh and so if if if they are going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing\nSell more alive but how can I think if I met her get out their sales email for credit card again usually identity to stay safe secure that sound them my warmth or to go and get your free\nAmerica's first news we're Gordon Deal every day five to six AM news radio Ninety three point one [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to close the goals Robert Zubrin with us we'll get to calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there a blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\n[noise] what [noise] I'd say China right now I'm is about where the U.S was\nAround Nineteen sixty seven uh I mean in terms of manned space flight\nA you know they've been to earth orbit they've I mean there are a bit\nBeyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they did launch a small space station which we did not have them\nAnd do they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon mhm\nUm they can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay it's once again um\nThere's a new paradigm now and then these entrepreneurial space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can do in one third the time at one tenth the cost\nAnd if uh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with\nUnderstanding that they're going to need to have rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so potent wants Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity\nOr if you're going to be a first class power much right now you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean\nYou know a a a reason is a ...\nIn a certain I mean the reason why the um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was [laughter] and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well\nThey're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and\nUm so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to launch a weapon or something like that\nWell I'm a I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons\nOr the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us where you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well the ... states that one weapons okay I mean 'cause what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists\nWell uh the presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I don't think that I mean it's a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just the uh the rich that get to go to Mars well\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um\nAnd also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working ... to go [noise]\nAnd um you know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into [noise] and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of proportions rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds a fake launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know and that rocket is the oxygen and it's not feel [noise]\nIf you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows uh\nThat you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah you know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion door but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um we could I mean the the ultimate would\nBe in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen\nTo your show like\nHey I'm I'm enjoying the show the ... and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm willing to get there if we find someone in your life then we\nYou have the right to invade like the American deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead I'm okay All right well here's the thing um\n[noise] there there is an intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because [noise]\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people\nRight and you can even make an argument that what we did\nTo the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong this he had these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually

while\nHe has a graduate degree in political constantly from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland was research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on\nE. and maps environmental sensitivity and ghostly encounters Brandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the ghost studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy guy shot at a clinical therapist get involved and do studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a very psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so it actually I actually got a job and then I studied psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my home town of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit we won't get into that\n[laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well\nThat's good well let's see they they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when Tony apple was for a year in the at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teamed up their sports why\nSo tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies book but to give us an overview of what you've been doing Brant\n[noise] well you know I I have a degree in psychology at University of Edinburgh I studied um basically environmental sensitivity and go counter um and then when I got back here to this day I got back into the critical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kinda got me going in and I'm interested in writing a book and that's when I came out with the go study\nAnd I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes my encounters oftentimes mainstream macadamia we'll explain\nAnd these things away as to lose the nation's interpretations are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes so individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experiences\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just go stories\nTales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights in the cause of these throwing encounters\nUm it ... the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know and you know these ghosts I've been taking our interests for millions of years\nAnd it's and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspectives on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting firsthand accounts going to anyone he would talk to me about goes down awful conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's when I came up with some of these new theories are and that's when I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thoughts and I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters with\nA book well then you bring a dose of real science to the picture I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is it's out there you just\nGot to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology a physicist a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and I'm entanglement and non locality and\nHow electricity affects us and um and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just\nYou know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWould have you concluded to brag about what the ... experience might be for real big into their imagination what do you think so\nI actually think a\nMajority of the ghost encounters there that are out there I Believe are there is some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to my encounters it's such a complex process and there's so many variables going on um you know there's\nEnvironmental stuff there's um a internal ... electrical stuff going on um but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine\nAnd um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nSo what do you think causes them one of the\nI think there's I'm In my in my view I take them more by side based view on goes\nSo that's um inside is basically um telepathy extra sensory perceptions those types of things I I really think that a lot of goes link counters that happen out there um the base of it\nHas to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em\nAre coming and being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on my main theories in the book go over um what I call a uh tell a path distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's telepathy a is a real or it was a real important part of it goes and count\nHow important than the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghostly encounters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind\nI'm a death\nOr life threatening events or some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happen after that and one of those things is um\nYou know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it and it and that leads to sort of these by energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to\nSend a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and a great classic example of this is the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these this is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there was a an aberration of my aunt and she says\nYou know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you know my aunt\nPassed away right on time that I had that\nAnd I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distressing they'll saying to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity alright and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans May New we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nFox News I'm Joel NATO a man hunters on after a shooting at the University of Utah leaves a woman dead police

no I haven't been scared that budget I had an experience I'm a I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio\nAnd um [noise] oh one morning a new my wife was out of town and I'm One morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and that was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon\nAnd I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratch and they get outside\nSo I'm like yeah well you know my scientific brains going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it\nAnd I'm like you know when I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this\nSo I open the door the dog and me and went outside in the backyard and she's sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating and I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and somehow\nUm you know drowned in there by you know dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter] but I think to myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but\nSomething drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing and I never got that feeling or that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd was there is some sort of like distress signal sense to me with the cat and distress and that kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know but that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen

and experiences of all of our humans are ... stored in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like or your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think these things [noise] I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these\nBereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death um so that's a\nPretty high number eighty percent of the huge no yeah yeah and and perhaps\nThese bereavement operations er visits from the deceased shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way\nThe process emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased\nI couldn't help us move on through crisis or grief or maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards resolution and ... ... and when I talk to those these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one step after these operations\nAnd I think on TV usually ghost or negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive um it can come out of it goes the encounter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life or there is um something to look forward to it's just not all negative and demons and things like that\nAnd what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these guys reparations ... what's so special about\n[noise] that is a that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think\n[noise] you know something narrow biologically is different about them you know when they put 'em there's there's some tests out there specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nThat like human magnets or something or\nYeah yeah exactly you know I ... the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that saying that this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist\nBut there's some some really unique experimental designs that um you know where they're actually doing that from our FM our eyes and eat jeeze\nAnd what they're finding is their their brain is actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity at very low levels so there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more sense that other people and the general population can't you know so and this is true for less than we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that throughout all rise as well so you you know I might get\nPoked with a man and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really that it\nDoesn't hurt at all with those brand and we're going to talk more when we come back ... takes ... getting

Brendan that you don't have the answers you wish you did\n[noise] ah well I'll be honest with you I think ah any type of um ultra guys activity or recurrent spontaneous psycho cases where objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on and those types of cases\nYou know do humans have the ability to move objects if they're\nUm in distress um you know to me it's hard to fathom you have the ability of like where the poetry guys I'm a you know we'll call it goes moving objects when they can physically touch them and things like that I really don't know the answers to that\nUm so you know it it's it's something I always read about that go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nWhy do girls seem to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know [laughter] there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMr Bush or something else to give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours I could not fall asleep when I could not understand why I was very anxious and felt as if something was not right\nWithout warning a soft glowing light appeared next to my bad the light gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband he did not say anything and appear to be just staring at me what was bizarre was that I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious\nThe next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child stating my accent died the night before unexpectedly his death occurred around the same time I saw the image in my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time\nSo this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked about\nEarlier so we've all heard of these but it illustrates the role of fill up with the er ... phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing a tense emotional shift is related to the process of dying in a in a way sent up\nHello Patrick distress message to his ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witness I'm the typical soft glow in the white operation or those types of things um and what's really fascinating is since his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around that time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or pull up to the er ... phenomenon my suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of a in a life threatening situation\nThey send something out into the environment like a message ... if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the life may know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well\nBut this is a great example of a crisis aberration side phenomenon but it also bags that question you know was this did this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment 'cause obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do with this is well\nOh yeah yeah I Know it's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal and um or goes way encounters electricity and it seems to be\nYou know the most prevalent things but the idea is I mean listen we're we all think electricity comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but you know electricity electrical fields comes from humans\nAs well an animal sure does ... you know any involvement of humans also includes the involvement of electricity because like your city is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nFrom people who walked by street lights and the lights go wild as they get on a on a range the lights go back on again\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone is walking around in a way\nUm so it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only confident in all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being present to sort of experience that operation a poetry guy so an eerie feeling a temperature change an uneasiness or whatever\nSo for humans always present electricity electrical fields magnetic field they're always present as well since the first go counter ever\nUm you know ... and that's an important thing to think about it you know we're always immersed in electromagnetic fields we can avoid them you know as as part of earth that's what it is\nYou know any amount of always been linked you know there's some research saying that you know abnormal or fluctuating am apps can actually cause\nA ghostly encounters um you know sort of trick the brain into thinking you're having a ghost encounter on the other side of that\nThere's this idea that you know electromagnetic fields have to do with with ghosts and goes for encounters and you know every TV show and paranormal investigator team uses a EMS meter and that's an important part of the for them indicating that it goes to this president you know for the EMS as moving haphazardly through the house like a person walking the belief\nIs obviously that that that goes a whereas if you have a fluctuating he amassed next to a dishwasher or you can probably say well that's a dishwasher right um so\nYou know energy electricity electromagnetic fields

city a ... [laughter] before you had the experience maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years okay All right I'm while answer your second question then we'll get back to the first question will quit\nI I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know with the husband thing his wife and then the wife kind of said hey check buying the workbench and he finds a pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness\nAnd communication is it happening in other words he's saying get on with the complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because I don't think you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation\nTo resonate with the consciousness of your brother and when you resonate with something not just information at the visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that I'm unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there is one case in my book that I go over a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night\nAnd he had this feeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog and in the water injured\nAnd you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they were kind of reading each other's emotions and then he wakes up cars finds a dog\nThat type of thing so you know why there isn't physical communication or words there is some sort of like\nUnderstanding or your reading of mine's type thing\nWhere do we get the book to do studies for into\nThe study is available at Barnes and noble a it's an Amazon dot com if you like listening to books on radio I'm In the car you can get it at audible as well so basically anywhere you can find a book she can pick up\nFor Brandon thank you love talking to you for didn't belong to Tom damned highs or Liesl lion elect Sloan who would show a lot of short Stephanie Smith Chris moral student but all in Georgia now I'm George Norris somewhere out there on coast to coast am will shoe on our next edition until then be safer [noise]\nBoy there's actual any of the dollar amount that's been floated out there and what they spent\n[noise] right it was twenty seven million and a my colleagues I told 'em in two thousand and having to hand [noise] and that's the you know ...

mid term elections is not going to be as powerful as once believed that said history does not favor the political party of the president during off year elections\nWith a look at three build whether states that could determine control of the Senate here's Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury side Jerry set this up\nAs well so the either for Democrats to win a control the Senate and that the Republicans have only\nFifty one forty nine margin there so it's not a big margin obviously it's the smallest possible but Democrats would still have to defend\nA lot of tough states win those states keep her seat and turn a couple of others in their direction and that is a tall order because I'm a lot of the seats Democrats have to defend ten of in fact are in basically red states that Donald Trump won so they have to hold on there\nAnd find a couple of others that they can turn their way and when you look at that uh the equation that they have to put together\nThat was trying to figure out what is it what are the bellwether states that will tell you whether they can pull this off or not it seems to me there are three of one is Missouri where Claire McCaskill the Democrat is trying to hold on in a state that has grown increasingly read over the last few cycles\nWhere she really did have a problem in how to handle to Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination there was a huge there's a liberal base progressive base in Kansas City in St Louis that was opposed to Kevin I'll want her to oppose it\nWhich she did but also a southern Missouri is very much Trump country so she's trapped in the middle and if she holds on it'll be because ah she's Claire McCaskill kind of an institution Missouri but it's a very tough environment and mess that one out in the ballot speak usually important for the Democrats\nSecond one is Florida where you have a Bill Nelson a Democrat and other democratic incumbent facing Rick Scott the incumbent Republican governor so that's a big time match between two heavyweights [laughter]\nVery very uh ... a heavily funded from both sides and the wild card there all of a sudden is again Michael and does that help Governor Scott because he's seen is leading the rescue effort or does it really hurt him if people think the rescue effort has been sufficient so\nAgain Democrats need hold on to that one if they're going to have a chance and third is an interesting open seat in Arizona where there's a Jeff Flake a Republican retiring repairs on his kind of become the ultimate purple state could go either way in any election\nOr and you have to ... you have two women from Congress Martha McSally on the Republican side of course the cinema on the Democratic side of the woman going at it a whirl Martha McSally running pretty much as a Trump Republican\nAnd Kirsten Sinema running as a kind of a moderate Democrat in a state that can go in and which direction depending on who shows up and if\nDemocrats are going to flip one to get them to their fifty or fifty one vote total one of those probably gonna have to be years on 'em so those seemed like the three to watch if you're trying to figure out how this adds up at the end of the night on November ...\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury Siamese but an online video\nYou bought the three bellwether races that could determine control of the Senate with regards to Missouri in Florida ... it's kind of the late are arriving debatable topics like a Kavanaugh in Missouri and then hurricane Michael in Florida will will those be enough to determine on election outcome\nThat's a great question I it's hard to know is this I'm going to be late breaking events or is it basically the fundamentals and I think in a certainly in in Florida there's a big question about uh you know who turns out is it\nA a suburban voters or is it his panics or is it working class a more conservative voters in the panhandle where where's the turnout going to be and I think in Missouri You have a similar situation in which there is a\nPotentially large voters suburban women for Claire McCaskill but also millennials and minorities those are two groups of voters to simply aren't as reliable uh in terms of just showing up in the mid term election compared to their performance at a presidential election so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast
