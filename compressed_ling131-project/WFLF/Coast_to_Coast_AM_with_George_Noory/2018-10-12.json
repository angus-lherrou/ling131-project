downturn in a recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure and that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and governments the recessions as bad thing\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a super bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half up six to seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently\nFive and ten years that we used to have both parties used to be more centrist not that far apart now they are extreme far apart there's the far right\nIs the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal\nThat's why how he won he picked off the far right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this\nI'm much more difficult if the social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are polarized this cabinet shop thing it was just pure partisan you know the Republicans believed him and the Democrats believed her the men believed him don't women believe ... I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality it was just\nPolitical partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really\nI think that the social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republican and say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and do all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're going to hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war\nOn the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge now I think there's going to be fact I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example of that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd it's hard to argue mid hatred and ... on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always the nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and in the elevator and stuff this it every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell ya I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kinda like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em\nBack too because we're familiar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price [laughter] and and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about the ... the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got ... book is going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover and zero our in our newsletters that Ninety years cycle is the most powerful force\nThe biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution caused the greatest for my and global his\nLaw you know Harry I've had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September a you know there was one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ... meter ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy yeah and if I did or didn't happen it didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell you know what I mean we're we're in the same position we're coming into a truth out sick kinda marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made it finally comment and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump had that surprised when in the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to eleven hundred shift overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so\nThis is a tax cut coming and then all of this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that I'm an we're running out of tricks I mean what can they do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the set it but\nIt's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses anyway is the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not good to when I was just going to last night and\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and they may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so are there were peaking now or it best Trump holes on and\nNoticed after we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble lasting path next the next year but there is there's a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you don't want to get hit by that\nFor forty pursue we know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what could happen when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes yes uh China went down a little bit and China made the biggest one was the only stock market that violated a critical point yesterday it went down some more but came back up to even but it's still pilot but the U.S markets looked like the ... going to open up two to three hundred points tomorrow now that minor compared to fourteen\nHundred points over just the last\n... stay

you predict dumped five years from now\n[noise] [noise] yes you know George or we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know\nThe trouble in the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation where they would predictably spent and when they would stop spending\nSo yes what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight will be over a ... about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst\nAnd and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal boom the difference is George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states has kind of the best house in a bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing with the biggest Boston bubble burst all ready has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent\nIt worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more of their money there so you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah but next but between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three\nIs going to be way more on the downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only\nDifference on George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boomer so large because older people when\nThey die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes and young people at the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course\nThe aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sector so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry ... dot com and that's going to be best place to be the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to pay for everything eighty three two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to to the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate up and a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that so\nYou know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and ah the great depression was followed by World War two\nThe disruption a around the world and makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and then when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with

us or our trade is three times tilted towards them\nThis is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to give him too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so [noise] so I don't know if it's more a trade war but but they're certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise]\nThe the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and then that's what happened to the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk to but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward and all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack ahead of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said

that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHappened in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen to people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nAnd that's

and I don't know I kinda think it will but I I don't know I'm optimistic I'm going to stay on the line because I Know you're going to have questions and I want to get a few lick than because Alan HR twenty three sixty thinks the path\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent account\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and get may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went too far and that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than health care there on her run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans then people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going\nThis bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off his loan so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it the leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nIn two thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in a voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWhat will you know I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\nA permanent quantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks\nWho got us in trouble and did all this leverage and and the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say that but if\nThey sent everybody at twenty ... every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks cause things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people\nInstead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer as only benefitted corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to a check so he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend that rambling them but you\nDon't write if they don't spend it or do they get you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and the have them spend that money to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron and low Harry Good to have you\nKnow hello there George and not Harry of that question you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank because that's where all the leverage has been it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems worse farms\nWere over expanding and borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to express ... money or pull account if they're going to do for the more fluent or towns and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina\nOkay thank you\nAnd I think here I just think that part of one of my question is why I asked\nA direct it might even have one right way ... ... ... fine I'm not I'm In my head and humiliate crumble it kind of combat can line\nYup they play all about timing\nIf all of that tiny one of my gardening looming I'm hearing that you just answered my question like\nAbout the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much um I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits off of a larger\nAccounts and more affluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever's scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that's all right oh deposits are insured they can't insure everything if you have a major clubs but the smaller accounts it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable than in what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounts those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course\nWhen when things go bad people going to hit foreign deposit there's more Iceland went down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller\nTowns domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again I still say\nHave as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account\nWith your stocks or bonds or cash in it they can't they can't\nPledge doses reserves and well that's a good thing Harry thank you were on a time here ...

McGill University now throughout his entire life\nHe has had many close brushes with that as well starting in the womb\nYeah you said a number of paranormal or anomalous experiences visions breed cognitive dreams auto body experiences encounters with message burying operations as well welcome to the program Dr many mate is on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting the the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders of normal first came out many people ask me if the book was based on stories which my patients had told me but my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nA doctor's bound by the Hippocratic Oath which states that are doctors should not repeat anything he's told by his patience and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences pie stories from my readers and for my audiences\nAnd from family and friends and from my own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had so many close calls with that so many rushes to\nDeath [noise] um you know there's been a lot of little tribute and about the near death experience but the um term near death experience you know it's going back to talk to him and moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago I was right\nNow I think he estimated that something like one in thirty Americans that they had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people but there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never were pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I look at how my clothes brushes with death effected me I see that I have some of the things\nAfter effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls this death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found get myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then he and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say it was gradual the first couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of ... the ... you know\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences\nBecause there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeeze\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because that would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous stem cells donated pollen allergen it transplant mhm was more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nOf Israel but I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nAlthough super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said\nYou can't keep giving you a chemotherapy because it's doing tremendous damage to your body\nYeah was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be in the mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy\nUm and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that's why I eventually they gave me the parents find huh [noise] now that the person who gave me the transplant he was an anonymous donor that\nThe rule at the time was that after you when you I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them and I did read him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy [noise]\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow [laughter] so he was flown back into the don't you send in Washington DC and the team\nFrom the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of his themselves and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fine ever since\nThen have you still in touch with him the other happened\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you save your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and it is here altruism you know\nHe said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor to drive and one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is a cheek swab that's it yeah it just it takes time to get the DNA so that's when his name into the donor bang\nAnd then um years later by name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to themselves and that was what was brought back to where I live closer but yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nIn Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic realm as that help or hurt your psyche has your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see a psychiatrist [noise]\nHowever since I had that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between ... experience and what's a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common [noise]\nYou know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel just touched on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common in fact one study\nSo that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post staff contact with a loved one even if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\n[noise] um and in fact you know atheist agnostic have these experiences as well as religious ...\nYou see that everyone is psyche again I I tend to believe you can agree with you\nOK but\nUh when you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the the word say Kate how about a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or pay cognitive beams and other things have talked about such that stations and voices and so on\nDeath that vision is near death experiences so certain types of fake experiences such as ESP and collapse of the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing [noise]\nUm for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh you must be fake it kind of just\nThinking about it right or is that\nVery common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them [noise]\nIt was really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic realm out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nSo interested in philosophy\nShe just always was and there were some things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to this and she's going to study it and she she went into it and the big white [noise]\nWell that's good but I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor these medical center in New York\nWhere they were studying deemed to let the the the ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had centers and receivers\nAnd the receiver it's we're in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to the teeth and um the AG could measure what we call REM sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the average rent dream state the Centers for giving random images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on the images I Try to send them to be with and they found that people were more susceptible to telepathy when they're asleep\nAnd it's also true that people are more susceptible to collect the when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to

normal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize as paranormal phenomenon Mandy let's talk a little bit about the death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely calm and don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh this phone you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice is dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they call them visitors\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that I've been up another subject which is sometimes people receive messages in dreams which aren't the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the mess\nThat's the question like where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious oh we could say it's coming from something they've added or we can say it's coming from the spirit\nWorld you know but some of these methods\nWoman I mentioned who had the dream that you could be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear mhm you know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\n... there was a movie about a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government to leaders to to assassinate them\nAnd you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and there were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\n[noise] well that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know while they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone to have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and that and how how did we know it's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\nMhm [noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um it wasn't a pay cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it\nThat I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up this is the message I got I I just saw these where it said\nThis is a world of illusion and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she'd been that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with ... told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he north ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their promotions do maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should go after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know\nThat said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregard things which could be dismissed that superstition is always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard dry shows was above horse racing and bill yeah one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spin on something else and loss\nAnd Dr seuss in movies screaming in grants you knew you knew you knew that's a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fair I think people are they don't believe that they don't believe in all of a sudden they were afraid of giving into something which appears irrational\n\nDo me a little bit about blind people in a or B and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because\nThere have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery and then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up of able to tell the doctors and nurses are what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies\nIt was one patient who is blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the ... and on his doctor\nPie and of course the doctor was founded there was another case or the blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I Know he was he wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and ... everything that was going on and then when he when he be covered and they couldn't find where she put his statues\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right\nBack but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I find you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wow yeah it works it works yeah\nWhat ... what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component like I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related to the I think it's ... I think it's ... and I think it's spiritual\nI mean there are certain words that are used to describe these experiences these phenomena some people call them ... and people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or miss the cold air mysterious Israel or it's being used to describe the same event\nBut I think paranormal event and have a spiritual component yeah but I'm not saying every parent normally there but some do of course it depends on the Christian having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] [noise] oh definitely I think it improves quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live our teen nine to five eight and a day to day life that is something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\n... when we come back with Dr many

borders of normal as a psychiatrist in you do have to decide whether a person is truly experiencing a psychic issue or is a psychotic how do you tell the difference Manny\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone hearing voices certain qualities that would distinguish the fake from a psychotic experience for example if someone here the voice\nI'm a psychotic ... nation tends to be very very frightening it's also very frequent it could be every day [noise] auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices\nIt could be the sound of machinery and in fact it may be more than one voice too with the voices talking to each other about the ... the voices might be a accusatory or threatening\nWhere I'm psychic aloof nations and to be ... feet when\nThey may occur only once or twice in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and calming the other thing is with psychosis\nYou can't just look at when symptoms such as hearing a voice\nYou have to look at the whole person because say coal is the major mental disorder which affects the person's ability to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work\nOr within the family if they if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other than an aside from the ... for example the thought to ... or paranoid I ... or you know feelings have ...\nThat you played talking about and that type of thing so that it's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nCan you make a misdiagnosis is that conceivable\n[noise] yes in fact it had happened that is a psychologist that did an experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had each one of them go to a different emergency room had different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patients well they weren't\nPatients they were actors pretending to be ... that they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... they're admitted to the war they were given medication they didn't take\nMedication and once they got the word the the patient me that they were faking so they were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to pull the other patients\nPatients knew how did they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal the facts and the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their appearance their behavior the conversation that way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them is completely normal so that's why I say you can make a diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come to the doctors couldn't figure that out\nWell unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes\nWell that's true [laughter] but but the patients didn't\nEffect because well the Asians live with it they they know the on the thought well\nThey know the symptoms and everything that said All right\nLet's take some calls here for you to Judy in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting and waiting to talk to

of a you know that kinda\nGosh you're however uh I had a dream that\nAim to come true uh many years ago and I was in my thirties and a ... and ... says a ... that's disturbing you know our view of space and time\nAh right now it doesn't seem to allow information flow backward in time so I thought I Would make myself an experimental subject and I tried for a year to a record my dream and at first I tried a member of the seven days a portable tape recorders are kind of clunky\nMhm and uh and to record you'd have to hit two buttons I think like record and play at the same time right right\nSo it turns out that was a nightmare like uh getting up at three in the morning and trying to hit the button [noise] so I went back to just writing things down on paper\nAnd of course then the problem is uh getting yourself up out of a dream I figured that method for that that took me some of them were reliable and one night I had a very unusual dream or it doesn't seem unusual and then I decided but what happened later in the ... thing\nAnd that was as a as a I was a situation where I'm sitting with two other people and we're sitting outside it's some kind of a table\nAnd we're enjoying ourselves having like lunch or something and the one person in the mail and I feel very very close to him I'm comfortable with him and then there's a woman and I don't know her\nAnd are at one point the the nail says uh and we're outside I'm kind of a format outside I thought you know couldn't figure out the map but anyway he says a [noise] a very I have to go to the bathroom\nYou know where it is and I said no you know until we were had been drinking a cup of Vermont I said I Do too and so uh yeah let's go look for it and and the dream rafter ... rock side but some kind of structure outside we walk a couple of steps\nAnd then there's another walkway going both ways more cables and then I Would have a couple of them just like many levels and finally I said oh look I'm there to the bathroom got married\nAnd so I'm walking ahead a and and the dream and I get to the door and I pushed to the bathroom door open and there and I'm trying to not be grossed about this but there I see something unusual\nAnd when it was is in men's room have toilets of course we're you know the doors closing and you're in Bloomberg and then they have you're All right someone\nHad in here

the Pacific region at the end of the Asia Japan and a lot of foreign students in my classes and so I said well you know maybe it's a person from another culture if we didn't understand that and you know he thought that was the place to go to the bathroom and you know [noise] okay so I wake up and I think\nWe're about me write that down in some detail I ...

rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is Laura 'cause this to the wall Street Journal Laura where we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\n... four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent rates are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty or fix to us just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher that's a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I'm a I'm a little bit younger I even though I cover this all the time and I know that right to to be cheaper than a it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as an adult I'm seeing rate and a three to four percent range and so even though five percent is actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a ship for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the six percent is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that than\nUm with that said though I think we are observing that the market is a lot more interest rate a sense of it but it has been in the past and I think one of the reasons is what we just touched on that we have younger people who don't remember rates being left high and I think the second is because we saw\nA huge run up and prices when rates were low and I and so I think a buyer they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura are the high rates a negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner has a rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around three point nine but anyway I'll full percentage point at least below where rates are now so\nThere are no the the odd person out there maybe they had their credit score up or something like that but there is almost nobody anymore or was a strong incentive to refinance\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce their asking price\nWe're certainly seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual or if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing\nAbove price growth is slowing and I am definitely sharing especially in front of the more expensive markets um but I went to somebody hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver a New York we're seeing or hearing more and more about price production\nSo what does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI think that you bought a home good for you [laughter] I think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought the biggest jump within and rates in two years\nUm and prices aren't going to go out and are going to reflect that right away prizes are still high um but I Do think for a virus that just got exhausted I'm far from a bidding war as in cash buyers that my real friends say that we've had in the market\nThat has really cold and so I think for buyers who want\nA little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment make sense for them and uh and maybe adjust their prices down or the bad I think it can be a good time to buy\nMust be some tax free than or some payroll reason but there really is and um it's just that companies don't want to\nPay their employees too often because you know what they have to usually they out for their payroll to another company and sometimes that um their contract with that company depends on how many times they have to go through the payroll so\nUm you know if they're doing it all the time they might get charged more\nSo it's really about you know\nHow your company can facilitate payroll but\nTechnically there's no reason why you couldn't get paid every single day\nWe're speaking with market watches Maria Lamont yet Maria how will the gig economy affects how we are paid\nSo it already is actually um you know over and left our two companies that compete with each other very um you know strongly for drivers and so one thing that they've both added is the ability to get paid after every ride 'em they've worked with a company called green dot to do that and square\nUm and so now that those type of ... workers are used to doing that that has kind of shifted into the you know ... regular payments cycles\nUm you know every day workers are now saying we I Know someone that gets paid every day or every ride why can't this happen for me so that conversation has already permeating you know a lot of different companies and is kind of increasing the pressure to pay workers more frequently\nDo you think the rise of the on demand payment company will somehow forced traditional companies to change the way they paid in their cycle\nYeah I think we're already seeing some of that you know obviously the demand will have to come from the workers and it's kind of hard to lobby or company to pay you more frequently I think that would unfortunately be hard to do but I think now that this is part of\nThe national conversation a bit more um companies may start to do that as a benefit for their workers some of these companies are are you know that that allow you to outsource both\nAre presenting it as a benefit there saying you know if you want to keep your workers happy if you want to retain them longer pay them more often so we may see it sort of position that way and it could actually make an impact relatively

ends it retains teachers for days school schedules are starting to spread across the country to nail hubs of the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend now how widespread is the day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we are actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\n[noise] you know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant erode districts [noise] and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTurnout why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend to a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits news story as you were absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it now they're unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or is that while you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know their notice and fewer teacher absence is\nWe're speaking with tunnel hubs or the wall Street Journal now if you were shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing they're at and hours\nAnd you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minute today to Ninety minute today\nIt just depends on where they were at when they started when they when they were all five days if they were already seat in the hours that there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nThat does each state decide its own hours and or days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm\n... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever and there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that\nIt's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at ours has you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know have this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that",
