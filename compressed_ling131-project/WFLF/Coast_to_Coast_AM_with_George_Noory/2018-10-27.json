there's a lot to talk to a an about coming up\nOn coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's\nFan Michael well uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day as good as my son was born in ... a year and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and ours [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked it a bit\nLater on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the elite group\nOf science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know and I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific tell me and she's\nA she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff a ... or packing for Mars and wish she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is very good at it\nYou know she's great and you'd really like her and this is just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you'll pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer in cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball\nConnection with Ted Williams family in ... but I mean yeah I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I tried to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America Tony Tony Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook\nBasically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that as far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that I Walk with me had his head\nA frozen and the ... I Hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories are thought and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that like old school um what I ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then download it on to a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with the four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not that big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're\nIs the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[laughter] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's\nOh ... out for many many years I was pretty much an eight it's in the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started at myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be an\nExport into wisdom and Buddhism and Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life\nAnd she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I like ... or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it and so I became a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my age very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an

reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is ah is is just great it's the end of life is\nYou know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which might be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics\nAnd and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAnd they were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryer and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of\nUh trying to get their hands on some DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes doing I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and there is an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we are in synch ominous traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural flow were to find the natural\nOrder of things and he kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's a nice ... nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I own a margarine is not so great for us right [laughter] but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know\nA ... billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we need to do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back ... quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a juicy or a peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the ... the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the song but he recently applied to the our son was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence [noise]\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robot\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little ... crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYou know ... you write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in\nI mean ... it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just\nDoing computations 'em but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once posts about being very\nGood at about well you know like you they're ... buttoned up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small but\nYou know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the\nDay all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\n[noise] yeah and it and I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the\nEquation is let's use in a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's to say that that that average you know I using it a drop ten points so we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows\nIt might be a lot we might be bringing on her own physical demise faster than right than we would have possibly imagine so\nI like that the cushy mushy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that that you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquer the crazy with that the right now I fully believe that completely and I do and let's pick this up coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like\nTaken a while but you know a lot it's bag

radio Ninety three point one [noise]\n\n\nI Want to move here to leave some time to talk about future of privacy where we rest right now at this frontier of all of this home technology with Michael Guillen in a moment but I I wanted to wrap up\nThe conversation about a up as you talk about them in the book people who are becoming part of something else or use physical\nUm enhanced segments from technology to be able to compensate for\n'em either for injury or for a deformity and there's a couple of those that are very entertaining like the guy with the built in vibrate or in some of the other stuff that's in the book but the part I thought it was really interesting and I just wanted to mention that because\nI I I think they're this idea of the ... skeleton um I Know several people who have a ...\nWho had trouble walking or they lost their ability to walk in spinal injuries and and that this to them as a dream ... just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\nOf I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess\nA but where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's it there's actually\nA movement called the trans human movement where as you said the idea is to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories that the usable a trend human augmentation there so there is usable wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I ... this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power line when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms to the vet them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd and now scientists are creating for him what are called neural off the prostheses\nSay these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we are mechanical\nThat requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you know these are these are arms\nThat he can move with his car so they're they're wired to\nMind that I mean isn't fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I I agree with you and even even in\nEven in a military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it get it ... it you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell going to take some of that load off of their own yell at them but I think that uh\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we could come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that decades weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about\nMaybe some of our advancements should not be consequences free is that I think that that I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me that I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then it never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and uh you know we're talking about enhancing to fold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we spare\nCould possibly go run there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know\nAnd and now and and the coalition a group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff soon uh using their own that is just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human\nLike brain the question then becomes do you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words do give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in we're going to be now and another escalating arms race right\nYeah ... ... in some ways you know ... that I often I often think to myself you know\nAll this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we can't are just still the same you know all our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose\nTo you maybe the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor conundrum\nIs not the Terminator conundrum but to Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism you know\nYou know I mean that that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending ... Terminator but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to\nYou know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going or\nAt his weaknesses but but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story\nAbout the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old head on a new body\nRight yeah yeah okay well we had transplants yeah yeah\nSo let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those\nHalloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now there's this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] [noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to sew up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on that we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our cut a country I just had an op ed that it'll be published very shortly\nI'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so saying that um the Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nHer videos that kind of a that you're ... or your dishwasher everything that's going to do\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now are more than eight billion\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book and the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to ... to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show key thing\nIn whether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was raining one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife in the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\nHang onto the thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join in the ministry\nThe end of life as we know it might go deal in next on coast to coast am in for George ...\n[noise] wait is news adequate to talk about our news radio Ninety three point one WFL Ari\nAustin in LA are tied to two and the bottom of the fifteenth the game already passed a six hour mark the suspected package bombers behind bars about FBI Director Christopher Wray says that does not mean\nDoesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages and trains is now\nIf the IRS fifty six year old essays are say on a Florida who's attorney says is mentally ill\nHe doesn't seem to recognize reality he lives in a fantasy world\nAttorney Ron lonely say outcasts linked the criminal history including a two thousand to charge of bomb making and forecasters say a nor'easter will hit the mid Atlantic states this weekend bringing heavy rains\nAnd strong when from New Jersey to Massachusetts\nJust sell out wall that's all\n[noise] you're just\n\nLong while\nPremier ... ...

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [laughter]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed a one story and the police looked into it and his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat they police found was that the woman was wearing a face woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd and I think that there's and there's a lot of education I remember and I'm sure you're you're older than me are the same age as as I Am as as I remember being told by an aunt of mine that a a a cousin that was being born into family wouldn't have a soul because she was a test tube babies\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make him they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where great science writing and science journalism in a book like this is really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated\nThese issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself but anyway [laughter] and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense\nRight and you write up\nAfter you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because\nBy that time so the beds and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into our DNA that when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense then ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about is how big the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah yeah I'll give it a little plug for an up and down there I think the question you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a ... fine it says that they will pray that they would die\nAnd they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this period that you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether it's immortality would be a blessing or a curse a ... you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray a ... what's your thought on that Michael\n[noise] well it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse or some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating er and and so I I'd I'd love to think for about this reference to revelation [noise]\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of ...\nOf a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot of it we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it\nIn the form of a big computer server and the in the body of a among careless or a kind of a robot human like robot but get so complex and soul\nYawn ... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it you know it's like that guy net running it's like running on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the word from saying or from the crush souls of the people that stumped son on it you know getting ... getting itself coffee yeah I get that I think that happens\nWith some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a kid more elite dishwasher six so there's exactly those exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible and the the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject\nOf immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast saying David\nGoing hey my question for example and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\n\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing me because it sounds like a really good\nQuestion [laughter] yeah they do we just lose him\nAnd we just left\nA oh no Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him while we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nI enjoy your show but uh [noise] I've been I kicking machine going on forty five years yes er here and I was a banker do generation had like you know from your guest or where do you feel that the shoe will\nBe overcome through CRISPR or a maybe a journey either by pigs I'll take my answer off the air\nAnd hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine as\nHe's on dialysis is on kidney machines and he has macular degeneration\nIs like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful um they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman\nWho had the operation and you know even though her fight it's still not crystal clear she can she can make out fate and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're\nMaking enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are is already working on a second generation\nA that will help actually restore\nSight and people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these by merit a there's a lot of great research and I've reported on on for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using\nStem cell or ... it might\nCreate a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you

go to open lines I just want to play the story I Hope you went to coast to coast am dot com and watched this video of the Oregon pot shops and the moving jar if you didn't here's the story on coast to coast am wrote in\nDowntown Oregon City there are there to at least that's the theory\nBehind paranormal activity witness that fine zero treat a can of its dispensary what's going to happen now\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that Andy going that's next to it\nEither what's happening and I felt like somebody was standing there are like somebody with like right here\nSuddenly the jar bombs on the level surface that just happened then Andy remembered the surveillance camera with all the jar\nNot long after that this happened watched the Penn it's completely skill and no one's around when certainly depends begin to move\nAnd if you think the video has been dumped her as a candidate shop that would be against the law ... certified video GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with you as a form\nOf ... to bring me up to and so so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there is no real explanation for why there are gone there\nBut that video ... especially the and the fact that we were really got me was because it's a candidate shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it you want to jump in on open lines of ... let me go to a Mike in Charlotte North Carolina coast to coast to get us started Mike\nGood morning hours\n[laughter] we're good thank you [laughter]\nWell Halloween all out of the night run with children\n[laughter] yes well anyway I Am right now not enough runs in the Los Angeles because it's not going to be a good to be in the Eighteenth inning for the game the squirrels series or the question of being whether this show ends before that game and where do you want to take off\nOh about ... oh sure\n\nResponding to truly talked about a floating there's not a super bitter or ... forever blah blah blah and one problem\nDownload memories download voices could download mannerisms can download actions match by robots now but it won't be Larry gang because you\nCan't show [laughter] so they are some of the feelings and the personality of the you know\nI I'm with you in your it I mean we're the incident in\nThe Bible says the dead are aware of nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but I I I it's impossible because we are not God that was all I have to say\nOh it's fair enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated\nSo a lot of people would say that and it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were like we did have a soul if other people out there have you know\nUh other meant if there are other people who have uh the problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease you know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human than they have less of a soul [noise]\nUm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology young soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about\nJust two babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi I'm I or world power guys first of all for not let in for five years I don't want to get too much into it right\nAfter ... ... and I I have a couple of things to say on this whole and mark how are the blacks were hurt and I'm a reader either manner awarded a habit of things he ... that were to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and I said environment now and furthermore\nIt our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first survival situation and there are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know compiling compiling surprise for\nThree years to come for for them is\nFormer rooms with multiple wives with multiple showed her with multiple multiple and um\nAnd we don't really we are not really part it whether or not we are usable Harlem and\nWe don't know even with training we do know is me supplies what's this phone somebody who was in a cave\nOr in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt your on your way to I'm falling scare myself not to\nA consumer companies suppliers but just chew on my cell and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer a myself to give her trial like for a year on one of\nThe supplies without training without any knowledge of how to use the supplies to just hear somebody could even\nHis fans and sell an interesting you don't really know even with things like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know it's going to survive it could be a child it could be a twelve year old kid\nWho hasn't had any training on how the year the supplies that are stored up with colds or or whatever um\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I ... I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are\nA latter day saints and so I just would be a clear\nFor people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do but to her point I was watching on Netflix or there's this series called like the men with three wives your three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade\nA Mormon sec community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife and the following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab\nAnd um and they they they've already talked about saving up than having enough food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and what it even work Kennedy even work I don't know\nA ... but uh yeah so Aaron's willing to be a volunteer but um I think the only thing I ever get to bring your kid a\nDone is in a in Kent, Ohio I knew well on coast to coast am done\nRather a I'm happy to have a you\nKnow I got a kick out of your commercial market goes in the pawn shop in the court that was their name was Andy Gomez remember Gomez the monsters\nYeah sure loved them as one of them is ...

is\nWeren't looking shall we are looking ... what else is going to happen that we're missing we're missing all this has gone on purpose were missing something what is your opinion on that\n[noise] well it's an interesting claim it that the the the marches on purpose or coordinated toward us I mean I I I think that you'll always see migrations in the long history just bring up the Bible again it is\nIs that we're all immigrants right the Bible says that we we all move 'em and that would be you know all of the stories you a lot of the stories we're both from people just trying to get food just trying to move to get food and begging people to allow them to live in in space has food\nSo I kind of see that as a perpetual thing not something new but you know I I it is or is there or if it that's the smoke screen than what's behind it I guess we're supposed to wonder about or are you suggesting that something is going to come from the north um while we're so busy\nLooking south and east is that was that part of your implication\nInsurance that kind of my question I mean all this was happening at one show there's something else going to happen that we're missing and all the media is

didn't really listen to you for\nSo long I I started out listening to art bell and I've tried to call in a couple of hundred times this first time I've gotten three this is such a great privilege it if I can and I would like to share something a ... about the Bible a\nAnd there's a great truth that we need to realize in any discipline a\nIf any discipline that you study whether it be science or whether it be ah the Bible for instance\nUh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a big drink and the and the Bible is something to be studied\nPondered over all three of the Monell the estate religions from the middle east began their roots with the Bible and polluting the Korean the Korean has the birds and the Old Testament and\n... and the new ... and the New Testament to the current New Testament yeah I mean the\nStory the story of the prophet Jesus and the current is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and ... even the story of the floods the story of Jesus in the car and all of that validates not counting the historical\nValues a historical cruise you know that that line up with a so many of the stores in the Bible a mini the many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because\nA historical value of the book of Daniel is so accurate\nAnd ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for Daniel to know as much of the future as young as he did\nBut that that Cruz when you look at the courage there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the the Old Testament and the New Testament this has done so much for humanity you know\nOh I agree we yeah we we stray\nAway from that and people and and people like to take two or three versus\nAn edge a whole right the terrible whole book or you know and they'll\nUs called in and you know it's called proved texting and it's a yeah it's\nThere's a there's an old saying I said it before it goes to goes but as soon as the first in St learned in seminary was that some people\nUm some people rely on a an scripture\nI'm like a drunk leans on a lamp post not so much for illumination but for support\nAnd I think it's the illumination part that I always go for another support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just sounds like you're a learned guy but\nI did a I'm a I was writing I wrote an article about a ... about the true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories\nAre told and I was interested in how many troops um how many murder stories there are in the Bible\nAnd that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that it starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what these murder stories still do\nWhat I found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder\nWith regard to Jesus they where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the ... of the Bible in the New Testament the Greek word says kill but actually the word that's often used\nUh the Arabic word is that Jesus was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it and he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot when we think about it\nIn a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out yet I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I said this do you think that corporate Christianity\nHas a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to build\nA legacies de do you think that that has hurt us and gotten a so why are you are from the central message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime there's always the ... been the big difference of shooting a bullet in the name of God or taking a bullet in the name of God and I'm I'm In the taking the bullet camp [laughter]\nI'll take the bullet and protecting somebody else I'm a ... you know people go a long way far out of their way to create these\nStructures were there shooting people killing other people in the name of God and I uh that's where I draw the line we enjoyed the conversation the ... and you got a great town oh let's get back to work too but um last time I was in a Bowling Green
