states\nIf it works on that level then why would it work if something is it's common to all of us are money\nFor our we've never tried it put it that way and well I shouldn't say that either because in monetary history uh we did Abraham Lincoln issued the first green backs\nA James Garfield or by William McKinley put his back on the gold standard heck even John Kennedy uh changed the monetary system by the issue of United States votes in Nineteen sixty three so there have been presidents who have tried to modify the way that our system works\nAnd they've not had very good luck if you look at what those four presidents have in common I I don't think I Would want to be the fifth fourth\nIn I I sometimes like in the do the Teddy Roosevelt and you know he came in with the big boom and a sure he he was a people live compared him to sort of a grand a lion\nAnd he room in the territory but never violated the presidential uh laws but it's the government has grown so big\nIt it doesn't stop on a dime and you can't turn it on a dime and is that people don't understand how difficult it is\nTo get movement out of our government\nYou're so right on that and and the one place that we all expect the government to to do its job is in monetary policy now our founders were so very specific\nAbout what a dollar ... it in fact article one of the constitution says quote no state show make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender and payment of debt and that was so that we wouldn't know what the standard was when the Congress was charged with\nSetting what that standard is so they decided back then okay a dollar is point seven seven three four ounces of silver or\nOne twenty of of an ounce of gold so you knew what the standard was imagine going to buy a gallon of gas and not knowing what a gallon a short one store could undercut the other by making a gallon a little smaller and so forth\nSo this is a real problem we don't know what a dollar is but yet we're expected to save them at their contracts for them\nThis is a law ... dramatic flaw in the system you enter into a contract today to pay ten thousand dollars over the next ten years\nAnd by the time you get to the end of ten years of dollars value or rich substance standard has changed so dramatically that you you can't even recognize the first hour that you borrowed\nThis is a very very\n... is absolutely the most important critical relevant to your state's monetary system what is a dollar if we don't know what it is as our founders intended us to know that it's impossible to responsibly contract for future obligations we need to fix that right away\nI Know I've advocated for Thirty years let's go back to the gold standard or a silver standard\nI doubt that we can get there from here as we say in New York but you can do it slowly and I think that the President Trump's policies are a step in that direction\nAndy we've got about a half a minute here again gives them the Web address the phone

I. D.\nUh but the only case that he mentions taken the trial if you've read very closely as the thirty nine and dealt with a so he didn't really have a sufficient background\nBut it's so then what are you saying because of color\nWhile I don't know I don't really don't know why I was brought it not not before those seven years I don't know what his background is he says that he had prosecuted quite a few homicide cases and uh uh he may be telling the truth I don't know about that and he may have been successful but I can tell you that\nWhen he told the jury I been prosecuting bad cops for seven years he was not telling the truth was investigating bad cops for seven years but not prosecuting them\nMugging image was lousy or as I watched the trial I fully expect to garden at any moment to go jumping across the room and slug somebody\n[laughter] and and and that is what it looked like he he did have a chip punish false hope so [laughter]\nThat that that's pretty colorful away articulated there aren't\nLet me give you one one just unbelievable example of of of incompetence of between the two prosecutors surveys and it just it just illustrates a ... and again the book is three hundred and fifty six pages of this but this type of thing you're aware of the ... the van at her uh bringing the vile blood back to Iraq and have you're aware of that whole that whole issue\nOh yeah okay um let me just briefly tell you why why he did it normally you collect blood from a suspect in a homicide cases a couple of days later a week later a month later sometimes even a couple of years later 'cause there's no statute of limitations for the crime and murder [noise]\nUm uh so it's it's it's not within hours after the murders as was the case here now the the the the defense argued that he should have booked that vial of blood immediately ... and he could have done that however\nNormally you do not get a D our number which you need to book items of evidence until the the uh the evidence at the crime scene has been collected by the criminalist for someone to the search warrant here that hadn't been done yet\nOn a phone was still at Rockingham first he has been a Bundy collecting evidence and evidence is booked sequence Chile or by number so at the book that while\nIt would've been item number one but what the reason they didn't do that is he had no way of knowing what number of phone was given to the items of evidence that he was collecting Bundy and Rockingham it would have messed up the whole numbering system\nFeels I would've made the argument that you'd carried it around and head opportunity a impossible yeah right\nAh but yes but it's also it was in advisable but I mean how could he ever dream that people like Shaq and Cochran or out they're accusing him of framing\nSomeone for murder I mean here's a guy twenty eight years on the forests not one citizen complaint against them in twenty eight years he's about to retire in a few months with his wife Rita to his farm in Indiana and he's going to frame OJ Simpson it's mind boggling\nYou free you plant evidence in a capital case in California and testify falls that you can get the death penalty yourself under one twenty eight of the California penal code the prosecutors never even made that argument and in in any event\nFong had already given item number one to the spot of blood above the door handle and uh so so I'm a batter brings the bio blood back the fog and any detective will tell you that when they turn over items of evidence to the to the criminal is in their mind\nThat's the equivalent of booking not I just I'm giving you the background as to why he brought it back here why bought it back to Rockingham survived torture him on the day after the murders but here's the point that I Want to get into\nThe defense argument of police frame up and conspiracy and all that at the heart of that very argument was banned that are bringing the vile blood back in what they claimed his advantage matter in his evil co conspirators to blood out of that violin planted that ... had Rockingham and Bundy was a major major major issue with the trial\nPost trial post trial\nSeveral the juror said that it was the most suspicious thing that the LAPD did during the tire case okay now there were several arguments that the prosecution could have made to knock down this core defense argument about Ben and bringing them all but back to Rockingham I mentioned several in the book I'll just give you two very brief ones right here\nIf he was going to bring a vial of blood back the Rockingham obviously he put it in his suit pocket he wouldn't put it in a large ... thereby advertising to every one that he was bringing something onto the premise is that just common sense on number two number two\nThat are already knew that hundreds upon hundreds of reporters and other members of the media had already congregated at Rockingham an Bundy\nTheir cameras blanketing the premises picking up for the evening news all the movements of everyone on the state there are helicopters up above filming everything down below obviously planting would have been absolutely impossible there are many many other arguments now what if I told you what if I told you listen to this because it's unbelievable there's no other additive than\nIn the eight hours of summation that these two prosecutors gave neither Clark nor Darden said one single word to try to knock down this court defense argument about ban that are bringing the vial of blood back to Rockingham they never once even touched on the issue\nI check the transcript three times I had my wife check is unbelievable I said there's got to be some attempt to knock this down because it goes to the heart of the defense case\nAren't when you get to the point when you don't have an open up your mouth and under one single solitary word on an absolutely critical issue the question is how does it get any worse we're not talking incompetence here we're talking beyond incompetent if you didn't show up for work hard I wouldn't say that you were incompetent incompetence of showing up for work\nDoing a bad job right well we didn't even arguing it but they're not showing up for what about\nThe angle that a a ride Bennett are carried it out in the world but a lot of people's on well ferman socked away a little bit of it remember the sock business and took it over and planted it that's what a what\nI saw the glove they the glove they All right you know there were four teen uniformed officers that arrived at the Bundy murder scene before fun before affirmative ferment arrived rapid two o'clock and it's right at these these murders happened around a oath whether there's a disc right there there's a\nDivision of all you know but but somewhere\nSomewhere between ten Fifteen and ten thirty five PM in the evening of during the twelve correct for the first officer arrives right after midnight okay they're Eighteen uniformed officers that arrived there before for him and all of them saw only one glove so there was no second glove there\nFor for him and to pick up\nAnd deposit at Rockingham even if you wanted to even if you want it to frame Simpson by planning to go out there was no second glove there\nUnless Eighteen officers would have been willing to take the stand and commit perjury for ferman now\nMind you Eighteen officers say they all they all made the statement at ... in in front of a a a internal affairs but what about Clark only called two out of the team to the witness stand instead of calling you have a sixteen she had the other sixty and there she knew their names\nShe didn't bother calling all Eighteen the more you call that stand the greater the likelihood that all Eighteen or going to commit perjury in a capital case\nJust to help someone most of whom they didn't even know from\nYou is your smart speaker and tell them Google Home the plain news radio Ninety three point one WFL I

Institute in Virginia and William sounds as they set aside he and he guide you\nThrough these incredible states as consciousness and I personally know that they exist from my experience in love to hear more from William welcome to the shadow\nThanks for joining me William\nHi how are you feeling good side he'll\nTell me first of all what led you to even create such as this tendency I out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own ah I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer in this would be impossible but\nI had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was a message to self initiate and out of body experience so\nI explored um and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily\nExercise um I initiated my first\nFully conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your family who had actually the your entire life or the whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience which sounds ... it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise uh that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nAnd was this before or after you became a hit list\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help to negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your oh B. E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know it was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realized that was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached the arm out oh no I was nonsensical\nI I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examined my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this and my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment with a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here\nAnd ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nWe've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional what I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical\nThe world is just the innocence ... than at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of ... and yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I only seeing you know is incredible as our our world is and\nYou know this incredible globe that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and it's all in the tens information Disney in ... why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once\nYou have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms yeah out all human\nAnd has to be it wouldn't just be one that they don't want to do anything\nNo of course not ... it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and you know they're real because actually they heal meal you aren't you blame them because they're usually not a language to really clearly defined what another mention is\nUniversal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died or I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words\nLanguage is no longer a barrier we we communicate directly by soft ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits so this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere is no um when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say\nTo go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow you're listening you teach at them and really tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called in after all tourism many [laughter] she's it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body [noise]\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great in Virginia only\nTwenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop\nI'm generally what I each person is in check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese acronyms and um what is that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in personal isolation both\nAnd I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber and then I present Emmy sank which is a ... a ... brain synchronization kind of technology plus guided meditation\nMm mhm so to assist in crossing over have you ever done this after\nA [noise] a\nTragic incident national tragic incident where ... one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact ah during that period of time um that was a that was one of their events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way badge and you're having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body it's called ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to wrap our minds around that so there was a lot of people that we're shifting those are\nPeople that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and it it's it's functions in different names and in different cultures\nBut nothing that I went to ... we we presented in I\nThink I'm more or let's just say are very grounded in a scientific waves at least a scientific as we can\nDo that goes for all the training here that it's a it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allow the person to have their own experience but then all of that I Want to find out a little bit more about one of the culture or does this and what it\nCalls and other cultures are going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about what other countries just exist and and also a little bit more on how you can get it on your own and it was like that but my guess William bum and I am an argument and in the country to country and\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to go to ... dot com\nAllowing\nOnly won them a\nOn on the plane ... one do you and how\nSeventy one Seventy nine ... from Monday Sunday Sunday storm I eighty Seventeen Ninety One nice weather and traffic every ... minutes in the morning I'm Danielle Middle East radio Ninety three one several un\nI'm like the opposite of the devastation from hurricane Michael Steele being assessed\nYou have to search and rescue teams that have been out in the debris field what they're looking for is any kind of avoid space where a person could be trapped they've had the dogs out there as well or they're trying to account for raw or what could be between fifty and one hundred people who have gone missing a since the storm\nBoxes my job and recovery efforts continuing in Virginia Georgia and Mexico Beach Florida a veteran D.C lawyer expected to be the next White House counsel our sources\nFamiliar with the decision tell her own John Roberts that President Trump has chosen bats simple Loni to fill that important role in that the president left the White House this afternoon he didn't confirmed the pick but he certainly did have some high praise for civil owning\nIf chosen civil only would replace current White House counsel Don McGahn list is Fox News\n\n\n\n\n\n... now here's your guest does lead cigar\nWelcome back to ... am I what does it you know then I also have a shell and the same network that George ...\nIs on on the guy in network if you love watching him on beyond belief you can watch my show that it is called inspirations on guy at least take our and itching check that out inspirations on guy allergies T.

wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis well\nThat's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWill keep you safe that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think you know people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience or as science has on top of that so\nMany people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and there are no I'm all over or their vibrating or they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be\nA prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them in our signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now sees when you are when people aren't going to be travels the experience he mapped the brain or you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research a matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh there's there's quite a bit of research being done\nOn different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror\nAnd every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're they're but they're mad their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to it\nShit obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly\nOut of remote view more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are talked for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the mind near\nA mind mirror it's just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved\nAnd again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to\n[noise] but that that that's\nOne of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people how to have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most of it my\nMain goal is to teach people how to have a profound a spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking\nAnd walking through a wall and talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect

Bonnie travel and he's been doing twenty five years of research at the mineral Institute sedative or sixteen thousand participants who have gone through the OB e training at bin ... Institute in Virginia\nAnd he's come up with a common reported phenomenon associated with the the ease mom it's funny if you could explain this to our audience [noise]\n[noise] yes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe\nInstitute for the last eight years oh okay but I've been studying this and\nPracticing for forty a ... just to go on my website ... dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did a\nA number of surveys and our receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it ... it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance um [noise] a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring fountains as a as a prelude normally\nTo the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet\nBut there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis I'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent\nHearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent [noise] this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone and that is seen through ... through\nYour clothes diluted at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body because\nYou're having it doesn't mean you actually did your body but it means you're in the process but most people don't notice because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things for instance probably the most common adjust the jerk awake you feel like you're just you're taking a nap\nUp and suddenly you just jerk back into your body right is\nI find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nSo that that's the dance on because then half each I'm retired I Will switch and I think his muscles ... are you saying that now the money you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have\nFound and what many other um experiences I've seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take for granted no one you know there is no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a sleep and you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nLook ... image or looking at it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you want an animal sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nOr they're moving their legs and the dream began or\nThey may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences are is natural was breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... its temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years Ninety years\nDidn't ... machine and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay and most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death\nActually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this when you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into and it will be and that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how did you hear me now an imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay and you can have multiple experiences\nFor instance I had I began to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies and I was still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master\nWe're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar but then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification\nAnd I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when a often will get\nInformation given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in experiential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOh what's going on\nAnd I think this is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated ... anyone other than yourself\nRight and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAnd very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything left backed up specialty of religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nA ... it had been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you after you experience it menu sudden oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report to you

back to coast to coast am Ryan Lee cigar and my guest William Bowman is joining me his website again is astral info dot org now uh we have great color come in with Amy may cause\nSure and has to let's go to Jamie in Washington state first time caller here and coast to coast and Jamie what is your question\nHuh how's it going great what is your question my friend\nI'm curious if there's any a relative in between the buddy ... says in a memory loss\nGood question the question I mean not remembering the experience or memory loss and general\nIt was just like you see it on the TV shows where they ah\nStart cutting your pants off of you and the whole nine yards and what I was gonna say though is uh oh I was scared to death are are are truly was and\nBut right there at the end it was like a a breath of fresh air came on me and I wasn't worried about anything anymore\nMm that sounds he so tense peaceful and is is\nWhat it was exactly these all\nHave you been able to recreate that experience I'm not a heart attack that feeling that experience and [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nNo I Wish I Would actually be great\nWell maybe that's maybe you can blame could he\nAbsolutely one of the things that people do report\nWhen they have and out of body experience um\nIs that they have this immense feeling of a love and peace and for that just flows through them ... ah I've talked about this many times um it's like you're entering into a some people reported\nLike their entry into a sea of of love and I'm an acceptance and it's and it's like it's difficult to even the there is no words to even describe some of these things\nBecause they're beyond our um our verbiage but yes I mean that's one of the reasons that people do have a explore these experiences so they can ah let's just say connect with those higher aspects of themselves\n... now and thank you very much some clients he said it ... I mean has there ever been reporting of that and not a good experience similar to be is that you can't it's not right\nYou know it's like there has been an end to ease and nightmares in ... in your fear\nBased if you've been brought up with this concept that there's a double a or a Satan around every corner waiting for you to pounce on you you're going to have you made likely have negative experience your own fear will create it\nWhen we leave our bodies were entering into a very thought responsive dimensional space\nAnd that's what people forget it and I I I say this all the time you know we're not observers of non physical reality we're participants\nEach thought is a creative projection and we are influencing the energies around us we do it in the physical but slowed down here but when you leave your body through near death experiences\nSame applies to um if you're doing ... San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you do see experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative energy it's you are going to create it when your mind is going to mold the reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever\nThen you're going to manifest that is well well you are creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience\nSome people don't like to hear this but that's it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was just a dream I guess I don't remember but he could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got in the recycling took on their helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that I'm\nBrian ... owns a motorcycle and\nIt was and he woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a projection of anything and it was benign and with no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nWhich looks pretty bleak to be honest and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because I was scared to each other yeah\nI'd I don't know is that an adult law out of body travel most likely mhm well it could have been but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there's consensus what I call consensus realities and there was non consensus realities there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist and\nIn our multi dimensional universe\nAnd that's why it's important for us to look at them learn these what is essentially the rules of non physical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here we're used to linear time right it's the gravity we're used to\n... you know when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity\nAll the things we're used to have to ... you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm In my workshops but it's also in my books but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of the are continuing existence\nYes so that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they want to thank you so much Williams has been great if you go to his website which is ... info dot org you'll find out about all of this book and his courses in classes and there's lots of free information there as well\nAnd when we come back we're going to talk about Colorado and the great history forgotten tales that's Colorado's Sylvie back I mean you're listening to cook and\nYou're good morning or let him do search don't monitor you more news radio Ninety three boy one [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am so my guess today her website is called managed to legends dot com and I love the beginning of it it does [laughter] welcome to the blue moon haunted history chores Ruben probably scaring the public's in two thousand two Stephanie waters is my guest welcome Stephanie\nLisa I'm Glad to be here and I love that proceeding commercial about paying because\nMy gold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan I'm going to scare the ... out of every it's lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial saying can you really they pee on an erosion is is that there's any way to go to the\nFunny yeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nOn so will you send me your book and we do are you constantly in Colorado doing our guys shows and I thought it was so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's really unassuming you can find\nThings like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience\nWhere we are normal\nWell this is this oh I've been seeing go since I was the ... high to a grasshopper is what I always say I'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding\nAnd after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago it was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and the unite the paranormal can you ... community and to also do some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend or a spins\nAnd she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirits out of Longmont, Colorado mhm and so\nThe two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community now we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and uh we've we call it a ... feast because every year\nWe try to sponsor it in a different community and by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history\nSo even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go on and the night supposedly this stuff really happened and I got particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nBut he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them\nTo see if it was possible that these things really happened and so that what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to ship for publishing LCD they actually published my last book\nGoes legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through ship ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through you're going to die of cancer and how you how you reconnected your life which goes what were you doing before then\nWell before that\nLike I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child what do you mean seeing it you you know I see it and I actually feel it\nI mean like humans to my examples that\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things [noise] um I'm an impasse\nI think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't protect that into\nThe future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was that and we went back in there it was so\nI'm able to do things like that um\nBut I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nAnd managed to Springs Colorado and he was taunted and so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists\nAnd I open my\nBig huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nHe'd you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted that I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is the way through I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought\nAn old haunted mansion sight unseen I Swear\nThey because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas 'cause she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything that we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast that for selling a view that you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done in the arts\n... I just loved it and um when we bought it it\nWas really rundown [laughter] extremely\nRun down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us\nThat they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for and we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house in five years\nAfter five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house ... what have you well after us and you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and an artist you know and it's\nVery severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going roe [laughter]\nSo I actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this is before she died and then he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about that just do what you want\nAnd I said All right thank you very much so I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest estate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like that while I hired twenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you drinking fallout blew\nEverything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till the ghost of surely\nActually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nFascinated with manatees springs especially\nBecause we had some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter of the ... springs on the beautiful hiking trails that we had in my house is shaking my head and never find true north I kid you not the the Indian American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in these places the trees actually grow kind of fight way I'm just curious but the hair on my back on my arms and my neck will go up and he um you can feel it um and the other thing that curious about it is that because these magnetic anomalies\nUm Nicholas ... actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the clubhouse hotel and he was watching as the bird um we're just\nGoing over managing spring it was like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense they're ready to find their way true north or south was gone and you know they have to have a little piece of ... type crystal and their brain and it ... the he was saying he must be leading that maybe\nBecause of these magnetic anomalies the Brits were hunting confused\nBecause they were actually behaving in a very strange\nManner by like diving into buildings and and like ... how the pilot [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing Springs Colorado when we come back with my guest Stephanie waters I Am Lisa guardian listening to coast to coast am\n\n\nWhere\nAnd\nAmerican British

[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast and my guest is Stephanie waters and she is not only a professional storage or as we can tell but she's also the owner of the blue moon hunted histories tours in Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you when we were just talking about men or two springs and how has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're ... in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nYeah um\nThink another reason why I'm that people\nWere drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pact between them that they would not\nFight them and they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nSo the manager confirmed that\nSnow yes all of this worked up beautifully [laughter] than eating\nNow had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was\nAmazing during the time before book yes\nOh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand six team\nBecause this theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball\nIn this book was reaching out for at least trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their story\nThat yes you seem to be the you know like the public is for the east coast today [laughter]\nYou have made it is it's meant to be one you have no way really connecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live ... ...\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's haunted by the ghost but like all the little girl that bounces all isn't she do I'm like no leave in ... but listen friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere's no devious funds spirited\nNo no that's not if they are they're just kicking you studying you trick here they are in prison here\nBy their own their own their own mind that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during my time so yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the ... and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely a big believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not is you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes that come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning but I find the best time\nTo actually look for those of you wants to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nThe transition time\nWhy it's the it's because of the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter it lends itself\nTo the shadows does that make sense\nYes it does it make straps when you see the shadow people and the light changes very fast right now and it\nOnly I call it the God light it only last about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks in the end of the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is a place that you're living in now haunted or did you met with non on ... and the gas the ghost follow you\nRight yes they do online to or it's it's very funny the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten [laughter]\nJust getting\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and managed to err on time because whenever I Would walk in her name's bites they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know it'd be certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you've walked underneath them and I said [laughter]\nYeah that's true [laughter] so they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights will flash this this town is very haunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and I went there once a month and doing doing\nThat my show in the if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYou too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happened to some people at the end of the life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd and the uh did you notice that would happen to
