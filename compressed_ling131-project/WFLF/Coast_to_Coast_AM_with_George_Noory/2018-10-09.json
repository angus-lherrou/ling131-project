talk about this high technology artificial intelligence survivor and Reese with us his book the force age if I were in the long mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence is it that bad\nA well I I see that\nYou don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's we don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine and your mind as a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my part cost about a I I I find maybe one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nBit there may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine\nWould do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a rocket blow up because a single one was a transposed with a\n... opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um you can have\nAn airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people think you've got the co pilot right there you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer fly all the airplanes in it a quote has a heart attack look I bet\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one better they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the grows in the ... and just really the incredible growth on this kind of technology\nYou mean is it the humane\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that was very interesting reason which was\nNew and you know three laws of planetary motion the laws of magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took a nap for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up his face up to space up to space it's delivering the goods it it can it if you out of business it can make probably any department in your business and ten percent cost ten percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some really cool things if there were no more advances and I ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is uh they they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nA it's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is a kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary a A R if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said um there's a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a petite ... or carrying a gun mhm\nAnd then it blows up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder\nAnd you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right\nAnd you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're gonna make autonomy Skilling systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are that have significant military budget sitter spending good money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic gun tour it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so uh it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make kill decisions\nYou can always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think that we're going to build a a weapon systems\nIt's going to have well for\nFor three very easy reasons you can argue that ah they're they're better they're more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage and wherever they are you then argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ...\nOr ... whatever country you are and and and third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunate elite alone were the political cost going to war which uh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nIt may not be a good thing but in the long run\nWe don't do what some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapons systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if there's no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean do you see the day though by run that now we're coming up to the top of the commercial will finishes up when we come back next hour but\nYou know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial our cars with driverless cars do you see the day that the you know all the entire post office system will be done because they'll deliver and

survivor and do you think technology will ever replace pulse still people who deliver the mail to our houses\nYou know I'm I have a I have a feeling that any job at a machine can do we really want machines to do it I mean 'cause if if the machine can do a job to make a human do that job there's a word for that that's called B humanizing\nMhm because if if you just use a person for stand in for a machine then you're saying nothing about you that makes us human I'll be interested in and we only need you to be a machine that that we invented a is delivering the mail or or delivering packages something like that\nI could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine that washes windows I can imagine machine that automatically most my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if you take a step back these technologies this country for two hundred and fifty years as ... as high unemployment between five and ten percent\nAll the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years of the jobs vanish and so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years right\nAnd we had rising wages and because so why are we able to do it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out of everybody sees it and says I'm going to use this to increase my own productivity\nSo what ever if you can self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city if you are I mean like\nIt's hard it's hard necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if you went back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future you know there's gonna be the sweat thing and\nPeople are going to use it what do you think there's going to do their jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were going to vanish she would say well that's gotta be hard on the travel agents at the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers [noise] um\nBut you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you when you see at sea air B. and B. Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs are going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEverybody every time technology makes a great job and destroys\nA bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nThey if you had a robot that was a waiter in delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do a what a waiter can do you know they use spell a drink you know the robot cat a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThere you have a special order and you want you want to send your food back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots they can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult yeah so\nWell correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes out of batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that power these things for very long\nSo right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of moving there aren't going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house silver figures out where to punch you're all out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I Am happy when it gets that right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm not like you said that oh you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that sort of big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer and\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it and let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines\nWhich is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project to try to take this little worm\nYou've got three hundred and two neurons in his brave basement Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer just take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so there are so many we we're so\nSpectacularly amazing uh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do and and we've used it\nTo overcome scarcity because for all of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action about what it means is it you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause\n'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor and the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize and we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened\nUh you invented a nation state and that's why five thousand years ago you can kind of shut your clock by it all over the world a\nGiant civilizations emerge ... America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that\nUm that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude if you if you actually can take human thought and put it in a machine and human action to put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we're the smartest thing on it\nIf you can just make a whole lot smarter huh I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster than humans can I'm coming from St Louis\nI've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bond will be er a by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast uh you're\nYou're right that is already officially intelligent and it is to be\nFrightening if if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and said that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are certainly not bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we've ever had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment long that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it\nYou know sometimes a new technology comes along and they just don't adopt a blockbuster you know a streaming video came along and they were like yeah we'll we'll just wait and see and you mentioned them and I'm\nA Polaroid the same story which uh which digital photography\nAnd they didn't they didn't catch on right block buster was another one\nExactly with regard to drones I agree with you we're we're going to have to work that out and you know where where in search early days but uh but yeah there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like customs there's going to have to be laws is going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't have because ah that's very real\nWorking remote\nYou know I I kind of\nHope so I I don't know that I Would say a blanket thing for for every single person on the planet like because you can just ...\nCareers that you you can't like the electrician or a ballet dancer or anything that requires a psychiatrist or anything that requires a kindergarten teacher requires you to be president in any in any way but for people who are the information industry then yeah it was just\nThere was a series of commercials on I don't know if you remember it in the nineties that someday you will you know send a box from the beach someday you will and all of the things in those commercials\nKind of thing for the army did stay with us by Ron you're just come back and take some final calls in a final chat next on coast to coast\nTo coast website is no streamline for mobile devices Greek news if you're ... the one who enjoy our website on your boon visit goes to ... am done come on your iPhone or Android rose or\nOne bag weekdays Ninety until noon on news radio Ninety three point one [laughter]\nSneeze design current and robbers Supreme Court newest associate justice promises to be a non partisan player on a team of nine\nI was not appointed to serve one party or one interest but to serve one nation America's constitution and laws protect every person of every beliefs and every background\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh speaking at a swearing in ceremony Monday Night in the White House\nPresident Trump apologizing to Kevin on his family during the ceremony for the heated confirmation process hurricane Michael's getting closer to Florida now about four hundred and fifty five miles down the Panama City expected to make landfall Wednesday with torrential rains and deadly storm surge\nThat storm surge could be a foot high end even be felt in Tampa Bay state of emergency are in effect for twenty six Florida counties\nScientists and brown men is Fox News\nAbortion got rated PG Thirteen [noise] do you use the expenses to or yellow pills to charge your sex life are you thinking about it\nWhat if we can promise you the same results for less than three dollars a pill\nIf you're paying twenty dollars a pill for the ... year getting taken to the cleaners aren't pills deliver the exact same results for less than three dollars\nYou'll save more than sixteen dollars a pill for the same results and right now radio college will get forty four blue or yellow pills for a hundred and twenty bucks which street just ... you can say more than ...

people who need to feed you still have illness that\nKills everybody you start poverty which I think it's a technical problem you have all these problems technology cancel why do I say that because\nThey don't have to be that there are there are lots of problems that aren't technical like there's hatred bigotry and all of that but there are certain things we just haven't figured out how old are you in disease how do you slow down aging how do you do all these things and so\nThey're suffering people around the world that just are waiting for technology to come through and\nAnd finally deliver on all the utopias people used to dream about whether it be great if and now finally we've learned district and we can now make enough of all the good stuff for everybody and we just we're almost there and and so I don't think we I Would speed it up if I could there's there's still too much suffering in\nThe world Richie ... so the last thing you know we live in a world a universe\nThat looks looks vaguely looks very in the uh it looks like it's waiting for us to pay a visit you know I think our ultimate destiny is a billion people each on a billion planets and if you think that range\nUh I think that would be the best possible outcome because we live in this this universe and so we we got to get there are right now we're we're we carry ... balanced on this you know pale\nBlue dot\nScott Ritchie in West Virginia now Ritchie taken away go ahead sir\n... thanks for having me on the shelves missing interesting topic I\nI just wanted to ask the your guest there or if you think that the way technologies progressing that we may get to that you are to be an age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings 'cause working alongside with technology\nI Love that question you know you don't Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did go up to ... just like he thought so why are we still working all these uh\nOr is and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nNo air conditioning six hundred square feet do medical insurance no higher education vacation grow your own food make your own clothes you can work Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty people decided they wanted more and so there is no limit to human wants it turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home but not holy water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always worked forty hours a week\nIf if if I productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now Byron this technology\nUm I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine the machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who the machine\nA fixed by rote probably couldn't machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or what we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\n... ... ... wife hand now can pay for and and ... ... ... ... ...\nAnd ... ... ... ... ... and ... it gets half an hour and I\nAm talking about automatic guns\nWell okay I Know you're you're tied the guests bart is entirely right we are using a condom his\nWeapons would that make kill decision of course we've done that since landmines wheat crop would drop dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is rebuilding machines that they kill\nA so I didn't mean to say that uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we built machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nMake more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and they will go and decide that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but part I agree with you\nThe fourth age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books are so old I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just by ... dot com and there'll be a lot of links\nTo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's going to out jumped\nTo very simple things one uh\nIndividual worldwide average income\nPer capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ Seventeen fifty nothing happened what if you look starting Seventeen fifty is shot up like a rocket um\nWhy because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we made the scientific method and there's no limit to where that line is going to go so vast amounts of wealth created a eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen\nIs all purely technical problems like disease and hunger you will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming or all kinds of people said it would be possible but um\nYou know this country the United states already Throws Away in a food to feed all hungry\nPeople not world no question that the world strains to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that wouldn't be traumatic for her to come on coast to coast as we talk about the ghost photographer

are there are we are\nAnd welcome to the show and I had the James Cameron on a about a year and a half ago talking about some of his work and what a genius that guy is\nAnd you know I Will tell you a gym is a good man to yeah he said his\nMan I I have some great stories about him where he just allowed me and to um like\nThe theater where they record all the music and he said you stand here this is where the director stands and may you know the best place to hear it every day and I'm like oh I Love this guy you got a great background by the way\nI have an end or are you talking about my elderly

first and then made my way to San Francisco and\nThen maybe the way down to what Santa\nAnd here you are and here I Am talking to you\nWriting stories about ghosts and interesting things\n... and that the craziest title called their book that goes for dogs for\nWhat some of your peers about this the fact that I mean here you are you are a corporate executive doing some great work and now you're writing a story about the ghost photographer\n[noise] get out and it's it's it's a great question I I think because what I Do day in day out and you know rooted and data and and I'm and I'm\nNow ... you know within the organization thing you know very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling the story and they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you make this up\nHere that you're that nerd we went and [laughter] and and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people and have kind of gone with me on the journey and I think that's a very small you know quite\nZero one percent um you know they they just they can't make their way over right to our mind that's right um\nBut I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could they interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell their you know talk about their experiences because there's so many people have had him and I also wanted them\nTo you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into this and like you said not a lot of ... minutes well once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk to your ear off and you know just just for your listeners and because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah Bush because I you know when this started happening\nTo me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit about medium shift just you know some of those things in a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe in ghost so we're almost the majority\nAttorneys were barely a minority and that's grown I bet\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second stat um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and\nEvery two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is Googling the word ghost costing\nYes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening um but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey either way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nHas nothing to hide\nAnd you have nothing to hide\n... journey started for you because of a personal situation\nYes did did you know just\nThis started from me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey Adderall transformational Journey Through grief [noise]\nUm I lost my mother to all timers a and you know I I you you're not only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing post and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd open a like a ghost Porto because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes were older guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started this aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs of if\nYou have been doing this show me things what kind of cameras\nAnd iPhone\nI used and what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise]\nUm it was an iPhone I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Samsung camera on the phone but like a regular camera\nAnd it was interesting because all I captured on that um we're or IRBs not that ... you know are unimportant and special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else it's interesting\nYou know when this was going on for the entire jury looks looks good into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise]\nHow did you I'm Sorry so you mean get me going through\nThis year I mean how did I start to heal from the ... you started to these strange thing yeah\nI um you know I I was I'm very

sure many people have talked about the astro planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this

who are more conservative and he is and for people who are on the liberal side of things so he has a he is part of a five justice conservative bloc it's more conservative and it's been in recent memory and so he's in a position where the court could do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law\nBut as we say and the story I mean the big challenge for him as you know Brett Kavanaugh\nComes to this court after this brutal political fight or you know in some inflammatory remarks he made in his second\nJudiciary Committee appearance and you know the whole process just isn't that sort of process it reflects terribly well on the court and enter the challenge for that she will be to to try to steer the court through these\nMeaner pretty rough partisan times\nWithout also just looking like another partisan body you know\nHow to steer it though 'cause I mean it was rare you ever see any of these Supreme Court justice is like you know do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him and steer it\n[laughter] well I guess a few things I mean there have been times\nThe cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type ruling so instead of trying to tackle some big hot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll\nKind of break it down and and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruling that doesn't that's not so\nSweeping so that's one way to to minimize the court throw a little bit there have been other times and on on issues that he really really cares about he's not that interested in doing that you know that's a calculation he will have to make another another question for the court and there are times in their big cases the court will not be able to avoid I mean the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some\nBig legal issue the Supreme Court really doesn't have\nA choice but to take it so so certain things they won't be able to talk about it is a case where the court has almost entirely discretionary docket meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear the you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn roe v Wade for example\nMeat and the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now and so that may be a way he could try to deal with some of the\nInteresting for speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle tests Supreme Court chief justice talking about John Roberts it's interesting right I mean ah two weeks ago maybe Brett Kavanaugh might be the only justice most people in America could even name\nAnd now with all of a sudden the the high court is under this renewed spotlight\nPromoted him when they go through the confirmation process they have something to do this for a little while but then that kind of fades [laughter] um\nBut you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar boat Justice Clarence Thomas who had a similar\nSort of thing and you know in justice Thomas's\nIs probably easily the most recognizable\nMember of the court for the public off the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings but just like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him will be just to get back to the judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time\nAny any way some of the guys down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so you know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice to us I mean if if a new justice Kevin I'm\nTakes very bold stances in cases you know that cutting a strong conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for that if he finds ways to moderate and the end to forge common ground\nWith with a cross section of people in the court didn't then maybe slowly that that sort of makes things a little better for him\nPlay sprint that's Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall

depression\nAnd so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and center yourself and realize that you are not down but your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anger and\nWhat is the nature that they take on this stress\nWell it's interesting it and\nI've done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system in the mirror neurons are the compassion neurons in the brain for I'm I'm past too that's why it's such a interesting characters standing impact and thought that the mirror neurons the compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on a CAT scan and in that you love and they're getting pricked with a needle here on mirror neurons get activated that much more showing highly empathic people\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries then if you realize that when you see something or ... something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all light impact patients has to take this fast and not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant on ...\nStrasse negative news it's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many fast go out in nature medicate exercise Brandon laugh so that's one tool but also just notice past traumas\nTriggered for instance you know at the last year father and\nYou know I'm a man was lost in this current accident now your pain about losing your father's triggers so you have to know the different towns that that could make a big difference though that you know I'm dealing with is an addition to the current situation [noise] um and also doing a lot to nurture\nYou know do something really kind to yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear in the news that\nThe commander go outside um learn now is a complete sentence with paper because their parents don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining\nAnd so if you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no you know it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever they have the type that energy vampires are the criticizes the blame or as you know that can make\nAll this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear horrific things and the news you don't want to be around energy vampires so I write about who destroying your energy\nFor we're speaking with Dr Judith ... she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and we're talking about coping with tragedy in the news like that horrific stretch limousine accident in upstate New York and which twenty people were killed [noise]\nUm can the impasse who take on all this stress from other people's tragedy calls\nHimself a long term harm\n[noise] oh definitely and and pass it don't have the skills that I'm writing about in the book can be kind of course they never want to go outside they had panic disorders making at physical disease or a lot of the decisions because there aren't sensory overload all the time\nFor it they're just being bombarded and don't know how to stop it\nMan so yeah I Believe the empathy is a trait", "show_name": "Coast
