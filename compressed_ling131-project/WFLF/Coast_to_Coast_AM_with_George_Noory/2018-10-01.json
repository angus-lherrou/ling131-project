enough we get more requests for Dave than any other guest that I've experienced since I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found as true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises to come Dave great to have you back\n[noise] George I'm always humble that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though I appreciate the invite\nI wanted to say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today\nThat you make some personal observations that I have not uh I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into some of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities\nOr some of the missing to your own life right\n[noise] you know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family are people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and [noise] there's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and hopefully people see that you know have these people are really really good people these are the Drake who is fighting these are\nThe upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the\nHigh rollers but people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because\nIt seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder has the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nThat have happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out one from help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and ah\nI've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families and covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration in their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA runner and out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement report the who they interviewed who they talked to were they searched the effectiveness of the search or the areas they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching blind\nAnd there's been in for chef lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books who might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service\nGovernment entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing that the families of the missing but uh it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\n[noise] you know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but\nThere is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found disappearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered them didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background ought to be looking into it [noise]\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest

there are people who have written books similar to yours as well as people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address that for a moment before we jump into the cases\n[noise] this is one of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that\nAnd I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the named David polite is missing for one one missing in national parks there all frauds they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent and listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads\nThe only site that has me is that can him missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click and and you listen if you don't know it's somebody of talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us the people don't trust you to really don't even listen to him a ... missing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that ... on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I a huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports\nNow find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased they're released the report most times other times they want there was a case from eighty six\nAnd are filmed impossible distances away sometimes they're alive amazingly enough but I'm often found impossible distances away and there is no way no way they can walk there on their own uh talk about that phenomenon\n[noise] so there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talked about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in his books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child sound say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with the case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOf four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps ah another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours not possible in my book\nBut I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data because in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen these numbers absolutely blown to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is in all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance and extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you're you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away we'll watch the child what's that child's gonna do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe the plan that dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents and you think your kid would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare but I have all these examples where these heights have been achieved by these little kids\nWere they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nOh yeah I mean we\nTalked about a two year old boy that they just he traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges and he was found face down in snow the next morning unbelievably alive and we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection\nWhat happened as mark that we couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe it or why\nYou have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on the bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours to have to go point six miles per hour\nBut a kid's not going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water\nUm it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody pick them up for some some thing or someone picked him up and slapped him there\nAnd and the reason these cases have significant is that what you report on a child who's abducted in downtown big [noise]\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later the trials away you know sure as somebody put 'em in the car and drove down there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party and anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody saw anything nobody sonic cars\nNobody else was there so how did that child make that difference in that time doesn't make\nA in the new book\nUh it's law L. A. W. land air and water and a land cases you've talked about before but you've got some new ones including one that happened in the organ pipe cactus national monument Arizona\nReady to take a break now when we come back this one has really creepy and even some of the investigators who are working the case admitted it was really creepy I Will tell you why in just a moment talking with David polite is going to take a break the ...

you learn\nSo for people who don't know national monuments are part of the national Park Service it's their property and they patrol it and their national park police are there\nWell there's an a location called Oregon or gee a an organ pipe cactus national monument\nAnd it's an Arizona far southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico well on February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two years old named Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico\nDrove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around and she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called er\nWell I stumbled onto this case and saw it and some archive somewhere and I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff yeah some pretty documents on that case\nI got the documents in my hand then I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports amazed added a we don't have any I said have you heard of that case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all the articles in all the reports said that they stated she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working in a ... a university lab tech to earn some extra money [noise]\nShe'd love the outdoors type regularly on January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument\nAnd she slept in her car that first night February first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and was smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture and asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he ... he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOn February third she moved your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling and found carols car parked in s this Kenyan picnic site\nWith a note tape inside the windshield\nAnd it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February\nThrough these contact the ranger smart smart thing to do exactly\nYou know I Wish everybody would do that but then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier\nAnd I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he had the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second he notified park headquarters advises them that he has a missing hiker and starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service that you sent in to Forman teams up that trail the search\nWhether it was described in reports as cold and blustery they determined care was laughing eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service started to get low and resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs month an air force base\nThey brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent again he met Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina\nThe parents that did the care would never ever go off trail she was in al ... outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth February twenty second that Ryan told the Associated Press\nIt's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery march seventh one last push to locate curl rangers claimed to\nSmell an odor of human decaying flesh up the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service put a team into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd again they have no documentation on the incident anymore now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils\nAnd it was three type written pages that outlines the search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane for review what it says one additional was turned up on Monday February fifteenth too limited locations about four hundred yards the park on the south west facing of the hosts a J. O. S.\nA very strong in distinct human odor was found but no other locations\nSupervising ranger how cross of swore oh that's where our national monument and one other searchers who was recently involved in the recovery of body had very strong and positive feelings on the ... the odor\nThe following day ranger cos after flying the area and a border patrol plane letting eat man search party back over this area again the odor was observed at the same location but only occasionally and not as distinct\nOther members of the team described it as a very weird and scary\nAll efforts were negative and search activities have been reduced to intermittent patrols at this time I have never and thousands of reports seen anything described in our national park service report of very weird and scary\nPlace\nYeah that's really strange just a feeling they had or the fact that they're smelling what they think is decaying human flesh but there is no source or the older\nWell here's what it says other members of the team described it as a very weird and scary\nSo I'm sure all of us who spent time in the outdoors have spent have smelled the odor of dead flash decaying some time animals die smell it I don't know if that could be weird and scary\nBut ah again\nThis was her second hike into that area which she nervous about making the trip is that why she left a note where she just smart about it they never found her there was never any subsequent follow ups after that first sixty days search both of her parents are deceased she didn't have any brothers or sisters there's no\nThere's nothing left of her family anymore\nYou have another a case in in the book about a land disappearance that involves a really smart person somebody who's the editor for what looks like great things his name is Steven read and his disappearance was in Nineteen Ninety nine in Oregon told me about that one\nSo this is the one time out of the thousands of times where I read this case and I said you know

[noise]\n\n\n\nSo Dave I Want to jump around a little bit to make sure we save some time to talk about the air cases so I Want to jump into one of the most baffling cases involving water it's a guy named Henry McKay but this is really pretty creepy\nThat is a creepy case and ah [noise] the new Brighton Minnesota the community just north of Minneapolis not very far with the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe was thirty two years old [noise]\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids lived in a city called Mountain View again just north of Minneapolis north side this\nKoester area of missing people that I've written about in the past [noise] he had a great job using auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue [noise]\nOn September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California and it was a planned vacation well on Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend who was a very diligent guy always on time very respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the early early on that Monday morning and ... states that he dropped him off at a location in critically at the super gas station or a Seventy third avenue\nAt two twenty three am Henry phone appears corrupt pocket dial this wife while she was asleep when California and a left wing the voicemail strange sound screaming paintings growls et cetera\nAnd a guy from uh Finland did some amazing work sent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances in Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances and your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that\nAnd then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles\nNow in the Nevada try and go down there by you they goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle and when I first got on to that I thought you know it seems kind of hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it on a map\nI said holy crap you know it's in the middle that try and go to Sam in national park yes I go that's\nQuite a coincidence so Yosemite kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances in kings canyon and sequoia as well [noise]\nAnd when I watched a documentary about the Nevada try and go there's several thousand planes that have crashed and disappeared in this year is in that area and a lot of it\nCan be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents that things which seems reasonable\nBut when you bring into account that there is also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some uh do you have any specifics from the ... were you when you get into or should we just go you jumped into the cases of ear disappearances in general\nAnd it was just go to air disappearances\nYou have a case in the books from Moffett Field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that's a I grew up not far from off the field in Sunnyvale I grew up Cupertino and I had plane flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week\nAnd it had notoriety in the early forties for being a place where all the blimps that patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed at their and Treasure Island in the middle of the bay [noise]\nWell in August sixteenth Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting sent out a treasure island where they help a world's fair there was a man by the tenant earners Cody twenty seven years old and Ensign Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this\nWell as they depart they start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the pharaoh on islands and Cody with control of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military\nAnd it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a a needed for patrol\n[noise] we'll both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to a treasure island for the day to leave on their ship [noise]\nUh that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nThe first hundred and ten minutes of the flight was normal fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles east of the fair on islands\nIt ate all five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scramble to ... to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the boy will the planes encountered cloudy weather with a ceiling a five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them\nAt ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they are to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in the file and they couldn't explain why it was there [noise]\nAnd then it'll weapon Fifteen for fun and calls Moffett Field against they didn't get that in LA had crashed in the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast\nOr the navy response to Daly city and they find their airship on the ground with one bomb missing the gone to was in near perfect condition both motors on the ship or off even though one trial was half open and the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required were white preserves over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each a airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the tanks\nThe radio was in perfect condition no distress call\nFor fun and called back and say they said they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nThe central coast of California had a major search that started almost immediately that may be found to fishing boats and navy boat in a postcard ship that saw the blimp dip\nAnd drop to wears on the oil slick the blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowds they said all appeared fairly normal but it did go into the crowds and disappeared the crash happened at four thirty to build your street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean\nThe crew did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the crap we're still there [noise]\nThere's a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there's a couple of theories that developed a and that the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break and come back we're in the jump into\nThe other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people ended the break with the journey wheel in the sky\nBlue cheese find them ... and I just log on to go to ... am done\nMessages

radio Ninety three blame on [noise]\n\n\nBefore the break we're talking about this US Navy blimp it's patrolling off the coast to California and uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\n[noise] for the navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board\nWhen it hit the beach originally when it hit land it drop one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood [noise]\nThere was a massive search off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they reviewed radio bog there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch the flick that they were watching on the water there were lots of water craft in that area\nThey never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd the area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because Jeff north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which has had several strange disappearances I've documented and just south\nOf the Golden Gate to a location called half moon bay in that area of the coast I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no on their part of the northern California coast north of that coin raise area [noise] and nothing immediately south half moon bay\nSo it's just one area that have just strangeness attached to it [noise]\nAnd like you said that they came up with some explanation for to me that were laughable\n\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened [noise] what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left or the craft or a and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway [noise]\nOr even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak\nRight because the the area of the water that was searched up there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get into that if I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick ... case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was\nThe organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened and he went to base and\nAt the circumstances were it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them uh their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I've thought the same thing in multiple missing for a woman books that looks like people are snatched down to the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these are odd locations a little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that uh a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch in elsewhere\nAnd I'm Jeremy ... made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which\nHad been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with\nSome people whose names I cannot cannot make public but they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside\nHe had a had an ongoing interest in getting Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked uh ask me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch\nAnd I asked a couple of questions that didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me but\nThe idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\n\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone uh he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the the public has never seen so you know he he he has a\nVery broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so I don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody has been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wake up call [laughter] think so um [noise]\nSo you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything\nLate it to a disappearance that I could sing my teeth into that could related to the activity there and you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but as I've said before sometimes I think\nI related to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers aren't ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it and I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water\nAnd when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it just filled with water and I have no cases from

in proximity different dimensions but they can interact even thousands of years ago they talked about abductions but the ... to\nTalk about what they look like what the Romans were like what they did

country many times I went to visit some friends in Rochester ah I'll Try to find out the exact date but right now I Can't I'm going to send you an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places and the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a man a woman and a boy and a couple of other people walk in one direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around out simply to me out of nowhere\nThere were picnic tables right near there and one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared\nShut high to the other one and she had a girl and the shuttle can our kids play and the the the people that I had been walking with the mother said yeah and we shut down at a picnic table and the strange woman said to the other lady that I had to walk with what's your name [noise]\nThey they tell their name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later the lady looks and the boys gone and she starts calling them and I got up and I walk around and swear to God I Am not making this up\nThere was a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bumped them but this is the part I Want you know it had kinda futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature looks humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped at least twenty feet from the ground without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where the you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was scared I thought that that creature and those people that are pure were part of the same group I thought they were military people and this creature was a genetic hybrid this is what I Believe [noise]\nWell\nThat's quite a story or Dave any

move right\n[noise] well yeah I wrote a story my last book one right before this about a story a Spanish priest in Texas that was running from Native American thing came upon this giant piece a pink granite in Texas it's a state park [noise]\nAnd he said that as he ran up to the top of the granted it opened up and swallow with him and he said that he was inside the Boulder he guest made it for three days\nAnd then he said at the end of the third day it's that amount and that isn't the only story I've got like that and uh people probably don't know this but there are stories out of Iceland\nThat they will move road when they're building it before they will blow up a piece of granite or big Boulder because they have a bully in their society that things are living inside of those

stories rumble locals including the tribe\nIs make note of the make and model of the ATV and ask them how did you get past the road block how did you get that ATV back onto this road\nThe two girls there's no way they lifted any weight and even to adult men that looked like lumberjacks again they look just like the people on the brownie paper towels would have had a hard time\nUp a like a four hundred pound ATV and somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes I Can't remember this was a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses but I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting\nAreas in the rain forest in the woods [noise] um\nThey were like blonde hair blue eyes wide again just like give aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans it was like they were too perfect\nNot a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the cloud shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nSo they just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\nThey kind of stopped and chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they hold off and they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped and I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake\nAnd like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life sometimes don't sink in until after the fact and you know I started thinking about it we'll wait a minute how did they even get that ATV onto the road that show [laughter] alone\nHow weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how hard it was at the time but um\nYou know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there'd been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that their records their their sounds\nIt was in those same woods where I heard this ah ungodly sound that couldn't be any other animal and I don't think are the best opera singer POV raunchy could have imitated the sound\nAnd I'd encourage you to find out what coast to coast did with the audiotape they used to play of this a legit big foot recording ten or more years ago George ... used to play it\nI think art bell used to play it hasn't been played for years but I heard that up in the shame woods it's a unique recording never heard of it before\nI'm starting to buying more and more to the fact that these big puts might be dimensional\nMight have a a extraterrestrial connection the humanoid that I saw in the woods the more I think about it there's\nNinety nine point nine percent sure those remarks humans and hindsight I'm just glad they didn't take me whatever they were doing up in that area\nWell we're glad to cause a ... you wouldn't have been able to call in presumably thank you Jason for sharing that story that's a that's a pretty strange you need to start carrying some recording equipment with you wherever you go

he's talking about is\nJust as I Know what he's talking about [noise] um and it at a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody else it had this experience but um it was kind of like hey what are you doing up here and in\nA second guessing but [noise] oil it's really far away and uh you know maybe I'm just imagining that and\nSo I kept hanging out look at the stars in about ten minutes and they closed oh I'd say at least three miles in maybe ten minutes and it did the same sound again only the the impression or psyche can personally at all it was like hey I'm coming at you\nAnd me I jumped

systems are more vulnerable than ever what's being done to fix them we're joined now by cyber security journalist Kim Zetter who's got a piece running in the New York times Kim what kind of security do we have\nIt's really and what I Would refer to his band aids security there were really not in a much of a different shape than we weren't together sixteen there are some some some differences some changes but certainly not um ah what you would want\nWhile what are the band aid by the way let's let's let's work backwards I guess\nSo um what's that ... prior to that extent it reached out to states and it I'm offered the scanning service that it does\nUm what this means is it simply will scanned the Internet facing system to these where they um\nThe servers like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line the jets will do the remote and um and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability is better knowing that we know about that I'm also have a patch of elbow\nAnd it will tell the states where it's found a vulnerability and\nI'm able to keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a weekly basis to see when the um the customer has a patch that to them so they did that too few states before um the two that I think the election and then they've done that to more states are more county now\nUm since then but it's still the the amount is I think it's less than half\nUm and the scanning isn't really a sort of cosmetic it getting at only the Internet facing system it's not getting at the core back in ... they're supposedly not connected to the Internet not getting at the voting machines at all not looking at the core vulnerabilities there\nAnd it's also not touching um water the election management systems and these are the system that sit in a county headquarters a there used to program their voting machines and they're all the youth tabulate devote so these are actually the most critical and not the Internet they think that the\nFocus so if you're if you're an average voter\nDo walk into a polling place in November with the utmost confidence where are you saying there are there are some doubts about\nWhether or not we could be hacked\nThere has always been the possibility for our elections isn't the act as a for going back Fifteen sixteen years since many of these systems were implemented were just addressing it now because of the Russian threat\nBut um it's the ... the situation is not new I Would not tell that are not to vote uh definitely I Want motors to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is um the ...\nStates and counties need to implement um mandatory audits and they need to have a paper trail is either a paper ballot the voter filled out or that have the machine produce paper trail\nI mean they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't though\nAs you point out there's a really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of backup\n'em yet so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballot today at all those can be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have other ideas need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets scanned at the machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um states the county election officials are looking at that paper after a collection is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter veterans cyber security journalist also author of a book called count down to zero day she's got a piece running in the New York times titled the crisis of elections security how do we get so vulnerable\nOh we got vulnerable because of a reaction to the Florida fiasco and the two thousand presidential election in that case I'm sure everyone recall the dangling Chad while you know that that took you know the the race to the Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington DC\nDecided that they didn't want that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballots that were the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount\nBut we count and say what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh it's done and many states I'm over reacted and went to system that didn't have any papers at all and that's how we got from what we have today\nIs Kim Kim Zetter cybersecurity journalists Nineteen Minutes after the our\nPortion of Bull Run was brought to the Supreme Court or how you know it's not Martin lottery\nThe centerpiece of

in price and banks had made loans they thought would never defaults than repackaged image securities to make them seem risk lists\nWith time even the deepest traumas wear off and there are signs that risk taking is returning though in different forms from before more from Greg is chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how do you see it\nGot to Christ basically because uh everybody became somewhat blind to the president of risk weather was bankers who thought that the loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought\nTheir homes would never decline in price they essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on and everything is all about bankers investors and we it's individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether to the regulations or attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what type of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts sort of crises [laughter] but it's also been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting do your own household and investors are much ... of risk what the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example I used to be the total year we'd build one and a half million new homes and its expansion so far it's more like a million and there are several rates for that one is that well I'm an Asian country so maybe fewer people need homes\nBut also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages so that's limited who can buy a house I and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and you can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess does that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand in the crisis and they've kind of learn to sort of like be more cautious they're investing\nAnd so we see an investment if you look at housing ambulances methods combined it tends to be a little bit more muted [laughter] you don't have so many people going to start their own business Bartlett because it's harder to get the loan you know he used to turn to a home equity loan to start your new business [laughter] those are harder to get but I also think people are at an age and it sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do [laughter]\nSure you have your ... those here and you realize there but it really kind of the exception you know it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley what people want is to not start the next Google or Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook the level of new businesses being formed does actually historically\nQuite low and I think it's troublesome I mean essentially a people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nFor speaking with Greg it cheap economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk\nFor a while so you mentioned it before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean once we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or are they related\nI think it helps explain why would the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bull mark markets climb a wall of worry that as I say if everybody pessimistic there is nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people forced to capitulate\nAnd fell into that so in some sense cut some of them is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nIn that similar for the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy projects you're less likely to get a bust in a recession\nNow that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off\nThe market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market as well and some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off [laughter]\nI don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer and I think those are the circumstances by about which the risk to start to grow and if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis\nBut you know risk they have a kind of like goes away that sort of changes shape it sort of like water running downhill and counter the barrier try to find a way around it and and we hear happening now some of the risky types of loans have been banks will make like to like ... companies\nThose are being made by other companies like investment banks are private equity funds [laughter] so you in some sense skill at risk out there it's just a form that we're not used to when we can't have a lot of confidence about whether\nThe system will be safer as a result\n... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal reminder by
