happened\nYeah go go go wasn't going to get into the technical details on the the the outage or actually last that I I guess around an hour and a half and that apparently it was a global outage which is pretty that's weird\nWell it it's interesting because um as we know that the the actual video stream for the people from YouTube from different locations around the world if it's not all coming from one place but there are centralized system of course\nSo the fact that this was a global outage suggests that there was some kind of access related problems centrally that caused this in my own

gets sued for not paying their student loans are they going to lose in court and there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens\nJust enough to cover the costs of administering the program\nWhere does the lending money come from Allen for those for these loans\nAll the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans\nUh today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise] ah so the federal tax payer puts the money out a and the federal taxpayer\n'em and let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education a ended sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that essentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter]\nAh but um so yeah this is a federal program money it ultimately comes from the taxpayer who\nAt this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit\nOr and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a ... something that makes this\nA predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fair to collect the practice laws\nFederal um a fruit than lending laws uh and these again are restricted or it's completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of\nThis the genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cabal of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nAh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes\nServed on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprises\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise] ah like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could to make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for a parent who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give up this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan because as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose\nBankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices truth in lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned\nUh so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank guinea private line of credit\nAnd do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type of loan\nWhatever happened in the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of ground serves even state funding cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee\nYou now you're per year that's tuition room board books um for a four year course for a four year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad is now six point two year what happened\nAgain the colleges are sitting in the ... seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really stream the students out\nAnd keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cautious just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane storied where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently were Lindsey\nA guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder ... the belt bills are so high\n[laughter] that's right you know and and that's really urged the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um after charge huge amounts just to pay out that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie ... Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others about how the student loan problem\nIs really affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million

Orlando\nSixty nine AM all news radio Ninety three point one [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to close to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I've three reason engineering and um [noise] I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for a short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera [noise]\nAh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into\nA is a system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is ah what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties an interest and [noise]\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Leslie stall yeah a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might\nAdd a and so it was sort of snowball from there I\nUnfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project to get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later [laughter] and Congress has not moved one inch\nAnd I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits or have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed to be the ones that kept the short end of the stick\nAnd by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared marked for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car and so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars\nKeeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I make a similar analogy off and I have no student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's got great reviews you go in and you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no break any wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know this car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no break\nYou know [laughter] uh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly as you as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night are expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nMean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals\nBut because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very rural\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans and the first place so the only people the people that get student loans\nAnd it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a you know I'm a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruel you ironic is that is these very people that the landing system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq crazy once once the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nUh it's ... it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running\nYou know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I should have pushed my kids' sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars off and\nYou know the scholarships really have an increased uh on that scale and and so it's you know\nUnless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy so this has\nJust gotten unreal um this is not this is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college will\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just to provide and\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge tile and good thank you [noise]\nI got good news for a two man a trope rally over there and a lot of the other day\nYeah there was a big signs they throw support the seal day there he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway I I I wanted to drive a little bit of a trade school to a ... a company I used to work or I got on egg wildly\nAnd when a totally went under the owners of the night and a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know\nAnd it was a sad time but uh we pretty much going on during the late everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I Love her the job I hold near one but they wouldn't even let alone and fast or if I was I didn't have that little piece of paper saying to undo it all too\nWell and I said well over ... years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nAnd I looked at the local school there and they were to go to court houses dollars go it for oh I think it was up to her horse just don't take well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going unless the house in dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi trucks and then I felt like I got shafted on that I found out that it's not a surprise sounded\nA let's get your reaction to the cell and where do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's\nIt's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call I'm having a publicly think Allen he the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition and inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the lungs especially the taxpayer on hug 'em it's going to crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt is college dead\nIs that all of these programs are failing\nThe vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where you work for a you know if you work in a college or a hospital other nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness\nAre actually getting it so the rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more\nSo mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan show\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I'd be our program and actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so\nTwenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nOr the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nBig was going to say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was [laughter] ironically it was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit the inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students

what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the list or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't they scammers\nOut yes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall ... who they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger alone and then get a commission off the top of that or or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger alone a and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nHow George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of up growling pose a telltale\nHa that job thank you and I hope we hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and all for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off my credit report and lo and behold the same week this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nI Hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning that particular uh but their information has a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listing a breakdown of all of the uh uh costs but I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can get through I tried to negotiate directly with the the oh he tried to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight now and first of all I Would I Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy writes back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education\nAt this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education [noise]\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the get alone he'll take it all the you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with the closing up like like what you describe it and\nThey get the information Allen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this or a public debt clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good\nUm but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you\nNever heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are strong beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and ...\nMy leaders down the line least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave\nAnd well what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent particularly for older loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original ...\n[laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens in the Pentagon homeboy what's that all of a\nFor incredible down I knew a smack downs on their mind that even much says that got me on line for daily coupons enough or\nEvery day the dot com mental thing ... everything I couldn't apply when back weekdays\n... noon on news radio Ninety three point one [noise]\n\n\nLet me tell you a little bit about Nick ... those are viewer news the show Nick worked for the United kingdom ministry of defense the best of getting your photos and other mysteries\nHe's been called the real Fox ... has been working as a consultant or spokesperson numerous alien the movies TV shows video games as well and tonight we're going to be talking about aliens at the Pentagon and Nick welcome back it's always great to have you\nGreat to be back on the shirt I don't know how you doing these days where do we last\nSee each other contacted the desert we were there ...\nNow was that to your life event in which we\nThat was right around that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job they're great job indeed\nAliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nI can actually it is a new documentary that I put out the story and you grab them but you're right that story and and really to\nTry one human tree as best as I can tell the story of the U.S government don't want any relationship with the phenomenon watch decade now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nI'm hearing this town that they have been the biggest thing go wherever they are you at a community I think that the story that I think come [laughter] and I would say this is what the vacation and released the British Government\nMiles but the the revelation that off to decades have to know the U.S government did have a new effort program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm from an agency of the day and and like you say for years they said no no since project to close down we haven't been doing this this knowing ... there were no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on tangle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment polls there all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this but Robert Bigelow a Senator Harry Reid charmed along I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up in honey you track all this stuff is coming from all different directions\nI think the answer that one is is very cautiously and very carefully and and I absolutely in meticulous detail\nBecause I think the problem with this story\nIn one sense for years people have said the\nProblem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's going on with the aid kit story with with these revelations or we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just a confusing mess if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on December sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out will to first than a than a third one\nBut now with the public have been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this won't stop by and then this is a millionaire businessman\nAnd and struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back and and give people an overview of this from my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot in the course tonight dinner gun but tell us specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on this one and it was quite a a diverge and for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and then you've done this of course civilian times yourself you know you sit in the hot seat\nA direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this when you see the final product sometimes you think well well you know I've got edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd\nPut that back then and I wish they'd take it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon what I did decide teamed up with Warren ... oil from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so scripted the entire movie that the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this and then literally I went into a recording studio you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right did\nThe whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did the parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike along I ... I was very much in the driving seat having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can while I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I Want to do because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure for mayor dates a completely\nNew role to me I mean there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose who just made a a a great movie but um\nYou know I I it was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish who they are going\nSlowly and as I say really to try to go through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story\nFrom from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field has is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but\nThey don't go to many conferences and and it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand we go ahead on tool of platforms\nThat the young people need to watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but too young to get people and and another thing\nIs you know it's been a year since ... had his press conference where he\nGot together with the stars of people\nUm and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times when the story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so they ... at the Pentagon I wanted to reignite the U.S and put it back where it absolutely belongs\nCenter stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization Dewey ... nowadays like like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you say the organization I'm E. E. T. I. P. O.\nYes I Am well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has said well it always says in these sorts of\nSituations only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle\nFrom the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and\n\nPhone plain news radio Ninety three point one WFL\nLast News I'm Carmen Robert anew Fox bull shows if the election were held today the house would likely flip to democratic control\nAt a big part of the reason is women are poll shows likely female voters support the Democratic candidates by Eighteen points and even more concerning for Republicans is a shift over the past two years I\nStarted Gallagher experts say that shift happened because Republicans positions around a favor including trying to get rid of Obamacare residents along Florida's panhandle slowly returned to see the devastation from hurricane Michael for also for\nAbout a hundred and twenty thousand customers in Florida still without power including more than half of bay county where we are the water started to run but they have a boil order in effect and\nThe schools are still closed here\nFox has wrecked lemons salt in Panama City live it's Fox News\nSun burn or to\nGreece is cheap but the airfare cost a fortune Paris not much closer and again airfare what about ... let's face it flying anywhere is just too expensive wait what's that [noise]\nWhat I Know the ringing\nNo one ever heard them a total\nNew was to\nAh well in the sky\nBut I never ... you\nKnow I'm never saw oh\nWho was\nWho was the\nThey show me in Sweden fragrance meadows\nHospital\nYou know\nBut I never heard singing\nKnow I Know\nIt was\nLive from the gateway to the west coast to coast am George Norris we'll be back with more with the\nPope and we'll take calls next door with the pope as we talk about his ... at the Pentagon fascinating DVD fascinating indeed\nParanormal dot com approaching eighty thousand members now shows such just truly remarkable so if you haven't signed up for it yet it's free to sign up just go to the website colonel date dot com and meet people who get you ... the dot com or something that will help make you look\nA little more healthier\nScience has come a long way in helping us look younger now\nWe have an amazing product to give you near instant results with bags into your eyes fine line wrinkle roast beef and pork it's called instantly ageless unless\nThe two minutes see dramatic changes to your look no need to know paid instantly ageless is a cream applied lightly and allowed to dry look younger and intern feel younger\nAnd do it in a minute even doctors agree instantly ageless works like this from the Rachel ratio\nBoard certified dermatology factor Whitney about her looking to turn back the clock either by that time of her own home but ... acknowledges emerging almost like showing at the back of my wallet that's how they can learn while at Brown\nRight we're going to try a product or ... you know go back there are a path that I have been let her in her credit on silicon and ... and we're going to lay out there\nAnd then she went off to try products\nCalled instantly age where yeah instantly you could see a difference even the cameramen were like wow look at the different yeah I definitely use the product\n[noise]\nFine and it was actually a very traumatic Richard ...\nInstantly ageless today go to our exclusive website H.

for us but I think some of some of the Komen tree about this has been a little far fetched I mean it'd be something from a ... movie by apple aliens I mean it's it's more about DOMA nineteenth future idle space\nWell are you exactly but what do you think about the late president Ronald Reagan's attempt to get the star wars technology going some people thought it was to protect us from some kind of alien intervention\nYes and he certainly made of course ... those remarks\nAre very famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I occasionally thing how quickly would we would set aside differences down here on it if if we face some alien threat and and of course people read\nAn awful lot into those remarks and then they saw the star wars program and they read read a law into that to my own personal view is that that was much more about just trying to ... when the Cold War and find crop the Soviet Union which to be fair and exactly the way it pretty much\nPlay down oh that's right absolutely there's been new still talk disclosure are you you know I I'm arguing Steven bass and all the time Nick I don't think there's going to be the kind of disclosure he expects\nDo you think that the things that are happening now or governmental ways trying to soften us up for governmental disclosure or do you think it's never going to happen as I\nYeah I I I agree with you I don't think that kind of steep pass it um disclosure with a big be my fellow Americans people at the world we are not alone I don't think that\nIn in here they are bringing them yeah\nI'm a ... and we've discussed this before one of the big problems of course is is not saying that the extraterrestrials bought if it turns out that we've known about this was Seventy years they can be a lot of questions\nTo answer about that no I I think it's more like clay and I don't believe either this is a kind of softening up kind of climate ... program but I Do think that through\nThrough the revelations about eight tip them through the classification and release of the British Government ... files we are seeing government say effectively will lick here is\nOur data or as much of it as we can really\nYou know without compromising classified information I'm ... and and the ultimate irony of all this might be ... genuinely governments don't really know what they're dealing with either I'm which takes me back to the mountain Reese\nQuite what if we all dealing with some things so above and beyond comprehension let's say it would be an allergist to explaining quantum mechanics which you say\nYou never know you you never know when you look at Leonardo da Vinci's works He depicted things that we have today I'm not sure you knew what the what what he was drawing though when you say\nWell he was clearly a visionary genius has been a time travel [laughter]\nWell I'm not sure about that but um I guess there are there are a handful of physicists working on that Ronald mail it comes to mind yeah\nBut I think there are some some others or you know I I had a job in the ministry of defense where I was paid to think the unsinkable so I I don't really things out\nDid you get involved the remote viewing or anything like that psychic work with the ministry you did\nYes absolutely we had you can't run a UFO program without finding yourself\nThe the focal point for anything\nYou saw that any any one kind of comes to to government about and of course we had we had people who said that they will psychics and they wanted to volunteer their services to the intelligence community to help us well you know locate\nSoviet ballistic missile submarines are on mosques by some ... sort of thing\nSo we looked at this as a classic low probability high impact

Idaho Nebraska in Utah\nThat ... the main tribes has the same that the Affordable CARE Act are allowed expansion of Medicaid up to for people to earn enough to a hundred and thirty eight percent of\nPoverty I'm the one difference there is the ah the funding element in Utah that goes along with that um [laughter] but this is an issue one reason it's still I'm practically and as an issue and said that there's a lot of\nPressure from a hospital particularly real hospitals and other medical medical providers in these states that have not expanded Medicaid saying look there's all the federal money available that would help us and we're not tapping into it even though my tax dollars from our states are going to find these things and you know across the country\nOne argument for why they had happening by mail initiative is there is neither conservative states where it's not politically feasible for the public officials Republican public officials to look like they're supporting\nThe Affordable CARE Act but if their voters say we want this and there's a way that they they can do it without having to take direct responsibility for it\nWe're speaking with Maureen grumpy Washington correspondent at USA Today she's written a piece in the midterms healthcare is the key national issue but the real action may happen at the state level or could this be a trend where state legislatures are addressing this\nPotentially to their Seventeen states that have not expanded Medicaid and I'm a Republican who worked on health care issues for a number of years on on the hill and he said uh\nOr and white healthcare reporters that he thinks that phase initiatives have found that shit is in these states passed that it it could start a trend for the state that many of the other states that have not expanded Medicaid but the other thing that's going on\nIs that had an expanded Medicaid conservative states have been asking Trump Administration for permission to do so but they do so in a different way in a way that advocates for I don't like such as time passes and work at ... and that's another issue that tip play\nSome states might be willing to expand Medicaid if they can do so in their own way but I think the way they want to do that that are being challenged in court and we're saying that truck sample in um Kentucky okay\nYeah I think you meant to that point you mentioned a couple of states where governors races to have an effect on this right\nRight that's a little bit of a it's not quite as an immediate impact that the ... the governor's aren't the only ones in their states that have the say in it in the state legislatures are due to come up as an issue in several governors' races Florida Kansas Tennessee in Georgia where the Democrat candidate for governor saying this is something that we should do\nOr what was that due to a lot like tying it to I guess the federal government money would there be a guarantee that there would be there every year\nThat's the way the law is written by one of the argument that opponents of expanding Medicaid I'm One of the argument that they're making is that you can't guarantee can't guarantee the states that funding will be there forever\nOn Saturday or their argument is that states get depended on his federal money and then if the federal government can't live up to bargain of funding Ninety percent or more out of the expansion and hate you're going to be on there around", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Pine Hills", "day": "18"}
