people I mean if you look back in history [noise]\nUm you know he told me being a couple of centuries 'em\nBefore a lot of recognized animals where was found to exist in the first place so I think it's important to remember that um you know there are surprises still out as much of a the world which still remains under explored\nYou have a several of the creatures are monsters that are in your

it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something that couldn't somebody in a costume or\nA as an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose

ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chase in central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid so I Know the area very well and it's a it's a large area of a ...\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be too hot spots for paranormal phenomena the kind of chase he's just saying you know that'd be coming out his window areas where it seemed to everything in its brother comes through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local news pay for the chase post and somebody had same this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid Fager sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better term to use over the woods are at high speed um you know kind of a like a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out to point classrooms\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... it in that respect than there

something pops up and people who like want to know was that\nAnd then he's never seen again but um this particular case is an interesting one I'm cutting I pull Nineteen sixty four in Buckley, Washington\nAnd I'm actually quite close to my room there on the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed um he sold the strange creatures while he was driving along the road\nAnd it was sort of humanoid with these huge wings but it was kind of Harry as well [noise] excuse me and had the shining a yellow eyes but the sort of the ... the hair angle combined with the large wings um\nYou know that they everybody in the wings kind of people said oh it's ... you know don't sasquatch because he's got wings but he caught it looks like\n... ... square and um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases it just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black stories you and I have talked about that before a that might be spooky here than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies uh to to think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nWe're well I've got to be honest with you in Georgia I'm up to five books now on on this phenomena foreign demand in black and one of the women in black\nAnd I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon or the CIA or the FBI or and I say I'm a you know nothing like they they concept even the movies back typically are described as looking\n... you know go on and a skinny white white white um and people talk about ... mind control the personal hypnotized them\nPay for even talks about when they're in close proximity to them by full and shake afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black of turned up in homes right after paper pain using wage reports which puts another angle to it\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know they should have a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know for those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe based but many black mistreat it's far beyond you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd I guess I'm you know\nI'm asking it into contact sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters are that some of 'em are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction files but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about with the cat will be a tuition is you know you got a really weird one explainable events so much off Asia apps to explain\nThere is a parallel with the ... black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think that government agencies are responsible for their my paper I think it's a very small catch a great\nState the January unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support his\nAge the over the years agencies may actually employed the elections are demanding black as a means to cover their tracks in other words\nIt might be paid for with the government to do that many black are all too real but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them from using the ... the most chafe\nResumes to to ... and quiet people who [noise] who they may not want to have them talking about

for this new book or yours top secret alien abduction miles\nYou're talking about uh the world in which we live we're mass surveillance is sort of a given now right\n[noise] well unfortunately in of course you know a subsequent generations Tyler do grow into a world where I've never known any different you know I'm right\nThey've Lewis a night you know before the Internet age will remember that um that was not that sort of um worldwide surveillance that we have now and um\nYou know I think that's one of the unfortunate things for future generations it's gonna be a child a normal thing full of them and and probably accept it as well\nYou know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea the fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to talk us into getting a

able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance devices like that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k.

intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what you learned Ilene abductions are all about that that idea would seemed preposterous to many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\nYes I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually the official publication diet is the first to November but people can already got it [laughter]\nBut um the the reason I wrote top secret abduction falls is because over the years I've collected a number of official documents on abductions which again take classified through the fate Information Act in the ... um the u._s. and finally I was in a position where\nI could actually sort of put the book together and you know provide the rate that wave yes it's another book on Eileen abductions bus instead of going just overall ground you know\nWind up present paper with a guy to showing\nHow falls would be put together now I start the book actually with the contract a movement of the Nineteen fifties which preceded they abduction phenomena by just about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to pay for for the would go so to speak\nBut um government agencies do ah put together falls on paper to claim to have had I mean ... for example just about all of the contact taste of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia dams ... castle\nTrue and bathroom ...\nAll of them had FBI falls out putting on them one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm ... by the FBI but yeah like ... ... ... aliens but they told the FBI that they may have had\nA governmental governments very different two hours and bordering on communism\nAnd I'm so that really opened the eyes\nOf the FBI to the extent that for example George fans hassles FBI file 'em is extremely extensively about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages [noise] um ... she was about ... and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now in the fifties excuse me in the early sixties things really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one\nI'm with the ... case which is I guess is the defining moments you follow gee when\nIt wasn't the first abduction case on record it but it was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn ... wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and hail they're coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky and then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail rights they you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd they get back home and then they start having these waves dreams and nightmares of being taken on board\nThe strange craft where they really strange creatures and be subject to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly striking is that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the moaning about to I Am\nAn essay was driving the vehicle to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cost and time to a halt\nThey should they should become known as they the vaguely interference phenomenon where they knew ... what's\nIntriguing is that they\nThey uh British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to\nA group within the British royal Airforce cause pulled a a promise to security services are sort of like the the James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how they ... they promised them security services aimed severe Rona wild man by the same time to with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling an intriguing aspect is that he told the police so they should have direct quotes that he was ...\nOh told about the time which is an interesting thing because that sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle\nOf abduction little in today's world but Ronald ... in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO coming down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to beat strange checked his watch and there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think\nYou know you put all those aspects together but has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject than thinking sort of the muse meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys telling you is crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around it takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and men or the the CIA scientists study the UFO topic and they include\nThe UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion is that a justification for going around people I condemn ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... ah first book flying saucers of land they published in the early fifties that that sold in huge figures are gigantic numbers of books was solved\nUm and I have a ... went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have they sort of a communist type of governments um the communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file on a damn ... um\nPredominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with aliens bucked\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the communist angle\nJoined a ... page with thousands of members Greek for show updates and connecting with those friends go

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finish this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] it gives me um [noise] no it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people\nAnd cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right on people's um unusual experiences and unusual states have consciousness religious experiences\nPeak experiences what whatever you want to call them so\nYeah it is kind of the privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interests and that's really ... how this book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know there's a movement in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it's sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about near death experiences and and the sciences and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture\nYou mentioned in the beginning how a believer in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of limiting a round the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase\nThat that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they ... pretty high numbers in America\nUm believe in and goes to believe in spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation in traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional ... with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about this how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very robust sense of belief and\nOther world um and spirituality and the absence a really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and\nTrying to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter or dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi versus thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves and embrace with ... with a sense of a mystery in and wonder\nI think that all those concepts are sort of uh the the bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's and that's what I Try to look out of the book\nWell you know we we don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard time too late normally\nGeorge it's too late [laughter]\nYeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort of that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kind of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given day or a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um that one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I can I ask the question of well what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for them for the listeners tonight yes go for\nAnother demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are our three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um send Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and I find I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talk about an additional spatial dimension [noise] a a direction and space or a dimension in space but different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions that has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide\nAnd then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction\nUm or a fourth dimension and this would be you know this would be an object that has links with\nHeight and something else [laughter] and the the something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive [noise]\nUm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality [noise]\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they've seen simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nWe\nDo go treasures\n[noise]\n\n\n\nWash\nWeekdays new enjoy free all news radio now these reasons why

think not a lot of people would make it right and the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a and he kind of hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide\nCertainty 'em to him but I think is his story is a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed I must say in the book he develops the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nBe able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see see I'm into the future and he writes these ideas have been a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I've had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happen uh that happened in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job who were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back and this one sided audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well so in that chapter sex um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on C. S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made a vat of that book but she talks about time slip some and and time travel um and so on and some of her books\nSo yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my presence could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of her own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe\nI'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block we are we are kind of a passing through passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future [noise]\nAnd and all of our defendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions with got depending on wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a\nProfessor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm done\nAnd all of his own laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies tackle all the time\nYeah you're right you're right at least it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how freer to make choices um and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow\nLift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension the dreaming self he said can lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moments\nAnd Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space philosophers there I'm that's what he believed as happened in some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and you could we could talk about that as a as additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he thought everybody\nEverybody's sleeping self had this degree of freedom and he he also believe that every one if they haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and and they followed he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of the all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and past events I'm sort of mixed up together well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences want to talk about say onto a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we discussed on this program before my fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search warrant visible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray sail away takes us into the break [noise]\nNo you can you show up dates with other ... spins when you go into ...

dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to the world pull them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached down and grab us and pull us up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional hum and as being that calmed down and insert themselves\nInto our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that and and the and habits book a flat land so yeah people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher rounds or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional hum and as I was kind of the higher dimensional objects than themselves into our world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal bleeps good coexist with a scientific yeah ... is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people\nIn the story so I have you know people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experienced like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and some skeptics I have different voices\nIn the book I'm Talking\nAbout what the meaning of these events are ... and\nYou know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret\nWhat's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences moments of insider intuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences them and so on\nAnd and that they are ... than using scientific concept to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book white like all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set of discourse is that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like jaded up you've done right who have these dreams ... seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't\nHe didn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went to I went to sort of popular science book um\nAnd I think that that's one point I tried to make in the book that I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concept um\nUh well I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time ... would be an example reaching out to some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know a remote viewing\nYeah\nYeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to to reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been given Vonn earth right I'm ... reaching for something else reaching beyond\nOur own subjectivity on and we talked about dreams earlier I think\nA through dreams and you know in the sixties and other times you know Americans used psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into another round and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances or who's going to a gym to\nTo reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely they're all different all different different methods\nAre so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project or consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that that doesn't that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about ... viewing and other a ...\n... has higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott book flat land for men have because\nYou know in flatland what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a length and wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is um up or down so when you're if you're a figure in in ...

sleep out view I'm a out who are prepared to uh uh be able to remember these dreams or how to ah make them more loose it\nI don't know that so I don't know Christmas is a Christmas tried that has any expertise but we'll ask him\nYeah there I mean gun in his book on dreams doesn't really talk about uh preparing yourself at night although I think there are other\nFolks out there who've written books about how to remember your dreams who do actually you know\nSay things like you know talk to yourself at night before you sleep and tell yourself you're going to remember your dream from but I think some people would say there are ways to prepare yourself but done done system is pretty simple just keep a journal under your pillow or on your night stand and right when you wake up\nWhenever it is right down on as many details as you can about the dream and he feels that by doing that um as a daily practice\nYou'll get better and better actually at remembering Adrian Adrian sort of evaporate pretty quickly after we wake up right we remember them right away then we forget them but his his journalism technique he said\nUm you know helps people remember more and more details as you go through the process so that that is pretty simple technique but there there are there are others out there who talk about um dream and dream interpretation\nThanks dug up going to take a call from a

know my solution eighty and like\nKnow Internet or wicked PTO will say that doctors will say or is this\nI should mention that during the state of my body is and I'm able to actually I don't want to say ... you know something along that lines into that and it's very scary actually yeah yeah yeah right at all I got a call\n... let's let Christopher a response thanks Bernard for the call so does sleep deprivation lead to other realities I Wonder\nYeah yeah um well she mentioned the word sleep paralysis and he also seemed to I thought I heard him say consulting doctors are we compete in there there is a category of sleep paralysis and there are\nThere are things that happen when people are falling asleep or waking up and sleep ... thing is it's scary ... is a very common\nYou know people wake up and they can't move um [noise] you know can I think I Believe that can be accompanied by\nSeeing things and and hearing things and so on so [noise]\nYou know get the question is is is merely a\nA physiological biological um\nIssue or a problem um or is it somehow opening spiritual world\nI guess my answer is I don't know I think that if you if you do look on line or consult the doctor they will they will tell you what I said which is yeah these kinds of things happen and sometimes when people are awake there in a kind of an in between state of consciousness I'm you know that they'll talk in terms of psychology and neurology\nBut um it it could also be um an opening to\nOther realities of their spiritual realities maybe I don't know you know in some cultures um in some cultures you know people have visions um [noise]\nUh that that can be traced to you know brain chemistry or some sort of a ... aspect of their of their biology or the brain chemistry but I don't think

know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders handlers to identify certain characteristics that a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious this\nThinking about this is that they're just a drop in this in some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a post office in and get whatever there is there's shipping

you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up\nIn these facilities as we speak but UPS and FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now they consider that to be security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think\nUm I I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their political here now my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far or send to the the mail to the post the postal service and show 'em you know the postal service has investigators who have deployed to try to ascertain exactly how to use\nThat just got through um
