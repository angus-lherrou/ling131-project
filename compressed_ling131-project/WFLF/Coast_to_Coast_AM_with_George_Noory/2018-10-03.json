regardless of your thoughts on whether the global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box tell me about the title first of all\nSure well that's a ... this is a book that tells you what your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over his think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAre the ice caps melting or not\n[noise] what we've had a gentle warming again we've had a degree in the last hundred and Thirty years and so there's a little bit of ... at the north pole and I'd Greenland but the amazing thing is the ah the south pole ISIS getting thicker I Love the show a picture of the Amundson Scott station\nIn in my presentations should I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nUp and they leave built\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ice is getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying this huge sheets of ice and falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew or knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is that there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about cities that one renewable energy [noise] plus or minus you\nYeah this hundred percent renewable thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind or you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries\nSo this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure uh some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the a cost of a wholesale electricity\nAnd that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution I'll\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about on my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes\nOn now they are all modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty are six major\nAir pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe at the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and he this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming matches it\nIs kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and\nClimate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nKept slowly there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of it just cycles which are uh the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are\nAre they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they cause the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that a scientist believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm\nUm the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nIn our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example than the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nWhat's to come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate would you\nSign up new ... zone or free email

Streever wrote a book called the coming global superstorm and that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and when I was wondering was\nOr is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and what his predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with Yellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming in Kentucky or is it very possible that the ban in both of those movies that very well happen\n[noise] yeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under their their call during\nThe day after tomorrow was based on the idea that um manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically\nSlowed down the Gulf Stream which is part of a the a a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian in the Pacific\nThe the theory basically was that are warming would cause a cause of water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop that current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fear though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this actual thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nOh they'll make it\nStill doing its thing well okay go ahead John\nYeah ah my dad who ah who quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're\nTalking about wind bills when I when I was\nLiving in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind will that they had and I think he out in the field that they had a big fat and it was up by twenty four\n... boots lame you know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas or were you now why don't you put a generator on that and what do\nYou know Christianity they'll come back and they said no no no it's going to cost too much I can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that\nAnd they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Want to go why hasn't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills\nA but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi George and thank you for having Steve von Loor\nBump into spoken to him several times are hurting on many shows and he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that\nAccuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends she\nNot to make the same mistake that these climate change hopes there's\nA are using a ... I Believe me I Believe you said\nA one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars ... billion ... it's quite a few of those are those are United Nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day\nOr we wouldn't have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double their two dollars a day just four dollars a day and and then I come to the point that people like frosty will reject man and a a ... a\nA young child than a\nHere's the point is you've already said that\nFor one thing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what's the process is told us is that your section thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people daily\nA dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massive rally improved airlines they're doing All right with out as his boss she will ridge a lot of them are a ton of illegally into this country because they had been tricked and deceived into thinking\nThursday humid with a mix of clouds and sun high eighty seven\nTo Ninety One news weather and traffic every ten minutes in the morning I'm Jason Crane news radio Ninety three point one W.

we're not going to go back to the days when most of the world was uninhabited we had all forests and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to\nTo NASA uh their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age no scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years\nOr any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet oh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nWould obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a if you look at ah I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about um uh there are some some um\nIndications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast but the ... it used to be a big court or a big port [noise] um in in a northwest Italy an\nExcuse to report as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise so matter what they what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like to mention I perhaps to a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and dumb what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time to weather stations a news article scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections\nThey're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky they no doubt this a lot of\nBut harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to himself I can tell you how to do it first of all any time you watch the news you are watching at Emanuel factored why\nYou're not seeing the real no a weather satellite max that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon but there's a site I it's a you\nTo one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologist she keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storms low pressure zone coming directly into California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up\nThey're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricane they can start hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zone and this is what's happening this is not\nAn act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex would have in our with our weather\n... when I hear about it in the new\nLuskin Steve's reaction to that Bruce IQ\nBruce felt might have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it is something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead [laughter]\nGo man just did it exactly right I Want to be conservative it happens to believe\nThat Adam is being gay oh engineered the came trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently at gentleman on his show\nTalking about ... put out a video called Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the body now son where people are so much shoes were hit\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were told us that they said they were going to back off cam trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to science I mean it's to the point now where you can go to a street and on the stock market on whether it didn't want her games that they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid of heart\nAnd on top of that then you got the geo engineering of the show on the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a ... man ever come up with man is not smart enough\nTo harness that power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing with Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of the climate accord 'cause it's a sham men they weren't they were doing is gripping the oil um industrial nations away describing it into the pockets of the little league\nAnd mean China's there with her sky completely with pollution not paying a dime and do it either as Russia but the United states of America was going to quite old guy now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was

about somebody in a canoe when a\nOff and on this particular day he was standing there in the noise the falls and on the opposite bank of the creek which was rewarded with toll kind of pointing ... uh pines\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee\nSo he's watching this thing going up and down and thinking to themselves what on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here now he couldn't cross the river\nAnd when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it a little in other words there were like low boroughs ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so one that was up in the high tree he could see it and\nWant to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention but he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and won't position and staring at him\nSo now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later he sees some law flinging the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy\nComing along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one\nCarrying the other one who knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something and play with your kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved houses are a\nUnited assume they're out in the rural areas right\n[noise] ... yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very interesting a story a\nInvolving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business uh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the risk of New England combined and you know\nPercent of it is uninhabitable so when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in\nI mean we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state\nAnd so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine or the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them well gardeners they will gardeners\nThis was like a match made in heaven well as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of using the gardening tool\nThe wife is saying the husband was to shovel wisdom rate was this so finally the husband get the idea that they're going to gather together with the tools they have to an inventory\nAnd then they were going to keep them all locked up with the exception of two small hands spades [laughter]\nHaving accomplished that they really have a missing some tools\nAnd they started they left to hand spades\nOn what she called the the wife pulled the heat stroke table on the patio and they were using them for partying plant\nAnd\nNo sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hand spades withdrawn they it actually called the police report in depth on the property of you know tools and this and that\nNumber and understand who would come on their land and take tools and take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel\nYou're going to Rob the place Rob the place well [laughter] bright ... and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods they found one of the shovel leaning on the tree and the wife spoke out nine feet off the ground one of these and only one piece\nHand garden trials with a rubber handle on it showed into the side of a tree nine feet up\nNine feet up show they went back to doubt they got a I guess an iPhone or something took pictures of it they brought a ladder out the husband couldn't Bush this thing it was buried in a tree several inches thick couldn't budget\n[noise] so they had recalled the police and told them the story about\nFinding the shovel in the woods showed the cop shoveling the tri ... everybody was baffled by you know the turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was\nThe cop told them look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass it on to the detectives [noise] well I said the long and short of it was a couple of days later they came outside\nAnd the guardian behind the house had been trampled down there were huge footprint in bed or tomatoes were taking the head of lettuce one mashed\nAnd whatever had done this which was obviously a big foot\nI stepped right over the fence not using the gate there was a gate on the garden and it just step right over the warrior winning had it's full of feed\nAnd then left they recall the uh the police over to see what had happened that transpired\nAnd he actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had reports periodically of people saying they show these big tall creatures coming in their property of walking here and now it's\nJust it's convincing yeah it's not like it's not like these things on being seen it and not being talked about which\nIs a very odd thing you know you know George thinking back to us to\nTalk about that when we come back while you're at the top of the hour\nTalking about UFOs encounters big

lady from the humility is is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting\nUh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor who was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of things but time nickel and they form this unlikely friendship\nAnd turned that into a hiking partnership\nAnd they had run across a couple of big foot ... messing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ... and the professor said that it sounded like\nA Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with no this is a Russian speaking immigrant saying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was one step above the Bering Sea and it did these things or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they talked on a pulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while\nAnd they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ... and they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant and they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the uh the uh yesterday and the abominable below snowman I have no idea uh I have a Sanders since book the bomb Rose Bowl a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading uh an encyclopedia on the creature a and yet getting back to what I said earlier\nNone of this stuff means anything\nTo the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about big foot or a hoax the film is a hoax all of the uh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taken everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of ... what the majority of the people out there I think about it so that's one of the things I Love about coast\nYou know a a we'll tune in because we're hearing things that we can get\n... nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos in big encounters where's the Tania\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the dead falls incident but one day they'll share with you a was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys ... we're working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this amount and then a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and then the second day uh the focus was on that of ah getting attention being saved so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words held than SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green bows and that night they decided to go on a night hike\nTo see what it was like a navigating\nAround in the dark\nAre now during the day they had climbed up the side of the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area or at night\nFor the hike well when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear\nHe had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose your own monarch yellow or that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail\nOne or the kid says hey what's that and they noticed in the distance of light moving around in the woods now of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a battery operated lantern\nBut then they realized that this thing started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in or around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they've been trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believed there were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey can see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but\nIt was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming aiding the trees around it\nSo that the parents and the guy who was that bright\nYeah I mean it's it it it's a glowing light ... around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's doing something really weird [noise]\nHe described a picture this George a two inch wide let's just say ... a two foot wide beach ball he described it go on ... ... coming out of the size of this thing as being like when you blow bubbles through want as a child okay\nSo this thing is coming out of the side of this or and making its way down to the ground [noise]\nAnd what blows my mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like twenty times are thirty times the volume of the orbit self and yet the war was on changed and this thing was attached to it\nNow they start to see a big foot\nAppearing in secondary glob coming down and they described it as being like in his state\nThere is still

they would start spending money in in large quantities and\nElections and certainly there is some corporate involvement on election there there's a lot of debate about just how big that is what this shows though is that some big companies are actually voluntarily saying you know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nAnd when when you're talking about interfering in elections with money you talked about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWorld show companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates\nBut they can support candidates and the other way it's such an independent expenditures they can support political parties they can support organization that then go on to support candidates such AS Party [noise] ah you know the Democratic

program has sharply divided the tech community between supporters who say it represents the future of secure elections and critics who argue it does little to fix the problems inherent in online voting more from Danny Boyle and national security correspondent at the Washington Times Dan what's happening\nHappening in West Virginia is that they are trying to wrestle with the issue how to process ballots from their residents who are overseas are serving in the military [laughter] nice balance\nTimes are difficult to get in on time because it's maps of the ballot so West Virginia has taken a pretty bold step of saying actually use a smartphone applications to allow folks overseas to vote and and kind of the most experimental way or that exists in the country right now\nWow All right so several presidential elections ago we would not even have considered this from a technology standpoint but these days it has to be asked what's the uh the hacking riskier\n[noise] well I Know that that's a big issue because a lot of folks\nHave said you know what what on earth is going on here you know in the last election twenty six to like you guys are talked extensively about in Russia

fellow here in Washington Richard stroke or\nWho works on dealing with watching them trying to get the U.S government to adopt one block ... thanks it's great for a little ... he goes to the argument that I just said that this marching allows for a deeper level of verification ... um\nI think what's what's interesting I'm\nFloored that Virginia is a all across the country it's a battleground state this year with senator democratic Senator Joe Manchin he's up for reelection\nA ... and the neck and neck race with other Republican\nAttorney general Patrick Morrisey so people are really watching the game and so this is a state with a Republican slipping while they're going to have a pretty strong chance of maintaining a majority and expect them to maintain it well it gives them a better chance to take the take the Senate back\nSo far allies are really watching thing that's going to be a real close race and those that were seatbelts could be extremely important\n... and again it's not
