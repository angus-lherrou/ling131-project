that it was a rocket launch saved is a great deal of time and a\nTime and trouble first case I'd like to talk about comes from the fourth of October last Thursday night or Thursday night eight days ago that is a father and daughter professional driving team were driving a tandem Rick from California to Texas in southeast Arizona\nSuddenly the daughter explained she was driving the father was in the bunk getting some rest she explained very loudly for her father to get up into the cabin immediately he didn't know what was going on so he jumped up and his daughter described a very peculiar event\nShed seeing a what she thought was a meteor going from North to south in front of her truck because she drove to the east\nAnd about two minutes later looking in approximately the same direction she saw a disc shaped object she described it as being parents do or paradox grain I have no idea what paradise is but it's somewhere between yellow and green descend vertically\nAnd here we're here is where it gets really exciting George\nBut daughter according to the father's account and this is posted to our website had an almost insatiable desire to steer her truck across the

much says he is on line for me to find that out\nWell how many do you mind Jeffrey believe how many people believe that demons exists if you went out and pulled people\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there is there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings\nOur own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you can leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of\nNegative emotional energy drugs or something\nI practice something called modern actresses and\nAnd that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel ... and ... it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they uh uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environment and generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra citizen deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has\nTo be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises difference from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest is an effect would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest is ... and ...\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who\nAre agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion wasn't touching anybody anyway this really is not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete\nIndividual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it and it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people\nAre from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be dealt with you know sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family\nThat's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it cleared out ones and I then I teach people how to maintain the clarity of their bodies\nTheir energy fields or and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion I'm not the only one\nA qualified extra system just about every religion\nBut they all but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of work and past lives um I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are\nThis universe I said before on on one of my appearances this universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you\nKnow do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which calling me all the time\nI'm even evangelical Christians have you know it it they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for more at the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website starkly dot com his book is called power protection will come back and take your calls as well perhaps you've had a\nDemon exposed situation to that with us too\nNumerous details Lewis show or a gift sign up for the ... ... email newsletter will be free at ... dot com [noise]\nShe didn't know what I'm going to be laid it\nAnd so people will be calling on comfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy generated we don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session it all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nThat's a good mix them costs just for you know most all energy more than people do next\nStop let us go to C.

then you have a\nA R D I F dot com cardio mobile faith in your pocket you can take any Katie anytime anywhere right when you deal is\nCould be seeing things from the other side sometimes\nYou know and and sometimes not and and negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves\nWhich unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues physical brain problems a depression anger issues unhappiness\nA overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line\nAnd being able to reach into the physical realm\nAffect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is it's not so much of an immediate dug but actually\nBeen working on them for a long time and they can cause physical injuries to even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work I'm doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly light shot out from it hit me right in the back and it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know have looked at in a you know get some light medication for it\nIs it the demonic Stewart had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is the\nYou know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack and it can be physical because demonic spirits study how to do these things\nThe non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark rooms that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and essentially that is very connected to the physical realm maybe the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to Jim in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or ordered ... sort of like I go to the other side gets off drugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say no I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steal your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about while you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for spirits\nOut there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things\nAnd trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore the physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's not everybody's disaster or anything we just have negative energy issues and also getting if there's some kind of negative spirit attack\nNecessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or ... or ... whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual is hey this is my main concern not dealing with the negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't or other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get ... down\nGeorgia I Am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm I'm On for that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kind of stuff at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past life helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift I could ever be giving is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they do love it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is Jeffrey ... would you please ... you can find everything

tweak questions for Tom and he'll pass them on to us and we'll get going with that too but let's go to the phones let's pick it up I'm going to keep in Virginia to get things started Hi Keith welcome good morning\nHi George warning thank you sure and uh [noise]\nOn your topic I Can't believe that actually want to talk about a related to that places in which people who do believe that they do believe that they saw that but actually did not and perhaps her desk why that\nCan be um some possibilities okay [laughter] um I I Want to talk about a an example of that including I'm\nA doctor Christine Blasey Ford and I'm Brett Kavanaugh who both appear to be very certain infants here and their claims\nThey did a they did and in many people yeah many people\nFelt like a Ford was very credible\nAnd she said she was a hundred percent certain\nOak her accusations against him [noise] and I want to mention um several years ago the late ... called a magazine [noise] regarding Prozac I'm alarmed monster that I created\nShe joined the board of the international coalition for drug awareness which was founded by a coast to coast am gas and like Tracy or at the book Prozac panacea\nOn Dora and for Thirty years his research government approved prescription mind altering drugs regarding your previous guest she actually says that ah another name for sorcery which you mentioned the holy Bible or pharmacology\nI Believe and [noise]\nAnd she said that that actually among some of the bad effects of\nThese got rid of her prescription mind altering drugs including fs horizon added crafts and so that they create actual portal for negative dark and even demonic spirits but they also a interfere with people's ability to\nI have a spiritual\nThing positive spiritual experiences including belief in God some people when they go on the drugs they stopped believing in God [noise]\nThere is a boy who uh is featured in a Youtube video and like Tracy hope everybody could watch why it took them to school and in that he is uh basically describe this when he went on these medications um\nWas waking dream state and\nOh he he didn't know the difference between reality and um you know his delusions what he was stealing and it almost ended up very tragically hit it going to jail for this this boy\nLots of people do yeah but he he later you know God out or because the people knew that there is really something wrong this this boy didn't belong there they didn't believe that\nIt really is responsible for that and sure enough you know it was going to the medications but they believed him\nBut the people believe in yeah and and what I what I Want to talk about is what he believed that he was experiencing in this weekend dream state which is common and trace that's about\nAll these cases and David what's your clue suicide and domestic violence workplace violence she ... she\nOf the school shootings are involved for kids that were not on\nNot on these drugs\nAnd so the bottom line is what I'm suggesting that is that it's possible\nThat because some of the side effects are a dilution hallucinations and I am Tracy has a false memories center article about a Roseanne Barr who accused her parents of\nMolesting her and later and that was after she was on the medication that is right and then later she she realized that that was not correct at all and she was really certain that it had happened\nBut uh but but then you know she\nAnd she would only ask one off of that she would have passed a lie detector test because she believed it\nExactly and so this is what a I think is important for people that know and and who has a documented thousands of cases over the thirty years of the things and what I'm saying you know in in my previous call and I I didn't get to\nInclude all of this but I but basically I had a dream in which it was very vivid\nI had mentioned that you know I was told by somebody who had died twenty five days before that he would feed me and Thirteen months and I said how do you now when he said the holy ghost told me [laughter] and [noise]\nAnd I I you know I knew it was a dream and but the I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream and the voice of a loose a tree but\nAfterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr ... in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has and consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream sure she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on the mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that but we've got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nYou know in June okay where you\nAre I'm engaged in ... um I had a I'm well thank you and I couldn't believe it I saw before I had a I had done a little stint in jail and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know and um and I was in a bone in my life where I didn't really know\nIf God was real or if the devils real all this you know when I started reading the Bible and everything and then I'm\nGoing back to the point when I was down and you know whatever and uh uh I asked God when I was like well you know your real angels on everything Israel you know show me because I Would like to know I Would like to believe I so I\nIt's probably ... ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later then what happened when\nI started seeing these little things like with people like a Beagle like these little spirits and stuff\nAnd I'm a well I I think this one guy had three of them\nRight and it seemed like everybody and he had frenzy everything he did he touch must go I mean you have a one my ... and you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's monkey you didn't have none okay now these kids that you know\nYou go oh it's a glass of water without knocking over some breaking it it's something told me that he was going to get an angel [laughter] but he just didn't have one at that time\nAnd I'm leaving it was kind of be just to show me\nThat you know how it works warning or no and then I bought a church in a ...\nI tell my uncle about it and he told me oh you

T. bones oh God LA here here's the funny thing George\nI. T. Bones Are like called the police and I called the fire engine and all that because I was sure I'd kill their passenger oh my God yeah well it\n[noise] we call the sheriff we called the police and they were on their way and the fire trucks showed up in the car took off\nIt took ... years it took off running it on a trail and parts all which they catch him in\nThe ... fire and just showed up says where they went down the road all that far\nWhy would they take off unless they were hiding something probably isn't drugs or something yeah only they stole a car\n... car was pretty torn up to begin with but I couldn't believe that the that the lady just moved here and went down their own\nThat's a that's a great story tough thanks appreciate that ... let's go to Angela in Fairfield, Ohio hello Angela\nMorning jarred Maureen for taking my call my pleasure thank you\nI was listening to Tucker Carlson of the Fox news channel ... um [noise] last night and he had a far left liberal female guest on that's had a group of evil which is we're going to get together after capital of New York this month\nAnd I don't remember that day they did give a date and I don't remember I don't have a computer to check it out but anyway they're going to put a hack on justice Brett Kavanaugh\nYou know my son I Would like to ask the good which is the listening right now to cast a spell to block the heck\nNot a bad idea the guy's been sworn in he's our justice let's give them a chance to do what he does\n[noise] I agree one hundred percent and I listen to to both of them and that lady came across and I'm not totally and balanced to me um\nBut she was and they both seemed to be telling the trolling in her\nFace her hair kept falling in her face she ... the ... old and I I'm you know she just I I think she has a mental problem\nWell we don't know that but uh you know they both came across as telling the truth they didn't come across as bad people and it was just a horrible situation though just horrible\nAnd mixed up with someone else\nThat could be that could very well be a war you know ... years if he did anything if he did anything he should have said look\nI was Seventeen years old and I was with my buddies and I didn't do anything bad I just you know was too aggressive and I'm Sorry if he did but he didn't you know he said he did not final Texan tweet for the night what do we have ...\nDo you think cabinet read that story which is\nOh I'm sure you know somebody's got to [laughter] probably uh this one from Justin in Fort Myers Florida beat this when George ... a year and a half ago I was in the bank and it got robbed him into the manager had a gun and disarmed the robber now that was something I Can't believe I saw\nThe manager had a gun in disarmed or they didn't have a security guard is already taking doesn't say that\nBut he's ... that's pretty risky though for the manager is number one what they always say let them take the money the banks insured you know don't\nYou know confront them somebody could get shot you might have had a good opportunity and took it and let them go you catch them\nLater you get your pictures on video everybody knows who everybody is now\nBut you never there I mean he could on his back to them the could have been a lot of things\nMy point is that if you're going to pull a gun like that it's very dangerous people could have been shot innocent people let them go\nIf a guy who's robbing a bank the newer in their view run in the store some guy comes in with a gun and says you know give me the money you open it up give them the money and Bush um well I agree but if he turns his back on you jump on no no when he turned his back\nWell because we don't know we weren't in there so we don't know what the circumstances were\nAnd what if he's got another guy in there hiding or something and you're in trouble you know okay Thanks Tom next to Barbara Los Angeles welcome to the show hey barb what's up\nMan I sure can
