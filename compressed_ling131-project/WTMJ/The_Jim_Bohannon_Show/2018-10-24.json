caused a delight to from uh Pittsburgh Katie ... evening Doug welcome to the program\nHi Jim thanks for taking my call I enjoy your show thank you what I what I wanted to ask the mayor about uh Pittsburgh gone through a similar answer major from having industries here when the bio medical and scientific cetera um\nAnd it's doing well the reason is doing well however the city schools the Pittsburgh city schools struggle year after year fewer and your families are sending their students to the Pittsburgh public school they'll go anywhere else private school\nA Catholic school charter schools that are ... how is the Oklahoma City public schools\nAre they going through the transformation of the economy in your city\nWell it's it's a little inconsistent certainly we're we're a little different in that we have twenty four school districts that are inside the city limits of Oklahoma City and so you have all sorts of different success stories inside those twenty four\nBut the largest district as about forty percent of the population\nAt the Oklahoma City school district and it's it's a you know performing poorly a similar to what you're describing in Pittsburgh so I mean the the urban public school setting it's still very much a stressful situation across the country\nIn Oklahoma City there are a lot of good public schools are out all around you know that center part of the city\nAnd people have gravitated and that's part of the you know the sprawl issue that took place over the last few decades people were searching for a better education for their kid\nAnd so we're trying to get more options you know charter schools and at other options for kids that for for parents that want to come in and provide more density and the core of the city but I don't know the single mayor out there that satisfied with the level of education and their inner city district\nYou mentioned charter schools I wanted to ask you more about how successful they've been\n[noise] oil most of our biggest success stories are charter schools are not that I Can't tell you that they're all high performing but a lot of them are um and um you know our\nOthers attempt at a charter school downtown and you know it it's run by a board of our business leaders um who you know kind of insurance success and uh you know there's nothing magical about about the model it's not that they have a bigger budget they have a smaller\nBudget it's not that they get the hand picked her kids they don't any kid can go there that lives in the district a but they've\nTaken out some of the inefficiencies I think that our public school system is played by and created a model that puts more dollars into the classroom so you know in in that one instance things could be working better I\nLiked the idea that parents have choices um and in in Oklahoma City there's a lot of choices\nYou know I I Know of course you're acquisition of the uh it'd be a thunder franchise and also the opening it part of the maps three project was the the opening of the new stadium for the Oklahoma City ran off your AAA a baseball team are sports franchise is a good way to enhance the city because I Know some\nSome urban areas have become a disgusted with the exorbitant demands from most sports franchise owners\nWell it's been a big positive for us I I think one of the differences is if you if you don't have\nA a major league sports franchise and you get one it is on a superficial level up a level of quality that you didn't have before and I'm not saying it should name this much but it does and and the fact that\nSuddenly your sports teams are playing teams in New York Chicago Los Angeles it and that matters because the image of your city to a certain extent as who your sports teams play\nAnd there's a level of quality that a major league sports team can provide to a city the size of Oklahoma City I think it helps or CEOs attract talent from around the country\nWhen you know you offer somewhat a job at a company in Oklahoma City that person no matter where they live in the United states they're going to think of themselves if I take this job I have to live in Oklahoma City or if I take this job I get to live in Oklahoma City\nAnd having a major league sports team is an asset that would get more people that would be more likely to take that job\nOn on a millennial basis my my input from young people is that they want to live in a city that's culturally relevant\nAnd that includes the pop culture and a major league sports team mates shoot culturally relevant dumbing when Russell Westbrook and Paul George to name a couple of our players you know choose to live here and and choose to sign contracts here when they're\nContracts by every other team in the league seemingly um that sends a message that this is a good place to live\nUp in the I think that when sports starts to become tired in a city is when they have more than one franchise and people get tired of subsidizing what new facility after another new facility and so I I get it you know you have three sports teams like Seattle there\nWell we're coming up with a break here that that doesn't move here I'm going to finish

tonight with a man who was a\nQuite familiar with the problems in urban America he was a\nFour terms the mayor of Oklahoma City and he's the author of the next American city when you speak of the the next American city uh how how next is that is this like a five years or ten years down the road or is this city a popping up right now\nWhile you're cities are never reached their journey at least they end up their journey there always evolving and what we're talking\nAbout is starting to purposely create inner cities an urban corps where young people get around in a in an environment that has fewer automobiles um ... manatees and instill you know looks set to call you by the cost of living\nUm and amenities yield of that generation\nOr any you know it's hard to generalize 'cause every cities differ\nBut almost every city out there in that category we're talking about has some sort of urban revitalization taking place and young people that are attracted to it there's an urbanization going on all over the world and midsized metros are capitalizing right now for the foreseeable future\nWhile he's six six five oh jumbo return to a call from Brian in Ozark, Missouri small town about that far from a a a somewhat smaller midsize cities Springfield the good evening Brian\n[noise] hey there they're fine fair question for your guest sure where you said you have earthquakes in black guy that\nI think it played a role yeah there's here's my question is given no we've had a minor earthquakes in Branson\nHere in Springfield actually oh are\nWe got a new record fall there is no but we're here but we have the presence of your show or if the black or white or maybe they're not your fault of ground or\nDon't think that they needed ... votes or impact or which is by the way based in in southeastern Missouri a down toward the roughly the Memphis metro area and along the Mississippi River I don't think that the New Madrid influence extends as far west as Oklahoma\nAre your thoughts are Mr Mayor\nOh your thoughts ...\nWell I I yeah I think I think he's just as I say there's a connection between the oil and gas exploration and uh and the earthquake it does seem like there's a connection there so you know central Oklahoma was already on a\nFault it was probably more susceptible where these water injections took place um and like I said you know they pretty much diminished at this point because I think the scientists to work really hard and they know that\nYou know you you can't survive a politically um if you're the cause of these ... a nerve or being a earthquakes but\nI think most people in Oklahoma have been very patient with oil and gas industry\nThat's been a significant part of our economy for a long long time but most Oklahomans are thrilled that United States is in more control of its energy future going forward that we band earned and oil and gas industry playing a major role in our caught\n'em but you know at some point their their technology is got to catch up and figure out a way to do what you bring up the oil and gas but they like to bring out without causing harm on all the rest of the\nDoubt it it'd be Oklahoma's economy of course a a began a pretty much wants to uh uh the presence of a lot of oil was discovered in and of course the automobile really coming into its own just about the time that Oklahoma became a state back in Nineteen oh seven\nOr if the Oklahoma economy has been tied with energy for for many years is the the state's economy a skill that directly tied to energy or has it been in effect diversified\nYeah uncle I'm sitting here supply but this is talk\nUntil Oklahoma as the state is overly reliant on the oil and gas through the string and as a result it it's a it's called me and it's tax revenues cyclical based on you know how the oil and gas industry is doing but in the oil and gas industry is going through such a transcript ...\nAll of the technology of the advancements that they'd been baking that made them more efficient at the street or you know with the current price which is much lower than it was just a few years ago they were able to make a profit\nUm I I Would say we've already reached peak oil and gas industry it just simply takes fewer people to extract oil and gas grill it's more technology driven and they get more or less gas that it was just go well used to [noise] um and so the result of that as a more efficient model\nOr one day they'll pull and pull a fever people but that has really helped the United states determine its own energy future we need to be less reliance on foreign oil\nAnd uh I like the only gas industries you know it's it's been a wonderful job in in creating a better resources for our country here in the United states\nYou mentioned the progress would you made that one cent sales tax I'm Wondering the extent to which Oklahoma City depends on uh the sales tax versus let's say the property tax or is that one of those few urban areas which as an income tax even what what is the basis for Oklahoma City taxes [noise]\n[noise] well most of our operations comes from a sales tax and most of our capital agents come ... property tax\nThe uh the maps program is a little bit outside of the scenario I just described as it is for capital projects as well but in general it's all government in Oklahoma but is funded operation lay by sales tax and capital by property tax\nWill take a break come back with more with our guest Mick Cornett his book the next American city could be yours back in the moment\nI'm Jay
