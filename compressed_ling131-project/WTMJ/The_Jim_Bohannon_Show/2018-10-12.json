Jim bode talks\nGoing to be talking to them or something but I brought up before on this program and has long been my view the Congress has unconstitutionally advocated if a bar in the constitution and essentially\nHas passed along the business of law writing but who's to say tackling hot potatoes and blow yourself on the record\nTo these other elected\nThree litter agencies and uh I I've always felt that the ... I Know the the reason for your Bones Are cowards and they want to keep the job of the time you tackle a serious problem\nIt probably is still a problem because there was some controversy attached to it and politicians hate that well and that's what we've got elected for was to tackle these issues\nNow I see that that thought has been flushed out in a considerable study my Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who has written judicial fortitude and published by counter books subtitled the last chance to rein in the administrative state that Peter thank you for joining us tonight\nMy pleasure good to be what you can\nAbsolutely are your thoughts if you would on on the witness trend really began and that how it has managed to avoid being challenged in the courts because to me it as it is a uh imminently challenge a bowl of there would be such a word\nBut it's it's a very much challenger bill and I hope that this book will encourage the court to start looking at this issue but it really began I think in ... what was called the progressive era between the Eighteen eighties in about Nineteen twenty\nBy the Gallup ...\nDid you survive\nHeavy see\nI'm Jay Garner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rate stays locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win\nCall us today at eight hundred quicken or going to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only valid uncertain prettier Trayvon covered crossing permission ignition housing winter like it's not that he thinks analyst number thirty thirty initial conditions are exclusion may play\nFrom a massive cactus falling out of homes\nWith beer advancing our cars would be covered have talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre ...\nAnd you're right ... thanks and continued for example and everything [noise]\nWe're glad you're with us on the jumbo ... one of these six six five oh jumbo when he's six six five oh five or six to six\nBoy I gotta say it's about time and thank goodness for Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who's the website isn't it leaves their initials H. E. I. dot org somebody needs to be done about this tendency of Congress to pass the buck\nTo the other like the bureaucrats and those three letter agencies and elsewhere but the three letters or a good place to start\nOf essentially writing general outlines of laws and letting him be the agency spilling the details right the laws\nAnd are we going to be done about that uh we have a call from dark who calls in from Wilmington, Delaware to speak with our guests are Peter Wallison the good evening doc welcome\nYou for taking my call is ... just a one or two quick questions for his ... just genocide list of course there's always\nMr walls and where you see this court editing under President Trump on her opportunity under us as a sports such abduct Kavanaugh and if there is no justice appointed a say a second trumped or what you just wanted\nYou to court foster turning back to the it out of the cameras are not are you hopeful for the future outs are what are your thoughts on that sir\nBut did you have two questions that that was just that was\nYour ... going on just over the shooter that we could turn back the tide of I Would say almost fifty years\nAll right very good of a director do we go again in other words I yeah I Will go to Jim Cavanaugh tipped the balance and to actually show some judicial boarded dude\nYeah I actually think that that this is very very hopeful\nI at in the book I talk about the position of each of the justices but I say that we're the appointment of Kevin ... there are five justices on the court who I think are ready to modify some of the major decisions that have led us to this position\nI'm the one that is most important here is one called ... the Chevron case or Chevron deference where the court many years ago in Nineteen eighty four\nA declared that the lower courts had to defer to the to the interpretations have various agencies of what powers they had been given by Congress that's very strange because it leaves the courts out entirely and so\nThat that decision in particular has been a warrant for the agencies to increase their powers tremendously and interpret the authorities\nThat they had gotten from Congress to grow their powers now with Kavanaugh there he's a constitutional list he's a text you list just just\nLike Gorsuch is and the other three people including especially Justice Thomas who I I dedicated the book too because he has always been concerned about this question\nAnd now he has four other justices I think on the court who are ready to take the steps that Alexander Hamilton expected them to take when he wrote that ... that the federal is Seventy eight paper that I've that I've named the book after\nA while it it's just remarkable you know I understand Congress being leery of hot potatoes it's cowardly it's chicken but that is understandable they have to face the voters the courts don't what what are they so reluctant about\nThat well I think they really are concerned about not having any a direct support from the public\nSo they don't need support from the public good I mean if we don't even associate with the public they they have their own circles for cocktail parties in the like\n[laughter] I agree that there is of that but Alexander Hamilton was white and when he talked about fortitude because he was saying yes okay the courts are independent and the reason he was writing about it is because he had he had been asked why are you giving the courts\nThe judges lifetime appointments in this democracy\nOn why shouldn't they stand for election and the argument he made in this federal is Seventy eight is they need lifetime appointments so they can stand up to the elected branches in a democracy the elected branches the president that Congress are bound to have more power because they're speaking\nFor the people the courts are only speaking for the constitution\nI'm so they had been since that\nThose decisions in Nineteen thirty five\nAnd the effort by the president after that to a point seven new members and that's changed the entire nature of court um they had been reluctant to take on the elected branches so that I think is a reason and we have to get the courts to start doing\nThat well we certainly do Alan on the road in South Dakota tonight good evening\n[noise] hey there thanks for taking my call sure [noise] I just mentioned just turned it on here and I didn't I haven't [noise] but uh your guests mentioned\nYou know he said that uh\nWhere Republican sooner agree with that and I agree with you know kind of the\nTime frame will be the problem started I you know it's also around that time were from what I've read where you start became you know people start calling us democracy is not a Republican I heard your guest said several times referring to our democracy\nWell I mean look at one of the ... we have a representative democracy that's a while though and maybe that's because until recently it has not been technologically feasible first of all they have one great town hall meeting or we will now of course read the point where that is technologically feasible although I think it would be a terrible idea\nUh we we can even talk about that a bit later on but but the point is we have a representative democracy that is a republic we elect people who make these decisions about how it works or anything you want to add to that a leader\nNow I think that's exactly right I think ... many conservatism afraid and I'm certainly one of ...\nAnd the ... the leader\nNow I think that's exactly right I think ... many conservatism afraid and I'm certainly one of them\nMany that many conservatives are afraid of the term democracy but we have to understand that the that the founding fathers actually thought of the people governing through a legislature\nAnd the legislature of being elected by the people would make the major decisions that is still a democratic structure and so\nShould not worry about calling something a democracy that democracy that fit the founders didn't like was that democracy where ... which is called the direct democracy where the people make the decisions themselves immediately in in in some kind of I'm kind of\nA conference or structure but that's not what we\nHave the old town hall meetings in the building I don't know we'll loves a good idea that's right so we'll we'll get we'll come back to that as time allows but right now I'm calling from Sharon in ... Missouri hello Sharon the go ahead\nYeah kind of like damn I missed it wants and maybe I Am right on base back um\nThere is a movement to have a constitutional convention and get one a couple of the things that I Hope comes out of it if we do have one is that we had cats that term limits for the legislative branch and me reigning power of\nExecutive orders as the president now if that is down\nAnd the legislature cannot I guess you have to worry about running for office and is there like it\nWould that change that balance so that the courts possibly would any stat that to the plate a little bit more because it's like we have to take more responsibility All right\nWell the way the way I see it in the way I discuss it in the book is that if the court actually step up and say that certain laws that Congress passes have passed too much legislative power to the executive branch if the court to ... or ... would actually say that\nThen that would force Congress to make these decisions itself the ... for Congress as Jim had said before is that it's too easy for just a pass on to these agencies all of the major decisions\nOut of control\nYeah certainly on one hand it someone has\nTo step in and rein it in and that can be done\nYes well it it can be for people love if people decide do or if they're forced to Robert in Burlington, Vermont hello\nGood evening to things on the other and I use it for me to talk about the constitution big a deal that they left off of close to his living and changeable a document\nWell out of the comments and I made were in regard to those with that viewpoint that the constitution a is a a document that we could make up was we go along if we don't have to like what's in it it's not a view I happen to share but that would allow people to follow that was all set right\nNow I just thought it would be the fact is is yes it does it change will document but only the voters of the country are you allowed to change\nWell no actually the voters of the country don't have any direct say so in changing it there are methods that involve the both the uh it usually we have used the constitutionality of the Congress although the beach the conventions could also be the method of proposing\nA constitutional amendments and then ratification could take place through three quarters of the state legislatures or through a a convention failed and three quarters of the states the voters per se do not have a direct say so except insofar as they elect the people who do have a say so uh Peter\n[noise] yeah well that that's exactly right that had to have the system with ...\nUm but it it's a important just to understand we have been ... that the procedures in place the mechanism in place to govern ourselves and we are not allowing it to happen we're allowing the government to slip away\nOut of their hands into the hands of bureaucrats in Washington yeah that's the problem\nThat is the problem but of course it's a problem but will not be going away until the people who are quite happy with the system are forced to to change their ways will be back with more in just a moment\nFrom a massive cactus falling out a

her and in that or if it's back Congress went along with it however a wise or unwise decision may have been\nUh it wouldn't be the subject that we're talking about\nIt wouldn't be the subject we're talking about tonight I don't believe\nThat no not unless it was an action that was not the rise by Congress this is exactly the kind of thing that could happen if Congress hasn't authorized it um and one of the problems is that this very general legislation that Congress\nPasses sometimes allows administrators even conservative administrators to take things into their own hands and do things that Congress had never intended\nExactly in that in fact that's what we're talking about that that would be unfortunate but if there were specific authorization by a majority of both houses of Congress it\nIt uh a ... in other words if the authorization will specific enough then you would have had in effect a law uh presumably that was passed Gary into Butte, Montana good evening Gary\n[noise] getting ... thanks for having me on the shores pick up things and then get on on\nYour your I agree with almost everything your guest has said I'm a minor point I I Believe we should call it a constitutional Republican and instead of a Democratic Republic but that's my\nMy aunt yes that it really is we're getting into ... federally\nYeah yeah yeah it it does mean something to me but I don't have the time to sit to explain it on your show but anyway um and then the\n... the main thing is that I Want to call about is the constitutional convention and that that is something that we definitely do not want to do there's there's conservatives out there that wants to do this and think I think\nIt would be a very good thing to do but I I agree with your guest it could be a runaway costs us ... read the history of our convention they weren't supposed to um go off and right\nHere but you're not going to get anything that would be authorized but it's such a convention that could take effect without\nActually having thirty eight states ratify in one form or another let's not forget the articles of confederation were falling apart at the time that that happened and I would I Would just add one more thing given fact we don't go that route\nThen most of the major changes that need to be made right now be of term limits of Congress be at the no budget no pay for Congress\nBe a a an amendment that would say that Congress may not pass a law that affects the general public doesn't affect them equally all those things you can forget about\nWe are at an impasse and the mechanism as if this guy has currently been used it's already it's in the constitution but as it has been used today we're all amendments start with Congress then we can forget about any of those things ever happening a\nBigger one thing they're ... and I and I think much of what you said is something I agree with but\nLet's focus instead of having a an argument about whether we should have a

auto accidents or anything like that or a sexual assault or a lot of things I don't want our kids to suffer from both the ordinarily bumps and bruises of life [noise]\nThe the day to day method of of learning by doing and by making mistakes that's a necessary part of growing up as in fact that's the goal you really want your your child to grow up that's\nHow you do it that's how you grew up is how I grew up making mistakes\nI a good look back on my mistakes in in various categories there are a few I suppose that I made that look back and I still cringe about many of them I laugh about one of his eye dumb [noise]\nA at a lot of them I can look back in a positive way and say that that wasn't fun but I'm a better person because of it\nAnd it sounds to me that there is a whole generation not everybody in the generation but but I ate a major subset of this generation of parents engaged in such behavior\nAs if they\nNever thought about it [noise]\nAs I say it it is difficult for me to even conceive of of any parent who who thought about this for more than twenty seconds to not be able to figure out that this was a terrible thing you're doing you're setting up your children to

that they don't learn except maybe they learned that a mommy and daddy will always be there to make it all better [noise]\nNot the way it's supposed to be and again I Am sure that not every parent does this I Do a few parents in that age group bought a lot but the ones I Know\nActually raise their kids with discipline and with standards of performance and with punishment\nWhen they they fall by the side with correcting behavior all the things that are yes hassles ... and sometimes even pay for the parents but that's what you signed up for when you when you reproduce stomach you're having a kid\nThis is what you're supposed to do [noise]\nIt's it's interesting that that we have a generation of young parents who apparently can't figure that out [noise]\nEverybody I'm Talking to right now talking with a one eight six six five oh Jim boat\nWe were all raised by parents who started out in life making mistakes who grew up who had children and they let us make mistakes\nSome more mistakes than others some lessons more painful than others but the general rule of thumb was I Want my child to grow up to be an adult\nSo that they can cope I won't always be here people who are parents get older they die the kids were supposed to carry out that's the whole point I Want to produce kids who can make a go of it after I'm gone [noise]\nIt it just strikes me as I said I'm just wondering uh how you feel about that I Am I to old fashioned them I stuck in the past ... lacking compassion for young people who should always be protected from every conceivable moment of pain embarrassment are

not happy about it but I accept it but it sounds like\nMuch more than that it sounds like a trip to universal trend to be sure but enough of a trend that\nYou have to wonder are these people thinking\nAt all I don't think we're talking about parents who sit down and and and deliberately calculates this is how I sabotage my child's life they're not they're not saying that to themselves they're not that they may be doing it but that's not what they're trying to do\nJust uh just sad and bizarre as I say life comes with challenges\nAs they say no pain no gain\nSome pain of course we
