C. where one eight six six five oh Jim bow at the Allen calls in from Dallas this evening and listen to the cliff five Seventy good evening welcome Alan\n... going to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind to live album\nFall here he was spending that my experience has been I'm sixty one years old I've I've tried ... travel and most of the major freeways in America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith with on an on the major three ways but then if you run into a situation where like in the south and North Carolina where the Florence hurricanes are flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou need to make sure that when you're when you're going now go go on the major freeways first and then wait for the detour then that's when you should you should start on the side roads and says it because there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get out of the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay on declare major uh interstate and then and then then if it happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then go to the side routes that's all I'm saying\nAll right well let's see what I think over because to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me and then he\nHe's absolutely correct but importantly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to watch those rows you should at least be familiar with them so when you're traveling on a leisurely um track\nTo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there now and the other people are going to meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several of the major roads to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those roads\nSo when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline it's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say before let's say you're on a major artery and you're told that are being asked to take place\nYou can easily tax the email from your phone that hey I'm taking this beach and we're going to go to through this direction to that location so this way\nFamily members who you rely on\nEven as the people on the other side cannot get that say no meaning that tax to the email that says wants that to our sons on and the people on the other side get that connection your text or email all show up once their their cell phone reaches that tower\nNo as a as a as did the ... thank you Alan for your call them ... and your thoughts here or how does the GPS era affect all of this\nMakes everything so wonderful that we know where each others are like you can set and activate your GPS for your family members\nSo this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but\nTimes of weather related problems such as Michael you know the storm skipped girl down you know can't take our technology and if the towers that an equal that you're sending a signal to went down\nDance single you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they hit another tower that active they will instantly they received those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way\nAnd on the other side it's important to understand that they will receive at once a power is connected to that cell phone they will receive that message and now they know what happens to you\nAnd I would just throw in a quick little plug for radio a good old ubiquitous over the radio always there to serve you should switch moments we go to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the boat had to do with our guest disaster preparedness expert at the early ... good evening Patrick\n... gamble for this coverage is very fascinating with hurricanes and so forth [noise] um [noise] and uh otherwise than being a good script for a movie [noise] um why not just bomb a\nHurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific a can be a new tailor it would rain radioactive [laughter] a wave of [noise] but uh maybe a hydrogen bomb or\nWell that's a nuclear bomb to the case you didn't know because it involves a a a\nTrigger that consists of uranium plutonium but beyond that if the if it let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter a I Am not sure about this but I Would say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal\nInto hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other uh him practicalities of such an idea that they're just too big\nAnd very\nWell you know let's put it this way\nLet's say the United states was to let's say or just you know in a state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with the storm and the storm goes towards Alabama Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida are liable for the river in this storm and damaging the states the other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there is a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and it goes straight to the coast cities and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nAll we liable for that so that's another area of issues that may arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the people that it hit that got a kind of be upset\nAnd I would note one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody would ever found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action lead to one followed but this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nCloud seeding a part of the eye of a hurricane this was I think the game was off Jacksonville, Florida and so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left earning headed inland\nAnd the the I don't think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe the ever again that was tried so uh the the fact is that that we just don't know enough about these things in the end of the Anthony notes quite correctly or\nOne of just simply change of course it damages somebody else them to the who is liable ever I mean you can be a painful lesson and be a liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do with the exact precision\nSome more callers will be an athlete covert and his book is
