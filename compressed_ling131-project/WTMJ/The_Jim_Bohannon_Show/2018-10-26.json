such as it is regarding the\nPotentially explosive packages in our third our this evening but they're going to continue with other things for the moment\nIncluding a discussion with Chris Steiner wall this evening he has a Fox News digital politics editor who put together a quite a story some people may look at the populism phenomenon and think it starts with Donald Trump ended the most assuredly does not\nWe're going to take a look at just the history there in what Chris was put together every man a king a short colorful history of American populace and it's published by a twelve and Chris thank you for joining us tonight\nWell it certainly my pleasure thank you for having me\nAbsolutely let's start with just where you would start that is to say at what point did you say we had a political leader who could be defined as a populist\nWell ... thinking about it this way in American history even before there was a country or even before there was a constitution even in the discussion about drafting the constitution there were people who felt perfectly convinced absolutely sure\nThat there were elites who were crafting that document people in New York people in Philadelphia maybe wealthy planners in Virginia\nWere conspiring against their interests\nBecause really when we talk about populism in the American tradition what we're talking about is grievance we're talking about a subset of the population\nInterested in what he called the boys at the force of the creek\nHe claimed seven million ... along with ... we would lie before he would tell the truth but he he claimed seven million members and share our wealth clubs in the summer of Nineteen thirty five he was broadcasting on the regular from NBC\nAnd he had whatever however much you may have exaggerated he had a huge following and he and Coughlin boats using the radio ah we're driving a hard hard to uh Roosevelt left flank\nRoosevelt said at the time um this that there was populism on the right\nUh uh Douglas MacArthur who had busted up the bonus army these were a pensioners from the first World War who are owed a bonus that had been approved by Congress from the first World War and during the depths of the depression they showed up on moss in Washington they marched on Washington and then they set up a tent city on the other side of the Anacostia River from where I'm sitting right now\nAnd a MacArthur\nAh he was a veteran of the first World War rainbow division highly decorated he rode tanks into this camp\nAnd there was a reactionary hard line on the right there was a reactionary when you've got to deal with this and these things but Roosevelt biggest concern when he when he called a Huey Long and Douglas McArthur the two most dangerous man in America he was talking about those twin threats that you describe about the about the reactionary is on the right\nBut his biggest concern was Huey Long and the hardcore social is on the left\nStay with us more to

six to six\nAlways the opposition to populism has tended to take and the leaders tone and certainly Chris Steiner wall points that out of the very beginning of his book every man of king\nAs he writes as Andrew Jackson was beginning a second term as president and Eighteen thirty three the board at Harvard University thought it would be appropriate to bestow upon him an honorary doctorate of laws\nNow that the man he had beaten was a Harvard to allow them or maybe John Quincy Adams and\nHis response to this as he wants told a cousin and this is a quote that his reverberated through his great\nAs myself and affection a child of our alma mater I Would not be present to witness her disgrace and conferring her highest literary honors above the barbarian who could not write a sentence of grammar and hardly could spell his own name\nUnquote which aside from being shall we say a little bit opinionated was also way off the mark Andrew Jackson himself happen to be a lawyer I'll be a not a a a Harvard law but could certainly manage a sentence and the spelling of his own name your thoughts\nA Andrew Jackson was a rough rough here are old hickory was a no sophisticated hum and it's about like what ... was a interesting sometimes\nSo it was George Washington's for Pete's sake so\nI was just about to say so and so's mind if I don't use spell check 'em but you know the the reality for John Quincy Adams the the belief among the founders and it very then um but even with Jefferson ah who invasion Gilman farmer\nI'm reading the news under the shade of the tree is as he rested from his plow hum and the the rule of the commenters but so even among the\n... were then the Republican Democrat um but even among the ... the the the more democratically minded of the day\nIt would have been hard to imagine that there would be a leader arise that would not be from the nobility from the from the ... right that you would not have a Presbyterian\nOr not an Anglican uh not a congregation less but that you would have somebody who was not from Virginia not from Massachusetts not to the manner born not to the merchant class not a planner but instead the frontiers meant\nYeah not from Massachusetts not to the manner born not to the merchant class not a plan or but instead the frontiers men now Jackson was astonishingly successful in Tennessee he made himself amazingly well the uh he was the governor of Florida he was a justice on the state Supreme Court\nOr he was the states for senator he was a general uh for the uh in the black hawk wars he did a uh he did a lot or not in the black hawk words but in the uh uh the creek wore\nA he did all kinds of things he was he was a renaissance man and a lot of ways but he felt way outside especially as a Scots Irish meant he fell way outside of what the expectations of the founders would have been for the kind of guys for the kind of men who to populate because the assumption was that there would be such a press that\nThe natural human preference for\nUm excellent for ... for those things would have drawn men from the same category but what they didn't count on was when you do have a wave of immigrants and you do change the makeup of the population the expectations and descriptions for what an excellent man might be will change\nAnd certainly overtime but they they obviously have a part of it I suppose with geographic here was the first or a president to came from west of the Appalachian Mountains\nAbsolutely and that westward expansion of the purpose so Jackson interesting Jackson's legacy is only\nUltimately field by James Paulk one term president who should have finished his work\nUm who uh after a a a a diversion a diversion poke gets back in and they finish the westward expansion everything was about moving west more space more inland more room for Americans to spread out and of course this is Harry Jackson\nA earned the ignorant may uh and the infamy for his trail of tears and the Indian removal act this is how\nJackson you know it's it's interesting if you see yourself as a victim as Jackson did Jackson no matter how rich no matter how powerful no matter how strong he became no matter how successful he ultimately saw himself as a victim has an aggrieved party and\nThe permission structure that grievance gives us is an interesting thing and it was very interesting which accept his heinous treatment\nOf Native Americans what he did he felt right in doing because he was doing it for his people he was doing it for his people who she saw as victims themselves he saw his fellow Scots Irish Americans he saw his fellow western ... the the people moving west\nRough and tough they were talking about of the first a whack at universal health health care we're

had about a century now from Jackson as you right here is Christopher walls and the book every ...\nIn the summer of Nineteen thirty five Huey Long was the sensation that is an understatement\n... he was a wild too and he was a wild thing and uh what's interesting is he had he had run for the United States Senate a as a staunch basically to re consolidate power in\nLouisiana and his intention was that he would try to hold the governorship and the Senate seat at the same time he wanted the legislature he was a lame duck and the legislature was being a was starting to a pale\nUh at the demands of the king fish the emperor of Louisiana all of the things that he told them to do there was they were starting to have some opinions and he did not like that\nSo he ran he figured if he ran statewide for that Senate seat he could show his great power\nAnd he did but then he found out he couldn't do both so he wins but doesn't go sir points in Nineteen thirty two but he doesn't go serve until eventually constitutional crisis he uh has called out the state National Guard\nA to prevent the lieutenant governor from take the oath of office he said but eventually he finds a a more accommodating Lieutenant General uh our our lieutenant governor who will be a pliant a vessel for the will of the king fish\nAnd then he we figure she has to go to Washington so he gets here and he finds out he can whip these people just as easily as he whipped him down in Baton Rouge and that the reporters here are just like the reporters they're desperate for good copy desperate for wild stories or he finds out that the same levers of power that worked there work here and he went\nSame levers of power that work there work here and he went right to work in in the course of a very little time he found himself a absolute sensation a national political figure and people couldn't get enough of it\nHere is a floor speech just one excerpt from Huey Long talking to his fellow senators a mob is coming here and six months to hang the other Ninety five you damn scoundrels I'm undecided whether the stick here with you or go out in the lead them\n[laughter] well okay [laughter] what'd you down as undecided ...\n[laughter] now that are there came a time when he became a something of a sensation about possibly challenging Franklin Roosevelt for the presidency what happened to at this point of ah of him grasping for the ultimate political power\nWill think about the the context in Nineteen thirty six I'm there were a lot of people was the sons of the American system of government probably that the smaller Republicanism wasn't gonna work um that what was happening in Europe was maybe a better solution um the depression had proven intractable\nAnd you have national social national socialism in Germany or you have fascism in Italy and Spain you have a strong argument being made here\nIncluding in it with a bunch of American adherents people like Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh uh Joe Kennedy and others who said hey you know maybe we ought to pay attention to this maybe this is a more modern scientific way to approach things\nUh and the moment we we take for granted\nOur our institutions are weak now relative to how they were say fifty years ago but we it's hard for us the grass you know on the day that Pearl Harbor was bombed the American Nazi Party claimed two hundred thousand members are a lot of the things and norms that we take for granted today in the pit of the great depression or not\nThat was not that was not everybody was an agreement

not he was really getting challenger as well I'm thirty six I don't know um he had a being Huey Long he had lied about it and he had talked about it and several different ways depending on who he was talking to\nBut whether or not he was going to challenge the threat that he could topple Huey Long and when and when and went on a platform or that he can topple Roosevelt and when and do so on a platform that basically called for repealing the American system that it was time that we had something more like a dictator who had the power to\nDeal with entrenched interests who where he said

I mean as I understand it they were in fact that it just to\nMake them safe\nI was under the impression that they were not detonated so as that that to keep the components are intact enough to ah to examine them I I think that they were certainly diffused that I Know the term that has been used by the the government's potentially explosive devices which makes me wonder\nIf they might not have contained explosive but we're not hooked up in such a way as to go off which would certainly explained why none of them did but I don't believe that\nThat they were were detonated because you would be destroying evidence\nBy mistake\nWell I I Know I I think so yeah\nI was just one I was just wondering if there was you know that they had given information as far as how strong network\nI I've not heard any information about these except to have been called\nA potentially explosive devices I found that term to be a rather intriguing in terms of government euphemisms potentially explosive devices says to me that is something that contains explosive materials but it's not\nHooked up with such a way that it would go off now that that could be reading more into it than the government intended but that's how it sounds\nBombs or Bob my main who cares said either went up for it it's still up\nA well it is that and it still is dangerous and all but it certainly matters in terms of how it was put together if a perfect example let's say I jam a bunch of ah oh diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate or something into a package like the Oklahoma City bombing\nBut I don't include any detonator or method by which it could be set off then that would be a potentially explosive device but it would not be something that you could expect to go off and that makes a lot of difference in terms of the the the motive of whoever was behind this\nOh yes sir I'm I [noise]\nI don't really think about ... ... ... ... the torch balls to\nGood good absolutely good\nWell good certainly are in it in in terms of human safety and possibly good in determining a motive if you go to the trouble is sending out a a device that is designed not to go off\nAnd at least in the case of the Brennan package a included white powder that was described by the government is harmless [noise]\nThen you wonder what's going on here then that gives a lot of credence to the false flag notion that this was designed
