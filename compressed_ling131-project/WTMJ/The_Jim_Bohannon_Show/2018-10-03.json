mean I mean it did just a ... I was the lead strikes me is just a tad unrealistic really\nAs long as you have a free society now of course if you are if you didn't have a free society that'd be very simple but\nMuch lower than they\nAre not these are some many or not\nI mean don't you think that's a matter of choice and one is individual white kind of like if they don't like it up north because it's cold they'll St Louis downtown\nAll they can but you're talking about the forcibly moving them\nOh no I think for moving them it would be ... well that they're going to be happy where they live well\nBut they're they're going to be more unhappy if they they feel like they've got to leave their their view I think would be fine somebody wants to leave the others leave\nAgain that would be an optional thing either they can choose to Italy\nWell let's say\nAt what point their values are just being or choose to be a happy because I didn't\nBut of course you know election returns will change what a given state happens to do and and that's kind of an American viewpoint so again a I'm not sure that I see that as as a solution may do you draw the lessons from that you're wrong\nWell I I I think Lynn raises an important historical point the United states was\nAs you know originally Thirteen independent independent countries briefly and the ... the deal that brought the United states together under the constitution was a was a deal that was supposed to allow exactly the kind of very very significant differences\nIn a state character that Helene is talking about so all all of us are look back and are appalled at the at the question of of slavery but we we tend to forget that\nFor example Massachusetts and Connecticut at the time of the founding\nA had established churches and we're we're very proud of their of their puritan tradition as being part of the public character and culture of the states\nAnd that didn't mean that any he was forced to leave those states have just meant that if if you wanted to live in that that kind of a place then then you would live in Massachusetts and Connecticut and if you want to live some place else than you'd you'd probably moved to New York\nAnd um\nIt it is\nInteresting that over over the last two hundred years the United states you can say has moved more and more towards a enforced\n... trying to force all the states to be the same and as I say I think it's very understandable on the issue of of slavery [noise] um but but when you get to a\nWell I was just going to finish that thought but the clocks gonna make you finish it after this break\nWhen you just need to be heard when you just need a way\nTo guys that love talking big scare away some of the players that may or may not be on the scene going forward yeah you know this is a pretty important we ... a great match they go all things\nOn the morning at eight thirty five [noise] Monday\n... that that that's what independence means when you celebrate the fourth of July in the United states if Americans still do celebrate what you're saying is our country can chart its own course and the ... you can't you're not going to have England or China or Russia or anybody else dictate what we do\nThat the theory of a world like that is is that different nations will have different forms of government some of them were not going to like\nSo you you you read a lot in in the American press these days about uh about a Hungary Poland Israel Italy criticizing these countries and saying well that that\nThey're not they're not getting government the way we want them to be governor\nBut that's exactly the point the point is but\nIf if Americans going to be a nation state and national state\nAnd it doesn't want others to to interfere in its elections in to tell us what to do then part partly it has to allow other countries the freedom to determine their own course and so there's a certain ah humility in that saying we don't necessarily have\nThe the answers that we can dictate to every other country in the world invading Iraq and ah helping determinant new constitution there didn't work out so well some may maybe maybe America doesn't have\nPat answers for every other country should be governed\nUh obviously quite quite frankly there are some countries out there that just really aren't aren't fit for self governance and it'd be kind of a free status or culturally they are simply unprepared for that the I Wonder if some languages even have the the word compromise in them I I seriously doubt of Arabic glued to the word ...\nUh because of the of the uh the the way that the many aspects of their culture a proceed so\nUh I I think that there was a much greater recall probably for this kind of think back when the United nations consisted of a a lot of Western European democracies and we were willing to look the other way for the the Soviet Union and then suddenly all they have the the big\nBreak out of a of a colonial is a a areas of became nations after the Nineteen sixties and we certainly saw the the likes of Libya leading me the United Nations Human rights council\nAnd we realized that the total of ... of of the notion quite frankly I think the the the widespread growth of independent nations is probably what do the United nations because you you have within the United nations today what may be out of a hundred maybe some countries you've got maybe what\nFifty or sixty that could be considered the genuinely a fit for free self governance\nYou know most of those countries but the ones that you're saying are are fit our our country is in which there is an overwhelming majority of a ... a single national groups within the country and ah the\nThe ones that are not said are you you you're talking to a large large portions of a of a Africa and Asia\nAnd look at look at your entire swaths of the predominantly Arabic countries from Morocco or eastward and then once you leave by the Arabic countries just going predominantly Islamic countries many of those are are very monolithic ally of one the culture and uh the the the armpit of the planet\nI mean the whereas the United states and relatively pluralistic place I mean\nI'm pretty sure that that's a that that is Sunni Arab propaganda if you actually take most of those countries and take a look at what's in them or you'll see that they're not at all monolithic I mean in\nThere are ... crashed in in ... countries like a ... ...
