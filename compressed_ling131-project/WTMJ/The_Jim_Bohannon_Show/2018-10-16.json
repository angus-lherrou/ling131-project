morning on your way to work as\nThings happen overnight worth reading in the morning that's what we are here for to help you get up to speed on what's happening in your world anyway and\nWhen he was options morning you was when she or he was ready to do any GM James\n[noise] yeah there is a difference\n\nThirty three thirty the final score tonight the Packers over the forty niners for one for seven nine nine one six twenty other talking text line for one for\nSeven nine nine one six twenty well we have a officially reached victory Tuesday I'm here for the Packers are in our our last call before we went to break nights are wondering you know where's the positivity or where's the optimism put his name\nWas ... here's here's a reality I there are three to one one it's a winning record and any when you get it is good you know tonight obviously was was not perfect it was not their finest hour to be sure no doubt about it\nAnd it's actually there's no committee you don't have to worry about style points you don't have to worry about strength of schedule or anything like that you just need to get to the post season but they have to get there\nAnd I I Try to be realistic with this team they've got some good things but as I said we haven't seen the really long stretches of good football\nOften simply and defensively um we do how competitive the NFC North it we're getting some idea of where the strength is in the ... we're not totally certain or that because the league has just been so weak the weak to me it's it's to the point of frustration trying to figure out really outside of the top two or three teams in the NFC\nWho's really good I'm ... and who's really bad it's a numbers game are they coming into into tonight\nI'm you need if you if you feel ten five and want to get you to the post season you need eight wins yeah five tough road games um if you go to and three and that's right you got to win all the rest\nSo I I'm all for optimism I'm all for being positive and I and you know I don't want to gloss over the problems on the same again you've got to be happy with the wind victory to say glad to be here but\nIt's going to be tough and his team to get to the post ... uh it really is and you know where can they improve how do they improve I Want to see more era Jones yeah okay I got the secretary's going to be much healthier wide receiver in a corner is going to be healthier\nAnd that's all good and dandy but the way they play tonight can't play that way against the rams you cannot play that way against the patriots so let's get back to work for one for seven nine one six point for one for seven Ninety nine one six twenty\nThe talk and text line Let's talk to Carl Carl you're on backers of the\nWell I'm a comic view comics and I'll hang up and listen I'm\nI Want to echo the sentiments a last caller who mentioned the negativity and I totally agree\nBut for all this crap everybody complaining there was a victory thirty three thirty thirty three points or primary yards on off and we got to come\nThirty three points or former yards and often so we gotta complain come on let's enjoy it\nBut here's the thing call I I mean you never say for the victories I mean I I agree with you on that um and as I said and anytime you get a win in the NFL it's tough whether it's in the San Francisco buffalo or Minnesota Chicago New England whoever but I don't think you can totally gloss over some of the issues that need him and then it clearly issues\nThan about or you can do this against you know we can't do this against the wing when things weren't clan those teams tonight they were playing the miners they had a game plan for the niners I tried should touch I trust is coaching staff they will put a game plan together for those teams from the time comes and keep\nA Carl thanks for the call up and of course you know you're you're you're you're going to approach the rams game completely differently than you approach the forty niners game but I I I feel like I said a lot already\nThe season to it's not the coaching to me it's not the preparation it's not the game planning and it's not a political it's the execution\nAnd the execution um was not as sharp as as it should have been and um you know San Francisco's uh one one team a couple of states away from being a window steam I'm going back to when we do a against Detroit\nA there is some talent on both sides of the most of the forty niners no question about it I mean the rams are are the best thing football at this point and the patriots\nI mean it's not just you know from what we saw last night but we we don't have good doing with this and you know I mean it's the same story there forever it feels like\nI'm so yeah I mean of course you're going to approach Los Angeles differently course you're going to approach the New England differently but how do you get better based on what we saw here tonight here's the thing you're ... you're six weeks into the season I and people always say like well you know takes about four to five weeks to figure out the identity of each team and I I don't know that that's true anymore because\n\nGeneral ... chicken in twenty six Green Bay\nThis inside linebacker Blake Farmer\nIn CJ ... twice denied by the bankers defense and a Green Bay needed they needed all of it here tonight they needed all sixty minutes so they got to win over the forty niners\nThirty three to thirty is Packers O T continue get behind the scenes access the ... with the stadium tour the tour included a art something strolls the players tunnel reserve you're spot on line attackers dot com today I'm Jeff how come you know and by the voice of the bankers Wayne Larrivee so three two one\nIs where we sit here with this team and you know the the thing that that I've been saying and and she calls it brought this up and it's been inconsistent mhm um they haven't played the the the great\nLong stretches of good football often simply a and defensively but yet you know you sit here and I mean it's already been sound like a long season I mean there's just been so many twists and turns at this point what do you think just seen as I\nI honestly don't know Jeff I really don't um I I think the regime that has some upside to it um I think they're going to be really good offensively going forward here I'm a defensively I'm Still wondering you know where's where's the improvement going to come from I think the young defensive backs\nI'm certainly get a dry year Alexander back a ... two weeks it that'll be great that'll be good um the safety play has got to improve a little bit but I thought it was good tonight and you know the outside pass rush you know the outside linebackers they've been that's worthy inconsistency in my opinion has been defensively\nI was really alarmed at the way a San Francisco random football tonight and the first half primarily\nA but they ended up with a hundred and Seventy four rushing yards of thirty attempt spy point guard average wow\nYou know uh that's the thing that concerns me when I started looking at defense is uh what do you do against Iran that start that's where it starts and then what are you doing in the past and that type of thinking about how many turnovers you force that kind of\nThing where you you you probably don't realize and it was really on this late tonight how much speech San Francisco has they do on the other side as well and it was you know getting to the outside and you know the stretch plays running the football and\nI Can't help but think ... Gurley coming up uh the Sony Michel James light back sealed in New England and um you know they they're that officers running this is a run defense that you know hasn't really been gash that much\nBut it wasn't good tonight\nNo I'm clearly struggled with this team um the cat jumped off I'm off the tape at me as I looked at this team was map Brita okay he jumped off the tape and and he got injured last week against Arizona didn't come back or the second half\nAnd you know so all we could talk about the ... I saw him he look really good to be I I Know you only got fourteen carries tonight but he had sixty one yard most or who fumbled in his bumble last week against Arizona kind of turned that came around it happened in the second quarter\nBut tonight he was twelve Terry's eighty seven yards a you know they were pop it seemed like even a on what I thought were ... they were getting four or five yards and that's a winning play for the ... so\nThat was concerning to me but you're exactly right the speed and I knew when mark he's good when it was clear to play this game I said oh boy this has got you know he can run by anybody and and he was killing the Packers and the first half of this\nBall game for one for seven nine one six twenty on the talk in tech sign for one for seven eight nine one six twenty let's talk to John in ... John you're on Packers oh the\n... I think a lot for taking my call I just want to make a comment a little more positive I think there's every reason you know you have a lot of legitimate concerns are I think the fans have a lot of concerns even when they win games we can talk about what they do a lot better but I just like to point out that\nWe are we could look at things a lot more optimistic for instance we're really who I Know and frankly\nQuite easily be five in one team would we be five in one team with some major concerns that we are having I think yeah but\nI think if you look at the pivotal nature of those calls that were made\nUm maybe at the subject for a whole different story to be getting a little better understood what a how to how to deal with the quarterback in in the running to the passer but at the end of the day um\nI'd like to think you know the Packers are going to go so I really would like to see just a little bit more optimism\nI think there's a lot of upside for the Packers I I think they can be kind of ... kind of like a box of chocolate or going to get each week but I think there's a lot of reason to believe that he\nCan improve will improve and I just would like to be a lot more positive with what they have going for him okay I'll and I'll listen to your thoughts and your comments\nOr John ah thanks for the call a couple of it was called up tonight in and said I'm a you know obviously the problems with his team but um there's there's reason for optimism um I think if if you want all the way back to the started she said All right Aaron Rodgers is going to be injured you're not going to be one hundred percent you're going to have injuries that wide receiving an injury is a cornerback\nBut you're going to theater three two and one you kind of feel like well I you know maybe you would take it I mean again inconsistency has been an issue for this team but you know one who hasn't been inconsistent the rams okay it is probably didn't and maybe the chiefs 'em and they're not going to get very far with that defense and then once you get the postseason um\nYou look at the end of the noise I mean I I still think it's there for the taking but top to bottom it's tough\nIt's tough I I agree ... and and the thing that that impressed me about Detroit last week was in the first half the way they played the perimeter game that that's still a tough match up to the Packers okay hum but you're exactly right and here's the other thing we have to all remember and understand\nIs that teams evolve okay there you get better they get worse they don't stay the same to the season\nAnd so if you're hoping permit optimistic standpoint I I think the Packers are well coached and will get better as we go along with that would be good enough in the NFC to make the playoffs in and then get into the tournament ... will have to wait and see but you know you have Aaron Rodgers and as long as he's out there as we saw tonight Jeff\nThat game is leaves about four minutes to go with the cable looked like a loss for every day\nAnd somehow they got it done you know the the defense made a couple of stops there down the stretch that I I was impressed with they had a couple of three announced they got the big interception um you know from Kevin king and and your fence was able to finally get it in the end zone and then get into the field goal range\nUm you know there's a lot to look at it that that yeah they do the parkers have problem sure they do\nBut you know what I've always said this you don't want to be the best team in the league you don't be playing your best football in October right what would you want to do that you want to put your best football in December when you make the playoffs and then in January when you were the super bowl that's what it's\nAbout going back to the chief and they've started five and a last year as well and then they were laid off\nI don't know last year as well and then they were late November six and six yeah and\nThey're struggling to make the playoffs add to\nLegislate wildcard weekend last in Tennessee yeah um you know so so want it done but I Know you and I we talked about this seems like you have to give you the best teams in September almost never the engine\nTo exactly and you know I thought the gay lifestyle was great don't get me wrong New England Kansas City but Jeff those two teams and their playoff teams don't get me wrong there's that can Superbowl contenders especially in New England of the week KFC\nBut uh they have problems defensively also seemed to have problems events what do the Packers are problems Tibet sleep I Would say yes but you know a lot of teams have problems that\nEven even if there is no sex yesterday and I don't know if that's the blueprint maybe because it brought over\nHere is caused by the time I was shocked I tell you it was interesting Dr Iraq Today um and I was up your rebate over the weekend but a drive around today I I just you know my colleagues in Chicago all of a sudden it eighty five bears I was going to do that yeah it was like\nThe nineties ... and you know what was the dolphins and it's like they have to pay Sarah\nThirty thirty to

consequential McCarthy censor out there to kick or forty one year ago and he made it\nI I think that was really great coaching McCarthy's part I'm obviously they needed a touchdown but you know he sent them out there you have to go down and you're going to have to get a bill go anyway but um he sends major Crosby other get it done and get it out of your system and let's go and that's exactly where I think this whole thing\nStarted they probably needed twenty more seconds to get the onsite kick in you know and very so and that's fine just say we're leaving you um he delivered and you know and maybe that was really where it started so uh Wayne thanks so much a great debate with Jeff definitely thirty thirty to thirty\nFinal score denied the Packers getting when a three total want is

I started me wasn't good\nHow about yourself that that's a fun thing I don't know that I uh it was a good play are real close\nQuarters which and um you know ... or ... or was really a Bush running in the middle or in our ... in Michigan and I'm ... I mean\nSo I think you're right it was kinda cool scene race and we're not I mean what was that kind of border football's version reporter just uh I mean that was great\nYou know just you know here you know the people were saying about America's weekend and uh\nYou can also be worse than about America ... and uh I mean you've been doing it on time have you been making ... ... works or are we are we at the most often missing him or is it ... it was just started for him or you know what are you going to be he showed up you know you make the\nTopic of the phone call let's talk to Andy in Steven's point Andy you're on Packers oh the\nEither thank you so much for taking my call I just wanted to make a two quick points a one on the defense and one on air and John's on the fence\nI ah we've all been watching it and as Packer fans and as a lifelong fan I just need to say that we need to get an attitude adjustment a what we see right now is too many third downs too many things going wrong\nUm we need to as a team get better mentally or on the fence and for Aaron John is saying is you are to carry a ... average is outstanding\nHe needs to be getting the Baltimore and we need to involve in on the fence when he's on the field especially with play action ah he's invaluable and we need to get involved biggest thing with the defense\nI'm a I'm kind of plan like McCarthy saying that a as a coach I Know how good you are on our fence and even his play calling me kinda shaky there but man you need to give these guys going and something needs to happen\nOn that side of the body weight these guys up and not wait 'til half time to get them going and stop coddling them and get them going in a hack and tackle the ball carrier with four I'm sick of watching third downs be converted and a lot of Pakistan's on going back to a couple of callers ago\nUh uh talking about Pakistan a were smart we know what's going on we see it on defense killer something give us something to root for a non offensive side of the ball and we can't rely on turnovers\nEspecially late in the game even though it didn't work out in our favor we need attitude we need strength and we need to come together a aggressively as a unit so I Will hang up and let your comment like\nAll right Andy uh thanks for the call ... um I I mean again the the course is just growing and growing here Jones a five point one yard for Kerry tonight forty one yard ... on a carry\nExotic three down back I mean all all three of these guys again as clear cut strengthen as clear cut weaknesses but Jones is the one who has a lot more flashes and then the other two I think we're waiting I'm you know maybe on on the the other side of this by week we'll we'll see Jones a little more as far as the defense goes look it was bad but don't break tonight and\nI look I mean again it was it was bad at times who they were getting carved up into secondary I Do think getting drier Alexander back is going to be big I think it would show up really uh is going to help I really could do a lot of good thanks for the team and we were talking about\nAnd uh there was a lot of speed San Francisco flashed on the off as a side of the ball but a lot of explosive place that this uh this defense gave up\nYou're going to have a really good set of a pass catchers against the rams are really good set of pass catchers ... against the patriots so it's three to one of the United states is obviously very much up for grabs will be in the middle of October I started a long way to go before you even talk about what the playoff scenarios are going to look like\nGet a little bit healthier but certainly going to help but why like we'll just see it ... it victory I just said you always have to say\nBut I don't think you can totally gloss over some of the issues that this team has and of course what better time than the ... to ah reflect where exactly this team is whether on the sea and I don't like this week to week\nOr things that the NFL is going on because it just so difficult to tell who's good and who isn't because obviously that changes from one with the next to the Packers did enough here tonight to get the win thirty

from behind victory by the Packers thirty three thirty maybe the forty niners uh we will continue to take your calls to all those of you that are still up with us for one for seven nine nine one six twenty\nIs the ac unit mortgage talking tech slide you can text and your thoughts tweet them in on Twitter it's at GM Jay Garcia or as we said if you're still awake\nGive us a call as well we'll also hear from Aaron Rodgers and a portion of his paws post game\nPress conference of big game for a Aaron Rodgers here in\nThe victory as he finished with over four hundred yards four hundred and twenty five yards two touchdowns zero interceptions\nA quarterback rating of over a hundred\nOne hundred excuse me twenty five or forty six there in the victory for Roger so there's a number of things to touch on number one of the defense of performance that we saw a much there are certainly some cause for concern here when you look at that performance by the deep and write\nA lot of big place still given up especially you met secondary especially if you want to find them even more\nAt safety but I think what has to be most troubling now\nWe can't be totally negative here and the positive defensively it's when the Packers did need to make some stops they did on those final to drive by the San Francisco forty niners but overall a handful of big place you're from the forty niners all fence which\nIf we just read through the names of skill position guys on this team Ashton what maybe two out of ten people would recognize them\nMark we use good when you're ... not with a big game here but George\nKendall side of this is not in our fence loaded with talent\nPile Shanahan does a good job of maximizing the town that he has but this is not an off ... loaded team and the forty niners often here\nThat's what has to give you some concern for what awaits you after the by and I I don't want to speak in hyperbole here and say well the Packers lost his game today this would happen or that would happen but if you didn't each video game out here\nThere's a very good\nChance you're finishing the season where they losing record for out of five on the road after the by and those are tough games as well you open up with the law\nWell you open up with the Los Angeles rams it off and said look we talked about what the forty niners often did you\nUh that's a rams off fence that has an equally brilliant play color and Sean McVeigh but the talent that this forty niners team does not have so that concerns you but you have the rams on the road the New England patriots on the road we saw with the patriots did against the chief defense last night of defense\nThat I'm sure there's a lot of similarities here with what the Packers defense features here but that Patriots' offense the rams ... both of those are on the road the Miami Dolphins come to limbo field in mid November and that's the team who knows we I I think we still don't really know a whole lot about the dolphins foreign to\nWhat a loss the patriots who was the other team the bangles the beat them I Believe\n\nSeahawks on the road to Thursday games so that's the shortened week it's in Seattle the place that has given the Packers troubles before and don't look now but after being written off for most of the season\nThe sea hawks are still lingering there at three and three and then you wrap up that trip in Minnesota against the Vikings on another Sunday night game so five games right out of the by those are five very difficult games\nEven with this when I have three two and one you know what happens if you go one for him those five game\n\nIt's a difficult mid portion of the schedule once you get past that you do have the jets\nThe road game but you did the jets you do have the cardinals the falcons they're certainly not the team we thought there would be at the beginning of the season that's largely due to injury but the offensive firepower is still there the big takeaway here is\nThere's a lot of officers that can put up some numbers the Packers how to play here coming up on the horizon so those struggles that we saw defensively against a team\nI'm not going to say void of skill but a team that isn't quite as talented on the officer van\nAs most of the other officers teams you'll look at your third week that's what's most concerned about the defense of performance but again thirty three thirty final score Packers beat the forty niners ... field three two and one now so what you have in the NFC North\nIs a big log jam now you have the\nPackers at three two and one the Vikings are three two in one the bears would that lost yesterday or the bears are now at three in to see you have three teams just bunch up there and oh by the way the lions two and three without victory over the Packers so the NFC nor as we thought maybe this'll be the best division and football\nDisappointed a little bit so far but still\nFour of those teams much in there for one for seven nine nine one six twenty the ac unit mortgage talk and tech slide take your thoughts on the defense take your thoughts on some of the office of performance as we saw that I haven't even touched on the performance by the young wide receivers\nAnd not just the young guys but overall the receiving group by the Packers the job they did today and why we believe it's historic will share that with you when we return the extra points presented by pot of water the hotel and casino\nIt starts like the other\nSure that your green and for a moment [laughter]\nYeah Frank Fay tire announcing the lifetime Paris Hilton flat tire and ... minutes ...\nFor that for debt free we'll corrosion service lifetime or do you spend balance ... to ... and more that's a lot of tax\nPitcher is for me at all part of our Richland tire installation package next time you're\nTired of it even if you bought them online we'd be happy to mount and saw and of course found\nThem for you then remember the safe buffalo often have always make sure you got to throw it on your tires on ... on your [noise]\nThe extra point present them I've heard a lot of the hotel and casino continues here on WGM Jay I'm Justin\nGarcia we have now come to the road to recovery and quite a few guys to choose from here Randall Cobb obviously not planted eight Geraldo Allison injury being held out as well a dry year Alexander second straight week\nFear the drier was not a out there on the scene and the ... we have still yet to see still kind of that so much road to recovery but just getting himself back into football shaped after that off season so the wide receivers though\nI think before this game we would have said look this is the most important to get those guys healthy and to ... moving upward trajectory here but\nYou certainly get some more confidence\nIn these young guys you do want to see dry your Alexander back in the field and I I'm very interested to see ... in the mix and to see how the Packers sweatshop some of their personality the secondary if you think about that\nWe've drawn Williams would that same core that we had to serve the season with trod with fear the ... year with Josh Jackson with Kevin king who had that big interception tonight you throw up or shut brain land in the mix as well\nHow does that change them their coverage is and maybe some of the personnel and safety they use deep um that's certainly something to monitor so recovery out there for a handful of guys but as we touched down before a stepping out there\nThe backfield continues to be interesting and like we had just said this is one of those areas that you feel like it's going to be something that just kind of lingers throughout the season that we've touched on\nWhat's going on here\nLast week the week before that all the calls for Iran Jones needs to play more Mike mccarthy a saying we like this group we like things that each of them bring to the table here and look you're mall Williams is probably\nYour best blocker in the backfield a very good pass catchers well time Montgomery is probably your best pass catcher on the back feel that the guy converted as a wide receiver but Aaron Jones is the guy that just had it when you look at them you see all the tools he brings to it you see when Aaron Jones touches the ball\nIt's different than watching Jamal Williams running with the football he's a home run threat we saw it on their first drive with a touchdown that was called back\nOr ruled out of bounds I should say but you can just see what Aaron John springs to the table now the way that Mike mccarthy has handled this leads you to believe that confidence is not there in his past protection\n\nI think the things that you can call out or the number of snap city sees the number of carries that he sees I get now played 'em on third down for the past catching purposes and for past protection purposes\nBut if you're reading between the lives of your Mike mccarthy is basically saying we do not believe he's in every down back but when you get close to the goal line\nHe has to be on the field and it was addressed and the pregame show as well but the number that was put out there about the lack of carries that Aaron Jones had him a second half last week and really\nThe lack of snaps that he had overall yes you are losing twenty four to nothing\nBut it's a three score game and Mrs a guy that is a play maker when you need to score you see the dynamic that out there when he touches the ball\nThis is going to be something that we just continue to touch on every week I don't see it as changing the one thing we notice that Ashton you and I talked about this when the game started do one miner difference you notice tonight\nWas Aaron Jones was used early typically\nWe've seen Mike mccarthy kind of use the same rotation with the bags we always see your mall William starts the game gets the first series time Montgomery is typically gotten the second series where they split up between the two of them and it's around the third or fourth series that we see her and Jones in the field he was out there right away than it\nWould lead you to believe okay maybe we're going to see it increased workload here from Mary Jones eight carries for forty one year\n\nEight carries for forty one year it's targeted once in the passing game did not have a reception but even with that you see more than five yards for carrying the game for air and Jones\nAnd just looking at the game log city had\nOf course missing those two games with the suspension forty one yards and carries this week forty yards and seven carries last week first game against the Redskins six cares for forty two year a Lebanon for sixty five against the bill one touch down so far seven six\nCares for forty two year eleven for sixty five against the bill one touch down so far seven six nearly six in five yards for Kerry or what he's putting up there and just twenty four ... four games he needs more than six carries a game for catches he's touching the ball\nSix times a game seven times again twenty eight touches 'til\nYou got to get even more than seven touches per game but given everything we've heard from Mike mccarthy this is going to continue to be a rotation here were these three guys and I get that I get the different aspects that they bring to the table but as we said you get close to the red zone you get into the red zone you get near the goal line\nYou got to get there and joins in the field and get the ball in his hand and he needs to touch the ball more than seven times again for one for seven nine nine one six twenty the mortgage talk and tax like when we return we will hear what Aaron Rodgers had to say after the victory comes

and casino here on W. J. time for the tail of the tape\nOccurred through the area as we mentioned big game from Aaron Rodgers over four hundred yards but the targets that he had here in my day Adams ten catches raw hundred thirty two yards Jimmy Graham goes over a hundred yards five for one for\nMark ...

that's I guess the biggest area of intriguing what he brings to the table that six foot five frame of what many uh saint brown the physical tools that he has and you know overalls we we've already touched on a couple of times here\nBut\nI think there are certainly some questions about the quality of depth at wind\nAnd a couple of times here but\nI think there are certainly some questions about the quality of depth at wide receiver for the steam coming in the season this isn't an open discussion to say the team should have brought back Jordan Nelson\n\n[noise] but when you looked at it you saw Randall Cobb and injury certainly played a factor in it but rebel cup last year didn't appear to be the same guy that we've seen throughout his career\nDefined day Adams you've certainly felt good about but then you said we have confidence in Toronto Alison but you got to see it for an extended period of time there were people that were calling for dads Brian to be here thought Jake ... would be a big part of this on fence\n\nThe job that these three guys have done though to just continue to progress\nIs I guess what leaves you most hopeful for this ... going forward now one of the things that we talked about all fenced ... was\nThere's going to be a lot said about the defense and certainly this defense still shows it's areas of concern a given up thirty points to the San Francisco forty niners as we touched on\nThat yeah the big place if they continue to give up that touchdown marquee good when that was what sixty seven yards\nIt it just seems like a week after week there's more confusion in the secondary specifically at safety you feel good about cornerback you saw Kevin king where the big interception tonight But Kevin king when he did gyre Alexander back in the mix Josh Jackson I think has had a very nice rookie season\nYou're going to seep or shot Greenland again that's the big area of intriguing what does he bring to this team into the secondary but you can't hold the all fence blame free either\nThrough their six games this season Packers are scored a hundred and forty eight points that is basically twenty four and a half points per game\nThat would put them Fifteen to me and it felt some middle of the road\n\nTwenty points per game last year but you also have to factor in a lot of hours without Aaron Rodgers but twenty four and a half points per game\nThe San Francisco forty niners in six games this year have scored a hundred and forty eight point twenty four and a half points for getting this is a forty niners team that has played half of their season without Jimmy ... half of their season\nThey have played\nWith CG bathroom as their quarterback we go we went over the skill position guys I'm esteem jerk McKinnon loss for the season before the season even began wide receivers marquee Goodwin and\nBeard guards zone George kid all a tight and\nIt's not a dynamic coffins\n\nAnd it's not a very talented often and it's often has been equally productive as the Packers off\n\nIt's not like the niners have played the toughest schedule in the world leader\nThat's what's concerning if you look at this forty niners off since we're Kyle Shanahan despite not having the talent that other teams around him have on that unit Kyle Shanahan find a way to match the output of it often\nMike mccarthy has with Aaron Rodgers with divide to Adams with Jimmy Graham\nWith Aaron Joe's in the backfield\nThose three games without Jimmy ... thirty points against the Packers Eighteen last week against the cardinals twenty seven against the church is\nThis often has to produce more\n[noise] twenty four and a half points middle of the road here in the NFL it's not bad it's not good when you have Aaron Rodgers is your quarterback there's no reason why at the very least you're not a top ten off fence in the league Aaron Rodgers to find the Adams and Jimmy Graham alone\nYou're a top ten off\nBackers need scored more points in ... it's it's

hire and fire people uh I can see where they will be coming from\nIt or it would it nobody even somebody chose to go ahead and hire a woman in in one of these circumstances nobody could say that they weren't at least filled with a certain amount of trepidation\nYes I've hired this woman she's very good a perfect as an executive assistant it will require of course that we will occasionally have
