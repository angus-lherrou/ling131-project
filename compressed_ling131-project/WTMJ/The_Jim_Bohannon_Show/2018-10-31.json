Pelosi in the New York city she of course the house minority leader and does she hopes and some polls suggest you might be once again the speaker of the house\nNow it's hard to know exactly what Nancy mean sometimes sometimes you just a little goofy a are referring to of course the famous quote about to Obamacare we're just going to have to pass it to find out what's in it or to what extent do you believe this could have been the rhetorical rambling on the part of Nancy Pelosi\nWell no I think I think what she did is give a window to her so I think you know you brought up Obamacare the fact that she and her party\nBasically we're willing to pass this massive bill without having read it and we're basically engaged\nIn a a a propaganda campaign to fool the American people at least a portion of them into supporting the American people were told by the president and by the Democrats that if they like their doctor they could keep their doctor\nThey want to remember that he did lay yes they were told that their premiums would go down\nI don't know if they express disgust that Dr bowls but I Know the American people were not told that their deductibles would go a phenomenally um\nHigher to the point or the insurance was almost worthless which was the situation with Obamacare and and of course\n... I don't think the American ... honestly told that what they were engaged in was nationalized saying I'm a significant industry\nWhen as it they you know health care system in the United states is similar to the legal system and the United states has lots of problems our legal system has lots of problems ... and the healthcare system has lots of problems but when we compare it to other parts of the world\nWe thank God we have it because it's the best in the world right well the ... the\nBasically the system was demonized\nUm and there was there were just a lot of ... and going on in order to achieve again the enjoyed by the means the whole thing was like that so Nancy Pelosi is engaged in that\nAnd I think this has been the strategy of the Democratic party we look at where you know right in terms of looming we have a series of candidates who are posing as something other than what they\nAre yes we've been hearing a number of things about the people that are most notably a Christians similar from Arizona Claire McCaskill from Missouri are quoted in recordings they didn't realize were were being made to order at least they public in which they advocated there are a lot more to the

a barrel of goal and uh uh that was the first thing that the other one is that I think yeah the ... entire Congress go ahead\nAnd says\nI'm Sorry you're kind of skipping it out what was that last comment David and then I Want our guest to comment\nI I think we get a hold of statements for a a a Congress up there to put those on her forehead so that each of them can read it as says are a little respect would ah tore each other as you want respect you have to give\nYeah well there are certainly that's a that's a would be nice to add I figured this particular time your thoughts James ... and about the the tone of the political rhetoric of the day\nYeah and I think that sums up what David is trying to say and that's something I I think all Americans would like to see 'em a little more decorum and dignity among each other\nBut basically you know with that the kind of commentary this collateral damage commentary Hillary Clinton saying you don't have to be civil um and the\nThe basic um atmosphere I brought up the Kavanaugh hearings to see these mobs of people and they are ... percent that caused you know the president come up with the slogan jobs now Bob\nWoodward's on and

take 'em it'd be democratic leaders have not called out they haven't called out and he thought yeah always willing to go after the president's\nLatest rhetorical excesses by the president is is a pat 'em out to the stabbing somebody in the heart but when people literally go out and vandalized and then ... ... and the like oh they they they they're not say anything and of course they don't because they're scared to death of the Democratic writers good at what happened to\nThe Joe Crowley in New York the brunt of the Democratic or\nA house member who was beaten by Alexandria Ocasio ... odd David in Cedar Rapids Iowa good evening David ... welcome\nFailed a what I noticed is that we've gone from that the Democrats to kind of guy for like a a a a twilight starling history about the world like clockwork orange mad as\nHell and when they're talking about ethics and morals\nYou know how they came to al ... al Adel saw was A L wanted to say I want to go to hell I'll say I'll find it was ... well you know it it it may be nice where they want to echo\nBut you know people are laurels and ethics they will air on this other just as ...\nBut I think a lot of apple enough but as far as staying you know Neal lacking morals and ethics late to go there well\nIf your if your morals and ethics of lead you to break the law I Would uh would thoroughly concur less than a minute to go here ah your response James\n... well you know it brings up this idea when he talked about his movie analogies and that is we were talking about a political party that has made it their position not to accept the results of an election\nI'm David they've tried every way they can with their allies in the media to essentially not only undermine the president put to remove him from office using governmental agency so and it's all failed\nAnd yes there there in a mental state\nOf kind of the dealing with things when someone deals with that\nYeah there is still well we're we're we're coming up with a break that doesn't move and do we will take that break can be back with more from James hurts them in a moment\nI Wonder if these people actually hostages so that these gangs can get their people I'm into our country\nI I was that our guest to answer that I I suspect that most of us just want to come up here and grab whatever is available or be at a jobs for those with the work ethic or a or freebies for those without\nA granted good condition for bad back in their home countries but one thing I Would add to those who are upset about being separated from their children\nIf in fact you had a husband and wife who happened to bring their kids to work and work was holding up a bank the kids would be separated from their parents once they were apprehended they're breaking the law entering this country if you do not wish to be separated from your kids don't break into our country [noise] uh this this whole nonsense of\nOf uh wringing our hands about this just started to really freaked me out a James\nI perfectly understand is the ... is is right there to bring this up they did have for sure they have firearms this group and the bass a\nPortion of them are young men the fighting age and it does appear that they want to use the women and children are in as a kind of thought that they would do and when they arrived at the border they would stick them and fraud\nAnd to try you know say if the military were to use water cannons for example um I think they want\nAltered Cajun and injury this was a so it's a delicate situation but here's the big picture we simply have to stop the kids they were to get into this country\nThere would be an endless number of caravans and ah it appears as though the people that want to abolish ice they democratic socialist so they called themselves the people that want to open borders shame to never be able to answer the question\nOf how many immigrants is enough\nAnd so they they seem to be on a trajectory to turn the United states into a third world nation because there are certainly enough people in the world that would love to come into the United states of America with to just walk across our border and not have any red tape and be able to get\nBenefits at the same time\nUm especially for example the state I live in California they're ... they want to give them healthcare a tuition discounts and for all I Know probably proposing giving each one of them a condominium on the ocean it say it's always say it's a situation where\nUm we we have a finite infrastructure and we've already seen\n'em a loss\nIn terms of in California particularly hospitals roads prisons schools um which is a philosophy of\nJust bringing everybody and by the way also don't filtered them in any way\nYou have to say I want to talk about that when we come back here at one eight six six five oh Jim boat one eight six six five oh five or six to six and we'll be back in just a moment\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home\nHere dancing

before they crossed our ally see okay yeah and\nSo there's not like I had a black guy and like a a fat lip time so yeah there's been some scary things for sure but I think that first one was more scary for\nMe 'cause I didn't know what the heck it happened ...\n... it's Hollywood doing more of this now you had this to return to the Halloween the movies with\nA a a\nCurtis ... evidence yet or are we going to be a return to those good old days of the of the scary this of the Freddie Krueger and that sort of thing\n[noise] you know kind of it looks that way doesn't it I think that guy's like a symbol on and have figured out how to make and really commercial um horror films\nAnd and you know and it was so interesting I think about the hard line and have figured out how to make and really commercial um horror films\nAnd and you know and it was so interesting I think about the horror genre and Hollywood is it really is that movie that you want to see in a theater we get home is muted compared to the way that we respond to them in theaters\nSo for instance um if you're watching a comedy at home you might smirk you might have a smile cross your faith but if you're in a theater and other people are laughing you laugh out loud and when you laugh out loud your body chemistry changes it actually it releases endorphins\nAnd say you enjoy yourself more so I I Hope it I Hope everything so I just download and we sat and watched things by herself [noise]\nThe the whole future of of Hollywood I suppose is is predicated to a certain extent on the on the various revenue streams uh theaters for example uh get an awful lot of their money off of the concessions do they\nNot think so they do\nYeah does Hollywood did it cut it out but if you're showing a blockbuster movie in the theater pools in the X number of dollars off of popcorn and the and the candy at twelve dollars a candy bar or just the the the the film producer get a cut of that that's where the money is\nNot that I'm aware of what you'd be where I Would I Do yeah I Would be so I'm pretty sure we don't\nYeah All right uh terms of of the uh\nThe the creativity that that goes into a Hollywood productions each with some of the highest concentrations of creativity these days go knock it to the TV shows or even this was certainly feature movies you see so to me that some of the highest levels of creativity at least ... per\nPer second of air time if you will go into music videos and commercials\nYou know what that is a really great question I you know I\nVendors very expensive so it's really more I think about the effects than it is anything else\nDoes does does Hollywood depend too much affects or we don't have much in the way of star power in the script sucks but we've got the great ... computer graphic or a a special effects here as long as you got to dust pure white magic on your side can you sell the public and using\nIt now you can you you can't sell it felt like anything I got to tell you consumers are so smart they are so smart which is why you know I started digging into that the data side of things is to understand the customers for and there was a day when you could just make I'm living in but it go see it [noise]\nUm this is probably more like twenty ... Twenty years ago um but now people are smart if they can they can kind of smell a bad movie and it's not that listen\nI from what I've experienced and I and I had to pretty you know the kind of start with that because I think it's fair that excites everything in ... for every movie in Hollywood movie\nNo script ever starts out to be a bad movie you\nKnow and they're all gone with the wind and Citizen Kane storage\nRight I mean and sometimes you might have a script they might have made to not totally confident but it turns out to be a phenomenal film\nI'm so ... you know but I think people are are really smart and and you know I don't know do we rely too much on special effects on some of our most successful movies and the ones that I Am personally the most proud of our movies like hidden figures\nUm fault in our stars there wasn't a singles and special effects in any of those\nFilms [noise] um yeah Slumdog Millionaire was a an Academy Award winner for the studio and not a single effect I you know I I think there are a lot of effect certainly more than we've ever had um but I still think there's room you know for those films that don't at least I Hope so because those are some of our our best stories\nIs an article of faith among the good people in this country that anything that comes out of Hollywood is automatically the left wing of politics preaching to the rest of us agree or disagree\n[laughter] got it preaching it doesn't feel like preaching to me um you know I I don't think that that is fully\nAccurate I think that maybe some of the stories that come to us might might appear that way um you know it's funny I you know I sit in these rooms every day and yeah I'm a girl from Oklahoma I grew up at his ... and a Republican household\nUm but I can still enjoy a story\nWhether you know no matter what my political beliefs are or or not and I think that you know what I Would I just what breaks my heart is how politicized stories have become because movies like hidden figures should never be considered politicized 'cause there was nothing political about that movie\nFair enough anyway a fascinating tale and but we thought that on Halloween or virtually Halloween\nThat we should hear from Julie ...\nWho is a president GPA this rather just ahead of media twentieth Century Fox do talk about\nThe ghost photographer Hollywood executives true
