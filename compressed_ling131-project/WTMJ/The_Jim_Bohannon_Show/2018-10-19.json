thank you but first let me say that I don't know if you've\nReceived this particular comment before this this compliment but you are one of the most articulate man on the planet\n[laughter] that's very guide you really are anybody who's interested in public speaking I mean it should aspire to communicate as well as you do you are just in that regard you are just amazing well thank you very much I Want to buy a humble by that and and the blood related absolutely true you're up like ...\nUm I basically agree with everything you have to say about ... except for this\nI'm not sure I trust their motives\nI mean tell us what is not primarily country anymore she had been primarily pot and at the end I should I get that fans of pop probably lean more to the left and it it's the right it was a different story with Dixie Chicks I gave them credit because they were primarily country\nAnd they did actually it it's ... ...\nWhat is that that that's a big yeah\nI'm not sure I'd trust tiny at West motives either um I'll have to wait and see if\nI'd have to wait and see if anything happens does it benefit him on his support\n[noise] I'll I'll have to wait and see her\nSee what you're saying and and and again that I'm willing to to wait and see as well\nOr I'll I'll just have to wait and see her\nI see what you're saying and ... and again the uh I'm willing to to wait and see it as well yeah Taylor certainly has a has a ... by the cross over I Would not to argue with that for one minute two good points ... thank you very much sir to David in Dallas a little David\nHello Jim are you doing All right thanks\nTo your show and I have to agree with your previous caller about the motives of ... when he made a big spectacle of giving Donald ... praise and I just happened to wonder I I have to wonder if he was really sincere or just trying to jump on the term Trump ... to ... notoriety\nMade me a little hard to imagine that ... that it'll help pay rappers career\nThat's kind of what I'm going into yeah but er I ... I Can't help but wonder you know all the comments that Donald right after he said they're spread out Grady was areas are very smart man and then they all he could eat welcome there anytime\nA what would you know that being said Donald lily thanks very often what would have said are counted got up there and told them what our or about holy was all this other stuff but he's still be a great man and you know well\nI think we I think we know our president well enough to know now that no the president will lay on the heavy\nHeavy uh compliments if he liked what you say and heavy complaints if you don't so do I I think you've used ... question there David no obviously a a ... west said had everything to do with what the president had to say in response\nCharlie in Manhattan, Kansas and the good evening Charlie welcome\nSir jumbo how're you doing I'm well sir thank you\nWell you know a lot of people in this country and they ran into him all the time going back to your age maybe a little over but people don't have the courage to say I mean let somebody else to sink in for him\nAnd uh one thing I heard that I saw it on the Internet today Eric sold it for ex President Carter\nWas a great thing because he said that Kavanaugh was not\nA bad because of the first and they wait conducted himself his performance in the hearings boy you know he I don't know Carter been there a court room at the Capitol Hill they just say in a mate\nI really don't use it and one thing you see what I mean\nHe is using one thing and and again I I'm curious how Jimmy Carter would react if such charges have been thrown at him I've interviewed Carter so I don't even have to to ask that rhetorical question I Know how we would react\nHe would react very intensely would probably out Kevin Cavanaugh in that regard not to mention a although we we should in this context\nThat Kavanaugh wrote an apology that appeared in the op ed pages of the wall Street Journal saying that if he went overboard that he apologized for that so\nYeah I I can I must say I I put Jimmy Carter the category of\nWho cares quite frankly I don't I consider him has been to some extent never was and he was a better ex president than the president so yeah I see what you're saying and I I appreciate the your thoughts are Charlie thank you very much for that Pam in Sioux City Iowa good evening Ben\nHey I just want to listen to your show all the time on my way home from work and like far I'm actually calling from my car\nThat I think what the kind of a west and the cello slashed Gail and I'm an independent and I and I'm not a Republican and I am an end to end and I think I don't think it's that they want to they're trying to tell people what to do I think your point is they have millions of followers\nAnd they just want to let their followers now how they feel I don't think they're trying to tell them how the how about I just think that um they just again they just have millions of followers\nOh they do that and I and I'm sure that you're correct I mean the problem I have is merely the fact that there are a lot of people who may very well formed an opinion based on what some celebrity says that's the part with which I differ or that they both have the right to speak out of without question without question are great\nGreat great but I it again and like I said I like I I really respect your show a lot and\nAgain I think that I think I guess trying to reach all their followers and just trying to get to vote out there now\nThat that ... in which case ... together because as I say I firmly believe that each of them\nProbably injured their career to a certain extent so if in fact it was that outdoor mystic a boy when you take a hit you in your career for something you believe in the well that's that's worthy of applause Richard Durham North Carolina about high\n[noise] hey Jim are you doing it and I am well sir thank you\nI'm a on my way home most of the more you know\nI listen to you on a regular basis in a pretty shaky show I ah I Believe I've always said this in my life that\nI Believe that um celebrity have a certain responsibility when they get to a certain point of saying that they want to use their\nThing to get into politics that's one thing where they are actually active in politics but when you have so many years the day that\nAbsolutely do not know what's going on and they add ally nice April and if they only that their idols want them to vote a certain way that's the way they should go not knowing\nWhat the consequences are fill that that's the wrong way years you're saying\nYeah I I again uh I I think what they have to say and how they said both both does a couch a very much uh so I see what\nYou're saying and that that would be actually wagging the circumstance is good for them back in the moment he calls every spring\nBut when they call it they're talking\nOf course a lot of ... or ... and and
