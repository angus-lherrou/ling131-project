amount of irony obviously attached to the president\nCalling for a a civil tone or would have been a lot I think a a better for him had he not engaged in some of the tone that he is set in the past because that would have given a clear moral superiority or in contrast to a party which has stood by\nAnd essentially in some cases are actually whipped up the mob and in other cases that just sat back and ignored the mob but the uh give the president is often hard pressed to uh\nTo curb his tongue so as a result he finds himself dipped into the mix with the with the others who are your thoughts on that a doctor Uber's we go back to some calls here\nI think I think when we talk about President Trump we're talking about actually a businessman who a political solution not a politician he practiced and uh I think that's one of the reasons why he was and he he was not a career pilot\nAnd not a politician he practiced and uh I think that's one of the reasons why he was and he he was not a career politician and a lot of um middle America just upset and having to deal with\nWith both parties seem to become kind of a ruling class and they're tired of that so they put somebody in

right yeah go\nInto instead cost overruns and usually know accounting so top secret budgets fear based budgets are certainly some times are bad science budgets are can clearly go out to just off the register if if you're trying to check the books for Congress\nAnd you discover that some program is just looking at for all it's worth\nA you know we get whistle blowers we the people need to whistle blowers okay and and so the idea of getting every uh getting America to start spending money on every willy nilly ill\nAs opposed to this whole incident the Saudis are so guilty and these two versions of trying to be afraid of people seeking freedom\nYou know I guess I tried to put your comics in the context of the discussion at hand we're talking about the uh the seven pipe bombs that were delivered to various locations I mean\nI remember the tone of rage ... are you familiar with\nThat and I doubt that most of the reality ... one of the Palmer Raids and how does that relate to what we're talking about\nWell that's how Jared Hoover got his start and it was in Woodrow Wilson stay and they have these pipe bombs that went off and Vanderbilt\nActually went off in this case pipe bombs could have gone up I trust your not not assuming the track you down these people would not be a legitimate public expenditure this was a baby budgetary expense based on fear but it's a very reasonable fear\nWell after nine eleven they invented the Patriot act and they\nCame out and about what they didn't call just invent the Patriot act and point of fact we faced an actual attack and if we in fact sometimes spend money because of fear if it's eight founded fear I personally have no problem with it not can we go overboard I suppose I don't feel that these particular instances we did Dr Huber\n[noise] I think anything that that is reactionary that causes us to give up our rights it if for quote unquote safety is a bad mistake a I think we have to be cautious as\nCitizens and pay a lot of it as to what our government is doing or or there's a new and we're we're the watchdog so\nI I see where he's coming from we need we need to maybe slow down some of this knee jerk reaction\nAnd make it more of a thoughtful process new laws and you know there are times and you know I Know it can do that we just have to react because we don't have fine yeah\nAlthough of course I Would note that in some cases we're not talking about taking away our rights for example we don't have a right to get on an airplane quickly correct but All right to a dawn in Albany, Oregon now the\nLimited evening at least for me it's sounding like some whack job to President Trump's rhetoric for marching orders\nMaybe or maybe he decided that he would still be tried to smear conservatives we don't know\nThis is this your true yeah and and then it was to coordinate him though I don't know how much of a quote unquote white job it could have coordinated\nThe that's the thing that I think that you make a very telling point Dr Huber that that this would require have required very well organized whack jobs plural and they don't come they don't tend to come in well organized groups\nExactly yeah that that that that I think the the the doctor but it's a very good point there that for this to have been delivered to the ... that it was would indicate that we are talking about more than just a whack job which is even more disturbing because I Will take it they have given that we will always have\nPeople of that nature we've got three hundred and twenty five million of us but organized a

know the the Saudi Britain was behind these bombings or or or bombs or something weird like that this was going to go away and a couple of days they're going to be right back back in the winter of election campaign and the caravan and all the other stuff out there so you know I'm trying to think of what it was that this is ...\nAnd I don't know that and I always just look at that because these things can happen and it and we have looked back before and seen that that has meant that seemingly down made\nIt could be how but I just didn't look at all yeah yeah you\nKnow I ... thought I I again I I look at it from the standpoint of if it was designed Dr Huber to take our attention off of something\nWhat would it possibly be because it clearly couldn't be the caravan which will be a story long after this bomb thing has gone away it can't be the mid term elections one that's Thirteen Days away and we're going to be all elections all the time leading up to that point so maybe Linda's right maybe there was an attempt to describe is for something\nWith what's going to be ah that ah that we're going to forget about it in the next couple of days which is about how long it's going to take us to forget the bombs\nExactly well historically terrorists and terrorism was used to uh oftentimes ah terrorize a culture or a specific population and what that off and that was you know sway people's fear of a cultural annihilation and and usually\n... while those individuals up and made them move into action so if we take the idea that maybe this was a political\nUh the ... and\nPlay that they're trying to get maybe more Democrats now to go to the polls that actually vote by saying look they were all targeting Democrats we almost lost a whole generation of our leaders\nOr maybe I
