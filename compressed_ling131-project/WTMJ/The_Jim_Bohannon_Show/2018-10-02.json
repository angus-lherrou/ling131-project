one eight six six five oh five or six to six delighted to have you on the program tonight as we are talking about the new deal that's been were dealt with Mexico and Canada\nAnd do that deal has a a is designed to replace NAFTA was something that is a little more American friendly we'll see just how that goes over with the the Congress or whichever Congress it turns out to be of course with the mid term elections coming up and keep in mind of course\nThat although there are elections in November the new Congress will not actually take power until January so you could have sixty days left with this Congress I'll be at a with a lame duck Congress\nAnd the doctor Michael ... our guest is a public policy analyst in Britain lesser of finance at Stockton University and\nA lot of what we've been saying you're I think goes to the very core of a problem but I have always seen with the sort of thing and I guess I could summarize it this way that the more that a free trade zone involves disparate economies\nThe less likely is to succeed and again that's just right off the top of my head and I never got past econ one oh one but it just strikes me\nThat a disparate economies don't work things out so well so I think what I'd probably most surprised about is that we worked out this deal with by far the week or less developed of the three North American academies Mexico first and it's the Canadians\nWho was economy is much more similar to ours with whom we're having the biggest trouble so if you would uh address my theory a professor you may give me an a through an afternoon I'll take my lumps go ahead [laughter]\nLet me let me say this um you're you're you're correct um unless that less than developed country has some real advantage and making something versus another country for instance\nTo pose the a and here's the example I use on my classrooms um suppose the the the U.S needs a week and they need coffee\nSo we're very efficient at producing wheat we have the right climate for it we use small amount of resources get a large amount of we were not so good at making coffee we don't have the right climate port we can use a lot of resources and not get much coffee\nA country like Columbia let's say and South America is just the opposite\nThey don't have the climate or to grow wheat nor the the know how do they have to use a lot of resources and get a little bit of weight on the other hand they have a great climate for growing coffee and they're good at it so they use a little bit of resources to get a lot of coffee what happens they say\nSuppose the U.S specializes in making just we\nWere going to get huge amounts of weight\nColumbia says okay will specialize in jest making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for your wheat\nBoth countries end up with more coffee and more wheat without adding any more resources\nSo free trade benefits everybody well why somebody complaining you would say and the answer is if we stop making coffee and my example that make just wheat anybody making coffee is out of a job you say well you can go next week\nBut the skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the EU\nAll from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has an ... is very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products to sell them in Canada we'd end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is\nWhat happens to the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else but they say we don't want to do something else yeah we want to continue to make dairy products for and that's what the Rob is with with Canada All right\nTo a call from Sharon in ... Missouri yeah good evening Sharon\nAnd eating candy and about ... ... I think I heard today only what on radio is that China has announced that they are going to be paying terrorists\nOn ... side items and it sounds like there's going to be quite a few items that they are terrified and fact\nBased bad trade agreement that we had had\nFish I'm Sorry I I just I too jaded anymore I Do not believe in it at it from ... notion of what we've got to help everybody else\nThere is one law that goes that all of their lives when it comes to politics to power and that followed them money and if you follow it in for that is put on our politicians\nBy the audience by different governments by our own government if you follow that money you will find exactly why we had had bad trade agreements ratified\nWell we're coming up on a break airlifted larger give is linked here I'm sure more learned opinion after the break Sharon I Will add to a couple of things here\nUh to what you just said and please stay on the line a one would be of course that are no matter how much lobbying occurs on behalf of foreign governments and goodness knows there's a ton of that\nOutright passage of money to a political candidates for public office from foreign sources is very much a no no and the second thing is I think you are vastly underestimate him the extent to which so many elites in this country ... oh so so guilty about how rich we are I'm ... and we'll be back in just a moment\nWhen you just need to be her and when you just need a voice breaking news weather and traffic in the morning on your way to work times\nAbrams tank I'm sure the Chinese could make if we're far less than that so why don't we\nOutsource our entire capability of making battle tax to the Chinese and well rather we could also outsource the F thirty five fighter and our modern ships in the like and that we would just make out like bandits except for the fact that of course we will become the third rate world power\nYet except we don't have to have them built the tanks in the planes but\nIf the tanks in the planes have so much steel and them we can buy the steal from the Chinese are much lower cost\nThan it cost ... than for us to make ourselves then instead of these planes costing whenever they cost a few million dollars a piece you can reduce the cost to make the planes we don't need to give China our technology we don't need to let them make the finished product but if they can make components\nCheaper than we can make them ourselves are we better off taking it from them um and that allows us to produce it cheaper and that will be better off for us is\nWhich raises another point and I was ... or something I'm going to bring up when we come back from the break but the point is you you said that ... we we shouldn't have to give the the Chinese our ah our intellectual property secrets but of course to build a plant in China Today that's exactly what the Chinese have extracted from us\nAnd we'll come back and talk some more about uh some of the the

say yes to a fair amount of what is in this\nLet's talk to David new calls in from San Francisco divide the David good evening [laughter]\nYes I jumped up and your guest I I'm Out here in San Francisco we've got two major a financial problems\nDirectly tied to this Chinese steel and uh one is the bay bridge which got opened a just a fabulously sort of five years ago and it was\nThis was the new post earthquake Bay Bridge right\nRight yeah and in fact uh if you remember just a dollar value uh at at in the Nineteen eighty nine earthquake they said it would be a quarter of a billion dollars to fix the bridge\nWhen the new bridge opened a couple of years ago it was a what six billion dollars in cost and six billion in finance so it went well forty eight times to become a twelve billion dollar broken bridge\nAnd I was defective when it when it opened\nNow are you saying that that was built with with Chinese steel\nOh yeah and what was going well I didn't know that yeah and what was significant about it\nI didn't know that yeah what was significant about it our nose was the governor and this crosswords are right okay yeah I\nWas a Republican governor and little brown was the former mayor the two of them put it together and they created they actually created a foundry in China to manufacture the ... the bridge apart there were very few repeating apart so it was almost entirely customs\nAnd the they had something like twenty thousand inspectors per part\nOr each part had to have an inspector ... part ... almost to the to the mayor and they refused to accept delivery on the part yet it was over written by a a project manager who had no right to override\n... that that sounds like a terrible deal I must say although I'm not sure quite how it fits into the the context of this discussion regarding a trade matters other than the fact I I guess is a professor bus or you should always look twice when dealing with the Chinese [noise]\nBut uh uh Kurt in Rochester, Minnesota is a next step below courage\nHigh yellow the thing that bothers me about the ah the steel ... who from China is if you drive a car\nA lot then you have to have your brakes re done you may have found out over the last Twenty years that you can't turn a rotor\nAnymore because the Chinese steel that all the car owners are made out of is so poor that it is not turn of all\nYou know years ago you used to be able to take a break rotors or your drums in and you could Milam down and get another life out of them\nBut nowadays everybody has to throw away their owners because the ... the Chinese steel maybe cheaper but the quality is also cheaper\nAll right I Want our guest to comment about that we've had two calls are regarding the quality of of dealing with the Chinese\nIf it's that bad at least in regard to steal I mean you know when you when you buy a a broom and Walmart you're really not looking for the the\nThe the nicest brew him out there you want something that will sweep the floor or something like this well I mean a indicates will break drums a that's not such a good thing in the case of bridges that's a terrible thing maybe you will die\nOr is that the other problem\nIn trading with the Chinese the question of qualities do we had a question some time back about\n... I forget who was food or pharmaceuticals but there was some serious question about Chinese quality [noise]\nYeah that's that's always an issue of products like steel obviously quality is essential there especially you're going into products\nOr like a bridge or something that could cause some severe a\nInjuries but how about some of the uh smaller consumer product look at the textile in industry so if the California used to have a huge textile industry and workers were making let's say twenty dollars an hour and as a result of that they made a real nice shirt that sold for fifty dollars\nOr the afternoon for each one have you on every single day Africa welcome to the pleasure of your low warm and fuzzy sponsored by bobcat plus we're about home with the Green Bay Packers in Nineteen twenty nine WGM jak [noise]\nTo [noise]\nMy integrity and earn respect him in home or too far from provide some time we've been representing businesses in Wisconsin for over one hundred and Seventy years was continues to be important\nTo us is making sure that I guess in the way this excess of your best\nClient deserve good lawyers Meissner Tierney Fisher in Nichols empty up in the dot com [noise]\nSave time money and frustration every Saturday morning in Tulsa I'm able to value that aid got clients and can be construction for more\nTraining in June patient with the stocks will travel shell and I can hear money for an unbiased reviewing that's now become adults management sixty Seventy six fifty three sixty three percent of the antics slump\nDot com to help you me it's Saturday on how to radio WGM Jay [noise]\nWisconsin's ... news radio WGM Jay Milwaukee [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Richard Gere to Jessica Clement shot three four\nValley you Alberta, Canada [noise]\nThe scene in Las Vegas one year after the massacre the names of the fifty eight people killed by snipers Stephen Paddock rented an anniversary vigil it's been a year and bump stocks are still legal pad I use the devices to convert a semi automatic rifles into fully automatic machine guns and we still don't know what drove him to do it\nInvestigators have pulled over and police surveillance videos have Steven panic toting he's deadly stockpile but tonight are no closure to determining his motives in the ...
