to hear other parts of Steve Bannon\nBut the caravan is the big story the caravan of Mexico I've seen Fox numbers now tonight swelling to fourteen to fifty thousand the caravan of migrants and who knows whom and Univision tonight had a guy in Spanish that's why we don't play it but\nAh one of their reporters embedded with the caravan says he's met migrants from known terrorism hot spots like Bangladesh what\nAre they doing there this is part of the fear but the other is what Trump ran on tonight in Texas we're seeing a rally that is this gargantuan is anything we've ever seen\nUpwards of a hundred thousand people may have been there all day long with cookouts and tailgating and packed a basketball arena tonight with Trump been cruise now here is though something a little bit different Fox infringed today\nThey had on independent voters member it's Fox News channel and they were asking these people about the caravan\nAnd here's what the Democrats are believing and I don't believe them and you can tell us that eight six six fifty jumbo\nThere believing there's a lot of people in America we're going to see this as humanitarian crisis they're going to see this is evil wrong Trump I'm not proud to be an American if he stopped his caravan and all of his threat listening to these independent voters according to Fox News on Fox in print this morning\nRejecting pushing back against this caravan saying it's fear mongering and the like here's how it sounded\nLike a la Turk with you\nHow big a problem is that the United states has hunting even immigration laws\nI I think even the immigration laws are are a problem for any country and I think our immigration laws are needed to be modernized and updated or a month this country is founded on immigration and all of us come from immigrants are\nSo what should the United states do with those seven thousand people by the time it gets there can be ten thousand going to be twenty thousand which of the United states feel about this\n... this country on the planet I think we can handle a a caravan of people unarmed coming to this country so Letterman and well I Am saying too cautious improperly real quick I mean there's a humanitarian\nCrisis taking place in Central America and yet this issue get turned into a complete political football there's very little honest discussion about what's actually happening and can turn into talking points and they're\nTreating I'm treating this as an invasion is is a bad idea and going to end hardly if it is treated such as that way so I think the ... the the the human beings coming here and there needs to be a real solution um do offered um in in\nDealing with it or but the backdrop his the terms and so it all becomes political let's see what happens we're just\nAll right that's from Fox and friends are sworn in my audience was outraged after they heard that in Philadelphia today how about you eight six six fifty Jim what's not all political stopped with the political stuff this is a real issue we go back and forth with this we have awkward says he said it could be twenty thousand I'm seeing various caravans various things come together\nJust they they're gonna punch through Mexico\nIt is we have awkward says he said it could be twenty thousand I'm seeing various caravans various things come together just they they're gonna punch through Mexico it appears they've already broken throw in there headed toward the border and it may happen next week challenge of next week right before the midterms\nWell this is the issue writ large in front of his his goes on every day not not in the staggering numbers on mass\nBut this sort of invasive behavior has gone on every day I've been to the border I've done shows from there\nThis is a type of thing that goes on and I think this\nPlace badly for the Democrats and open borders and these independent guys here saying well\nJust let 'em me is that the solution now you know President Trump is even talked about shutting down the entire border if that's commercially and the military and the only hesitation I have there is you would meet an ass massive number of military to apprehend and stop this church\nAnd if the military had to use physical force firing on people that would not be good but short of that I think Americans say no they analogize it I've had all kinds of people tell me this is like someone just saying they're coming into my house because there's enough of them and they're going to come here and that's it\nIs that wrong we do have laws we do have asylum laws we do have the ability to process this it is not just political\nAnd all of this comprehensive reform enforce the laws we already have first how about doing that before we stopped at this comprehensive nonsense all the time back and forth with this\nWhat would you do in this situation I got a lot more sounds on this coming up but I'd love to get you in and if you have a reaction to the ban and that was really good stuff here's Amanda mystery open up about some things\nEight six six fifty Jim ... that will do it eight six six fifty jumbo get you to me down to your Dana this caravan story if it breaks right if they reach the border say days before the midterm election could be a game changer\nDemocrats in the media are thinking America's totally sympathetic they'll see Trump for the bully and all this stuff it is they won't feel good as Americans if\nTrump stops is I think it's the opposite if he doesn't stop it\nHe loses faith in the base of people saying that's why we elected you to stop stuff like this we don't want this [noise] love to hear from you my name is Tom junior data com sitting in for Jim go hand in on Westwood One [noise]\nSo if they make it toward the border which I think they will the dilemma is what level of force do you use in order to stop this Democrats are hoping\nThat somehow or another you'll use that level of force that America will be a revolt it I think America will not particularly if the military can push back on this\nWithout anyone losing their life or anything like that\nBut this is going to be an ongoing problem this is going to continue and continue and continue until we put up enough of a barrier ha a wall\nTo stop this but this is why Trump was elected Democrats in a meeting or not they think this is the October surprise that this is going to cut in their favor I don't see it in that way at all or let's go to Dan in Trenton New Jersey a damn good evening\nAnd assemble it to be a site on human trafficking Daniels on Google Capital says you're trying to get to the last Fifteen minutes timeline plants as I can only hold your county jail for six months\nBut I have a way to vote for three hundred years of solitary can record a judge asking for a contract for\nAll right thank you thank you very much a dance sorry to hear that thank you mark in Huntsville, Alabama is with us on the Hannity show although mark\nHow're you doing today good okay\nYeah I Believe built from Colorado so the head of what I wanted to speak about these people claiming that there are being ran out of the neighborhoods in our country and as a bill speaking or\nGive them weapons let the women and children come this far will take the women and children while they go back and fight and take the ... the Democrats are behind this one hundred percent of the things he has\nCome a lecture and they they are going to get surprised 'cause we're gonna make sure that it served as Republicans go out and vote I think it's going to be a mass turn out for the Republicans and we've done our own what we supposed to how this is insane to let these people companies country and they're going to one of our border\nAnd and go to the bottom of it\nIf we have to do all means necessary if Donald Trump got the call the army out on the air force of the Marines to stop them being all means necessary it must be done\nBecause I I hear you I hear you the logic of that Steve I mean mark but I don't think that's exactly what the Democrats in the media are hoping for you know what that would be like\nIn the short term as people are emotional if it happened right before the election in the long term you're absolutely right we cannot have people think they're just going to storm the border\n\nWe and you know are behind Donald Trump one hundred percent he's doing a great job he's a great guy and if it gets to it I mean it always ends at war if it has to we got to make sure we when and if that's what has got\nTo stop them at that border let's go Donald all means necessary I'm\nBy well thank you mark thank you very much eight six six fifty jumbo coming up I Want to play you a the bishop I'm a Catholic and what he said about people protecting our borders it's nuts bishop of Tucson I don't think you've ever heard this was at a ... of other Catholic bishops and archbishop such shocking\n... sitting in for Jim behind it can't believe\nWe're

manageable or at least the government was smart enough to inundate the border with agents are where we had controlled and better but now with these hordes coming as it's getting back out of control\nShe loved to have a good\nYeah well here's what it is and I've been thinking about this um you know um he\nCould the president could send the military down there which is a smart move however listen these people are coming\nAnd it seems that that's inevitable so my thought was\nTo set up a massive refugee camp or we have the greatest military on if we can set it up in no time set up with\nCans and with messed holes in the shower facilities and everything that they could possibly need therefore a we would not be splitting families and so on and so right\nThere for the Democrats can't go crazy over that kind of thing and then what we do oh by the way we set it up next to a place that has a big airport so you need to do it by the human error stationery over in Sierra Vista a default would chew cuts and here's the thing is ... and we used to do this for a long time ago what we can do is it\nSo these people are all going to claim some refugee status or still asylum status and stuff and what they do is they they um\nTo set them up in front of an immigration judge who eventually make the determination on them okay so what they do what they should set up\nThese um I'm I'm\nJust right you can and then have them go in there and make sure everything's all co pathetic and everything's good there and sank down immigration judges judges okay and attorneys and everything they can all legal and stuff so that dentist can't complain\nAnd then literally go through each family claim or each person's claim like they're going to do anyway without releasing them into the United states\nAnd if they go through this then we could do what's called a jeep pet light which is a repatriation flight to their country\nAnd hold on I'm In agreement with that here's the problem though my sense is that so far they're not going to settle for that they're saying they're just coming into the country and that's it because there's well by the numbers whoever's organizing this and it's going to be bigger\nI don't know how you're going to hurt them toward these refugee camps to be hurt I don't think they're going to settle for that\nWell I'll be honest with you I could you know

him and the Republican Party or independent of Democrats don't want them imagined being kicked out around that\nBut we're seeing tonight a couple of things I wanted to ask you were seeing in Texas and I'm hoping that we can you hear from somebody maybe in the Houston area they're traveling back and listen to radio that behind and show eight six six fifty jumbo that was that the Trump rally cruise rally the tailgate\nThat the guesstimate is it could be eighty two hundred thousand people at some point today were on those grounds are around them this truly was athletic just amazing even for taxes eight six six fifty jumbo\nAnd if you've been to a Trump rally\nWhat is the magic of it when you're inside the entertainment of that the I mean these people in Montana last week we're\nWaiting hours out there in freezing temperatures not just you know I I don't know who I Would wait for for that number of hours or ever have waited for four or five hours or more eight six six fifty jumbo get you on board\nNow I didn't have a chance I wasn't on the gym I did it on my own show in Philadelphia though\nThe opposition to this is just enraged tonight on several levels Kevin McCarthy he's their house majority leader you see this guy prematurely grey nice looking guy California\nWell his office was vandalized of Boulder is the report a large Boulder these guys picked up a Boulder not just the breaking through it through the window and took off they have it up all its Instagram account\nThrowing a Boulder holding a Boulder up between the two of them and throwing it through a window of Boulder attack\nAnd here's the thing is the most divisive celebrities in America a focus group last week did this morning console this call and they took celebrities entertainers people like me talk show host satellite\nAnd the criteria was that there was the most polarity between Democrats and Republicans with these two in other words Democrats favor the Republicans were opposed or the opposite that it so Hannity was in second place Russia was in third\nWhat do you think was number one\nAnd I'm going to tell you who number four was and I think she's been out it Ellen DeGeneres was number for now I'm a shock you think of Alan\nNice enough women that seems to me the dancing and all that well here's an example though you know she brings on Democrat politicians right before the midterms right before the presidential race just gives them an incredible forum everybody so nice there's no challenge and it's like an infomercial for them that's what it's about\nWell the executive producer do you know the executive producer is that the top producer out a multitude of producers of the Ellen DeGeneres show tonight showed his hand and I think this is what the degenerate show was about\nHe attacked millennia Trump I mean look you can attack president try to attack in Milan and get Trump\nThe executive producer Andy last nerve took to Twitter\nTo insult Mrs Trump and to praise the care of and he said\nI'm way more afraid of another ... getting into this country than I Am of any of the caravan of human beings seeking asylum is what he wrote\nAnd I maintain this is exactly the mentality of the people around these shows even as something that seems to be as offensive as the show\nIn this is exactly the mentality of the people around these shows even as something that seems to be as offensive\nAs the Alan ... number for the most divisive about Republicans and Democrats it who's the number one most divisive figure out there and it needs to Russia's three you get that

can you imagine\nEight six six fifty gym about eight six six five zero five forty six twenty six let's get some callers in right now Don and now Albany, Oregon\nIs that they're good evening good evening Hi\nDoing good myself I'm just I just have one question for your are\nCommunist socialist their own worst enemies more often than not\nA in some ways but here's the problem down right now we have whole generations of people that have been under educated or indoctrinated in colleges and the like and to them socialism is not human misery socialism seems like a new id and kind of cool to them as strange as it is\nYeah [noise] but I think something like that myself\nNo but that's a big difference of course we couldn't we've seen this we've lived through various things are these millennials and the like today I'm done and they just see that they're going to get something out of what is a tough time for them thank you and it is for some millennials\nStudent loan debt Everytime I see just Cory Booker is out there tonight you know the Spartacus guy the guy in South Jersey Cory Booker is calling for fifty thousand dollars be given\nTo children in various families of under income that's his big ploy running for\nPresident just give them fifty thousand dollars that's the way to ah make things more equitable fifty grand a hundred grand I don't know the fifties enough and I've seen Democrat after Democrat gone after\nStudent loan debt well here's the thing who's charging all the people that run colleges are progressive Democrats making a lot of money why are they charging well every time they raise the rates people start to scream how much it costs to go to college so what do they do\nThey have to get more student loans and more money from the government et cetera then what do they do they raise the cost\nWho's responsible for how costly it is to go to college it's the people running colleges making that decision these figures are not figures that are reasonable or keeping up with inflation or anything else they're made up figures they're charging but everything got away with and it's outrageous\nAnd I think you're starting to see a little bit of a pullback here\nBut it's progressive that are running All right so who is the most polarizing figure celebrity figure out their yelling show and if you've ever been to a Trump rally and I'm really hoping to get somebody I think we might have a couple of coming up\nHere in the ... and John and want to get them full time if you went to this rally tonight or all day long\nThis was athletic this may further induce people to know you're not alone out there as we head toward the midterms if you support that Trump's agenda or conservative causes there is not just going to be a blue wave here it's not going to happen in the Senate Republicans are going to pick up three or four Senate seats\nOn top of what they already have a house that's where the battle is that's going to be tough it's

our way\nThe average American apolitical they may have been like Dave they are activated by this and they say what Trump here's a guy finally taking his hand on\nYou know they vaguely might be a Democrat or Republican but they're sick of the politics they see this is a different time in a different person what did they see on the other side they see people doing stuff every day that are mob like these are mops\nI've had it here in Philadelphia I've experienced some of it we have a lot of anti ... here but it's not just ... its people going crazy all over the place to leave and that's the first amendment right to harass people scream at them as a professor this week\nAnd the University of Mississippi did nothing about it he tweeted out don't just harassed these conservatives

quite quite said if he doesn't like Donald Trump's away present at times and all that\nThat protecting America even if flawed versus the other side just on the attack significant numbers are going to

while in the holiest places I understand it inside the temple\nAnd then he sort of apologizes but not really and he says he's passionate and Democrats want people that are passionate about this what have you heard during this particularly in a circumstance like this guy throwing out the F bomb\nNow if I had the sound the sound was on the well this is what ... wanted in place but a TV station may have gotten it but just think about this and this is classic of what the Democrats are prosecuting which is the health care thing when even a Washington Post says the Republican did not do that would not do that\nIt's a lie wow I Can't take it\nRight there and they you know and this is a sacred spot this guy just blurt out I Can't imagine\nRight there and they you know and this is a sacred spots this guy just blurted out I Can't imagine is he just\nNever have run into something like this in a circumstance like this I let me go to the cars let's go to Katie in Redding Pennsylvania hey Katie welcome in\nAnd I'm just sitting here listening here and taking the man that kind of neat that guy in my opinion even lower than trailer trash you know\nWhat it said shocking and if I get to stay on next time I Want to play it you got to stand up Katie this guy is worth of the family was worth three hundred million is silver spoon\nHe just came in is trying to buy his way he lives in a luxury golf course really in South Africa this candidate who came to Bucks County and people here are in shock it's one thing to drop the bomb during debate that's hard to believe\nBut it's another to do it on the home court where you want it to be in the sacred ground of the temple\nExactly I mean in my opinion is just a few things in the world that you just don't mess with\nOne of them yes hello\nYeah exactly right it's hard to believe Nike Katie thanks very much that's why I'm bringing it up as an example of when they get frustrated on the Democratic side where this is going it's David in Greenwich New Jersey hello David\nI'm thanks for taking my call I'm not you want to point a to a real estate friend of mine who does business who was there\nAnd not only I mean we're like in to that too like the altar and the Catholic Church but not only did he drop it there but he's telling me you should have hurt him outside when he was leaving\nTheir sort of shame thing this coming up from Mexico I'm doing the math and if you have seven thousand people times twelve dollars a day\nFeed them let's say Mexico's and you're talking about eighty five thousand dollars a day I'm concerned that I'm bothered that depress you see these folks walk in ... who's got a backpack who's got nothing who's got nothing there's there's nothing\nThat right well what we've seen radio to point we've seen video at people and that money given out supplies and listen to this I didn't play because it's in Spanish I Univision reporter the translation embedded to your point with the caravan\nSays he's met Mike Rich from known terrorists hot spots like Bangladesh how do people from Bangladesh end up in this sort of a re\n[noise] um because you can walk into any part probably of South America anymore but it'd be great if the press would cover of each feeding and speeding of fueling stations in the medical stations and then on the third point now where I live down here is\nI can see across the Delaware Bay and maybe even forty two miles but I can see the lights at Dover Air force base and it's it's constant day and night at least the bombers and the east east monster transport troop transporter and equipment transport they fly or you don't hear\nA anytime something's getting ready to happen or go down how we would say if they stop\nAnd we've had nothing now for two days okay I was pretty much tells you something is going to be going on in the border pretty much\nSo well right and the areas it's going to take an unbelievable number of troops to do this peacefully though but thank is actually a great point you made here's how you get in eight six six fifty gym about eight six six fifty Jim I Want to play you quickly one\nMore guys this is Steve Schmidt he is the former McCain advisor used to be a moderate maybe now is full bore he's on MSNBC he's sickened by all this here's what he says when he hears we might use the military we might be doing this at the border here is ah Steve Schmidt\nAny idea that when a mother through suffering through a ... term risk and sometimes death\nAll around them when they reach the border and they see a uniform with an American flag and they are no longer safe\nFor that baby it's ripped away and put into an internment camp because there's a moral outrage that harkens to the worst excesses in the history of the country to the separation of families\nAt the slave auction blocks yes to the separation of Native American families it is a moral or I read Japanese entirely and this is the failure of the Democratic party to address this is a small issue not as a profound staying on our national water\nAs a poor family on American policy to frame the question for the country in the style age of ... what is that we are who are we as a people\nThat is a great question thank you for framing it now answer that we are people that are tired and you could tell me who we are do you look in the mirror and sanction is I Do\nWe are people that are tired of the American worker the American citizen in the American population being overrun in this manner by a bunch of people that have gained one way or another by it\nWow inflicting damage on countless communities countless people you know I Wonder what Steve Schmidt would say to the families like the young woman cakes timely killed\nIn San Francisco by a maniac who have been deported six or seven times I Wonder what he would say to that just collateral damage just one person\nThis is a stain on our national honor is it or is it finally seeing someone that's going to step up on this problem that goes on day to day maybe not on mass like\nWe're seeing now but it's a similar problem that we all know was out there\nThat's why he was elected [noise] that's
