look\nAt things that might possibly come before new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh including mainly gun issues in this particular incident semester the area of course\nWhere there have been many many at resolving battle that has occurred at the Supreme Court Charles calls in from Springfield, Missouri this evening hello Charles\nHow are you doing this to ban and I'm fine thank you [noise]\nUm I was listening and I you know you hit on a topic that's always been a kind of a hot button for me and that is how the liberals always do get these ideologues that you know completely side with them but the um\nYou know people get bored you know anytime that a conservative tries to get someone that really is on their side and it's not some halfway you know a retire in ...\nUh you know the Democrats are an absolute fit but we the conservatives do nothing like they have constantly there the the party of appeasement and they need some on this got some fight and then in just says no or we're going to fight for this\nAnd we just haven't seen it I mean I look at the Democrats and how they treated cabinet that'd be despicable and either party however why don't we ever fight [laughter] you know where you can fight they put up\nYeah that's a that's a good point out what our guest to address it I I certainly agree with the Charles uh\nAbsolutely uh Dave in regard to the notion of the next time there's a a a Democratic president if we put up by and liberal justice will you start coming up with a stories about how they uh they uh they litter or have overdue parking tickets or what have you I think that that is a struggle noted that disgusting practice\nBut uh I was wondering uh have Republicans fought hard enough regarding some of the more liberal a recent pick say for example a Brock Obama's pick some of which I I think sailed a ride through I mean it seems to be Republicans tend to follow the the the victim\nIt's the president's choice of the nominees qualified I can go with it whereas Democrats followed the victim uh I disagree with that person there for anything and everything is fair game\nWell I I think if you look at it from the perspective of Republican credit follow the constitution a little bit more than the Democrats do at least in this issue\nAnd and the the or a collegial bunch of people which I'm not too sure that pays off anymore collegiate being collegial doesn't work too well when you were in a bar fight\nAnd that's what we just witness frankly you know I I remember\nBack when I was in high school and we talked about all this stuff for the American government and and then I had some good teachers back then people are weren't really afraid to speak out poll a spade a spade and say look you know people do this\nBut that's wrong and shut the government is supposed to work\nNow days or ... it's almost like a a a pitch battle you know a food fight and what they tried to do to a British Cabinet oh the Democrats\nAre with this eleventh hour Hail Mary thing bringing up the Ford accusations and and and frankly I have a lot of sympathy for I think she got thrown under the bus a fifth of the dogs the ... just in order to uh to try to derail Kavanaugh's nomination\nUh they were both ... and it would probably be who've the the Republicans now especially if they retain control on Capitol Hill after November\nTo launch some investigations into just how did that become public or what we witnessed with a judge Kavanaugh dental justice capital\nOr was it just deplorable if not despicable and I wrote about this uh I've covered this thing for liberty part pressing the gun Meg and I'm going to continue to cover it\nBecause I think what happened there was wrong and and the certainly the polls\nSeem to be indicating that to the public is just wild up this really has fired up the Republican base I think\nIt's bringing people out to vote who probably wouldn't have voted at the midterms but ... they're angry and and they have some people if they were angry at they could identify the people that they're really mad at me and I\nKinda think the Democrats are they might have bloom this\nOne well we'll see certainly both basis seemed to be quite fired up we'll see who does the turnout trick the best Sharon in ... Missouri yellow\n... gang um you know I Hope that justice Kavanaugh\nGuest vote the constitution that but I Want to get it today I Want to make I don't want them to be ... best on the court I why in politics\nAnd some time not going to be happy with that all go against something that I think that it ... ... man I Will I Will by Bob and support it I tired\nIs cork\nA ... law than they are not supposed to do that that is Congress' job I Want everybody to do their job Congress to do their job ... their guy and they did bishop branch did their\nFor those in the judicial branch who do not do their job or I Would keep in mind one thing a shirt and I'll just note the stoop today was well you look at the constitution that information constitution of the house is spelled out in the constitution the Senate the presidency of the the cheap\nThe decision that information constitution of the house is spelled out in the constitution the Senate\nThe presidency of the the chief executive officers the cabinet heads and the like and then you come of course to the article three the or the judicial branch of that is is particularly interesting because it says the judicial power of United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court\nAnd in such inferior courts as weak Congress may from time to time ordain and establish that is to say all of the appellate courts the district courts are creations of Congress Congress can simply repeal any of those courts anytime it so chooses Dave\n[noise] yeah and I think we also know if if you study the walls really will judges are on the lower federal courts and and there's even been some mentioned I think ... New York\nThat that is the liberal democratic congressman go\nAhead yeah and it it he's apparently already talking about trying to recall or get rid of just his cabinet or you\nCan only do that by impeaching him convict\nI Know and and then just you know impeachment is just that came right out of left field but I think that shows just how extreme missed some of these people really are on the east side of the aisle and the country is looking at this and they don't like it\nYou know I'm I'm sure they do that after this appeal to the base which increasingly has as Democrats rather nervous or after what happened to Joe Crowley the New York other New York congressman but again keep in mind as in the case of the presidency\nIf the Democrats get so much as a bare majority in the house yes I'm sure the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump and possibly Kevin ... they'll never get sixty seven votes in the Senate to convict so it's not something that I'm going to lose any sleep over it will be back and just a moment\nWhen you just need to be heard when you just need a voice\n[noise]\nI remember thinking of the time beneficial it's none of your damn business you're concerned about beneficial then resigned that Supreme Court seat run for the house the Senate or the presidency and let's see if your idea of beneficial coincides with that the public\nBut beneficial to describe me coming out of the mouth of a Supreme Court justice beneficial is nothing to do with your job\nWell yeah um so you know you're here we are a back I guess at square one how how did she get on the court will\nThe Republicans say they were collegial and didn't challenge some of these things are obviously they at least somebody had to know about this\nDidn't ask the tough questions but I frankly I think\nWe just witnessed with the cabinet or a confirmation process the rules just got changed even even Senator Lindsey Graham who is\nTypically a laid back guy he ... his things were out the other day he was\nFurious and his Democratic colleagues are on the the so the Judiciary Committee\nAnd I don't think that's going to go away I think they changed the rules\nAnd you know what they're going to have to live with that for a very long time and in ... when Republicans come back and say there is a Democrat is president uh sometime the next four to eight years old and we'll see how that works out uh if if\nIf someone is nominated to a a vacancy on the high court I think the globe's can easily come back off again and and what does what good does it do for the country I don't know I don't know what some of these people are thinking\nWell I I I can tell you what some of them are thinking and then we'll take a quick break here but a lot of Democrats are really running very scared right now the do happen to them is the same as what happened to Joe Crowley the prominent or\nA Democratic House member many thought my baby a successor to Nancy Pelosi is Democratic House leader beaten by this Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nWho doesn't know as much as they used to pass in eighth grade civics class back when they had such things and just just cleaned his clock and now you've got to of course Dianne Feinstein let's not forget her situation in California because of that law out there where everybody runs in one primary and the top two finishers\nAutomatically go on the ballot in November which means that the Republicans have nobody on the ballot for Senate you've got Feinstein the incumbent and you've got a Democrat even further to the left that she is and the California Democratic party endorsed her opponent\nA lot of these Democrats I think in their heart of hearts are probably not thrilled with this but first and foremost they want to keep their jobs and they are running hard scared because of their own laughter as just imagine a state in which\nDianne Feinstein is considered just a little too conservative we'll be back and just a moment from a bigger mess\nIn theory or through a deer\nRecovered it talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre are ...\n... ...\n...

size has changed dramatically pound level but if you look at it from a from a spectators point of view [noise]\nYou're looking at a different game everybody turn that television on everybody comes out pretty much in some kind of an offensive formation where they spread the field they got a kid sitting back there seven plus yards he's a quarterback but he's a tale back in many respects\nAnd if he can run in through the ... he creates more problems defensively spread to steal they throw\nThe ball around and it's nothing for people to score forty fifty points again that's the big change and I think that's what's happened in the game that they've uh they've made it\nMore exciting but they've got talent level that permit them\nTo change the rules by putting excellent people on the

certainly a college football the big ways with the music with bands and a\nLot of spectators are in many schools have a pretty dominant followings in terms of the game of football some would say that there is a\nSerious question about the future of the game it has prompted our guest a Bob cast viola too right\nFirst and forever making the case for the future of football the fact that you have felt the need to write the book alone must have given us some misgivings so that you know it'd be the subject you come up twenty five years ago making the case for the future of football they wouldn't even have been an issue\nBecause of very good question I Would go and was that\nEverybody was taking shots at it and I felt that for my own experience my own experience as a as a player and the coach administrator and from many I coached and recruited\nI felt that story I have to be told to say hey there should be a future they gave should go on I I just want to get back to something very quickly generally you mentioned earlier it talked about change dropping the sport or none of it's very interesting in a pen in Pennsylvania just this year\nThere at three schools three towns because of population changes that have decided they want to maintain that football program and they've done ... eight\nFootball instead of eleven well you know people would say is that an indication of the game is going up I said not at all as long as they're playing and they go on with the game with preserving the game so you do whatever you can do that and the other thing is I noted\nThat this year but the kick off those two thousand Eighteen college football season is a record seven\nAn Eighteen college football season has a record seven hundred and Seventy eight teams playing each weekend since two thousand and twelve\nThirty five teams and join that list\nAnd school out here it's very interesting and again just to say there's other things happening that are positive a hearing surprise Arizona there's a new school\n... the name of it playing at the university plane as a building block to give extra curricular activity to the student base they started the football program so there are some signs that people are finding a way to keep it alive\nAnd in the chapter six of your book first forever or a quota or what you call that the coach of coaches a grant chief building some of the the positive aspects of the game here I'll just read the for the the the you mentioned a positive attitude and approach to life\nA total effort to anything I commit myself to self control of self discipline and caring for others\nUm those are pretty pretty solid point and then a very good points of\nCaring for others I that's a good point I think to explore further at ... ... it sometimes seems I think\nThat the people who watch the game who may not have any close association with other than just watching a a little screen in their living room\nBut the caring for others would be the last thing made with a scribe to football but it is a hard nosed ah ah almost kill or be killed a winning is everything or maybe more along the Vince Lombardi line of thinking and I am wondering your thoughts about this notion of caring\nIn football isn't it very much a\nA hard nose game of of when it's not at all costs at at most cost\n[noise] yeah but I think it's come to the point where\nHave come around to becoming more than just\nOn the on the field giving you an assignment block this guy tackle this guy is covered this band I think they're taking it beyond that what they do with their lives with you beyond your\nFootball experience 'cause no greater example of caring and when you look at the chapter in here on jak L'Engle\nWho came in and took over a program at Marshall after they add disastrous crash and kill the entire team coaches and\nParts of the administration of applying would have went in there and rebuild program rebuild the football program and it's a great story and Jack is a wonderful human being he had a lot he got the job\nThey went through three or four candidates looking how they're going to do this\nAnd they took this guy ... who's ... has a small college in Ohio because he was coming from a background where he had to live and stay and be with his players constantly small college they took a chance with Jack\nAnd he went to marshal and rebuild their program and it's a great story and he's a great story but there are many stories like that you mentioned grand theft ... is the guy that built the Baylor program from nothing he\nWent on to a head up the American Football Association for over Twenty years he's giving person and that's why he talks way does\nAnd I think there's a lot of people like that he and I told people\nWho quickly I tell people that you know there are a thousand coaches that they're they're they're written the book is like mine because there's so many coaches that had the same influence on kids who had the same type of kids that they coach that went on with the allies bigger and better things\nAre we in need of a\nCompetitive sport for normal size people are I think some years ago there was discussion of maybe a a special form of of basketball for people six feet and shorter\nOr do we need maybe a a a competitive football league for people who weigh two hundred pounds or less\nThat could very well be [noise] you know that's a good question that I really haven't thought about too much but the more you talk\nI could see where it would come down to that if it got to be so different that they only the the biggest and strongest could play a everywhere weren't great places I think it would be very interesting to have people who had maybe less size and less talent\nTo find a program that they could fit into because they wanted to play they leave they enjoyed it\n\nEr visits compressor one here's been servicing compressors that wave your motor sports for the years ... says there are other companies
