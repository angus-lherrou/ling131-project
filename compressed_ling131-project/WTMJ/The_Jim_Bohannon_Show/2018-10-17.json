J. T. to me with with Elizabeth Warren did yesterday demonstrates that the sort of in title mentality in fatalities you see she puts out this this story saying All right I've had a DNA test and it shows that\nMaybe maybe somewhere between six to ten generations ago I might have had some native\nAmerican Native American blood All right to which in how does that\nWhat is that game and I'm actually one of the tribal spokesman says this is all about Elizabeth Warren using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely inappropriate in wrong Senator Warren undermines tribal interests with our continued claims of tribal heritage I mean in what world\nDo we say hey I'm One sixty fourth this or I Am one one thousand twenty four this so that means I somehow and part of that minority community and I understand it really for one for seven nine nine one six twenty a bill in Mount pleasant billiard WTO O. J. good afternoon\nGood afternoon uh my wife or you're just fighting about this yesterday we are actually funny\nMy wife and I bought it at ... dot com right and my wife uh actually Canadian citizen but yeah\nUm but ah her her burger generation that are great great great grandmother was actually a native America but we know that you know I Do\nKnow that three generations ago not six generations okay got it\nAnd if they show that shows they live in a narrow America how most people I came that are Native American are chair through oh because the care very straight\nAway from Asia all the way that one oh do you know but I really the whole point is that she's trying your something that a big fan of it as a minority or\nYou know and\nIt's just showing how shallow you have to go to ...\nYeah ... is that oh you are is that I mean is that you're all it primarily\nWhat will my right and also is that\nDoes that tie you win All right are are you familiar with that you can how did you relate to the Native American experience by the fact of virtue that six to ten generations ago maybe you had a relative who\nYou know was was Native American and in some small part I mean it's just it's it's ridiculous I mean your wife I assume would not claim that she can relate to the Native American experience which she\nWell no but it looked like shape that now\n[laughter] yeah ...\nThat they say well Liz miss Warren\nI mean and look and this is from the perspective of a really white guy I mean a a Elizabeth Warren ... [noise] I don't think anybody would mistake Elizabeth Warren for somebody who grew up on on an American Indian reservation I just that's just not the case for one for seven nine nine one six twenty\nLet's talk to Russell in Brookfield Russell your until we T. M. J. lo\nOr high I'm doing is you're getting your tremendous amount of name recognition all across the country it's like going warrior does he ... things I can get all those free booze delete 'em talks about just the\nAdvertising in oh she has to do it just stays or goes like this and get free advertising ...\nWell I mean I think they used to call right but here's what I Would say for for anybody who said that there is no such thing as bad publicity\nThey've never had bad publicity me 'cause the the reality is you in this case I mean clearly Elizabeth Warren did this because she wants to run for president\nPresident Trump has been calling her Pocahontas and she wants to demonstrate that no this is on prove that I really do you know when when I made these claims in my past about having this Native American you know blood and my blood line that I really do have it well it turns out it's absolutely ridiculous that and\nIt again it it's not like saying hey you know my great great grandparents were slaves or something like that\nI've got to and so I I've grown up with this bias and prejudice and I can relate to all the different struggles that people are having that that's not that this is six to ten generations ago most people are looking at this I think enrolling their eyes and candidly I think she played and I I have\nI think she played right to President Trump's hands because by by putting this out she's made herself look ridiculous and if you're planning to run for the president of the United states for the presidency I think in many cases looking ridiculous is the last thing that you ended up wanting to do in any event I guess\nUltimately it's up to the voters but I Will tell you this this is going over like a lead balloon and\nDid up wanting to do in any event I guess\nUltimately it's up to the voters but I Will tell you this this is going over like a lead balloon and I'm even a number of Democrats are saying oh my gosh\nYou know we're trying to focus on this or that or the other thing and now the story for today is how one of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination for president in two thousand twenty\nShe's out with some DNA kit complaining and saying that I might be one one thousand twenty fours Native Americans so that that means I can somehow relate to the problems of people who are in fact Native American big big big mistake by Elizabeth Warren I think she's made herself look ridiculous and I'll go one step further\nIf she now besides after previously saying that she wasn't going to run for president to run for president\nI think this kilter I think she gets killed her presidential campaign because she is made herself look ridiculous and there are other candidates out there who will be glad to point that out it's one fifty to this is Jeff wet your WTO O. J.\nOne fifty five just by WGM Jay I'm One of the things that tells\nMe that maybe that just flew waves that everybody was predicting may not be emerging\nAt least for the ... some people thought seriously some national campaign that is going on\nTo try to scare people about Republicans about health care and and what you're seeing is the generic sort of claims that are being made against Republicans across the country and in in Wisconsin saying hey if these people continue to get elected\nYou're going to take away insurance coverage for pre existing conditions of course a preexisting condition is something you know you've got diabetes or cancer or whatever and you lose your insurance you're not able to get any back\nNow as far as I Know there's no Republicans out there that are suggesting that we do away with coverage for pre existing conditions there simply saying the way Obamacare does it is wrong in Wisconsin before you had Obamacare you had coverage for pre existing conditions that they dealt with it to things like Patrick care and the like\nBut this is the attack that it's being made and to me up at one level it shows kind of this desperate and is it sort of like what we saw over the years for if the Republicans get elected to go to eliminate Social Security and we're going to take gum elderly people and their wheelchairs and when to push him over the clips I mean that type of thing\nAnd that's been one of the challenges have been made against Governor Walker\nOh he's he's he wants to eliminate insurance coverage for preexisting conditions but he's put out something on Twitter now that this is on Twitter\nI don't know if this has been formed into an ad yet but this has been one of the most this has been one of the attack points but he came out with something yesterday that if this isn't an ad it should be an ad it's him sitting in a Green Bay Packers jacket it appears on the back of a bus you'd only one's Twenty one seconds but this is this is the Governor Walker Twitter response\nWith a link the record of success he's had decades of experience he was a general counsel at deans foods\nHe was the c._e._o. of a dairy products trade group and and he was trying to he lost that those jobs for whatever reason and he was trying to get something comparable way couldn't get anything comparable so he decided well All right I'm I'm not going to be in a position runs general counsel for some large company but you know what\nI still do my stuff and I am not at the age of fifty eight I'm not ready to retire at this point in time\nI don't want to start drawing down my retirement money so what I'm going to do is I'm going to lower my expectations I Am going to work at a job that no one said beneath them that's not what I mean maybe he's he's arguably arguably overqualified for the job but you know what the heck yeah job is a job\nSo he starts looking for\nCorporate counsel types of jobs and he finds this jobs it's advertised it it's they're looking for a senior counsel position\nAt I'm a medical technology company\nUm and it's okay well this looks like something that I I could perhaps do and then he comes across the at the ad says\nFor senior counsel three to seven years experience but\nNo more than seven years of relatively relevant legal experience so three to seven years no more than seven of relevant legal experience\nAnd the guy says wait a minute you know what what do you mean I understand minimum that you want okay somebody that's worked in the field three years of relevant legal experience that that's fine but what do you mean no more than seven\nWhat should you care and what if I've got twenty five years of experience you know it it doesn't that make me arguably perhaps more qualified\nGuy never got an interview because he has more than seven years of relevant legal experience and now he's turned around and and he he's filed a lawsuit saying this is blatantly this is blatant age discrimination you know they're\nThey are saying that you know they they don't want somebody because by limited to somebody at the top end to a seven years of experience what they're saying is we don't want anybody who is older we don't want anybody who has more experience and this is I think this is bringing up with this whole issue\nDid a lot of older Americans are finding\nThat you go in for the these jobs and you know you're just not getting in the door because despite the fact that the law says you can't discriminate against people based on age that is precisely what is happening and maybe it's because the employers\nWho offer health benefits recognized as somebody who is sixty maybe and I say maybe maybe statistically more likely to I don't know draw down and health benefits and somebody who's Thirty years old\nMaybe it's because they figured it okay if you get the job at fifty five\nMaybe you're going to only stay eight to ten years whereas if we're looking for somebody who's going to be a part of the company for decades you know we're we're better off going with somebody who's thirty five but this is I think in many respects a real problem\nThan older Americans are having\nAs they jumped into the job market now it's very very tough I guess to prove it but in this particular case the guy saying hey I I've got I've got objective evidence of this\nThey're telling me that I Am essentially overqualified for this job well who are they told me that\nI if I'm willing to do it what should it matter but they're really saying by putting a limit on the amount of experience is they don't want older more seasoned people that want to open up the phone with our numbers for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that if he acted mortgage talk in tech slide\nI Will tell you this anecdotally\nMy sent and this is just from some conversations that I've had with people over the last several years that even in a job market\nWhere you know we're nearing full employment\nBut from the perspective of people who are older and again I'm Talking about in the fifties and sixties but not ready to retire and again willing and able to contribute\nThere there is an incredible anti slash old bias that is there\nAnd that you have employers maybe suddenly maybe not so suddenly who are essentially saying we're not interested in older workers\nHave you found that to be the case for one for seven nine nine one six twenty that is the academic mortgage talk and tech slide\nAnd again I mean I understand that there were a lot of jobs for example that have just disappeared that were occupied by people who might have been in their forties and fifties and and those jobs are gone and those jobs aren't coming back\nBut have you noticed a reluctance or do you believe there is a reluctance on the part of employers to hire people again who are in their fifties and sixties because despite what they might be willing to say hey truthfully just don't want to deal with\nOlder but you know not retiring Americans let's start with Diane entails corners on WGM Jay good afternoon\nI say in your talk I'm Sorry right now I'm really [laughter] [laughter] or not or the nightmare a\nNightmare that's part of an eye on my job in October I still don't have a job I have applied to many many times in between\nI had a number of interviews [laughter] someone someone I got there I realized that wasn't what I wanted others I Would have liked the job and didn't get the offer that were found any job I Would have been perfect or it was like they were writing my description I never heard of word I turn\nI was when I turned it into I I Know I'm sure that's a big part of it I Can't wait until he came back I was getting was that they really liked me but then in the end they gave it\nTo his presumably younger than\nI Am one of them I don't know what's coming in first or second interview oh and I walked out the door and she was quite a bit younger than me and I thought okay there you know I don't think it is certainly a component\nBut then again three very dedicated to my holiday 'cause I don't watch [laughter] right [laughter]\nOnce again I'm an extremely hard worker\nVery dedicated screwing around on my cell friday 'cause I don't like it was a foot columnist [laughter] great [laughter] you know I I Am I really don't get me in the\n... and I I think you see and I think there is a frustration I mean I understand\nYou know it sounds like what's going on is ... ... ... you can't discriminate against people based on age but the problem is how do you prove this to mean and that's right and and how do you ... if if you were to first of all how do you prove but secondly\nI'm you know you you presumably singer out of work you don't have the wherewithal to hire a lawyer that's going to you than filed the lawsuit and things like that I think this is going on a lot I think there is blatant age discrimination when it comes to people trying to get jobs in\nThis argument said well maybe you're overqualified for particular job both nuts today I mean if if you're willing to work at the job\nYou would think somebody would love to have somebody who's overqualified\nYeah that's a story that you led with you know what were they didn't want anybody with more than seven years of experience that's kinda funny 'cause I never thought about that but my mother my two year old mother pointed that out to me when I was reading I mean\nWas like two to five years of experience as she said well you've got way more than five years or even look at you\nKnow I thought oh I think they're just saying they only want it that much but now I'm thinking of that is what they're looking for they don't want my own and they don't want to pay more\nWell yeah I mean I mean I I mean that I got to tell you again and this is this is just you know take it for was worse than when I when I saw that what do you think it through if you say you know I mean I I understand a minimum you know you we want three years because okay so you know was like in the field\nBut why put a maximum on it I mean if you can you can get somebody who's willing to do the job or whatever you're offering and it's got Thirty Years' experience would love to have that experience why put at maximum on there what\nDo you think they wouldn't want Mart and other than that whole story about you know you also point out on the job you know what if they're physically fight that there may be only will be there for ten years you know I definitely think here's an employment my possibly ape depending on whether I go to my care of the retirement age\nRight I don't either that whole time and it's not a lone millennial into ears are going to get this stuff and I look for something else\nWell right well there's no guarantee that somebody's going to stay in a job I mean you just there's no guarantee you that doesn't matter whether you're sixty or whether you're thirty there's no guarantee you're exactly right and somebody could turn around and Sarah I'm leaving in three years and it makes a call Dana hanging there pulling for seven nine nine one six twenty\nAre you going through this I mean it's the nightmare that she says that she is living I think there's a lot of other people that are as well we continue conversations to twenty nine to ...

T. M. J.\n... it was a wealth of riches last night if you were Wisconsin sports fan you had a Green Bay Packers and the brewers in the championship\nSeries going on simultaneously I understand for most of us there was a bit of slipping back and forth but which of those games did you watch slash listen to as your primary won the brewers\nOr the Packers for one for seven and nine when six twenty let's start with Chris and swing or Christmas afternoon\nAfternoon thanks for taking my call for um for the well rounded Wisconsin sports fan I like this is the absolute no brainer your primary focus to be a more diverse and that's where I was at our house partially other reason to his game started a little earlier so you record the other one at a minimum you\nKnow I got to watch the end of the aggregate right I'm off every time it's such a Packer game there are scored\nOur number for one for seven nine nine one six twenty five is the academic mortgage talk and tech slide right obviously locally we know how good does team is argue as frustrated as I Am with the national coverage of the brewers [noise]\nThirty six year will be the end papers frustrated\nGlory will be given the holes are and saying here's what I posted on Facebook a week ago [noise] build brewers underestimated overlook keep flying under the popular kids radars and really it all for the small market\nAnd again I [laughter] I pre shape that there might be some exceptions\nBut if somebody who takes in a lot of of this meeting and talking about the print media electronic media eighty to eighty five percent yesterday if you listen to it you didn't even have to play the game because the Dodgers had this ... this dealer kid pitching the brewers wouldn't be able to hit in ... it's actually and couldn't get people out\nNo problem at all the Dodgers were going to roll and then they were going to go on maybe there'd be winning the whole thing\nAll of those people are eating crow today every analysts at a Fox Sports one predicted the brewers would lose they were wrong this is a team that has got no respect at all they're not on the radar screen because we're from flyover country and I guess getting a little bit frustrated to me\nMary Hartman Mary you're on WGM Jay hello\nHow are you know I never ate it my husband and I try and stay and frustrating\nPart of that one mhm how they are like ... right right right and then put out there and they were all much shortly after the game last night\nLike I had a rough outing right it was so frightening to watch it like yeah I guess like a you know a lot of it around and\nWait and see I I I bet you most of those people never watched the brewers game during the course of the year because all you do is you watch the Yankees and the red Sox and and the you know the Los Angeles team I I was I was in Europe last week but somebody was telling me you know Bob Costas apparently kept calling um\n... you are ... or something like that yeah\nThat's right exactly I Know I I I I Know\nYou are on the air out ... and yeah and I think that even though we're hearing it right there are a lot of sports in general\nI think they granted so for like the first things that are part of life you might be out there that it that there's some small\nRate story you can write it down and write it it's it's\nA great story I mean it really is this kind of David and Goliath thing but again I there's this huge larger markets biased it's out there\nAnd I I think a lot of these people don't follow the team that never followed the team so what they do is they get their little like sheets that the producers right out for 'em and they read this stuff off it no it was I used to call and dress I mean I [laughter]\nIf if you were driving past me on the freeway was I'm going home or something\nAnd you find myself playing it looks like I'm yelling at the radio that's because I'm yelling at the radio because again I have some national commentator from serious or something but just talking about oh I don't think the brewers are going to be able to hit this guy and\nYou know they and they they don't like the way council plays the game they might respect great council but they don't like the idea that oh you you bring in these pictures and they get a couple of thousand times that's not how it's done the teams to win the world series or the teams that have the great starting pitching in and this this new revolution oh this is just this new trendy thing\nAnd you're Clinton crush all the great Dodger his picture on his way to the whole thing he is going to dominate the brewers that's going to be a quick to wins where are they going to get the other ones and\nThey don't even acknowledge this clueless and is that they're just wrong they don't appreciate\nHow good this team isn't yes if I sound a little frustrated and I sound like inventing that's exactly what I Am doing here's attacks thank you yes yes yes yes\nAbsolutely no reflection don't know how to pronounce pronounce names only reliever they can talk about his hater and then to question councils decisions on when to use the arms dealer must be the next Nolan Ryan to hear them talk unbelievable that's what I was hearing yesterday Mac downtown that you're a WTO O. J.\nI yeah I I totally agree with what you're saying I ... I was seeing that yesterday from a from ESPN bad uh the Dodgers winning or last night's game was six to their oh\nAnd then even after you know what we're going to stay away from the brewers a they have the Dodgers wanting to light a six to three\nTimes so I mean oh you know you're here saying I'm you know a lot of the the narrative that are like you know the brewers\nHod can they ride this hot streak and you know the ... Iran um you know run scoring Dodgers\nTeam right and and it's like\nYou know we were very high I mean absolutely but this is more than just the streak and look for more than just Chino October ...\nYeah I mean we make ... ... ... yeah I mean let's look at this okay the\nPlay in a tougher division and the Dodgers do up and down you know so they play you know baseball you've got these unbalanced schedule so the brewers\nThat is not to me a mistress it would be\nA one night stand although if you believe for it does not sound like they were standing very much so that's the deal\nPresident Trump of course denies it happened if it did happen\nI don't know I I'm not sure President Trump has the ability to have a lot of self reflection but at some point in time in the middle of night if it did in fact happened he's got to be regretting but it did because Stormy Daniels who is the greatest publicity hound since Barnum and Bailey\nAnd of course one of the most dangerous places to be in the United states nowadays is between Stormy Daniels are her real name is Stephanie Clifford\nAnd the camera as she travels across the country trying to again give her her career as a strip club entertainer or a boost and but she she shows up because she's a woman who says she slept with President Trump Bob up getting all these different stories you get the publicity\nWell anyhow at one point in time Stephanie Clifford Case Stormy Daniels files a defamation lawsuit against President Trump right now\nI I'm not exactly sure under the circumstances given the fact that she is a publicity hound to the extreme\nI'm not sure how you could exactly defame her but the bottom line was this defamation lawsuit was thrown out by a federal judge yesterday\nAnd I flipped throat so President Trump has one now I Would argue that if you are the leader of the free world\nThere's really nothing to gain\nFrom what I'm going to call punching down you know engaging with a pornographic Phil ... who says that the two of you had sex ten or eleven years ago and and I guess I'm One of these people that argue the quicker the this Stormy Daniels becomes a a small footnote in history the better it will be but\nPresident Trump was not satisfied with simply winning the lawsuit\nSo today he sent out a tweet here's what the tweet from ... real Donald Trump says federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump\nTrump is entitled to full legal fees hashtags box at Fox News great now I can go after horse face\nAnd for a third rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she\nSigned she knows nothing about me a total card\nSo he tweets about his take this case being dismissed and calls stormy Daniels' case Stephanie Clifford\nHorse ... All right\nAt which point in time um this brings out a couple of responses Michael ... who is kind of the sleazy lawyer that represents staff at which point in time um this brings out a couple of responses Michael ... who is kind of the sleazy lawyer\nThat represents Stephanie Clifford he sends out a tweet saying you are a disgusting massaging as perhaps a penchant for beef theology\nGame on tiny okay so\n[noise] we now have the president of United States calling this pornographic film actress for space\nWe have her lawyer hitting back and we now have her talking about the president once again and his Jenna tail yeah All right for one for seven nine nine one sixth one and then as he acted mortgage talk and tech slide\nI don't know about you but I just wanted all to stop I I really I really do and like I say I think President Trump's had a good couple of weeks I I I Do I think he's gotten back on message she's gotten stuffed on\nTo me engaging in engaging with somebody\nOn Twitter like the Michael ... of the world or the Stormy Daniels of the world lowers\nAmong fans of the president's me do does he really gain something by again while looming in the mud he calls her horse face she then I mean she said all sorts of stuff about him and you you know that she's a publicity hound and she's not going to stop but then\nNow it's the references to genitalia and all the while I think we've got a country to run for one for seven nine nine when six when he goes he accurate mortgage talking ... I guess here is my specific question do you think President Trump but again she knocked off is this the type of tweet that you think\nAdvances his claws helps him out you love to see it or is this the type of thing that maybe it just kind of take your victory in court\nFile for the you know the fees that you're entitled to declare victory and go on for one for seven nine nine one six twenty alright was President Trump's tweet about Stormy Daniels the debt invited the response\nGood idea for one for seven nine nine when six twenty but as he acted mortgage truck in Texas and we discuss in a moment\nIf you're on the line please hold on it's one Eighteen to suggest record double U.

out the wicker pod cast as well right if you're just\nTuning in ... ... one of the dominant stories that this evening and the national news is going to be President Trump\nDeciding to reinvigorate the feud with Stormy Daniels Stormy Daniels Stephanie Clifford is of course pornographic film quote unquote actress who says she had a one night stand with the president she is an enormous publicist publicity hound and publicity seeker\nI think the whole Stormy Daniels thing was kind of died down a little bit well yesterday the president won a court case or defamation lawsuit against him was dismissed\nAnd today he decided to gloat about it take into Twitter calling her worst face she of course now responded with a tweet about candidly the size of his genitalia and here we are here we are in America in two thousand Eighteen I think\nSometimes it's best just to let sleeping dogs lie and I don't think the president helps himself by engaging in this fashion\nSomebody like a Stephanie Clifford Sherry and frankly cherry or there'll be injected afternoon\nI Know [laughter] and I mean time [laughter] richer or them refrained from that they're over and over and over again and I think [laughter]\nOh I think left right as if I don't mind if I have the richer [laughter] yeah\nWell you know and and what's so frustrating I guess to me is is Sherry that I think\nI think that the Stormy Daniels stuff it was kind of on a backburner I mean I think she was starting to stay away from from people's minds\nAnd now now it's it's ... front and center and people are going to be chuckling about hey he called her horse face or she's making references like I say to the size of the genitalia he's the leader of the free world for goodness sakes why would you\nGive her any more than Fifteen minutes of fame\nWith every\nUm yeah you um yeah so you you might be right that he he just thinks you know can't help himself weight which is part part of a I think one of the frustrating things that a lot of us\nA lot of uh see when we look at you know some of the stuff that I think is is going on that um I think he deserves credit for it but it kind of step so his message you know air Debbie ... she says he is unconventional I agree but I like it when he slaps them back\nAnd again she she's talking you know philosophically speak you know you're talking figuratively about that but I mean I understand his his supporters and I get it you know hard core President Trump fans love it that he doesn't take crap from anybody and they love the fact that he's punching down and all that type of stuff\nI I I just think there's also this this broader thing that that's out there especially with the midterms coming up\nYou know I I'd like to be a sort of on the message of the economy coming up with about ten minutes we talk about the whole Elizabeth Warren thing\nAnd the huge I think you've political mistake that she made yesterday that has a lot of our Democrat colleagues going oh my goodness I Can't believe that you would do something like this but from the perspective of President Trump but again I understand that there's some people love it when he punches back\nBy punching back in this particular fashion all you do is you bring this woman who I think most of us just want to go away\nYou bring her back to the stage right here's Greg Craig says Jeff I'm admittedly a huge Trump supporter but\nI Do wonder what are you smoking so early in the morning when he tweets these things in this case I like horses and I think it diminishes ... meaning to the horse well I you know but the thing is I get I understand some people love that that sort of punching type of thing\nFar enough I my guess is you you can you can find almost anybody that has I don't know some sort of DNA that came from somewhere for one for seven Ninety nine one six twenty it's one forty three we're back to discuss in just a moment if you're on the line please hold on\nOne forty six I think there'll be team Jake see to me with with Elizabeth Warren did yesterday demonstrates that the sort of a title mentality mentality that you see she puts out this this story saying All right I've had a DNA test and it shows that\nMaybe maybe somewhere between six to ten generations ago I might have had some Native American\nNative American blood All right to which\nAnd how does that what is that gain and actually one of the tribal spokesman says this is all about Elizabeth Warren using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation\nOr any tribal nation even vaguely it's inappropriate and wrong Senator Warren undermines tribal interests with our continued claims of tribal heritage I mean in one world\nDo we say hey I'm One sixty fourth this or I Am one one thousand twenty four this so that means I somehow and part of that minority community and I understand it really for one for seven nine nine one six twenty a bill in Mount pleasant billiard WTO O. J. good afternoon after knowing\nUh my wife we're just fire about this yesterday we are actually funny my wife and I thought that if that street dot com right and my wife has actually Canadian but yeah\nUm but ah her her third generation that are great great great grandmother was actually a Native American so we know that you know ...\nThat's now that's three generations ago not six generations okay God\nI mean they showed that should be an\nAmerican or most people are saying that our Native American are caving to oh my pleasure because they care very straight and they walk away from Asia all the way down or do you know but I really the whole point is that she's trying to you or\nThat is so big and as a minority point\nYou know and ...\nWhich are showing how shallow you have to go\nTo ... yeah it's an old you are is that I mean is that your whole it primarily\nWhat will right right and also does that does that\nTie you win All right are are you familiar with that you can how do you relate to the Native American experience by the fact of virtue that six to ten generations ago maybe you had a relative who\nYou know was was Native American and in some small part I mean it's just it's it's ridiculous I mean your wife I assume would not claimed that she can relate to the Native American experience which she\nWell no it looked like she has enough [laughter] I guess the ... that they say\nWell listen as Warren I I mean and look and this is from the perspective of a really white guy I mean all of a Elizabeth Warren ... [noise]\nI don't think anybody would mistake Elizabeth Warren for somebody who grew up on on an American Indian reservation I just that's just not the case for one for seven nine nine one six twenty let's talk to Russell in Brookfield Russell your until we T. M. J. lo\nOr I should go to your tremendous amount of name recognition all across the country it's like going warrior\nPassers things and gets all those free publicity or we can talk about it I just retired and she has to do it just said that ... that goes like this and get free advertising it just ...\nI mean yeah I think they should call right but here's what I Would say for for anybody who sets that there's no such thing as bad publicity they've never had bad publicity me 'cause the the reality and see in this case I mean clearly Elizabeth Warren did this because she wants to run for president\nPresident Trump has been calling her Pocahontas and she wants to demonstrate that no this is true\nThat I really do you know when when I have made these claims in my past about you know having the this Native American you know blood and my blood line\nThat I really do have it well it turns out it's absolutely ridiculous that and it again it it's not like saying hey you know my great great grandparents were slaves or something like that\nAgain it it's not like saying hey you know my great great grandparents were slaves or something like that I got and so\nI I've I've grown up with this bias and prejudice and I can relate to all the different struggles that people are having that that's not the dishes six to ten generations ago most people are looking at this I think in rolling their eyes and candidly I think she played and I I have\nI think she played right to President Trump's hands because by by putting this out she's made herself look ridiculous and if you're planning to run for the president of the United states for the presidency I think in many cases looking ridiculous is the last thing that you ended up wanting to do in in any event I guess\nUltimately it's up to the voters but I Will tell you this this has gone over like a lead balloon and I'm even a number of Democrats are saying oh my gosh you\nKnow we're trying to focus on this or that or the other thing and now the story for today is how one of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination for president in two thousand twenty\nShe's out with some DNA kit complaining and saying that I might be one one thousand twenty fourth Native Americans so that that means I can somehow relates to the problems of people who\nAre in fact Native American big big big mistake by Elizabeth Warren I think she's made herself look ridiculous and I'll go one step further if she now besides after previously saying that she wasn't going to run for president to run for president\nI think this kills her I think she gets killed her presidential campaign because she has made herself look ridiculous and there are other candidates out there who will be glad to point that out it's one fifty to this is Jeff wet or WTO O. J.\nOne fifty five WGM Jake alright I'm One of the things that tells me that maybe this is the new wave that everybody was predicting may not be emerging at least for the sent some people thought you seriously some national campaign that is going on\nTo try to scare people about Republicans about health care and and what you're seeing is the generic sort of planes that are being made against Republicans across the country and in in Wisconsin saying hey if if these people continue to get elected they're going to take away\nInsurance coverage for pre existing conditions of course a preexisting condition is something you know you've got diabetes cancer or whatever and you lose your insurance you're not able to get any back\nNow as far as I Know there's no Republicans out there that are suggesting that we do away with coverage for pre existing conditions there\nSimply saying the way Obama cure does it is wrong in Wisconsin before you had Obamacare you had coverage for pre existing conditions that they dealt with it through things like Patrick care and the like but this is the attack that it's being made\nTo me up at one level it shows kind of this desperate and is it sort of like what we saw over the years for if they're Republicans get elected their goodwill lemonade Social Security and we're going to take a elderly people and their wheelchairs and when to push him over the cliff [laughter] I mean that type of thing\nAnd that's been one of the challenges that they made against Governor Walker oh he's he's he wants to eliminate insurance coverage for pre existing conditions but he's put out something on Twitter\nNow that this is on Twitter I I don't know if this has been formed into an ad yet but\nThis has been one of the most this has been one of the attack points but it came out with something yesterday that if this isn't an ad it should be an ad\nIs him sitting in a Green Bay Packers jacket it appears on the back of a bus you'd only one's Twenty one seconds but this is this is the Governor Walker Twitter response to that claim that he wants to eliminate coverage for pre existing conditions years the audio [noise]\nAnd that's it it's simple it is straightforward and I think incredibly effective if I were to be giving advice to the Walker campaign\nTo they expect that they see some sort of vulnerability I I Would turn this into a thirty second ad or sixty second at an adult that he's just looking right at the camera and he's saying okay my wife's got this condition you know my brother has this condition\nI it's ridiculous to suggest that I Would take insurance coverage away for people with\nPreexisting conditions but this is one of the big lie that ends up being out there the idea that well because\nYou don't agree with Obamacare because you think Obamacare has been a disaster because remember you were promised that you could keep your doctor and and you can't keep your doctor\nOr to say that well if you're going to repeal Obamacare that means that you're automatically going to lose coverage for any pre existing condition it's it's not true it is a non secretary nobody is suggesting that again you would lose that and I I think it's important for walk her to come out and say this that I Love this this little\nTwenty one second things they put up a Twitter because it's him looking directly into the camera saying this is my personal situation these are the issues I face this is just ally now he doesn't use the word lie but this is not true and I think this is a very very effective adds to the extent", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "17"}
