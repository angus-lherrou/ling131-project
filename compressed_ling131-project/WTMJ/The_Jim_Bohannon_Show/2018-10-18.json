Phil\nThank you for having me do you have a ... just as an overall explanation before we get them to some of the details behind it will fly we seemed to be a out of control at this time I saw\nI think it's probably many reasons but the point of the book was really to try to frame the whole political issue in terms of the underlying psychology\nAnd I I think the psychological positions are probably best trade with respect to the concept of religious conflict because I think there are many aspects of what's taking place now that really ...\nUh what goes on between a sectarian groups are out of religious level\n[noise] ... okay I Am a a a a a religious\nLevel All right uh ... please amplify further on that obviously we're not talking about uh two different religious sects per se unless you want to consider a I suppose the more traditional\nLooking back to the gym ... one eight six six five oh jumbo what does that work in this seemingly intractable national discussion about policy and politics\nThings do seem to be as this book is titled out of control Dr Richard ... and our guest is a physician and psycho analyst and the subtitle apocalyptic psychology and the age of Trump or to a rod who calls him from a wire Houser was kind of a sudden they have a job good evening rod and welcome\n\nRon are you there yeah can you hear me\nYes you're on the radio go right ahead\nAll my phone is like out of their own well okay\nLike oh sure I don't consider myself a really felt like ill when I heard on Wisconsin Public radio I listen to public radio a lot of ... and they were talking about George was getting when president he did not want to do\nWhat I ... it out\nYou know it it it got people that I don't care who's name there whatever letter or named ... ...\n... and that way I see it we don't need any other white\nBut it'll whatever something happened at a port woman and I can't imagine a traumatic experience like that but I'm not sure right here in the fact that Obama he killed somebody for all we got to wait until after the election\nShow it on the other ... and get it or they're like\nWell you've covered a number of the issues of the day but I'm not sure this directly relates to uh the topic at hand I Would just make one vote before a deferring to a doctor ...\nI was very naive of George Washington or anybody else to suggest that there would not be factions factions are almost prove that we have a free government if you have a genuinely free society you will have differences of opinion\nAnd like minded people will get together and organize to try and convince others of their point of view it\nAs an essential part of society now can faction lives will be carried too far well yes it certainly can and perhaps we're seeing a manifestation of that with the notion that you can have a free society without different factions isn't a possibility and buy it for to Dr Creighton\nI Would have to agree with you entirely about that I think it's a psychological motivation ultimately for\nThe unified groups to ultimately ... to small of divisions so I I think there's no way of avoiding corrections or what you do want to avoid as you mentioned is uh the extremes polarity between two factions so that there's no workable solution to the system\nAnd we'll come back and explore some of that here in a moment but the writing a call from Steve in a chat them county North Carolina good evening Steve\n... I'm always enjoy your show the fruit shakes thank you knew when it gets to a point when you go to a\nOr or use it all out and I ... I don't know if the person who is ... is left ... whatever they or are those standards really wants to those who\nWant to get to a point where you can't go out and have reason to Betty without someone screaming at you spin on who you know and then you\nCan't I really don't care of your disposition just let's say let's have a reason to bake I mean if we can talk with a screaming at each other ... which I which I don't do\nAnd yet I'm the I called the ... machine the machine has his just use to give up the fact that two years ago two years ago\nYou know you lost the election okay I guess what if you love this country if you if you're being honest ... then you're going to try to build it up not tear down\nAgain I'm not sure the extent although certainly I've had my differences over the years with the both Clintons especially in regards to uh honesty and and corruption I don't know that we can say that they are personally responsible for the uh the outbreak that we've seen a ... across the country\nUh I Do a Dr Creighton find one thing that I find tragically ironic\nAnd that is that much of of what we're talking about here is conducted by groups that roughly called themselves and ... that is to say anti fascist\nAnd the tragic irony is of course if those tactics\nOf silence when your opponents by intimidation and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect of most of these people but that is that is is the sad problem\nAnd that cannot be tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective that you are so pure\nAnd you are so virtuous that you don't have to\nBe tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective that you are so pure and you are so virtuous that you don't have to listen to anybody else than the only answer in my book and you can certainly agree or disagree as you choose the only as in my book is do arrest\nProsecute and if convicted incarcerate such people that is out of bounds you cannot let society it'd be reduced to ... to the level of ... who can put together more of violence in the street\nYou know I I think you are several important point a lot of the points that I Try to make in the book has to do again with the psychology of what's taking place at least a large portion of society and it's it and said for some time now that is an increasing degree of\nOf of the offices within the society and then the judge to increase the degree of moral perfectionism an obsession will thinking is in society\nAs a result when when when one encounters those types of psychological structuring individual uh those individuals are prone to what we call projection and that is that they tend to uh take aspects of their their denied a self\nMake up and to place them on people around them\nAre so when you have a group like a ... a claiming that the anti fascist and you look at their behavior it's very very obvious that the behaviors that you have your one would expect from a fascist group and so you see this kind of an accusation coming from the left projecting\nOn the right for everything that they're doing a and and denying that you're claiming that it's right to doing it so that's I think the motivation for some of this behavior in terms of how to deal with it I I agree with you entirely\nI think one of the greatest problems that we're encountering in society today\nIs the lack of enforcement of laws that are ... that are\nCurrently on the books for a place\nLike Portland for for the mayor of port in to sit by and have people rioting\nOn the streets I mean she used to have the police intervened this is a breakdown of the necessary a legal sanctions and boundaries that are a free society must have and if that's gone then it's going to be just a free for all\nYeah again it it it is not something that uh that that can that can possibly be tolerated and and I see things like that and there have been other examples some time ago when there was a a police shooting that brought the rioting to Baltimore and the mayor of Baltimore told the authorities to let it burn\nA as if to say that if people feel aggrieved enough that they get a free pass or behaving like civilized beings and that is\nAs as you say it I I think I'm not putting words in your mouth that is is pointing us in the direction of anarchy and that is not unacceptable outcome nobody is so aggrieved that they have a right to break the law with impunity nobody\nNow who's yeah go ahead\nWell again absolutely but it it it's the role of the government or if those are the local level and the federal law all true false laws with the country and if they fail to do that then you can expect a increasing outburst from these groups because there is centrally enabled to behave badly\nExactly are we are you telling them yes you're tactic and intimidation is working and uh people respond positively win or are they are told that their tactic\nIs uh is going to be tolerated and stay with us more to come as a doctor Richard Creighton takes a look at just what is at work here what is the psychology involved in the way we are currently conducting a business in this country at the public policy level and it's a\nIt's disturbing but again it's a knowledge and the knowledge is power maybe we can learn something from all of this one eight six six five oh jumbo we'll be back in just a moment\n\nOn September eleventh two thousand one in the world changed forever we lost two thousand nine hundred and Seventy seven people that day Andrea ... was one of ...\nWell it was just this type of conflict\nYeah a ... again uh I suppose that I'm hardly unique in thinking that uh that my viewpoints are correct\nOr they are by viewpoints that I've arrived that than by whatever thought processes involved but I Would like to think that it is a rational analysis of of evidence that arguments that\nThat reflect the the circumstances in the world but for whatever reason yes I like everybody else would tend to agree with my viewpoint but it's almost a a a ... a a it it it naturally follows however\nI have never been so enamored of my viewpoint that I Would suggest that hey I must be right and therefore everybody else who disagrees with me must be wrong\nOr nor be that no matter how right I may be that it's somehow gives me a pass on the rules of society that that is the level of arrogance that escapes me even on issues where I'm\nVery confident that my viewpoint is correct I I just it's it's the attitude that goes with the viewpoint that escapes me\nWell we we've done a very poor job over the last generation or two at raising children or children have been raised with this concept of preserving self esteem uh with the concept of self esteem is based on never criticizing number correct to an individual and this carries on into\nThe educational system so you've ... you've got ... now or at least one maybe what what generation that truly are able to look at it so critically\nA as a result they they have to preserve this concept of perfection and anything less than that it is not even within this fear of consideration\nAs we go to a break and then we'll come back with some calls but I have to ask you\nIs this a terminal condition that has to say are these people beyond redemption is it impossible\nTo ever a inject them if you will with a note of rationality or have they been so ... into this notion that my self esteem is the violence that they will for the balance of their lives which in some cases maybe fifty sixty Seventy years\nCease to be effective members of our society\nWell if if you want an honest answer\nI certainly do yes\nOr no also says I'm a clinical level there's a very difficult thing to treat and I think that's what we're talking about around and so I I see the prognosis for this generation is not good Wells Fargo says for society is not good as a\nResult oh it certainly isn't well honest answer is very exactly what we need right now will come back and talk some more with our guest Dr Richard crate in the book out of control back

thoughts on the subject of Katie ... a listener hello Jane\nHey you're about how you fine thank you sorry greetings from\nPittsburgh so here's the question we have a separation of church and state based on the constitutionality of not a holding against somebody of their race religion or create\nFake three things race religion and creed\nSo we've outlawed the practice of any particular religion in our educational facilities who've outlawed racial discrimination and all of our educational facilities where is the separation of create a state where he was far less credo\nIs allowed to propagate\nAnd the preached from the educational pull bits to our kids of course the legislation to level the playing field on that I don't even hear proposed\nI'm All right the uh I I don't do that or\nA law of that sort of might be a very worthwhile Dr Creighton I'm not sure how you would even words that such a law and he thought you might have\nI don't know that there's an existing law that deals with we create a certainly nothing that I'm aware of the post ... ticket set up\nUm I I think it's a dangerous thing I think to begin to interfere with people's Korea does if you will uh\nBut I I think that that goes to the\nForces in place that tend to moderate the extreme views at least a as a manifested in the mainstream move of of society\nAnd and in addition the idea of propagating one view only to the exclusion of others I mean uh it seems to me that the today's standards of of tenure is that what you got a\nCharles Manson somewhere a teaching under ten years that you could get rid
