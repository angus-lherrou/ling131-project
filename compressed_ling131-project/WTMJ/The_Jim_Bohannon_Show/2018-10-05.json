Mike Huckabee the forty for governor of Arkansas former Republican presidential candidate avid coast the host of his television show Huckabee which is just concluded sees the number one on the trinity broadcast network grieving bike\nWell Jim is great to be back on the show with you thanks for having me\nAbsolutely glad to have you back on we'll get into some of the heavyweight stuff of the day but first I should take note I guess of the fact that the Huckabee has been selected as the twenty Eighteen TV show of the year by the international country gospel music association congratulations\nWell thank you very much it's been a ... year it's hard to believe for us that uh you know we launch the first episode of season to this coming weekend but it's been a quick here and a lot more fun than I've ever had anything in broadcasting it\nWould just looking forward to more on shows and they they're wholesome and entertaining informative unlike most of what's on television today this is kind of the white television used to be when people could watch it with confidence\nAnd uh there's just an politics to keep it interesting but there's not so much that it will raise your blood pressure to three hundred over two hundred over\nYet [laughter] well that's a good thing I mean after all ... is a a program that is a part of the weekend you should be able to kick back a little bit of a and relax some of the like and this this has I guess many similarities what you're used to do on on the Fox network right to at least that's what I observed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe truth is I have five girls and every one of the takedown just about anybody of fighting and stuff that they believe that it and you should just be so proud of your daughter I agree with that lady earlier but I just wanted to ask you what I wanted to say something to\nYou know you're one of the most truthful people I have ever heard on radio or\nTV or as a governor or as a politician\nOr concerning abortion I think you're about the only person I hear a hundred percent of the time talking the truth about what that's about it and I think cabinet or a I Would ask you I mean do you think that this has more to do about abortion but it does anything else where cabinet are facing this opposition\nI think it does a cow and in large measure because the liberals are scared to death but there might be an honest look and or a revisit a rosy weight which was a ridiculous decision\nThat was a reaching out into thin air and creating a log it did not have any basis in the constitution\nBut what most people don't understand either to grow the weight or reversed it doesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states and each and every state would make its own decision how it would approach it\nMy own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question is to deal with it true the issue of cursing hurt because we were except the biological fact this is your science of of the unborn that every person is a person from the point of conception\nThen at the ... would actually be far stronger than any Robie wait a ruling ever could be in protecting life liberty and pursuit of happiness\nAnd would provide due process and would make it impossible for anyone to the prime a person of their life and liberty and I I really hope that that's where we end up moving with this because there should be about protecting innocent people not just about stopping abortion\nGo up to ten seconds here Mike then I went to the stay on the line we'll speak off air but I was doing a little checking your calendar on inauguration day twenty twenty five you'll be sixty nine same ages Reagan was when he was elected president a year younger than Trump and and we've never had a president named Mike um what do you think [laughter]\nUh yeah I I can tell you that there's a greater likelihood that I Will have transgender surgery ever run for any public office again\nFair enough but you can catch the man in his new element that is of course there's great TV show it's Huckabee on TBN and the new season premieres this Saturday aid eastern seven central and stay on the line Mike I'm jumbo hadn't\nYou know I I think that a lot of it depends on whether you see Trump's name on the ballot I think that the Democrats look at the ballot Lacey Trump same everywhere oh it doesn't say Donald Trump but anything anybody with an R by their name that's close enough will vote against that person\nOf whereas Republicans I think look it's about and they don't see the president's name anywhere instead they may see a lot of people that they made you ride as a as rhinos Republicans in name only and\nAnd so I think those two viewpoints may not be a good news for Republicans\nYeah I'm all for show I think a\nSharp has basically said that this is a referendum on the hand that as a national election not good for a Republican or any time the power and the party in power and so they're trying to like the ... election uh and not have\nA Trump is the main issue and they want on may ... judicial appointments or do they want that to talk about because a child support and instill that great it's a and the\nLow forties if you look at a solid polls and then the thirties\nAs you look at other goals and uh he's seen as very polarizing figure and he seems to stoke the culture wars in a way that is not helpful for the Republican Party or the country a

against others but she was she was pretty vacuous at times and I I agree with that completely the same time I grand at what he said I also grown because I think this is exactly how it's going to be taken he is again\nHanding ammunition to his opponents and he just doesn't need to do that if he had merely recited the areas in which your testimony was rather deficient on specifics instead of the

how are these people getting in\nAnd and I just wanted to make a point on the testimony\nOf\nWhat's your name a Dr Ford\nRight right Dr Ford you know for her to be saying that the anxiety and post traumatic stress and all that the first thing she asked for which she sat down with a cup of coffee\nI mean and then she strength sixteen ounce bottle with coke\nFor suddenly it's so nervous and stuff like that in front of a committee like that on Capitol Hill she was taking caffeine pretty pretty well it just struck me\nAnd then the laughter was the one thing that she remembers a traumatized certain laws and the sweat Nick woman that at the interview on NBC she said the same thing\nTo do after the laughing at stuff and that just you know I the credibility is just ridiculous I think you have to have this well in my opinion because if it if it drags on any longer I think he's got to get it\nAnd if he doesn't it'll end this stuff but I really do believe he's going to get it\nIn this country it appears so I I I think that that is that I as I say it's safer to lead the way that the not so yeah I'm I'm with you Dave I think that you're correct\nUh absolutely again or if someone is genuinely sexually assaulted I'm sure it must be a terrible trauma that most of us can only imagine\nFine I accept that our sympathies go to you and I will assume that that you would in fact were sexually assaulted you'll have the benefit of the doubt but when you go making charges against somebody else you've got to come across with the appropriate information did you expect us to take you seriously\nAnd this I don't remember where and when when and all who was there but that doesn't cut it\nWe may still have sympathy for you but we cannot take seriously charges against another human

couple of bucks out of the election at it turned out nobody is giving any uh whatsoever on the ...\nThat that's Joe Donnelly for those who don't know he is the Democratic senator from Indiana and uh again that of course the state carried by heavily by by President Trump uh that's that's interesting that that you couldn't even or even get a any takers on that I I find that remarkable\nUsually usually somebody will take it at least as a joke but that was out here about two weeks ago mhm and that was supporting of course the Republican candidate so uh it looks like he's right on the edge and if he works now I say he's gone\n[noise] well it'll be very interesting to see how are the votes of these senators from uh from questionable states in fact a a a will affect their their election outcome as I say I I think Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota\nHas felt in a way almost liberated because she's trailing so badly that I think that all she wants to the cabinet position in a democratic administration I knew I Would suspect that uh that she probably cannot rescue that seat in North Dakota\nDown down thirty ... down thirty points since ... o'clock news tonight I understand\n[noise] ah

on Republican right\nCurrently its value on Republicans and forty nine Democrats that's correct\nOkay ... ... ... ... ... probably the least reports allow and keeps saying that the Republicans could vote could afford to lose two votes\n[noise] uh I I I've heard some reports that say that and for the life of me I don't know what they're talking about either no they could afford to lose one vote which would then be a fifty fifty split\nWhich would be broken by vice president Pence is tie breaker\nThat's in the constitution of the event of a tie vote in the Senate the tire thought I was brought by the vice president of the United states however they lose two then it becomes fifty one to forty nine against Kavanaugh there is no tie breaker and Kavanaugh loses so I I have heard that that also said\nNo they cannot lose too that you're you're absolutely correct ... their stupidity here but it's not yours Steve\nThere that was owned a nice break a at ... at a the half hour well\nAgain the we don't provide the news on the half hour those ... no\nNo I'm not saying it but you but a lot today that they were losing wall and because of a wait and ah [noise] for that like that you know\nA lot more closer [laughter] uh we didn't need to lose ... on you know for for any reason but uh I mean I can I guess I could not stand up and ... or\n... or something of this import I think I Would say that my daughter I Hope you understand as the daughter of a senator the importance of this the voters come up this way we can move the wedding to Sunday but if we lose this vote it will affect the entire country I've heard people say just what you just said\nAnd my answer be no no that that's more important I mean it's not like your your daughter is not going to get married let her get married tomorrow or are they in this case if you're talking about senator able to get married Sunday [noise]\nUh he does say that he will attend the his daughter's wedding in Montana and uh uh\nThis is interesting thing right here though there's been an unusual late night phone call in which a senator Danes of Montana Heidi Heitkamp colleague called cabinet and personally a short and that he has made arrangements to be there to get across the finish line as needed [noise]\nSo uh for whatever that's worth a I I guess he's found a way around this so that that's the short answer on that one that he has a he has promised Kavanaugh if he needed he will be there so\nKavanaugh if he needed he will be there so again well that makes me feel better it asked me feel a lot better too I got to tell you Steve I have been the bothered about that and I just reached checked the wires here and uh\nThe GOP could hold the session open bar they overnight and allow Danes to vote on Sunday if needed to be\nA a whether or not the Kevin uh uh uh\nUh whether or not they promised to Capitol I mean people up here for a hypothetical Sunday's vote is not clear but the GOP good hold the session open overnight\nOr that could happen a so technically uh in the Senate ... would be backed a Saturday would be a Sunday will be redefined as Saturday or they could do that and and I'll guarantee you if it came down to the point where let's say it is a\nIs fifty to forty nine against Kavanaugh okay\nAh I'll guarantee you that both Republicans will do and then the Danes will fly and quickly make it a fifty fifty tie and the parents would cast a tie breaker so that clarifies that for me I I had been the\nMost curious as to how how bad could happen and apparently that's that's the circumstance
