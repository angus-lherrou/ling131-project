them are just a they have a mass kind of an engineer and really they are there that the government that they get ... by the government I mean look at how the Russian train these kids to hack at such a such a young age\nWhich is a great idea for the call hacking but it's not a great idea for unethical hacking and we we need to train our children a lot more and ethical\nHacking so they can do great defense is that we have to have ethics and this is the\nProblem we we almost to the point where we would have to have a world cyber court and you start getting into politics and and and bad actors that are acting like good actors and he's right on the money I mean I agree with him completely I'm just trying to add that they they might look like outsiders\nWhen really their insiders and talk about Russia all day long on that after\n... let me ask you a bit about that than since you since you brought it up a is there any such international body there is of course a world courts and there are various ah ah bodies of United Nations most notably the Security Council of uh like I'm not sure that I wouldn't necessarily in many cases be particularly prone to\nTo depend on such international bodies which I find in many cases ... at best and the\nAnd the hospital to U.S interests that red worst\nBut I I Am curious if such a pug bodies even exist usually law and regulation trailed far behind technology especially in this day and age\nNow you're exactly right and it always sounds wonderful and it's really dangerous because it's a really really really powerful weapon and I'm as pious plan to suit the side of how we all get along by uh I I don't want this weapon given to anyone that's not mature enough in the world is certainly not\nMature enough for this weapon and they will take it over they will regulate speech they will suppress their people they will\nThey will use it for propaganda and group think I mean it's just way too dangerous which is why\nYou know I I always thought the United states should a control most of the still and and we're seeing\nAnd and we're seeing this because again it's a fundamental lack of accountability we're unwittingly put all our ship says one big cloud and so you can tongues sure that you can get a huge when all you can find the fact that we have that\nAll sort of in one space it's almost like we should go back one eighty and do everything back paper was harder to screw up altogether and then you take the fact that people aren't really held accountable because the bad actors are in locations they are making a fortune outfits that\nLying is acceptable normal something that so it goes against the grain of sand people in this country you just can't be foolish and that would be really foolish and the United nations I'll forget it I mean maybe they have but it's just so far away at the ... yeah I think the real religion is gonna be technological\nYeah I Would have to think so as regards what you just said by the way this notion of a paper is oh so Tony a century well you know what a there are certain certain things about twentieth century that the ... were better uh the mere fact that we have a technical capability does not mean that we should automatically embrace it and in point of for example\nA it's been noted that there is no central computer in this country for election results are in which someone could hack and and also the outcome well thank goodness for that\nI personally am not encouraged by this move away from paper ballots there is a perfect trail right there of how people voted\nIf somebody hack something or something gets deleted you can have the validity of an election destroyed in an instant and I personally am of the opinion that the paper ballots are the way to go and if anybody thinks that that makes me a retro or luddite well boo hoo\nWell we we do have short attention span and we sure don't like the way for people that counts I don't want it to the baby out with the bathwater in technology there shouldn't be\nBut but ... it's got to be something there's gotta be safety measures put in place so that everything's not accessible there are a firewall or step bring things up there are different technologies there's you know there is no different safety net so we can years\nAt Georgia is going through this right now I I we have a perfectly fine\nSystem but but everyone tries to politicize this and again\nSorry we're we're we're going to break that doesn't move here we will pause and take a break and finish that thought in just a moment\nTo when you just need to be heard when you just need a wake up with all his literally had moments before I was driving through the market energy Israelis\nI to this day I Would still like to know who it was we thought that was such a great idea like oh the Russians suddenly become paragon of ah a democracy and and openness and and the combination is such a nonsense point of view I mean even Neville Chamberlain would have bought it that\nYeah there's no shortage of these ah world leaders that have no experience in the real world are having to\nFind the sky you know opinions and then they just sort of disappeared the woodwork and we're less cleaning up the mess and I don't care what you think about Russia or not\nAny every economy every county in the state of the United states has learned the hard way of putting all your eggs in one basket is never a smart idea and and especially after the big recessions and you know in Michigan diverse it they'll big time on the street tanks for example you
