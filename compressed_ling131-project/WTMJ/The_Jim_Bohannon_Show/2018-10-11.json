five oh Jim bold one eight six six five oh five or six to six all kinds of money things out there it's a major part of the of our lives even if uh\nMaybe investing or or playing a various a market games or or not or shall we say your hobby but the fact is that we all our economic beings to one extent or another and this is the kind of thing that can seriously affect your life\nLet's talk to or not only I guess Jordan Goodman America's muddy answers mad but to see the new calls in from medicine lodge Kansas good evening Stephen\nGood evening Jim uh or remember one night you know\nA very for those who don't know that Steven was in the same unit I was in the ... in Vietnam but to go ahead\nYeah but you are a suffer in\nIdaho I I was I was actually listed also but anyway what do you have it for what do you have for our for our guest\nAbout gold but it's so it's been for me I'm a Seventy year old\nAnd uh I uh\nIt's always been colder value for me uh it's it's really a state is saying or get Terry rated in the last year and I was wanting to know if\nIt\nIf he feels it's still a place to hold value\nI think of it as an insurance policy okay it's it's a gift disaster but that's been going down because when interest rates go up go goes down as do many other commodities and interest rates have been going up on the fact they're going to go higher and that's been hurting go go gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars announce\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars now it's even more than that\nSo I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters of the world and do this not throwing up it's just not what it used to be if anything they're going to become a new kind of safety valve and even that I've been working my way as well so have a little bit of an insurance policy but I don't see go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum or silver\nUm all the same silver has gone down dramatically a ... kind of a a a place a play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker wait wait so none of the pressure smells really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good I take for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add ... thanks for your service as well\nNow a this is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in certain times that gold another ... precious metals will go up a but I gather there are exceptions to that\n[noise] yeah well I mean these are uncertain times although I'm some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing these like we've got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on but I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know it looks like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter]\nA little girl just isn't doing well is it really is a direct correlation with a interest rates and I mean the feathers arms raised rates a lot and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury is now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so it's not a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that was all bad for gold silver platinum unwed him\nBut ... do you see a interest rates going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond bear market\nWe've ... basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bond interest rates peak about fourteen percent of the Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute though was about one in three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point to\nAnd I think it's going higher let me just a brief explain why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve is doing it right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOr out of the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds mountain gunfire for political reasons in other words you can get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bombs sixty billion a month through the so called quantitative easing program that's over that's been over for about a year and a half now and now they're doing qualitative tightening so when bombs come do they're not buying new ones they're not renewing and letting them mature\nSo two of the big buyers of bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile huge new supply Jim and we've talked about this before but the deficit that we have are being finance with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars in New that just that quarter alone today there are options of the thirty year bond the ten year by they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having a trillion dollar deficit so more supply less demand\nWheels and we don't go up and prices go down\nThere you go the old supply and demand thing All right we're going to come back and talk to the more we will certainly returned to the issue of China and a terrorist and the like about that when we come back after this break going to take a a very close look at that gift that keeps on giving the student loan indebtedness\nOne eight six six five oh Jindal is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Americas money answers mad as our guest Jordan good again money ... dot com a great website I challenge you to go there and not save money somehow okay back in the moment\nAll the percentage of people that are given major who within that twelve months of graduation are actually working in that field at work and it sounds\nLike it's just that come after this twenty seven percent of the people who graduate end up using something it remains their major there twenty seven percent meaning Seventy five percent or you know three quarters do not end up working in their major field in one way or the other\nEnd which case you are you essentially a ... it from a financial point of view you've you've wasted your time use a quiet I mean it's one thing if you have a hobby\nI'd say that uh our Jane rocketed literature I always you know their way okay so I'm interested in that well that's fine but but but you shouldn't be paying off this kind of enormous money\nTo finance a hobby and as I've also noted before that's why we have so many bowling leagues in this country people like to bowl\nAnd there are just simply an awful lot more people who like to bowl the people who can make a living and the professional bowling to her doctors and so I I mean it it just always it amazes me at all these people are what what I find myself or I Want to do this or that well why don't you do that in your spare time and in the meantime get a job\nYeah well I mean luckily we have a good employment situation right now and and there's a tremendous shortage of workers except the people coming out of college in many cases are not qualified or willing frankly to do the jobs that are available\nThere's something called the jokes report which is the job openings long term survey and the latest number was six point nine million jobs unfilled employers cannot find the people\nTo do tool and dye making are plumbing or electricity or climbing electric utility poles there may be the people come out of college don't either have the skills or the interest in doing the jobs that are actually available in the real world\nWe ... which raises another point is too easy to sit on your body in this society there ought to be economic pressures on people like\nIf you're ever while student loans were under economic pressure to do something a lot of people take jobs that are white but I've got a service those you know that's over fifty percent of the people graduating today go back and live at home because they can't services student loan debt and have an apartment in the car and kind of get on with their lives I mean it's it's pretty pathetic\nI don't know if you wind up doing doing a job you're not particularly fond of\nBecause it pays the bills this is I think called growing up with us we'll be back with more from Jordan Goodman America's ... man adjustable but\nWe'll see when our earnings go up we are and more\nNow if you've been
