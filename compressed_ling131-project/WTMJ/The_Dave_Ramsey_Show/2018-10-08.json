are quite honestly you haven't had as many playoff appearances in euro in franchise history that you would have liked to have it's a little bit easier to go and\nCompare the different uh the different season than the different playoff teams in in which teams are better and especially when you know they've had they've at three playoff teams over the course of the last ten years with oh wait twenty eleven\nAnd now here and twenty Eighteen I Do think that this brewers team is better than the twenty eleventh squat and I think they for lack of a better term\nI think there is some swag I think there's some confidence I think there's some experience I'm not trying to put that team down that was a really good team I mean we're sitting here talking about one to one really good team against another really good team but I\nI personally you know I think as human beings sometimes were prisoners of the moment\nI Would take this team I think there's twenty eight team team has a lot of things going for it\nThere's arguments out there is this the best brewers team in the history of the organization and it might just be there are there there's legit arguments for that and they get to prove that now I think it's going to be the Dodgers and I'm not I'm not trying to be disrespectful to the Braves and the Braves still have an opportunity to do something\nUh but I think that uh I I Do think that it's going to end up being the Dodgers and I think the Dodgers are really good team if you listen to me throughout the course of the year\nI said over and over and I thought the Dodgers had the best roster and the national league when the brewers made some moves late I think the brewers are right there and I think the Dodgers are the Dodgers and the brewers rosters are are very equivalent to each other and it's certainly going to be a good series if the brewers can pitch the way against the against the Dodgers\nThat they did against the Rockies the brewers are in great shape but that's going to be very very tough\nFor one for seven nine nine nine point nine four Fort won four seven nine nine nine for nine four or texting to for one for seven nine nine one that's six twenty this is

Arkansas yeah\nWinning best for us\nJudge said or just a little while ago with Greg massacres in Denver and I got a text message from John in Towson John makes an interesting point which I think is notable\nThe brewers hated having their AAA team in Colorado but do you think having the sky socks are diminished the Rockies home field advantage some maybe knowing better how to play there\nI think there might be something to that Cory ... naval Corbin burns Josh hater those are all guys who very recently were pitching at Colorado Springs and you learn how to pitch at altitude\nNow maybe it doesn't make any impact you know the brewers pitchers look darn good against the Rockies at Miller Park as well but maybe it does say that the ballpark that is tough to pitch shut outs and and the brewers just put up\nYou know that they put up the don't at all today against the Rockies and having guys who knows what it's like to pitch at altitude I think could've potentially impacted this game\nLet's go to Joe and Milwaukee has given us a call Hey Joe you're on WGM Jay\nMap a question for you here assuming it's going to be the Dodgers in this a seven game series and I haven't followed them all up this year because I'm more of a sudden the cubs and the cardinals and the vision\nBut that he could break down each pitching staff for me the strengths and weaknesses and we give the edge to and also if you could give the edge and eat position player there's an hours and last but at least when I was going to be a big factor in this series is ... on each team who you can be edge there that's how I got thanks for taking my\nCall I appreciate it yeah I Would take probably twenty thirty minutes to do a full breakdown where you're comparing the two I'll say this I think I think the lineup top to bottom for the Dodgers is a scarier line up then the brewers lined up top to bottom it's just one of those lineups you look at it and\nYou don't really feel like there's a whole anywhere I mean I I just the the game that their plane right now\nTaylor Turner Muncie Machado camp balance Ballenger is their number six sitter cheeky Hernandez is their number seven hitter are these are really good hitter so I think from a\nYou can also tweet end to the program just tweet at me a map Pauli on air and make T. T. P. A. U. L. E. Y. on air if you don't follow me I'd love for you to follow me but even if you don't follow me you can still tweet at me and will continue to monitor the Twitter account\nThroughout the course of the program ... got the opportunity you talked to a whole lot of folks but a little while ago he spoke with\nA brewers relief pitcher Jeremy ...\nYou'll get right and it was good I mean we're not done yet most of us are getting like this this\nComing on an airplane says a lot about a lot about what we want\nTo find friends all season long but to allow the wrong that's higher theory\nOffice like that was it a progressive once you open it was\nI mean like I said we were going to come to the park everyday ready there's no one will be don't over Scott I'm for\nOver something we we need to do so\nThe way it is it just shows how we prepare for anything we're ready for anybody so as long as we go out there and they will\nGot caught and all that stuff\nYou know it's pretty fascinating to watch the game developer manners and you guys are the same way but if you so much that we never know what's gonna happen now or you know what's going to turn on the way\nIt can be given God man any given day you know it doesn't matter who it is all of a sudden they call they're going to go out there and give a hundred different\nAnd like you know encourage believes in each and every one of the guys in every one of the bottom you know even the guy just come up with a minor league he believes in each and every each and every guy and that's what we love a bottom\nSo is that confidence give us a conference\nYou worked every game and the theory is an eyesore series\nAll right and it made me a hose down\nThe road to the world series goes through Milwaukee that we do\nWhatever we want to do they want us when\nWork every game and it varies me and I do I mean I Can't wait to dinosaurs\nGreat magic finding a new high pitch as beer was being thrown onto them Ashton got to pull that that can be a new drop for sports central where\nGreg does is a best impersonation of a Thirteen year old girl and see a as he says Orlando that was pretty good right there for one for seven die for that word feuds me for all wars died died\nNine four died for the phone number for one for seven eight nine one six twenty is the number of text and Kyle from Milwaukee has a question if a brewers players now on the twenty five men playoff roster are they allowed at the game they are most of 'em are in the dugout\nI think the brewers may have sent some folks home you know gets to a point that you've ... thirty eight guys available\nOr during September I don't think all the ... the dugout does not look like it's filled with thirty eight guys generally as you get into the postseason you are going to probably let some guys just had home you don't want to have your\nDistractions the wrong word but that's the word I'm going to use your you don't want to have the distractions of all those guys but there are guys you keep around those guys that have a possibility of being on a roster even somebody like a Jacob Nottingham aircrafts or Manny ... God Forbid got injured\nJacob ... would have to be available to uh be activated so somebody like him is still going to be around so yeah you're\nThe I think Tom hotter court that the other day on Twitter they don't send you to Siberia just because you're not in the twenty five man roster you absolutely are allowed to be around the team and a lot of those guys are indeed there so\nThat's why you see some of them are hanging out in the clubhouse for one for seven nine nine nine for nine forget Dave and ...\nHeyday thanks for calling you are on WGM J\nRod are you doing I'm good I'm first of all I think there's there is no compelling reason why shouldn't be a manager of the year\nI think the only guy that would compete with him would be a ... in Atlanta but if I mean my vote goes to crack count that those guys are one to no matter what but\nI almost feel like you know last year I thought council should have been the manager or the year and I felt like maybe he was discounted by the fact that the team came up just short of the post season I always look at manager of the year as the guy who does the exceeds expectations the most and the brewers won the most games in the national league\nYeah I mean but what what he's doing last year where basically electing stars are started by boat if you will just changing baseball\nIt's I I got my vote and in fact I I think they should run the table or they counsel manager of the year Stearns executive of the year Christian yellow which MVP that's I Would vote for all those guys and I appreciate the phone call for one for seven nine nine nine for nine for I guess it'd be major awards\nThe brewers are not going to have the national league Cy Young award winner although I Will be interested I think Josh later and Jeremy ... may get some votes may get some votes are in the site young but I ... should be the manager of the year and last year he won the manager of the EU or think from the sporting news if\nI remember correctly I think the sporting news award is the award the voted on by other managers so the other managers in baseball gave Craig council the award last year for manager of the year and this year the or the baseball America awards that come out in the season\nGave Craig council the award last year for manager of the year and this year the or the baseball America awards that come out and it was he's in the war of the the tools are the best tool it's not really an award for best tool survey are listed\nCraig council is the best manager in the national league and that's a survey that's done by general managers scouts and other managers in baseball so people who are in the game all think that uh he is the best manager in the national\nDouglas is in Milwaukee Hi Douglas you are on WGM Jay\nOh hello yeah you're on the air\nOh sorry I heard something that probably does cut thanks for taking the call and I wanted to ask a rod is doing after getting hit by the\n... from ... that that wasn't even a topic in the post game uh I think he came out more because of a defense than anything else there is a there is nothing to say on on Ryan Braun his health is perfectly fine\nOh that's good because you know a lot of times when you get here and they end up a no no for like the Caesar and he's made a contribution himself for this year it was a\nYeah he's got a great job and uh we appreciate your phone call he uh he's lost his playoff brown is here in September October Braun is here\nAnd that's a very good thing at this point in time we're seeing a Ryan Braun played a level\nThat very much is a he's a big time contributor to this team and I assume you're talking about when he got hit by the ball you know running between first and second that barely got um that was nothing so he is he is perfectly fine to go to Nancy who is in Florida Hi Nancy you're on WGM jak\nRight All right I Am great\nGuy they don't actually I'm just here for a for a week and I feel like they can grab curling are you guys up there because you're representing very well and I'm Glad for that is we kind of stuck\nHere [laughter] ... there you said read is that we said you were a fan of\nYeah I Know I used to work in a craft shop so you know better than than than I Am forever my act like All right all that kind of stuff so it's kind of in my act for better or\nGotcha awesome I appreciate the phone call and yeah I think look when it gets to this point like not the brewers fans of problem would be probably be ready for the cubs or maybe even the cardinals but yeah the pirates fan do you refer the brewers right now purebreds fans don't you work for the brewers right now get some\nGet some love for uh for the division I think so maybe I'm wrong on that I don't I don't know I guess it depends on from one to another Mike in Waukesha protects didn't I didn't even know the players get hit by the ball being out as a rule how often does that happen doesn't happen very often but that is a rule it's a\nIt's up to the player to stay out of the way of the ball so when Ryan Braun got hit\nA it it's almost it's kind of funny because the other day Braun has taken away when Christian yellow which didn't know that the ball was hit down the first base line and got over the glove with the first baseman\nThat took a hit away from Braun and now bronze get hit by the ball hit away so I kind of funny how things work out maybe not funny ha ha but certainly plenty put your the way a way that all works out\nFor one for seven nine nine nine for nine for for one for seven nine nine nine for nine for\nGM rocks and how about the moment from him he hit a homerun he's had a crazy season going up and down between AAA recently had a baby pragmatic caught up with him we will hear that conversation coming up in about two
