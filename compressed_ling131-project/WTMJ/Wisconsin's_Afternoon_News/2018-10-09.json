WGM Jay the brewers National League\nChampionship series opponent has been decided it is the ... stimulus Dodgers there'll be a Miller per game one on friday night I guess it's gonna be Clinton curse on fact I'm I'm almost certain that can be quaking curse off for the Dodgers I Would guess you'll lease on scene for Milwaukee I'll probably find out a little bit later this week but\nEverybody's going to be arrested took uh\nThe Dodgers one more game that I did the brewers to to win this thing that could have swept last night but nonetheless a off day tomorrow in maybe a travel day on Thursday and take on the brewers friday I presume evening at Miller Park what do you think of them have to just initial volunteer brewers in Dodgers for the right to play in the world series\nFor one for seven and nine nine one six twenty\n... is in Oak Creek a WTO O. J. either\nHi thanks for taking my call it's just a good piece by now but\nSeveral players from the doors they land in Malibu, California including hunting alone are um are Milwaukee Brewers it's got to be a bitter sweet game that they're playing out here thinking let's see how many of our parents to call somebody out here supporting us because the Dodgers stadium is quite\nHas like ten percent more\nAttendance capacity that are Milwaukee Brewers did him is that right\nYeah it's a it's a giant place and it's kind of a lead arriving Dodgers crowd usually in a we'll see what the secondary ticket mark it looks like but you're right Christian yellow pages from California Ryan Braun lives out in Malibu and markets announce emails from out there are certainly his ... will be expedited lot easier um MS doctors to\nYeah in the ... who says as well thanks so you're right reaches the phone call automatic there's a lot of those family tickets get eaten up if nothing else I'll be very curious to see what the brewery contingent is from a fan perspective in Los Angeles I thought it was incredible yesterday in Colorado Denver it's pretty easy flight\nNonstop southwest how bond hop off there you go easy city to get around walkable\nThere was a Wisconsin a friendly bar right within shouting distance of course field and when I walked off the field last night I was able to run onto the field after the game interview Ryan Braun yeah before I got into the clubhouse ah you walk back you'd go through the dugout to get to the clubhouse I looked up I mean there was\nEight nine ten rows deeper brewers fans\nAnd I think many have just sort of congregated over by the brewers dugout following the game I don't think they just you know occupied that section for the entire game but I Will say this there were audible MVP chance for Christian yell at that I could hear in the press box and a portable cheering when runs scored or when members of the Rockies struck out\nSo I I thought it was a nice showing for brewers fans\nA cool city that was my first a chance to get inside Coors Field I thought it was amazing very nice good set up\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty Dodgers will come to Milwaukee and this is a series the Dodgers one during the regular season four games to three Twenty one to run out birds and it kind of an outlier at the season for the Milwaukee Brewers\nAnd they'll have Clinton or try to deal with in Walker Beeler was more talented team and the Braves the Dodgers deserved winning the series the way I look at it these are the two best teams in the national league playing for a chance to go to the world series that's it they are the two best teams no doubt in my mind barriers in Oak Creek turned against the next primary\nHi there go ahead Barry turn the radio down to please oh okay give second [noise]\nAre you there are very high\nOkay sorry we're gonna move on here calls in Franklin joining a sec welcome Paul\nDoing All right thanks so much all\nYou're going to be like Las Vegas last we called it only got one you just take it a nice\nLike a ... for the first Iraq that I'll be studying the Dodgers\nGood stuff pop or is it the phone call yeah this this will be interesting to watch right nice weather that's been nice weather here I guess but day trip to LA to watch the brewers baseball\nNow is the beauty of the series is that it routes through Milwaukee it's a it's a two three to set up and there are only two days off in the entire series so the bruising Dodgers will play on friday they will play on Saturday\nThe series would move than to Los Angeles for games three four and five on Monday Tuesday Wednesday as scheduled now and then back to Miller Park should the need arise for games on friday and Saturday\nSo ... minutes a full week long series a week and then some uh and hopefully the rules are able to wrap things up a little earlier than that to the gym is in\nHey great thanks for the call and taking the call um yeah I clearly think from what I saw a after watching are games\nThat the Dodgers were clearly a better team a stronger deeper whatever than the Braves so uh the way it should be I mean if we're going to work our way up keep working up against the best teams and they definitely were\nThink the national interest would be would be slight I don't care but I ended up just the reality of the situation now you mentioned the brewers and the acquisitions they made you know trade deadline following the trade deadline do the waiver wire thing yeah I did develop health ... been great was August great\nScope it's been really the only one who is struggled along but I think the doctors could probably make a similar statement you know that even Saddam was the big dog a part of trade deadline and heat in one half of play here Thirteen home runs in less than half of the season with the Dodgers\nBut they also picked up David Freese remember him from the cardinals\nAnd killed the brewers it'll be two on single today and that whatever the Braves he's another guy that you just you look at and say oh God no not him they picked up ... or as a trade deadline and second baseman for Minnesota it didn't really have a great season hitting the baseball\nBut seem to hit brewers pitching pretty well so they possess a line if you look at it up and down and said you know that guy can get you up soaking that guy in Silicon that guy there really aren't any breaks in the Dodgers one\nThirty five who runs for ... twenty five or ... twenty five from Doug Peterson twenty four from ... do a if you'd included the American league stance Machado over thirty that Kim ... season two Ninety with Twenty one home runs eighty five are beyond so you know that's a pretty loaded London\nNo doubt about it so did the brewers pitching will be tested at a different level against the Dodgers and they were against Colorado with the Rockies he got to worry about three guys in particular Blackmon story or NATO brewers conquered them without issue\nLittle deeper with the doctors for one for seven nine nine to one that's six twenty Sandy is joining us next nominee false identity\nHey thanks for taking my call Disney with all due respect I Lived in Milwaukee forty one years I'm from Brooklyn and still have a Dodger leaking not necessarily in LA fan\nBut at Dodger fan than I Am super excited I I have high regard for council ownership and the brewers organization players and obviously a for Roberts and Dodger ownership on their team\nAnd I come from some cyber metric and it is amazing to me as you go across this flashlight how the Dodgers and breweries trade back and forth first and second the national league this year and some of the key stats\nOn both of our friends and catching so I'll make a prediction here I think it's got to go to seven I I think they're going to be really maybe there'll be a blowout somewhere along the way but I think that these two teams are they're they're ventures or Saudi you're pitching is so what do\nThey have these these uh prime time players ... had the best policy who gave his career to several days ago eight innings wait I think to have no ... no walk\nOr another emerging separate rookie and Walker view over another mystery guy emerges and max Montreal stop I Know the brewers fan when I hear about the brewery I don't blame them\nI Want my brewers fan except when they're playing the Dodgers fight I think this is kind of if you love baseball is gonna be an incredible series all hang up and listen at all I Will fade or my brewers fan friends and Dodger fan ... enjoy no matter what happened we\nGet a lot to celebrate this has been a great year\nYeah no doubt about it to the phone call Sandy you know it it does feel different than in two thousand eleven doesn't it\nAnd it definitely feels different than in two thousand and eight now I was talking on Wisconsin's after the news today drummer cure asked me why is this feel different because the humid does as well my thought at the time was this little ... have to worry about a National League central opposed\nYou know what I mean I Do thousand eleven that was great but they ran into the car don't boy it's a different track for the brewers this year\nThat the Rockies or an uncommon team the Dodgers somewhat uncommon team they've played each other's seven times the season the brewers dominated the you know was the only thing they did not have a winning record against Indiana West was the Dodgers\nWere restrict three of the seven games and maybe that's part of it but then I got to take some attacks want to do it for madam Chicago saying hey are you part of the reason why this feel different than it was a two thousand eleven is that a few thousand eleven you new prince was leaving in two thousand eight your news easy was gone in bed sheets\nIt's different with this brewers team because it it feels like this is the start that this is the start of something here with guys like yellow Jim keen under control I mean who you're gonna lose after the season maybe Mike was I guess I'm not even sold\nThat he's going to be gone I'm with you on that I mean there's a conversation for another day but I I really think about him and and scope would be the odd man out which is maybe because he's got the year left in the country maybe I Would maybe make a little less money than most doctors why don't they could come back at you know Fifteen ... Eighteen million\nBut maybe that's part of it I think it's a very good point here is that part of the reason why this feels different is that it feels like you were at the start of something great\nAnd that if you can sustain this and that's been David Stern Monterrey from the get go you want to build a team\nThat has sustained success year after year after year well who you're losing who are you going to lose from a a team that's reached the national league championship series and has a chance to win and make the world series\nMinimal minimal impact player sees the value of the monster mensch she was great integrate he wasn't going to come back right\nI mean just the different different\nIn a good way in a very good way for one for seven nine one one of the accident mortgage

man\nThan men did\nForty plus years ago I think about that\nAnd the reason is the nature of work has changed so much men historically a lot of men have earned that living based on brawn\nNo and doing physical labor of some kind and factory work his automated so heavily why those jobs in the factory that paid well we're really dangerous but a lot of those jobs\nAre now replaced by robotics and machinery or various forms of automation and they're not coming back I mean the United states\nIs the largest at manufacturing it's ever been with a tiny fraction of the labor it used to have\nWomen who so heavily rely on education for the field of work they go into it was seen incomes rise\nOver that time period men on the other hand who are not well represented in education generally have seen and comes to climb on average not everybody\nAnd it doesn't mean a college education\nBut getting a trade skill that something that gives you what's referred to as a skilled trade plumber electrician who knows what\nGetting a skill\nIt can be a college degree whatever it is business income gap that men are experiencing you can see what the cause is if you walk on a college campus which I've done so much a\nWith a daughter in college now that colleges are overwhelmingly dominated now on average by women students\nMen are not present anywhere near the numbers of women were in an era but it's all about what you know\nAnd so whatever that is that you would enjoy again it doesn't necessarily mean college it can be a state supported technical college but the point is today education starting out\nBut the whole idea is that in the future there will be only these him it's almost like how apple did something that seem crazy at the time when they eliminated the headphone Jack\nAnd people that are apple users now are accustomed to not having a headphone Jack anymore\nAnd So Apple is so influential and the United states that odds are we will move away from having any of these plastic chips it all known as sim cards and that would be so great for your wallet\nBut when major introductions occur like now with the new iPhones and the United states the new Samsung's don't have the same

them almost certainly plans have gotten cheaper and better than what you signed up on years ago and you just keep paying the bill month after month and never forget\nThe second tier brands that are owned by the major carriers themselves or captives up them\nFor a TNT that's cricket for T Mobile is metro PCS and for sprint it's boost mobile\nFor horizon they have a captive called total

instead of the\nParent brand if you will and the only thing the only difference you face is paying less money\nAnd I have a call now from I don't know what your name is I mean I like to introduce yourself Hi what's your name\nOr this is Rob Hi Rob it's great to have you here on the Clark Howard show and Rob you want to talk about how I always trash for oh three B plans\nThat's right clock and at first I just want to say I'm I'm completely did he talking to you I've been listening to you for decades and uh\nHow ... and also myself been interested in personal finance than investments for you know since I was a teenager a lot like you so well right\nYes so for St Louis I'm as you've talked about there for non profits and they do have a bad rap um and some of them are still pretty lousy but my wife and I've worked in a a number of organizations with for three days that have been excellent\nAnd I work in health care and she works for a think tank and we've never had anything but fantastic for three days with\nSome of your favorite companies and very low expense ratio does um so I just wanted to make sure that you were aware that not all for reviews are bad and ah when callers call in asking about their plans making sure they they look under the head of what they really got\nWell that is a great thing you said 'cause you know when I talk in such stark terms about four or thirty bees\nI'm trying to really shake people up and get them to do something they don't even know they can do and that is find out what they're paying for the for the ... the problem in the fourth ruby industry is so often even if somebody has\nA finds offered to them from a low cost a find a house they may still be paying very high charges for administration to an insurance company that manages the four three be there at and so\nThat's ... go ahead and try that I think especially um teachers have traditionally\nBeen exposed to a pretty lousy plans through their school districts and and whatever plans they've they've worked out um but\nYeah and it's an ... teachers get beaten up every possible way not physically but I mean\nYou know the teachers have trouble getting enough respect they have trouble getting enough pay for the hard work they do and then on top of it that generally school districts lack the capability in house to pick\nGood for three B plans and so they just can't say oh why don't you handle that whoever you are you go handle that for it's handled by a teacher's union that also lacks\nThe expertise to pick these plans and the teachers ended up getting socked with expenses that are so high that often a teacher will end up with less money at the end of a year and they started with at the beginning because the fees are so dry norm is\nThat in the last ... financial term by the way China norm is not really has seen\nTeacher plans with three percent ... expense ratio is and\nAs an example my plan and my wife's plan has expense ratio is a total expenses down around point ... point oh four percent so\nThat's fantastic so where you and your wife or his and the range of what a good for three four one K. would be also\nYeah well thanks clerk for everything you do crazy shit and I and\nKeep saving that money more you save the better off you're going to be and we're speaking now with tied tied welcome to the Clark Howard show\nType clerk it's a nice to talk to you thank you for taking my call\nCertainly Todd how can I be of service\nYeah all my life I have an emergency fond I'm just at a local bank and but it's like it's in just a regular checking account and it's not getting any kind of like return on it\nUm and so really I was just kind of wondering if you had any advice to maybe moving it I have a local credit union maybe in our area that I've seen maybe two or three percent for a checking account um this one that kind of get your thoughts on that\nSo that the two percent checking accounts usually two or three or ten years ago they were five percent checking accounts the way it does work is you and your wife we'd have to do so many debit card transactions than a month\nYou'll use it somewhere or any car and they'll say debit or credit\nAnd with a debit card you can choose to say credit even though it's a debit card and then the merchant has to pay much higher fees than they would if it clears as a debit card\nSo when a credit union or bank is offering higher interest rates on checking accounts with those accounts usually they're limited to paying the interest on our balance up to like twenty or twenty five thousand dollars\nAnd you're required to do usually I think it's like a twelve to twenty depending on the bank or credit union debit card transactions a month cleared as credit and that's where the money comes from to pay you the interest is what they earn on those merchant fees\nOkay so you would know cycles kind of keep it where it's at now just liquid or um\n... for an answer okay\nUm you can link your existing account to one of the online banks that are paying now lots of them are paying around two percent even some a little more than two percent on simple savings\nAnd the money can be moved on two days' notice you know emergency usually two days will be quick enough you're moving back to your regular bank\nAnd then you earn and that two percent that's going to go higher over the next six months\nGotcha and that is just simply linking the account to an online bank or is that moving it\nThat's exactly right what you do is you open an account with an online bank and you link it to your existing bank or credit union account\nAnd then the money can be moved back and forth pretty easily and I'm working right now there's a website that has a pretty good list of the online banks I'm looking at a bank right dot com and the highest rates available today or to point two five percent\nOn simple savings\nAnd so that's that's where things are headed by the end of the year we may have the highest rates of people are offering around two point five or ... percent really simple to just link your account and now you're going to get a better deal\nSo give it a try you're listening

number one that got to get the often on track in one form or another in what\nThey have to do it through the San Francisco games get a win there and then get healthy during the by and specifically are Rogers\nAnd some of his receivers so um that number one I think and defensively I think they're evolving hum I'm not sure how much better they are a than the previous year but I Know it's very early
