reviews Katie what about these bogus ones\nThat a lot as a matter of fact it's really hard these days to tell me to be easier right you would just say something it didn't it was garbled it just had five stars and it was garbled and you knew that that was not really true anymore they're not people are hired to just write reviews and they're getting very good at it [noise]\nUm there was a survey that found that about eight and ten people say that they read a sacred view in the past year I'm In eighty four percent of that and say hey I don't even know if I can always spot it take you\nSo I just thought you know this is an effort to unity to really dig into what is a research showing what experts say\nAbout spotting fake reviews for the first one which I Am not try and realized but I'm saying and the timing of her views if you see a lot but you're looking at a product Amazon wherever you're looking at it you see a lot of reviews pop in a short amount of time\nThat can be a sign that it's desert sacred fierce\n'em dead chicken and a lot of times there's a targeted campaign to add a bunch of new review that often happens in a short amount of time if you see a whole bunch clustered together that can be fake I mean of course if there is a product just launched and it was a Black Friday or Christmas or something like that that might be why there's a lot of the same time but again just be suspicious about that\nHow about the um this accusation or the investigation of Amazon doing that uh there were payoffs right to delete bad reviews All right\nSo that they are investigating that were not entirely sure if that actually happened they are investigating that they were on that committed employees mostly in China um are taking bribes to delete negative reviews and share sales data on ban ban to count there is a bunch of that now they're investigating it we don't know\nIf it's true or not but you know I mean that immediately when I read that I thought wow there's a lot of the reviews who knows what's going on here but it's a problem because you were people rely on reviews to to you know what they buy and\nIf they're fake I mean you're you're ... you're not going to like when you end up with one ended up in your house\nWhile we're speaking with Katie Hill editor at money or not Congress talking about how to spot fake reviews online or in another way uh you said over use of the words I and me and lots of verbs\nYeah this was a huge study coming out of Cornell that found um that online reviews that frequently you buy at me are more likely to be fake they don't exactly know why\nBut it could be because when people are lying they try to make themselves sound more credible by using personal pronounce it they're saying I Need to make it seem like they're they're real person doing this\nUm and then they and they also tend to deceive or use more verbs and then um it it the more ... more now and\nThat's a little bit harder I think to parse out but the guy in the me if you see a whole bunch of that that's a little bit of a red flag\nOr what's the scene setting you gotta watch out for\nThis is another thing from the Cornell SETI okay so this one was looking at a hotel reviewed in particular but I think it probably applied to everything\nTruthful hotel reviews are more likely to use concrete word so they'll say something like bathroom check and\nYou know very concrete things that people who were lying to fake reviews they were more like sending it seemed like wow that was on vacation or a business trip with my husband wears the other

hopes on a train new young guys in San ... guys\nBut the bottom line that whole experiment is this year that Green Bay Packers [laughter]\n[noise] well I [laughter]\nI'll tell you that it's I don't know if they suck all the way but it's definitely been inconsistent um there's no question about that and I know there's a lot of people that can go back to some of the personnel moves that were made last year even the year before that and you know I I Know Jodi Nelson is the first name\nA that's going to come to mind um and Nelson a couple of weeks ago a great game against Miami in\nA couple of big catches a against Cleveland last week but here's the thing you know which I Know is the first week of October here but I I think we're still somewhat early end of the season for me the big thing is you got guys who have to be available in December\nAnd the last couple of years you already know there's really been banked up\nThe last two December ... to January is and and I wonder where he's going to be at the end of the seeds and this is why you've got so many young guys on his wide receiving corn you\nKnow get like you take Randall caught on to the next to run them allows who's been fantastic\nAnd the first four weeks of the season and it's definitely a different feel for the office I mean there's no question about it that's all you know I mean everybody has injuries in you know if you throw a wide receivers out there like everybody was talking about at the end of the precision you sacrifice up somewhere else All right well we're not going to sacrifice up there in the program a mark ... is ready to go and mark\nUm what were your thoughts here on this on this effort here I mean the Packers down early that we've seen this throughout the season already they just seem to be flat in the first quarter what's your take away from that\nYeah I I don't know the beginning of the game for whatever reason has been you know obviously something bad one against the team today with the point that you know whether or not that was conclusive\nThe free seven points that ended up coming out for ... for Detroit but then there was no answer a back and ... with a team that doesn't hunt the entire game\nAnd you still don't have any points out granted I Know yeah I'm sure will\nDon't have any points out granted I Know yeah I'm sure we'll talk a bunch of bought Mason today and you know Don you know it it just had a bad day there's no getting around it but the often what looked disjointed\nThere was still there are a lot of timing issues you saw numerous times on the broadcast guys in the same spot or especially in a to point play so there's just there's still something that's not there and they haven't quite figured out what the rotation needs to look like at the at the running back spot I thought here and Jones\nDid get as many touches I think everybody anticipated coming into the game so\nAll in all I think if you look at this from a defensive standpoint I thought the defense and do they you know ended up giving up a bunch of points\nThey got putting a lot of top spots and so all in all I mean it it's not looking the wedding everybody hopes the team is struggling but I I still think I don't I Know there's going to be a lot of folks calling today and talking about it's over like the last caller you know there's so many issues we have the guys that we let go\nThere's still a lot of season left in this team has not started fast the last couple of years you always want to start building in the right direction\nAnd I didn't think the second half you looked at ... you saw some good things that things that you could build off of but right now you can't keep starting games off as badly as Green Bay has and it's been that way pretty much the entire

your for one for seven nine nine one six twenty on the talk and text line a lot to get to hear a team is two to one and and mark you know that record alone just kind of tells you how inconsistent this team has been\n[noise] yeah it does I think you you look at the beginning part of the schedule and I think with uh the home games that were on it and the fact that\nNot not a lot of folks with the new coaching staff in Detroit you thought this would be a game that Green Bay should win well that's why you play the games and I think Green Bay a dentist drowsy asked us in the pre game we where we thought Green Bay would be or has it been disappointing about the same\nI today's losses disappointing and I think you you look at how the seasons unfolded up to this point\nIt has not been the start that they were looking for I think there's a lot of ... there's a lot more question marks I think than most of us thought and most of it\nIs coming on the opposite side of the football which is the biggest surprise to me because I thought with Joe filled and coming back in with the addition\nOf Jimmy ... and some of the other things that you know the office of wind has stayed relatively healthy the emergence of drawn and ... and you have a really strong stable of running backs you thought that this office would really be dynamite\nAnd it's just been really inconsistent and I think that's why you see a team and you see the record being you know two two and one\n... it's because you've seen you wrote one half your play good one happy don't and when you're inconsistent like that that's\nThe kind of record you're ... you're going to end up happening\nFor one for seven nine one six twenty on the talk in tech wind back to the phones we go Kevin in Indiana Kevin Iran Packers oh the\n... how you doing today don't allow good hey just opposite race and I've been friends forever and we have the best quarterback in the NFL correct shore and\nFor the last four years once we get inside the thirty we're in now basically right I mean we don't score like everybody else sports against us so that that's got to be with parking is like oh you know I'm not real I guess I Am really\nBecause we've seen this stuff for\nThe last five years now where we get the thirty and we're just\nAverage up and order something's got to have some kind of change\nI think Kevin thanks for the call and then you've got to discount last year was brought home last quarter back in ... off the top of my head I I don't remember how the Packers were in the red zone in in the first five games do I do recall they seem to be pretty highly productive when when Rogers was healthy but\nFinishing these drives and especially ... has been a big issue\nUm you know again some of its penalty some of it has dropped patches but I Can't really put my finger on why this team can't seem to finish you know even when they get into the the edge of the red zone they're inside the thirty yard line they just can't seem to finish off he drives and you can talk about basic Crosby missing field goals but why you can't you feel goes at all is perhaps a question\nYeah I mean that's I think that's a fair point and when you look at the flipside of that in today's game it was the exact opposite I think Detroit was for for for what for touchdowns when they were able to get in that red area and I think you you look at and I know ah the telecast it a good job there was one there was a paid route to Jimmy grand that\nYou know I think Jimmy trip and it it just looked disjointed\nOr there were a couple and the second half of your easy pitching catch where you\nYou rent kind of that Arpaio looked at they did last week and that's the stuff that I think you're going to look more at and that's where I'd like to see\nMore air and Jones and more that run threat down at the goal and not down in that red area because\nYou know teams are playing for the past or playing Jimmy grand because I think that was the that was kind of I thought the solution and one of the big weapons that you're looking at with a big body and the the matchup problems that he causes we haven't seen that yet and I think that can be from a ban standpoint that's a real frustrating peace I'm sure\nIt's frustrating for Jimmy granted rare in Russia because\nI'm assuming when you make a decision to bring him in that was it was really tailor made

Jeff urine Packers oh the\nOh um yeah I I kind of a big picture question a\nPass for many many years in the pre season you see the starters in the first game for a series maybe to second was poor maybe in the second quarter third was maybe for a series of the second half and then the fourth and they said\nHow much you know especially with mark ... you have to clean this plane ... yeah so how much do you think the officers knew the issues are the mental ears and lilies and even some extent early season injuries are affected\nBy that to versus when he played\nAn interesting question mark and of course we've we've discussed as here because it really it is a league wide thing I mean nobody is playing their starters uh in the pre season anywhere close to do is they did even you know ten years ago\nAnd and I would tend to by saying well I mean just look at the team here that we played against Detroit they have not look good and and and there are three losses you know they did beat New England and obviously they beat the Packers here today but I think there are times in the first four or five weeks of the season outside of the rams into cheese where everybody has had their issues in the first quarter of the season\nYeah it's an interesting question though because uh you know\nAnything you do I don't care if it's radio if it's ... you always the more you do it the more knowledgeable you have and I think you want to get as many reps as you can\nThe balancing act in ... like we like we talk about Green Bay change their philosophy when Jody Nelson got hurt and that preseason game and missed the season that changed I think the mindset it was more about how and getting guys to the regular season opener so you're there is a given a take and when you don't you take those same game wraps\nYou're there is going to be a little bit of a learning curve there is going to be some Ross because you haven't done it and nobody ever as play yeah I haven't seen anybody play a ball game that's why the first couple of weeks there there's just\nNew England has basically play that were that the month of September is much more like the pre season they rotate off into vinyl around trying to figure out what combinations work it's\nTrying to figure out what combinations work\nIt's a new way the NFL and like you said ... with the exception of Kansas City and the LA Rams everybody's been incredibly inconsistent you've seen that league wide that's why every game UC papa look up to Minnesota when in Buffalo looks terrible last week and remained they win a game against\nUp three in one team in Tennessee so there's just\nThere's a lot of parity there is a lot of things that you just never would guess what happened there was more uncertainty now because you have younger teams that don't practice or play as much in the pre season so early in seasons\nYou just never know what's gonna happen but to answer your question yeah I Do think there's a there is a correlation to it but I think a league wide and it's not just Green Bay that that's happening\nAs Wayne Larrivee likes to say the first four weeks of the regular season are now the de facto pre season because you just don't see you know the number one ... out there and not just Green Bay league wide you just don't see your number one guys out there very much in the ... and let's talk to Bob on a cell phone Bob welcome to backers oh the\nOh thanks for taking my call um I've got a strategy question in the fourth quarter when they had a fork down and they sent a a Crosby out or the fifty six yard field goal\nWhy when they have gone for it and for down rather than the field goal I mean he was a Mason of having such a bad day\nUm I just didn't think that that was a the right thing to do and and uh I Would put the ball and Arabs hands and you can do\nYeah thirty one twenty at that point bark and you know obviously it to to score game you say well if you get the vehicle here uh you know touch down to four diversion you're tied the game but I was surprised by that I Know it was more than Fifteen that you rented Detroit thirty a yard line but they don't you just think at that point with the miserable day Crosby is added you let Aaron Rodgers when this one for you\nI mean it's really easy to make that assumption I think had it been a four and five or a fourth in Seventy then I think you probably you look at the probability of picking that first down up but the way Mason\nIf it was a normal week and we hadn't seen what Mason did in the early part of that game I don't have a problem with that at all because of the numbers would say no Mason is really you know has been so good from long distance\nYou have to get those points at some point anyways and up working Fifteen the conversion right on that is very low so\nBut the way the game was playing in the way Mason was kicking or you could tell the confidence was gone\nYeah it's you never want to take the body or best players hands but I completely understand\nYou know the rationale for doing it but in the long run when your second guessed it's really easy to say wow you had a better shot at connecting on that fourth and fifth in than you did mention Crosby kick I'm fifty six yard or a with kind of where the game was going\nAnd I think if it's the fourth and five it's probably no brainer the Packers are

with cliff notes you have to cut\nYou want Everytime anywhere great glass it's going to be great ...\nAnd I find that to be a little bit frustrating because you know this is a a Detroit team that didn't look pretty good last week against Dallas you\nKnow meanwhile they're the Packers defensively very good albeit against a rookie quarterback in Buffalo when I talk about how the Packers are two two and one are inconsistent but I felt like this game against Detroit and the next week against San Francisco where two big games did you had the opportunity to go into the by week\nFor all the issues all the inconsistent play and the Aaron Rodgers injury and now the injuries are wide receiver you could be for wanted one going into uh\nIf you could be for wanted one going into a very tough part of the schedule but now at two to one like it you know five weeks into the year we're back to the drawing board with his team\nYeah I mean I think that's when you look at the schedule that's why\nThe schedule comes out April or may whatever comes out you you start looking at it you think you know what you're talking about\nAnd things change quickly there's an injury you know obviously for the forty niners don't have grumbled oh now and that's why it's every week stands on its own merit and as we talked about the beginning of the seasons now\nYou don't necessarily know what you have so how are you you're just trying to find a way and you hear McCarthy always talking about you know improving and making steps in sacking success well now you've you've seen the ups and downs and you're trying to get through you want to you don't ever want to lose games at home\nIf you feel like if you do that you split on the road\nYou're going to be in a great spot to you know for ... positioning and everything else that's kind of a goal up at ... up at Green Bay\nNext week is a is a huge game I think for\nFor numerous reasons it's a home game against a team that you should be but right now if you're asking you what are you going to get I don't think anyone knows exactly what you're getting right you know with what Green Bay has you don't know and that's the part\nThat's intriguing from a overall NFL standpoint but being a fan of a team it's incredibly frustrating I think we're hearing that with some of our calls and or tax\nBefore we get back into it ten seconds for a station

in superior Dwayne you're on Packers oh the\nYeah I just got a concern about basic cause he's proven he is one of the best vehicle characters he's consistent as a team counted on that or is he beyond his peak as it mental it's easy to say it with mental to the rookie\nKicker the Vikings when they caught him because he was a rookie but basically it's been around is it still is an underlying injury that he's not talking about is you know\nBut it's not it's not Mesa and to be missing is missed how many extra points and then ... vehicles for him or you know it's a concern out what's going on with him physically and mentally I'm\nAs a team just going all we just got to get to this point and may give us three point to is it the pressure I don't know\nWell it's actually the colds away and I don't think it's a physical thing a bark um I I think today you could probably right off as just a case of the hips are they like to call it among the golfers and and what not um [noise]\nHe just didn't have it today I Know he missed an extra point last week against buffalo but I to me it wasn't a concern at all because he was so money with the field goal kicks and\nI look I think I Know there was a lot of knee jerk reaction of what we saw her this afternoon but I gotta I gotta do the reverse a Rick Pitino there and say Mason Crosby is walking through that door tomorrow I mean he's still going to be the kicker for the Green Bay Packers he was just simply an off day\nOh I don't think there's any question about that I Know on Twitter in some other you know ... everybody reacts I get it uh but Mason has been through this before and to answer the question I don't think it's a physical thing is you know it's mental and when you miss a kick you know he's pulled the first feel go a little bit less\nThen I think he tried to I'm not going to pull this one is blocked it out right and then\nSuccessful political develop right here in Wisconsin have become the standard for patient care here in

mark ... more phone calls to get to so let's get right back to adjacent who was on the road somewhere Jason you're on Packers oh the\n... were you know they're not ... well that's\nCool um I Would go on\nAll right Jason thanks for the call and we thought she was a little bit earlier bark but um I I I have trouble believing that these guys aren't focused I to me it seems more like an execution deal\nYeah no I agree I I don't think it's distractions I I don't I'm not even sure there are a ton of distractions right now isn't that mock her and I think it's you know there's some injury issues there are some other things but\nYou know Aaron has not been a sharp as I think he would say he'd like to be the opposite has happened is dynamic is I think everyone assumed that it would be and when you start factor and all that in it it does come down to execution and the lack of big plate there haven't been the you\nKnow those really big long throws that were customs machine we haven't seen anything really unleashed yet and so\nI don't look at this as a distracted locker I I Know there's a lot of people kind of get after Mike mccarthy and so the coaching staff because of the slow starts\nThat you have to start figure things out sooner there's no question about that I don't know if there is a job that needs to be had because\nRight now if you look at the second half of most of these football games ... really good football uh it's been just some really brutal the book games at Green Bay as last may have been future it first happened it's just it has not looked good from any angle and that's why it took two two and one football team\nAnd you know even in in victory last week against buffalo you had an offense that couldn't put for really solid quarters of football together and\nUh the tide of Minnesota and go in the first happened that it does about in the second half overtime as well and you know again I hate to say but outside of fourth quarter against Chicago this has just been an office that continues to search\nFor what's going to work and whether it's\nNot everybody's on the same page because of pre season the Aaron Rodgers injury injuries to the wide receiver injuries to the office of line I think it's I don't think it's one thing mark as you said last hour I think it's a combination of things I'm I'm not going to say the season is over there to to win one\nBut regardless of what happened next week you've got a really tough stretch after the by all the wait till the end of November\nAnd if you don't have the fence together against the heavy weights like the rams liked the patriots it it could make for a tough second half of the season\nYeah it's not close to being over I think that everybody looked at that\nYeah it's not close to being over I think that everybody looked at the schedule and knew that that stretch that talking about after the by what's going to be\nThe most challenging part of the schedule and I think it's still going to be but it's early I I Know people don't like hearing that there's going to be you know a lot of improvement and if there's not this team is not going to be in the class there that you have to continue to improve\nThere's a long way to go I think you're seeing some things that you light but for the most part it's not where it needs to be yet\nBut the good news is there's still plenty of football to replace\nAssad to Greg in sun prairie Greg Iran Packers of the\nExtreme I call it was like bigger picture defense we chased the court here we're going member would look like the jets I think we played out there like two thousand eleven twelve park you might even play that game and like read nothing it was brutal that I Am I Am lamb they requested Huettel their physical\n... nothing like that without the names because that doesn't do any good to five weeks though you guys think there's anybody that he even playing cobalt elder as he puts his not aggressive they're not physical there's really not much well consistently you don't turn the ball over\nTo the concert over I'm really concerned about that we switch nobody said well I mean he was a better on the game of passing by strategies\nIt really who we have we seen anything it makes us look like in ... Italy I appreciate your family\nLike Greg thanks for the call Tony ten is a win the Packers are went out to New York and play the jets Mike Bennett was there is the defensive coordinators nine nothing game\nI Would say that it's a mark you you had a very good personnel the jets in two thousand nine and twenty then I mean as a top five unit yet they're all ...\nPretty close to his taken and he's about as good as it gets so I think personnel has some ... something to do with enough drier Alexander I'm I I think it's like pretty well especially for rookie of just one of course we didn't see him out there a today he was a inactive but\nYou know go to the second half against the Redskins and then last week against the bills I think you were hoping for here's something positive to build on\nThe truth be told a wasn't a terrible outing for the defense they were hamstrung with what happened in the first that other than to the Kennedy ... sixty art catch a in the first half I thought the defense did pretty much as much as you could expect the problem was was twenty four to nothing\nYeah I I think a lot of times that it's easy to look at it and say well man it's your turn the game and a half and boy the defense thinks well\nThe defense from my yard standpoint and the thing that I Would be say from a negative standpoint I defense is the red zone defense you you need a whole teams to feel goes a little bit more than what they did today but all in all I I\n... I think I feel actually a little bit better about the defense today than I did last week which sounds crazy but Detroit's got more weapons I think they have a much better unit and were tested more\nGreen Bay did some really good things that as far as pro ball players and ... are they loaded with pro ball players no but I think Kenny Clark is a budding or he is a star player definitely and I know he got to think that he is a dominant football player and I think you're going to continue to see him take stride I\nI think the defense is actually played better than what\nI think a lot of folks thought Hey Mike ... is there is a lot of course they're doing\nI think they're doing what is expected of them at this point and they're going to continue to get better and better when they're fully healthy they haven't had a game since week one where they've been full full shrimp with Kevin tang and Alexander Jackson and that whole crew that we haven't seen it yet I liked the trajectory where this defenses go\nYeah I think you see thirty one points on a boat for Detroit and you think well a lot of defensive breakdowns but that that really wasn't the case here this afternoon will mark\nA this is where we part ways will talk to you next week so I'm good thank you All right thirty one twenty three the final score this afternoon the lions over the Packers Green Bay two two and

falls to the Detroit Lions and there there's a couple of times throughout the day that the Detroit the offensive line didn't have TJ like today I'm near past protection had been an issue a number of times with alliance this afternoon in seven sex or last week\nAgainst buffalo part of it you got a rookie quarterback another part of it as Buffalo's off into line it's just been in shambles how much of that would carry over to today\nAre we talking about it's such a week to week league and uh I I thought the pastor actually was not quite as as consistent not quite as ferocious as you were hoping for coming into today again considering the charge I'm delighted to get as much better than Buffalo's they'll get me wrong but uh just considering how much Matthew Stafford has been hit already this year\nAnd how they would take a little bit more advantage of that uh unfortunately unable to do so but as we dissected defense and the things that they've been able to do and not able to do\nAnd I think what we are starting to see is is since the first half of the Redskins game back in the week three is a defense that overall is starting to play a little bit better you may not see it on the surface here when you look at thirty one points against Detroit but\nUh I'll say it again I Want to be a broken record here but a lot of that falls on the special teams on the field position\nAnd I think the defense did what they had to do but the fact of life you see some very good play out of the de line throughout the season ... Clark has been phenomenal and you know de Larry's is one of those young guys that that you're hoping we'll we'll take the step up here and with with well I Would look out for the year\nAre you looking for a ... take advantage of of these opportunities um\nThree tackles on today how did he see things in other locker room report Larry my parents and the Lowry [noise]\nAh yeah it's tough because you know I think ... to ... you know he's ... he's gone but the story was\nWell you you know each ... each town but the story was poisoned the game and that's on an awesome though you know getting crushed up front but also you know making the big poison stopped my third one so that that's a big thing for defense and we can put some in the ... were very good friends who are going to\nBe a massive wrong guy because you're not\nThose are so from ... to ... to some extent [noise]\nAnd as one of like one of the guys like how do you how do you look at the flags were flying\nSuck because when we're out there you know I was a very good environment and we were fired up to a football and so you know like a combat but we've got to make sure we're just going through so we can you know I'm not one replaying very aggressive about five star we kind of ... and this guy was smart and fast and I think we're smart park kind of a and I fell apart at times\nDoing more up to ... ... more\nA real can just individually now are good they plan\nAh I think so I mean that's a big part of my game is out in the wrong number of things that you make tunes one dimensional I felt good out there um you know I got high a little bit and I'm a ... on third shorten those close but I thought we cut funding for four quarters and never give up and after a big part of the group\nMay Justin census cups William So I think that er mentality um you know show to the\nDo when you see or to make like\n... when you see him instruct him like\nOr is there a feeling of some compassion her ... compassionate [laughter]\nYeah I mean I think over the course of the year everyone has those moments where they're not you know\n... as well as they want to so he's obviously very experienced picker he's made some great cooks over the course of his career so he'll be fine that's and that's not our in our worries you know the guys making sure discipline um because assistant for course because he was correct you know not as ... and and you know he's a high pressure guy goes that's not very well so I'm always on\nThe Lowry with Larry and the caring for one for\nSeven nine to one six twenty that's talking tech might do some time if you'd like do\nI get in a thoughts or two for one for seven nine nine one six twenty in fact a couple of more text as you get to uh how about not suffering and taking the ball first when we when the thoughts that today the Packers one of the coin toss to for it to the second half its been standard operating procedure really ... around the league my sense\nAnd I'm probably said he obviously but my sense here this upcoming weekend preparations for the forty niners spending a lot of talk about starting fast\nIn about making an early statement I think the fact that the team has struggled the way that they have in the first quarter would would suggest to you know they they make continued it of course but you do wonder\nUh you know if they get the opportunity next week against the forty niners if they say hey why not get the ball first try and make it early statement\nAnd you know hopefully build off of that the thinking of course you know you can get the ball at the end of the first happened and get a quick vehicle or a touchdown and you get the ball to open up the second half get a score you know now you're you're you're really dictating the flow of the game and we all saw that last week against buffalo you number a Josh ... showed that interception\nPackers get a field goal in the final forty three seconds is the first half get the ball the open up the second half and you think okay you know this is where you can you really crush the bills here uh but they ended up getting a vehicle to open up the second half ... I mean it was Nineteen to nothing at that point you know buffalo just didn't have it\nUh and the Packers were on their way to victory but that that the ditch you know Aaron Rodgers and you think back to ... you know twenty four team that MVP year it seemed like just about every week the Packers had perfected the get the score at the end of the first half get the sort of open up the second half I think it just indicative of where this often is\nUh the inconsistencies drop patches the penalties and we've been through the laundry list and there's a lot of them again I think as you look for some of the teams here in this upcoming week getting off to a fast start again you'd like to see our Jones get the ball more than seven times and and those seven carries all came in the first half\nTwenty four to nothing is going to be tough to run the football you get into the second half\nBut how about you bet against say forty and understanding of course without Jimmy grow up blowing a we're going to get an update on a second you know they have in some officers struggles against the windows Arizona Cardinals\nIs there an opportunity there perhaps I get the ball to open up the game and make a statement I Won last time NFL uh instant replay\nUpdate let's send it over to ... to the game that you're referencing Arizona ... fourteen six lead on San Francisco right now they are just beginning the fourth\nQuarter in that content or back contest at the back of my next the forty niners the Vikings an eagles Philadelphia grabs a field goal and a person wants to windows small with touchdown pass an a to point conversion all of a sudden the eagles are back in the game down twenty to fourteen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Wisconsin's Afternoon News", "city": "Milwaukee", "day": "07"}
