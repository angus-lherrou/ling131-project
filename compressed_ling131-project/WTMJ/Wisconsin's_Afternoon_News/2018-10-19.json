here's the Packers head into this break into the by week what do you think is the strength of this Packers team so far\nWell you know what I've actually I've been really impressive and I think a lot of it has and what they're receiving corps namely those rookies that there are quite as ... an echo miniature St brown\nBut at gambling with a hundred and three yards on three reception for the forty niners on Monday Night it was really exciting to see them do so well and have have such a a good game it's actually him but that\nAlso even though it's one of the strength to talk to a big question heading out of the week is white it they're receiving corps and what is that going to look like with Randall cop coming back around when I drop them off our then well once they get healthy\nSo while that certainly strength because they're having so such gets at receiver it's also a big question mark\nYou know I don't have a lot of concerns on off into Libya but another one I have a smart question mark in a concern really why is Aaron Jones not getting the ball more forty one yardstick carries the last game averaging more than five yards a carry do you expect that if the Packers aren't so far behind moving forward maybe he'll get more touches\nYeah it's possible I think it also depends a lot on the health care and Roger then and what he's able to do coming out of the week we talked about right after the game on Monday he was little he seemed like he was ready and that he wanted to get out of the ... knee brace but\nIt's also it was not confirmed by his doctor he said he just really have that conversation\nThough I think it's going to depend on how Roger ... is is Aaron Jones and how\nHow many coaches we see him getting and that's like we said like that that's going to be a big question mark that they're going to have to address during the by week\nIs they're receiving corps going to be a rotation of Aaron John ...

great to have the opportunity here to be on your whole field and if you went to games here in the world series I mean anybody would have taken that at the beginning of the season\nI started to celebrate any home who said it rains centering around these things to come here and send the right\nHe's he's good at managing come here to our house or people are as far as I'm sure you'll have\nSaid wait Miley for all the is and how is it that he's been able to keep the Dodgers and other teams off balance what is working so well for you\nI mean he's ... he's going to be successful this year

sense\nI mean we've been very good very good he's ... these these series is more speech and stuff they their bodies are quite as to\nThis time to wake up about two they start making a lot of\nHunting or you you saw him in game to raise the Dodgers starter he's a lefty what does he bring to the table that you guys don't have to try and figure out\nHe's he's got come on do we got better very attuned to leaders I mean he throws the first in the second game then said he'd homers thing we we got a good movie just just because they felt it was the one\nReally good stuff man they're looking forward to the game tonight and hope are able to talk again tomorrow too in talking about a gay dad or share it with don't get the more\nLaws of the stuff makes it more freely to\nArgue that John it's many many of the brewers cats are in a there are crowds and the wind up tonight opinion certainly could\nBe one of those guys counted upon by supported his game cry council not shy about using his best\nHey Greg let me ask you something that manning can you remind me of out of the emotion of this team and interesting sequence a couple of days ago Manny ... tosses out a runner at second base I think it was the sixth seventh he comes up doubles to lead off the enemies celebrates this team seems to like each other and thrive off the emotion that they each show to each other\nA motion tonight's ballgame can you talk about the emotions surrounding this in the passion\nHe had kind of what it's all about no I there was the beginning of celebration at second pay but a base do a lot of boos from the Los Angeles Dodgers crowded bottles a little over the top maybe they were not moving their own guy made it would do enough to a different story for another time but you know it it's kind of what this team has been all season long and cry council allows it to these guys to be themselves but\nI'll tell you what if there's more celebrating going on at second base that's a good thing you you want all that to happen tonight my multiple occasions it will mean that the brewers are bringing some hip together and what does that runs across the plate [noise]\nA lot to talk a little bit about tonight Greg how is the energy how are you feel and I loved hearing him say it's loose the music pumped when we're ready to go [noise]\nYet feels like it did the one game too you know very similar in guys that I've seen of the clubhouse today and guys that I've talked to you wouldn't really think of it is anything different the end of a critical playoff game and they all are but I don't feel like pressure is mounting inside the clubhouse I don't think it feels that way to me\nIt feels like a great opportunity to get a playoff when on the whole field with one of the more consistent starters and the brewers rotation on them out in a healthy bullpen stack it altogether and there's reason to be confident\nCurtis Granderson I've been telling you this all the time I Need more Curtis Granderson what's the chance Curtis Granderson makes a contribution lightness ball game\nWell I I think it will be against the Dodgers bullpen pending health things that shape but certainly better a key option for the brewers off the bench\nGranted that the whole night to any of the last game you also had a couple of good fly ball deep the right to the wall the on the warning track or get a couple of games that theory so he's making good contact with the ball and not many guys are squaring the ball up here is on\nNot getting a stark tonight because of\nThe left the on the mound is part of the reason I think but also he's such a dangerous pinch hit it off and he had to make those they have they had a really thrive in that role not everybody does so for guys where he got the ball boy be great to get a couple of at bat but I'm sure a pinch hitting opportunity will be there for grad isn't tonight\nPragmatic at Miller Park thank you so much Greg news about your money Matthew tested with WGM day
