{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WTMJ", "content": "For the free market Journal Sentinel great author as well so he took it to a JC penny in the days when you could do this and he asked if they can bronze this burger\nPeople you know he's the baby shoes rounds used to see those all over the place and it's kind of gone by the wayside as well cost them a hundred and fifty bucks he mounted on a plaque\nAnd give it to his father market leader senior for Father's Day\nThe source of best friend that was present ever Well Mark neither senior still has that there's a great picture and make a story or he turns eighty three on Halloween this year and uh he's had that\nBrown's George ... Berger he's moved six time six times it's a nominate a shrine and as a a at a ... an apartment where he has a picture of his son holding that brands burger and then the actual brands burger itself is just melted on an award plaque\nAnd father and son the leaders were there at Tony stadium for victory ten eleven twelve that year Nineteen eighty seven\nAnd they sell their tickets does which is cool and uh so now all these years later we're doing it again George Web there's only thirty George ... left in the states only thirty of them\nAnd they're gonna be handing them out as I said to the six or they only get one but you can't get in line for one you can get a voucher for and there's a picture in the in the stories of\nOf the voucher as well um they talk to the uh the George webs vice president rice down we had a long talk about the at the franchise meeting about giving away these these burgers and um they didn't want to just\nMake people mad that they couldn't be there they couldn't get there between two and six so they they said you know what we still want everyone who wants to get one so we we want to limit the chaos so they're going to actually provide\nA these vouchers for these mines last time they did this hundred and Seventy thousand burgers given away\nThirty one years later\nWhen they have all those lines again probably and uh I Wonder how many folks are going to actually do this I didn't do it then I probably won't do it now but I Know it's it's popular and I saw one of my friends on Facebook and posted a picture of of one of the vouchers that she had gone and gotten\nThis restaurants in Milwaukee seeded Franklin Germantown Greenfield\n... to go walking shot while which also has been as a ton of thirty of them\nAnd it's one of those great traditions so as we're kind of doing over the last two games at Dodger Stadium where the brewers didn't get it done it's gonna be a way to kind of ramps up today for what could be an incredible weekend of playoff baseball at Miller Park\nAs we get sent to hopefully rewrites the world series history of this brewers franchise I was around in eighty two I was in college I remember that series very well\nThe chance was there unfortunately we didn't have our our great reliever hall of fame reliever rally fingers and and I think the costs that series in the world championship but uh we can begin to put those stories to bed if this brewers teams and get it done on friday and Saturday I Will be out at Miller Park\nNoon to three tomorrow kind of flipped on my show with just showing them just show will be a manned by Jerry later today and tomorrow will be filling in for Jeff\nSo I'm looking forward to that I read a lot of great brewers interviews a lot of fun to be had as we uh was we'd get set for game six brewers have as much as they are didn't get it done in the last two games in in Dodger Stadium they um they have their start starting pitching\nAll sets Miley and she's seen their uh their tremendous relieving relievers our sets hater enable\nJeffress they're ready to go I British arrested well rested and now it's in front of them as a great quote by Ryan Braun about uh if you ask the\nBeginning of the season to win two games go to the world series at Miller Park everybody with a sign that that pledge and that's what it that's really where we're at the Dodgers are beautiful\nBut don't forget we're up to one of his series at one point that that the two or three to mix\nFor World Series games is a tough thing and I think that actually hurt the brewers because you had a a late late night game in game five followed up by an early afternoon game in game six Dodgers time that uh that did not help are pitching staff and did not help our team and they and they looked a little tired of the day of rest\nHome field advantage Christian yellowish waiting a bust out it for the first time in the series are MVP I feel good about it you know wonder if they don't when\nThey got nobody else to blame but themselves All right after the break before a channel for biggest stories we see in across marking to stay in the world donors Scott Walker will join us at ten Fifteen that's\nAll next right here on WGM jak\nMoney was gone to an honest with you on this Thursday and we kind of\nBefore game six and althea [noise]\nGeorge webs only a few hours away from handing out those free burgers or those vouchers which is a good idea all those folks who can't get there two districts can still get their chance at a at a at that opportunity was just just a fun way to celebrate them and I think right winning streak\n'cause I tell you my mother in law saved her burger rappers from the last time\nI was thinking about that I told the screeners if you were in student wants to when I was sure that the guy had promised a burger last time the cost of a hundred and fifty bucks why why do you do that [laughter] you get to his dad who lived in Iowa as a as a Father's Day president that's excellent 'cause his dad and him had gone to the games ten eleven twelve of that street in\nThem that call someone who is going to give their burger bronze this time around\nI don't know but one of the ... that's fantastic idea so\nI don't know who's doing browsing anymore but that was in that case it was JC penny I'm guessing probably not any more because you also have to remember browsing ... baby shoes oh yeah yeah that was his name right everybody going house everybody had him that's not a thing anymore but it kind of shows you the difference in generations but that was the thing for brewers fan some of those folks bronze their burgers\nNow is your take pictures of ourselves eating the burger and then we posted very ruined\nThem we take a selfie with our burger solve all the folks are of course ten o'clock hours before our town the four biggest stories as we sit across from Washington state in the world joining us we're number two as Governor Scott Walker that's coming up uh ten Fifteen number one of course is the brewers\nAre a couple of tough games at Dodger Stadium at Chavez Ravine but uh you know what this team of surprised us all year long they're ready for the challenge to games at Miller Park hopefully starting tomorrow\nRyan Braun is confident\nEvery single person in this organization would be thrilled at the beginning of the year if you said you're gonna have to winter games at home during the world series or what have you know the guys that are going to best starting 'cause there's all year I'm ready to go for us for fully rested bull fan\nAll right you got to win both\nYou know what Ryan Braun obviously have the controversy with all the things with a with the er the steroids and all that stuff but he's a guy that gets\nI think he gets the experience as a player who knows what it takes and frankly look his performance in the end all cs is actually hit pretty well so he's a guy that's delivering it at that moment when star should shine I Hope the rest of the team gets that message and I I agree with them\nYou know what you have to do it right there at home you're home ballpark you played well they win almost two to one at home we used to have during the season when they play a Miller Park\nJust focus on tomorrow night when tomorrow night and then all bets are off and you begin to have it in the game so\nYou think wait Mali's tired from his parents [laughter] isn't that crazy wondering how people would react to that if baseball purists would be bothered by apparently some are I could care less because what difference does it make\nYou know what why do you care why do people care about their most of the brilliant maneuver Kelly I'm actually surprised it's ever been done before has it and I mean everyone's on before yet or not\nBut here's the thing I think all of us even though we're biases brewers fan as credit counselors done it a masterful job with his pitching staff in the series and in the season right [noise] it didn't work out for for him so well yesterday I mean what if it was outstanding but after that not some you know what\nYou gotta blame the hitters it's you've got a score runner to ... ... it can only be counseled playing chess the whole time you have to be able to hit the ball\nWhat about my premise of the two or three to set up all of this and I'll see if actually hurt hurt the brewers they're going three games in in LA I Know what I hear\nThat all the time every year I hear that oh two or three do not fair I don't know I think I mean you have two games at home now you you finished the series at home or else would you want to be\nThe bottom line is supposed to weigh in your home playoff games this is these are two home playoff games hopefully starting tomorrow Miller Park you know you could do I think in hockey they do to to one one one yeah it's a lot of travel though yeah especially talking about mid west west coast but do they do it yeah I I suppose it is rough\nEspecially that was the worst part was Thirteen any game early afternoon game the next day right that was a killer for the brewers and boy there ... seem like they were tired of whether or not the players were tired\nAnd looked at me started on certain times are good [laughter]\nAll right that was one of our for I'd send the four biggest stories as we see the cross Milwaukee to stay in the world coming up next Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker joins us live right here in the ...\nSix years with you I must Thursday we're now joined by Wisconsin outstanding governor Governor Scott Walker good morning hey good morning great to be with you\nIt was Thursday we're now joined by which sounds outstanding Governor Scott Walker in the morning hey good morning great to be ... thanks man\nSo I'm going to ask you before it gets into politics just brewers thing isn't as somebody who's running for office running for reelection does that get in a way or do you does it kind of add to the experience when you talk to other folks on what's going on I saw\nBut I always say that the voters [noise]\nLook at what someone has done in the current job Governor Walker lowered the tax burden law unemployment's there's more jobs available in our people to fill them\nChild tax credits sales tax holiday\nTony Evers mixed results as best as superintendent of the public schools in Wisconsin to me it's easy choice but I understand people disagree on those things real quick number three of our for our town I said this yesterday to the folks in Charlotte too that superintendents Brian Davis\nYou have messed up better on this story from the moments you decided to do that play all the things that you ended up doing all the conversations you had you could have resolve these things well in advance\nAnd the this honesty in this disingenuous way you're dealing with is when you've had other controversial plays this one is different though because I had the N. word in it\nAnd all this talk about the the uh\nThe feelings of your students yeah that's part of your job description but you're part of your job description of it is also make smart decisions\nAnd whether it was you whether it was your principal whether it was your drama director you all screw this up you could have had these meetings you got these meetings outside of the of the production of this play to kill a mocking bird and the and I'm going to go back to this before I handed off to Eric\nYou missed a teaching opportunity but it suggests that some of you maybe all of you have never read the book that the place based on\nIt talks about racism and segregation exposes it\nTells you why those things were wrong then as they are now you missed an opportunity here you embarrassed yourself with your back and forth decision making foolishness\nI don't know how you come back for something like that and all these other things you talked about your press conference yesterday none of that has anything to do it to kill a Mockingbird it's things that you wanted to do you could have done years ago\nThat summer three of our for attend the four biggest stories as we see it across Milwaukee to stay in the world coming up next the latest on the show your parents to the reporter for the Washington Post who uh is presumed that we get the latest on that story\nFive years ago the media is north of trials abortion doctor ... one of the authors of the book which by a draft of this story\nToday as twelve thirty five jury filling in for Jeff Wagner today noon the three tomorrow Jerry will be in my shift eight thirty five to noon\nAs I broadcast live from Miller Park new industries looking forward to that we talk a lot of brewers to Maryland interviews like we did last week as the brewers get set for game six brewers Dodgers\nLive from Miller Park and you can hear all of that right here on WGM Jay program note\nIf you missed our W TMZ cares piece this morning it's now in a pod cast page a great story that Eric did with survivors of nine eleven fantastic piece by her goes down and a part of our WGM cares raised a beam projects\nIf you can help us out please do so it's a great project can kiosk them but it's really an area wide project a kind of connecting our past history\nWith those of us who are younger and ... and those of us who have maybe not even remember much about nine eleven anymore so great\nProject in our community so you can check it out on our podcast page will have the Governor Walker interview as well up on the pod cast a page this afternoon so thanks to Governor Walker for joining us today live well wrap up the fourth time with this one Eric it's it's the strange\nCase of Saudi journalist ... disappeared supposedly potentially murder now seem more likely you stand bowl a office\nInvestigation is taking place in Turkey everyone is now awaiting secretary of state Mike Pompeo made a trip to the middle east this week he met with the president this morning to discuss his visit\nIn his meetings with Saudi and Turkish officials concerning the disappearance of your mouth and she'll be of course with the Washington Post columnist there he says he wants to give Saudis a few more days to look into this investigation by\nWe've made clear to them that we take this matter with respect to Mr show you very seriously\nSo for now Pompeo suggesting let's take a few more\nDays old president from the warnings that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that so that we too have a complete understanding of the facts surrounding back which point we can make decisions about how the United states should respond so\nHere's the thing how do you respond because they are an ally and important\nWhile they're an important strategic alliance of the United states but we need to be mindful of that as well\nAnd some would say that Saudi Arabia is now moving toward a little bit more of a westernized feel to it so you don't want to disrupt what has become a growing relationship in some aspects with the U.S and\nI mean they've even reached out to Israel in some aspects of peace and all that so you you don't necessarily want to disrupt all that so what do you do when it really it looks like Saudi was involved\nIn such a nightmare scenario for President Trump says Middle East policy on closer relations with Saudi Arabia and that young crown prince and so now he's trying to walk a fine line between preserving that relationship and sailing up with American leadership against in a parrot act of Savage murder\nI mean as international relations go this is probably as complex as a gas you know we don't know exactly the details yet about Mike Pompeo was on the ground in several countries trying to assess what happened for the president's\nIt's it has to be a wait and see a you mentioned the fact that Saudi Arabia has seemed to suggest that they are more open to a westernized sort of a sudden a government that's not the case for the crown prince\nHe's a dictator and he acts like a dictator he doesn't put up with any nonsense and there's a lot of folks in the intelligence community who think he's the guy that directed is now he'll never admit to that of course like a lot of dictators they do things that never get the light of day signed on them the president is faced with the challenge here\nYou have a great relationship with a country we need that ally in the middle east\nYou can't blow it up it's going to it's going to require great sophistication or some some gentle a nudging I'm an ally but at the same time holding people responsible\nFor the president to this points to years almost two years into his presidency has not been a president that suggests that would play during his strengths and I'm being nice about them\nThis is going to be a tough one now we still have to wait and see what the actual details are but all signs point to the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal 'cause she'll get into the president this might be the toughest\nCase he's had to solve in international relations since he took office so that's number for about four at San after the break\nAnybody trust Facebook anymore well they're they're getting ready to deal with the next election next big election mid term elections in the United states anybody trust these guys to kind of figure that out and bring that story next right here to be changing\nPolicies are right around the W. changes back was annual holiday radio show WGN papers on the night before Christmas starting Gina Miller shame matinee or Jeff Wagner\nIn a sleigh full of Wisconsin celebrities from target hall in downtown Milwaukee and Monday November twenty six at six thirty the live radio play ... will be recorded in front of a studio audience and you can be a part of it by tickets now go to W. TMZ dot com or text or Christmas to Fort won four seven nine nine one six twenty\nYou want to be there it is a blast as there are a lot of surprise guess I was in ... I was part of it last year as a newbie here it's every team Jay ... is a lot of fun so join us I've turned her hall\nOr for the folks who can't make it also be rebroadcast right here in the tea um Jerry throughout the holidays so kind of a fun way to uh listen to our annual tribute to Christmas and the holidays\nAlright Facebook I've talked about this subject before but um as as the midterm elections get closer and what are we remember about twenty six teams Facebook was accused\nOf participating in a scheme by people that work in the United states of a priority as opposed to try to influence our election and twenty sixteen her presidential election now see\nOh it was to try to influence our election and twenty sixteen her presidential election\nNow\nCEO of Facebook the creator of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg at the times that it was crazy but as we know that story develops to the point where they now know we now know that thousands of ads\nPromoting false storylines force false information replaced by Russian agents suckered eventually Saturday that he would make it his personal challenge to fix them\nWell one of the ways they've approached that is with something called their war room it's been one piece of this big ongoing project to kind of fix this issue\nAnd it uses a lot of the artificial intelligence systems are facing Facebook has been using to help identify what's authentic and what's actual user behavior\nAnd then they they use this war room and they'd give other people look at this thing as we approach November six\nTheir director elections and civic engagement and I said there is no substitute for physical real world interaction the primary thing that I've learned is just how effective it is that people in the same room altogether so they're going to look at the activity on their platform as it leads up to November six\nAre we getting too old\nWhere's the younger candidates while I think we'll see some of that in this current election but running for office as a young person is not the same thing as surviving the election gauntlet to be the candidate as we've traditionally seen maybe with the exception of Brock Obama\nIt's an old person game seven thirty five should age factor into that decision making process for Democrats\nIt's got a lot to do is what happens in the lead up to twenty twenty because Joe Biden as we've seen in some of these polls that have come out in a leading candidate to be that nominee so that's an eleven thirty five but I start with this I mentioned before the news I haven't talked about the Mueller investigation in a while\nAnd as we know we're now a year and a half roughly into this investigation millions of dollars looking at two things one was a clear evidence of collusion between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign and see whether the president's\nObstructed any effort to look at those um intrusions\nRobert Mueller from all accounts is looking to wrap this up at the end of the year nothing before the election and that's not uncommon typically are agencies like the FBI special counsels don't do anything to impact national elections and I think that's going to be the case here\nBut my question for you is really a simple one\nWhy do you think mother's gonna find so far we've had indictments on a number of individuals Russian agents who are frankly never going to see a prison so when you're not going to get him back to the United states for trial too\nThey might not going to be used have used the correct identities but for the Michael Flynn's that George Papadopoulos is Paul Manafort's others it's really been about financial misdeeds\nThe fact that they were doing things off of the well before the Trump campaign even got underway that have now gotten them into serious trouble in the case of Paul Manafort potentially serving many many years in prison\nBut really when you look at the ... that's not what he was brought in for it was about collusion and whether or not there was an attempt by foreign agents interfere in our elections and so far\nThat hasn't been the case at least as far as the findings and the information has come out so far\n\nFrom the forum on for one of the tax there's ways that only one is for the investigation country fair and fact based conclusion and for all Americans to respect the process and the findings obviously we should hope there was no collusion but it's hard to speculate and you know there's been indictments and some of those include the administration and Russians we need to know the truth\nThat's probably one of the most level headed common sense approaches to this thing that I could read or hear\nI don't care what part of you\nAre who you ally yourself with\n\nIf you really care about the future of the country you want to make sure that they are processes our elections are protected\n\nNow sitting here today there's been nothing publicly release that indicates to me that the president has anything to worry about that doesn't mean that Robert Mueller won't find something\n\nAs these indictments have come forward and these guilty pleas there are many figures tied directly to the Trump campaign including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort\nBut doesn't go to the desk of the president does it do that how does it\nReached that high so far it doesn't seem like it for one for seven nine nine one six point of the accident mortgage talk and talk to them as we head toward the end of twenty eight seen what do you think Mahler is going to come up with and do you think any of this\nTouches the president's as I've said so far it doesn't seem like it\nAnd the president has Saturn and many times called it a witch hunt or worse\nBut to this point at least the public information as released does not point to obstruction of justice justice or collusion by the president's\nFor one for seven nine I went to one of the acting it markets talking text line where do you think mother goes if he wraps it up by December does he connect the dots of the president or doesn't he that's the question right here in W. TMZ let\nThis is sort of is not a bad day in a in Wisconsin for October [noise]\nJordan was telling me Bruce Jordan was telling me how how quickly this month is going by were already halfway more than halfway home don't forget like Seventy days the Christmas that we're we're we're coming up\n[laughter] we're coming up fast and furious on the holidays so uh I'm actually at the time that when I'm Talking about because there's been a lot of indications\nThat Robert Mueller will wrap up his investigation into collusion a fraction of justice before the holidays one of the factors asked me about why I said that um he wouldn't do anything before the elections I'm the one of the reasons that the case is the Justice Department guidelines say prosecutors should avoid any\nUh disclosures any major um announcements close to an election because they don't want to be seen as influencing the elections so that's why I said that and and that has been the case I was like comedies decision to release information about Hillary Clinton's email server investigation was so controversial some people not me thinking costs or the election\nSo with roughly three plus weeks to the election the term elections and you know as I said\nTwo and a half less than two months of the end of the year\nRobert Mueller is gonna either public or released his findings less likely or release them two deputy AG ride Rosenstein because of course attorney general Jeff Sessions excused himself a recused himself rather from this investigation\n\nThat's the two choices now what happens is that the information of course depends on what's in their findings given the gravity of what we're talking about collusion obstruction\nI wouldn't be surprised if there is not some sort of a public pronouncements and that could go a couple of different ways as well no this president did not colluded with Russia you know this president didn't obstruct justice in the investigation into into that collusion\n\nOr yes to both of those questions\nAnd then we have a much bigger story of course and then ... the year and a half of investigation leads to\nAt least a year and a half of the fallout from those findings if there are yes\nIndications are yes or declarations in the in that investigation from the two six to I Believe what they will find as the Clintons were the people that the main dealings with Russia I'm not confident you will hear this through the media but in this case I Believe Hillary was doing everything she could win her people were not able to get it done\nDo I believe Trump communicated somewhat with Russian counterparts yes but nothing criminal like they're suggesting\nImagine what the tab will be for this investigation what a waste of money that's from Chris from the two six to\nIt's not an insignificant amount of money we're talking about I think at least twenty million dollars at the last economy\nLots of money invested in this investigation now for the government they gotta diamonds for a lot of different things wire fraud money laundering blind to the FBI they seize assets I think just from Paul Manafort those assets probably cover half the town\nWas that fruitful I guess but that's not what Robert Mali was tested investigate and in fact the end of this which I think it's a it's a pretty likely ... has a pretty high probability of\nAnd in fact the end of this which I think it's a\nIt's a pretty likely ... has a pretty high probability of being the case he doesn't find collusion or a structure of justice a lot of Americans are going to go\nAnd say to themselves or others what was the point of is the Manafort's the Flynn's Papadopoulos is that information\nCould have been glean outside of an investigation and the president and his conduct and his campaign's conduct\nAnd the day\nThe search the character of this president with an investigation that found nothing and this is almost a cliche because I'm selling so many times but the only person that really knows this is Robert Mueller\nAll accounts wrapping this investigation up as we head to the new year frankly that's a good thing because if it finds as I think it will that there was no collusion we need to move on business frankly taken up too much airtime too much of the oxygen in the room\nBased on really I think in most cases Democrats wanting something to be their their inability to get over the twenty sixteen presidential election\n\nWhat does our occasional guest on the program Dennis Miller comedian say I don't think the Democrats are really gotten over that twenty six election not handling it very well well they are not look to California for an example of that out of their mind about this president\nOut of their mind in what they're doing\nTo try to bring this president down including the latest fiasco the cabinet nomination wherever won states\nMerely\nActing exclusively to try to take down a president based on what they saw happening twenty sixteen is that the illusion I Know you can call it that is it the arrangement trumped arrangement syndrome I guess but what really is\nIs Eric ...\nIs there an age that's too old to be president is it's Seventy five isn't Seventy eight is it eighty Susan eighty five we've had senators go well into their eighties including some who have gone into their nineties\nIs there's some cognitive drop off lack of a mental acuity that says you probably shouldn't be president nine states that advanced age now where\nWe're we're creeping up are pushing up that number and as I said the president is no Seventy two\nBut Joe Biden will be Seventy seven five more years and that's just the start of the campaign season by the time he would take office you'd be Seventy eight\nThis is relevant because the other reason when they did a straw poll of the Democratic candidates for president twenty twenty he won by far the get thirty three percent of the votes amongst all those candidates\nFor the Democratic nomination thirty two percent the rest of them really made double digits\nNow I Know there's a lot of young people want to listen to the shoulder to want nothing to do a job I think he's old fashioned use out of touch\nAnd as as the voting population we said what they tell us is getting younger and they're still yet to be proven and we'll see I guess to some extent in the mid term elections if that's true or not\nWe told that we're told that they're energized ramped up enthusiastic about voting for new styles of candidates is Joe Biden around like in the past not met job I\nHad a one on one conversation with him smart guy experienced guy we disagree on most things he let me participate once in a ah a forum with him and that was the only Republican on the panel he he he ... he made a lot of fun about that\nHad a lot of fun about that are interesting is the only Republican on the panel but he was a guy that he is very uh what's the word congenial\nVery down to earth but does he too old to be president for one for seven nine nine wants to one of the more he's talking text line what do you think too old and we get into a situation now where it's too many old people none of young people running for office\nOr is that experience the wisdom that comes with age\nIs that why we're seeing this trend seems to be wrapping up in the other direction more on that next right here let me see I'm sure\nTo the state assembly while drunk series ... percent white and he has a new information on that story today as well\nTen a program note tomorrow jury and I will slip spots the jury will be doing my show in the morning I'll be out at Miller Park\nFor that lead up to game six of the ... else yes I cannot wait Santa blasts out there last friday we'll do it again and got some great interviews lined up\nTalking brewer's we just some of that early on the show today or as we get ready for game six ... they know what they have to do not like the wind to games and Miller Park to go to the world series to rewrite the story of Nineteen eighty two in a different direction all these years later\nShut out to those folks that George Web are going to be are lining up actually going to wind up now because he can just get their hamburgers you can get vouchers and they all have to wait in line anymore but a ... and let's let's give George Web credit for that\nThat's a cool thing I notice a lot of free marketing and nobody does anything for free anymore but the fact that they on or something they're going to say that they they promise is a is a good thing so credit to close to George Lebanese there's thirty locations now in the state of Wisconsin I'm guessing\nThey're going to be pretty busy today I'm gonna actually go to George Web not for the voucher not for the\nHamburger I'm gonna get some chicken soup\nI Hope to have chicken soup to one by the airport has chicken soup I'll be on my way shortly All right before the break we're talking about how old is too old to be president let's go to Dan and find a lack of your on WGM say good morning Dan\nHey there thanks for taking my call Steve yep\nSay I'm what I Wanna that Saturday a list and I'm fifty years old and after I get done and doing a bunch of things throughout the day or the week I did pretty good afternoon I'm tired mhm I Can't imagine being Seventy five years old and puff and train them than running the whole show of the country\n[laughter] it does seem like it would be a daunting task\nOf course and uh you know I ... you know I Can't understand why you would wanna throw that at yourself daily day and then they don't\nWell political ambition is is a is a pretty strong things well let me let me approach it with you this way so should there be an age cut off which and how would you enforce that\nOh I Can't really do that right now I mean there is no time or a age praying that you should dictate to whoever wants at the mouth but\nI Believe that the people just don't have the ability to hold that sustain themselves at that age\nYou're still young guys safety I'm I'm sixty and I and I I I I'm more on the line of I feel everything that I Do like a day or two later but I Can't even imagine the mental acuity you have to have her position like Dan thanks for the call or let's go to Tony in walk a show you're on the team jacket morning Tony\nThank you I\nTotally hate crime here playing a ... fine\nNo heat and the mountain well they have the time that\nI just I'm an owner can take that how you look at how they react on a trail or ... ... president when

it always spells out\nThings we get to do is as part of our ah WGN as a family so if you can stop by that night's loved to have the out there's always find it always cells out and it's one of those great holiday to the ... uh traditions right here from WGM say All right we're going to stay on our brewers team after the news\nSo a couple of topics I Want to go into one\nMany Machado find yesterday by MLD they they're saying it's about a ten thousand dollar find is that enough\nOr some great commentary from some of the ... will be folks that said the other commentators on the merits of the some of his conduct his actions his words may cost him some free agent dollars we'll see if that's the case 'cause it's still going to send a big a big contract\nAnd I'm also going to ask you the question what do you think and the brewers when two at Miller Park and go to the world series here we are two games to win for a chance to go to the world series can they do it\nI Know the fans are going to show up\nIt's been an interesting series so far some of the stars from the regular season haven't had the best and they'll cs Christian yellowish very disappointing as a place where he wake up at Miller Park\nThe love averages would say yes\nMeans a great hitter at a great season envy piece season I think he's a guy that uh I expect big things from at Miller Park this weekend he says hey you are\nHasn't had a great series is as well original can hit or miss but there's a lot of upside potential for this this home series and it's it's a do or die when two games or go home and spend the rest of the time thinking about what might have been so it's just been an interesting series throughout\nJust worried about friday just waiting friday than all bets are off yeah 'cause there's no Saturday if you don't win friday right mhm yeah just when friday don't worry about Saturday at just get the games than it was it good news is they have Miley and stuff just seem\nSo they have their best to picture starting pitchers well rested their bullpen is restaurant haters ready to go if they can hit the ball and Miller Park has been a friendly environment for that a scenario that can get it done but uh there's a lot at stake of course two games to get to the world series I liked the fact that it's that clear cut\nThere's no a second chance as you got one or two games then you go to the world series and humbled how cool would that be so we spent some time and all that brewer stuff in the next hour just kinda dissecting all these different angles on the series the season in a quest to revisit the world series\nFor the first time since Nineteen eighty two that's all coming up after the news right here on WGM Jay\nMorning Wisconsin's ... with you on this Thursday [noise] so here we are [noise] ...\nSee I have to win two games so less power and it's not some time and a lot of different aspects of this uh the series some some things that just bother me about a baseball um\nWe're gonna start done and child to the folks on Facebook dot com you can you can you can find us basically dot com slash six twenty WGM Jay can questions comments you're going to have those there I'll Try to get to those as I can also text us are calling for one for seven nine nine one six one is the second mortgage talking sex line\nSo a couple of things many Machado find ten thousand dollars for running in the first baseman have sous at you know our game for the CS it seems like hey Seuss amendment shadow of gotten over it because you always have some really strong pointed comments I guess I asked the question\nYeah thanks for the call Steven here's the deal about many Machado he's all about many Machado yeah he's playing for one of the best teams in baseball is not going to be playing for their team next year probably\nSo there's no loyalty there\nThere's no respect for your opponent I Know some folks don't think that's a big deal any more of a ... but when you drop sportsmanship respect for your opponent doing it the right way which it seems to be standards that have just been crumbling whether you're talking about sports politics or whatever\nI guess you get what you get with these people acting like lunatics on a baseball field isn't that much different than a lunatic in real life with politics or anything else let's take one more before we go to break Rick from Lake Geneva you end up ...\nHey Steve I agree with states that prior last call a chow she'd get shot out as loving baseball it then played three strikes and you're out he had three strikes or in fitness as we're walking brewers players and that theory\nThat uh the uh officials ah ah the heads of a fake like baseball they should have noticed all there and said hey you're out you're out you're suspended for the rest of the season or something like that I\nI I don't think they would do that given the gravity of the series the weight of this the fact that the Dodgers are trying to go back to the world series and thanks for the call rich\nBut what I Do think it's going to happen if he does anything else in game six or hopefully game seven he's gonna gets tossed out I Would be shocked if that didn't happen because you cannot try to injure your opponents\nWhether it's sliding into second base whether it's ... trying to take the legs out from under these was a new law at first base that can't happen All right we'll take more calls intact next manual channel what should happen to this guy is he a dirty player more on that story right here in the ... democratic\nLeaders as we can do state representative veil quaint got other addressing the state assembly while drunk Jerry ... Wagner he has a new information on that story today at twelve ten ...\nWe're talking many Machado I have a little bit of a quotes I was reading the story about it's\nA um one of the reporters yesterday I asked him about this a discipline from the major league baseball the ten thousand dollar sign this is what he said I'm not talking about that I'm trying to play baseball when asked me a baseball question we'll talk about interesting he doesn't want to talk about it if it's your actions\nYour conduct on the field you're gonna do it on its\nYou what you should have said if you believe it was there was nothing wrong there it was a baseball play I did I did when I was supposed to do he couldn't even owned his own actions and it's kind of how what kind of a person many Machado was let's go to Mike calling from west Chester Illinois good morning Mike\n[noise] [noise] yeah they say like ... I think this way too much\nAll right [laughter] do you think he's a dirty player how do we lose we lose Mike\nAll right we lost life well my son will be talking about it too much you know what I disagree with the reason I wanted to talk about it is because I think\nWe're getting to a point in this country where people including athletes don't know how to conduct themselves anymore sportsmanship out the window conduct on the field out the window\nEntitlements\nYeah he's a great baseball player one of the best in the major league baseball does that mean he doesn't have to follow the rules that that means you can try to injure other players as part of the game I don't think so let's go to David in Dallas ill during WTO ... morning David\nGood morning said thanks for taking my call what do you think they are weighing in on man like Todd oh you're very poor behavior on it but I think it goes a little bit beyond that I've been watching the\nGames and ah the doctor or as a whole have been very core in terms of their conduct after striking out or after a while you know flooding around get by ... we've seen a picture for all over the\nCandy and drop down on the floor and [laughter] they don't like being\nBroken back on their way back to the dugout and quite honestly it's not a very ... like who are concerned I'm\nVery proud of the grower in no way to conduct themselves they get struck out in the papers are loaded they walked back in the dugout and and that they're they conduct themselves in a professional manner and the pathway that we can take care of them are cattle\nAnd I'm a St Louis I mean I uh well ... is the fact that he won an online game league for half their thing and like comic take care of those guys\nIt's unfortunate when you've got young children that are watching this game all excited about it and then you see that type of behavior is going on a on national TV it's a disgrace to the doctors\nAnd I think for the call David I I Will agree with you on one thing I don't I don't I'm not going to call it the other players and the Dodgers there comes a highly competitive I think that's just the way the\nUh most athletes deal with that stuff but there is a distinct difference between bats and what many Machado doing he's trying to injure other players through his conduct on the field and if you don't think that's the case look at the plays again\nOf the touches a challenge Disney's Chinese replay or are you serious like every time I picture brushing the batter back\nIt's not the same thing\nAs part of baseball the things that many ... was doing I don't think are part of baseball let's give a joy from Milwaukee we got about thirty seconds generally what do you think\nJoy from Milwaukee going once\nAll right no calls enjoy so let's just concluded with is the\nBrewers can do it on the field Saturday hopefully a friday hopefully Saturday as well that'll shut up many Machado\nMaybe the fans\nThe Saturday hopefully a friday hopefully Saturday as well that'll shut up many Machado\nMaybe the fans of give them a the the kind of cheers I'd say that facetiously that he deserves for his conduct that'll be part of the great atmosphere that is Miller Park\nIf you don't think this is is this is a combination of the season at least as far as trying to get to the world series this weekend is it so much at stake do or die games with a great Markey as the caller set a classy Milwaukee team that does it the right way fun stuff\nWe aren't the cubs we aren't the Dodgers were the Milwaukee Brewers so let's let's get a couple of weeks after the break after the news are going to go to ... bill says W teams that cares initiatives raise the beam\nWhen\nFive pretty with you on this Thursday to for the last a couple of weeks we've been\nIn highlighting ...
