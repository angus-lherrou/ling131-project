{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WTMJ", "content": "One shoe catching the Dennis ... there has been a problem here nobody in their right mind\nPays it no nobody does unless you are at the state of Wisconsin where they're from the perspective of the employee he calls it out to his supervisors and his supervisors while they talk about if they go back and forth and then decides oh it's too much trouble\nIt's just too much trouble to try to deal with this and we've got these beds and nobody caught this before is that just go ahead and give 'em the extra four hundred and four thousand dollars it's absolutely crazy but again\nAnd I would say this to anyone who's talking about a gas tax or any increase\nIncreased taxation on the roadways\nBefore you do that let's look at things like this and let's figure out how much waste there is\nAnd how much mismanagement and here's four hundred and four thousand dollars a example case example number one and credit to the journal sentinel for finding that she can see this Jay is on line it's one fifty nine a lot of stuff coming up in the next hour the program the Kimberley Clark deadline is getting ready to pass\nI'll tell you about that just a minute stick around [laughter]\n... food if you follow what with Melissa was talking about for the brewers representative is how they're trying to keep for playoff tickets in the hands of brewers fan [noise]\nIt it's actually it's it's sort of it's sort of a genius and in fact I saw this coming here here's the deal [noise]\nAgain I I have a partial season ticket for twenty games so early September I get an email from my contact with the brewers [noise]\nAnd they say okay well here's here's the deal you can you you can you can buy playoff tickets in advance and he's you know there's different plans that you can do and my my friend and I we decided we're going to release some tickets for next year we've had a great time\nSo we knew the season tickets and then what we did is we signed up for we we could purchase two tickets to the all the different potential playoff games and you have the same seat for for all of them\nAnd this was back in early September they told us what the seat was going to be and they also gave me the option of either having the eat chicken thing or actually\nGetting physical tickets are just as an and I said okay well I I kinda liked it I I like the tickets I had just doing a little bit old school as a matter of fact they came yesterday yesterday two days ago besides they got all the tickets so in advance and what they do is you can be a credit card and they charge you a down payment and further to get in the playoffs more they charge\nWell All right my my buddy um and I we had a couple\nOf other people that wanted perhaps to go if there's a wild card game on Tuesday and so\nYou can buy individual if you're a season ticket holder you can buy more than the two that we automatically got and they had a special pre sail for the season ticket holders and it was it was like Monday morning and you you had to have you had to have your account number and things like that but if you did that\nYou could not\nOrder hard copies of the tickets and you couldn't order eat tickets either what would do is you sign up and then what would happen what happens is the day of the game they send you the bar codes onto your cell phone\nNow this doesn't make it impossible and then you need your cell phone to go to get into the game now it doesn't make it impossible for example if you're a brewers fan\nToo to sell the tickets to say a cubs fan or something like that it's not impossible but it's really really difficult because you have to wait until you get\nThat that bar code since you on the day of the game and then you suddenly have to transfer it now I mean I guess there's there's ways you could get around that you could probably still ... but it it makes it a lot more difficult than I actually applied the brewers for that for me I I part of near there I think trying to\nMake sure that it's the true fans they're not just the people that are trying to flip the tickets in order to make a few bucks so I gave him a little bit of credit there and\nI mean hopefully and I'm telling you at this point in time after being out of the playoffs for the last six or seven years you know if you've got a chance to go to the wild card game or go to the division series or whatever and you're thinking about selling your tickets\nShame on you All right\nNow in the last segment of the program we talk about\nHow the department of transportation knowingly unintentionally allowed itself to be overbuilt four hundred plus a thousand dollars for materials that they knew were not deliver and I think the general concept was how can you not ask for that money back or how can you go ahead and pay it\nRight here here's a story this kind of the flip side of it now that there's no question that the Milwaukee County pension system\nIs an absolute and total mess it goes back to all the problems with that as a whole pension scandal back in two thousand one and two thousand two and it's been well documented than the truth is\nFinancial aid because of the ramifications in the fall out of the pension scandal in Milwaukee County is going to be behind the financial eight ball for a long time to come All right so here here's the deal and I want to get your reaction as to what you think\nShould happen two thousand\nTwelve is a forty nine year old Milwaukee county sheriff's deputy who die he's um on duty in to be a cool crash on high forty three he leaves behind him a wife\nAnd five children so he dies in the line of duty now\nHe'd worked for the county for a number of years so he was entitled to a pension on top of that he apparently was also entitled to a worker's compensation death benefit\nThe the death benefit from workers' compensation and he's got the pension now the way it works and this is not unusual I guess [laughter]\nBut with the county is supposed to do\nIs the one offsets the the other one in other words that the the death benefit is supposed to go and be used to satisfy the pension obligations that's that's not an unusual type of thing you're not supposed to be able to collect both\nYou can only collect like one at a time\nBut the county screws up and doesn't doesn't count that\nSo they're supposed to reduce the pension payment by\nThe amount of the death benefit right but they don't catch it so they incorrect fully\nPaid the workers' compensation death benefit and the pension at the same time so they're they're making the wrong payment to the widow and five children the widow doesn't know this is the wrong paint the widow just she didn't get the money she assumes that this is correct that county\nFinds out about this and then makes the decision at least initially the former pension chief nose of the error but\nFails to correct it so for several years the widow continues to collect both when she should only be collecting one\nWell because this goes on so long it adds up to a boatload of money turns out that the widow has now been overpaid like a hundred and forty grant\nThat that she shouldn't have gotten on top of that there is also about twenty three thousand dollars in interest payments on the money that she was overpaid but she's done nothing wrong she she'd done absolutely nothing wrong other than collect the checks the ... center where the county's found out about this mistake\nAnd the county has now correct to dumb mistake so moving forward she's not getting both paints\nBut there's still the matter of the hundred and forty thousand dollars that she got over a period of several years that she wasn't titled to 'em but through no fault of her own it's not like she submitted fought false paperwork or anything it was the county that screwed up\nAnd continued to make payments to the widow even after they knew that they hit screwed up so here's the story earlier this week the pension board\nHas decided that it's going after the widow her name is Janet ailment and they decided that this money that she was incorrectly over paid a hundred and forty grand they want that\nAnd they also want twenty three thousand dollars in interest because of\nThe counties era so they made the error they want the money back and then they want interest on the money that they incorrectly paid um\nThe widow she says well it it shouldn't happen but I base my life and I've made investments on what they told me\nThe director of retirement plan services says well you know we need to protect our pension system rolling eyes and give everyone benefits they're entitled to and it's difficult when retirees and their family members are caught in the effects from previous errors alright\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty as the ac unit mortgage trucking tech slide the widow and the ... pi surviving children did absolutely nothing wrong that county screwed up\nAnd knowing that it it made a mistake\nThe former pension office continued to shell out this money year after year after year\nNow the the widow so she'd gotten admittedly a hundred and forty thousand dollars over several year period that she should not have gotten but it wasn't her fault\nThat this this wasn't like going to an ATM and trying to withdraw the hundred bucks and that gives you ten thousand dollars this was hey you know this is what they told her she was entitled to this is what she's gotten they want the money back and they want interest\nIn the market but it made their marks on the national stage and um it has just been my great honor to work with a timeline Meyer over the last several years and this is a well deserved award I Know a couple of people from station route and buffalo last night and I just I didn't want I didn't want this week than without acknowledging that and\nI'm just a a wonderful a wonderful guy and they don't know where the future's going to take time but he's he's he's he's just the best just absolutely the best okay that's number one number two they said it wouldn't last to have to do the shout out I talk a lot about my wife's friend who has just been that the the joy\nOf my life and I'm a wedding anniversary is tomorrow when your wedding anniversary so\nRude to keep this in mind you know when you're doing your radio shows or whatever or helping other people in the future always remind them to acknowledge the special people in their life and wedding anniversaries or important so our one year anniversary is coming up tomorrow in boy\nTime just certainly flies but to act did not want it to pass without acknowledging that I Know I talk a lot about fan that's because short and part of my

don't other boys are coming up for like\nFor you it's it's a personal a recollection of what happened to you at that time so many years ago\nI have a record\n... for you that it brings back those memories of what happened so sharply some although you said a long time ago\nDecades\nYeah thanks for the call Debbie appreciate ... is there an update Eric\nYeah there's a Senate Judiciary committee taking place we ain't going to ABC News now they have scheduled to vote on Kavanaugh for twelve thirty in several Democrats walked out of the ruins upset with the ...\nVersion of the facts there's simply no reason to do and I joined the families aren't Grassley said on the Supreme Court on the basis of evidence presented to us I re often\nNation was made by the Democrats who say you know mark judge ... the man that is the accuser had claimed was in the room with Brett Kavanaugh thirty plus years ago\nThat was denied they started to move forward on setting and vote for this and several Democratic senators walked out of the room in defiance so now Senator Grassley is beginning his opening statement so they will proceed as normal\nAnd it's more of a tantrum politics we've seen it to this played out during this this story line that the the Brett Kavanaugh nomination was never going to be easy\nIt was always going to be attacked you heard it from Chuck Schumer what was the statement yesterday twenty three minutes after it was announced that he would do everything in his power\nThis group of democratic senator decided they were gonna outs Christine Blasey Ford no one wants to claim ownership of the fact that the outer forcing her to testify in public when she didn't want to clearly did not\nWant to shaming the reputation of what has been a jurists was been led nothing short of exemplary like both in his profession and his in his home life shocking\nThings let's take a call from Jim in Salem you're on the beauty and Jake mornings you regarding where do you think um\nWhat I think is they put minor cannot be prosecuted as an adult ... be prosecuted for something to do but it's a minor thirty five years ago\nIt's a good question I mean it could be prosecuted in any manner that the state of Maryland decides to do that as well as\nI understand that but at the end of the day her her testimony just as it's still weak um the memory thing of now she knows who did it ... before she didn't know that it but at the same time it just doesn't make sense that you can prosecute them as an adult for what they did as a wider\nYeah thanks for the call Jim ... and I think Jim speaks to what a lot of people I rent a lot of comments heard from a lot of people that they believe Brett Kavanaugh is innocent these charges in a place some bad cabin you Kevin out for you after the News Let's go to Tom at home grove you're on WGN Jake morning time\nGood morning I thought it was very telling that the lady did not produced for corroborate two witnesses that she claimed that she said\nYes and and the witness was they did talk to would not verify her accounts of what happened and that that that was probably the most damning piece of evidence there was that she couldn't get anyone to say this is what actually happened that day thirty five years ago\nExactly thanks for the call let's go to Doug in Campbell sport you're under ... good morning to\nThe morning I'm my whole area is about the whole idea of sexual assault and if they're really interested in protecting women I haven't gone to say Cory Booker needs to be removed because he admitted that he sexually assaulted somebody\nWell we we can go on and on about the double standard is happening between Democrats and Republicans thanks for the call I it's shocking to me and I know my democratic listeners disagree with me on this but you out at a woman who asked to be protected and yet nobody's talking about that\nThroughout the show today on TALK about some of the coverage I saw last night was frankly horrifying on networks that should know better\nTalking about the strategy\nOf what the Republicans or Democrats were doing is that what you took away from that that was journalist should be talking about the strategy to political strategy ridiculous let's go to John in Tulsa you're under the teams can morning John\nOh it to the nominee they owe it to the process the they owe it to over two hundred years of of American a republic a tradition to to go ahead and move this process forward and get them to approve the swiftly as possible\nOr do you have any doubt that Kevin I Will be confirmed it next week well\nThe good news this is Jeff Flake is now off the fence and he he is now supporting the nomination there's talk that Joe Manchin of West Virginia is good for the nomination a I Believe at this point that the Republicans are so angry at the Democrats\nAnd because there was absolutely no evidence that points to Kevin are doing these horrible crimes that he's been accused of a in the Republican anger as they are the Republicans have you're staying with their base will not tolerate them backing down at this point I think that there's a good chance he'll be confirmed\nJames just an editor right Wisconsin thanks for jumping on the line for me quickly James\nOh You're welcome Steve\nAfter this break them to take some more calls mark Larry Sam you're up next we're all we're talking about the Kavanaugh lousy for hearing yesterday and and now the Judiciary Committee is discussing the votes today which will send us the full Senate more than likely next week seems to be with you on this Friday read your interview teams you\nPlay on Mount another back home are usually ... title on the line to the play by play man ... only got worse to break it all down as Cecily for Wisconsin's afternoon news used to be with you on this Friday so forget the friday foreign today\nTo different people student wants to life we might be short one today but ah we're going to spend a lotta time of that our talking about the cabinet or\nChristine Blasey Ford hearing yesterday and as as I look on the monitors there the senators and the Judiciary Committee or discussing the boats potentially that's coming fairly soon I wanted to take as many of your calls as I could do let's go to mark internal show you're on the team take the money mark\nBowden thanks fat\nYeah what do you think honestly\nI Believe both of them and I believe that they both fully believe the testimony that they gave yesterday I watched some of the whole hearing the the thing that really stand out\nAre when Dr Ford backed up by a exactly how the chemicals in the brain react when ... and it would make that the cabin on whether or not but that's because the ... it was just any other like any other party and when he got really hung up and\nStarted acting like Senator that was an article and questions about what she has to have you know I wrote blacked out well banking or ... ... he had an answer in ... that sort of around and they tried to ask her about her drinking that lately to believe that he did drink and forget something so\nI Believe that he did a lot but they're glad that he did not do it and if we don't have an FBI investigation to at least try and put the lawn back we can't make a good judgment and if we can't make that judgment the option of the law there now and that the horse threw up at all so sexual predator that and I'm not there that's what yeah\nBut I think that's what Dr Ford has testified that he is\nAnd you can't you can't put someone like that on a on a judge said her life I left the court\nOr in my yard mark as we've got a lot of lot of other callers but I I I appreciate your point of view let's go to Larry in Milwaukee on WGM\nJay morning Larry how's it going good what your what are your thoughts on yesterday for\nUp until yesterday I thought that the Democrats are giving you a quick bail you out and get them out of there what changed your mind\nUh I'm from a law enforcement family I have a couple of the fact that some of the family and the fact he doesn't want yeah yeah I went back to the gate\nThey a lot of time with my family everybody knew about it and how they would talk about me after a while just anything because nobody asked a lot of people are like oh stuff but they're not going to clean up after I left that specifically asked\nNow thanks for the call or is it a little bit on the FBI some people are bringing that up one these past six FBI background checks to all the witnesses that you that people are referencing were were were submitted sworn statements\nAnd those are selling these if you lie to\nThis community and to the government so there's consequences for their behavior if they were not telling the truth and the other big piece of this is the nominee Brett Kavanaugh even though he was asked numerous times he doesn't and he can't demand and FBI investigation\nHaving to go back to this I got one more call but I I just wanna make this point all this information was known in July\nIt's September\nAnd the reason we're having this discussion and the reason that Christine Blasey Ford was forced to testify\nBecause Democratic senators one or their staff leaked information did not protect her identity which as somebody who cares about victims of sexual assaults thinks is probably one of the most critical pieces of this story that or is not being met a represented promptly by the media\nWas the Republicans are their staff ... just the Democrats and shame on Dianne Feinstein who frankly as a center from California was in the San Francisco area she should know better\nAnd the fact that she held us information throughout the first set of hearings on Brett Kavanaugh shame on her was gonna salmon McHenry, Illinois you're going to be taking money soon\n... you know you don't receive good what do you think\nWell first of all before I make my point though and like to commend your previous guest Mr workers some for reminding us of the two hundred plus years the civilized prompts us in this country is now being challenged by a mob rule which will take you know where else to other than a hotel throwing in a\nSteak ah that's just where all this garbage is taking us on my original point was you know we should've expected those because Bill Clinton came out many years ago when he was in the White House who he was very clear he so we're not going to win this ... we're going to win this fight the courts\nAnd this has been a long term goal and the Democrats to get a bunch of people in the courts are going to argue about what the definition of the word is ... and so I've seen this coming for years Steve\nSo and now that the services are trying to put a few joggers or they're going to start coming up with this crazy stuff the ... the process and it's sort of you to ask her what we're all watch from now and they you know the three feet it for their last chance now to flip this country\nAnd we're not going to give up easy\nOr military go there Sam a great points as always um you want to know how I noticed process who screwed up because right now and the monitoring in the studio Debbie Wasserman Schultz is talking to the media\nDisgraced Democratic National committee chair somebody should be embarrassed but yet it's not being held front and center as a\nCommentator on this issue that's so screwed up Democrats are on this issue to have her out their disgraced congresswoman from Florida who's now being tried it out there is somebody knows anything about this issue\n\nThe last thing I'll say on this and we're going to we will cover it throughout the show today in even including the friday form\nThis is an embarrassment to our country is one driven by politics not reason not evidence not sex\nMotives anymore you know the chances are more ... than if you're the white collar software stories later this morning then you'll be headed to the ... right I'm Down to the house through the forest send the four biggest stories as receives\nAcross Milwaukee state in the world I think the last time I saw this guy was state fair Brian ... joins me in Studio in the morning Steve good to be on\nSo I have to ask you about the news of the other day and and the week I'm really a month is the cabinet nominations your thoughts on how much is that you watched yesterday but the incredible moment in our nation's history a Supreme Court nominee accused\nOf sexual assault thirty five years ago for the lousy for testified that cabinet passionately testified in his defense your your takeaway from yesterday\nYou know you is a real and it was heartfelt testimony by both Dr Ford and by judge Kavanaugh the more than anything you'd get frustrated with the process that's going on I mean there's this evidence is sitting there for weeks maybe months uh and it comes forward at the end and it becomes a Washington DC at times is becoming a circus\nAnd when I was talking to people that's what they're more frustrated with than anything is Washington can't function like adults and get stuff done on behalf of the American people\nAnd what's so frustrating and how you just watch this process play out\nIn Washington in the Senate it's just a mockery of some of these men and women that are out there so frustrating\nSo those of us who have talked about this issue for well maybe even before I was on the radio [laughter] what do we do about it\nYeah I mean you know you got to get a better process out there you got to get people working on behalf of the American people less focused on grandstanding giving themselves on cable TV more focused on getting policy Don\nI'm putting your qualified jurist on the bench and you know getting work done on behalf of the American people is what we should be focusing on in Washington knocked people out there grants and trying to get themselves on you know the latest soundbite on TV or radio darn frustrating\n... for the first congressional district joining me this morning so let's talk about your race or Randy braces your opponents I understand he's finally agreed to a debate yeah\nWe're going to be debating our first debate is going to be October Nineteen sign Oak Creek a city you know well very well I Will be there at seven thirty I'm excited we're gonna be talking about the ...\nYeah we're going to be debating our first debate going to be October nineteenth in Oak Creek a city you know well very well I Will be there at seven thirty I'm excited we're gonna be talking about the issues and so it was a location is people don't get it will be at city hall Oak Creek seven thirty pm friday October nineteenth\n... will will like congressman mark ... can be there to speak\nYou know we'll see we'll see her I mean you look at who is a liberal who's who are coming into the first district or tried to support my opponent you build a blog CEO are in town supporting him economic Shia yet Bernie Sanders ... Madison a congressman mark poke can coming in\nAnd house and they have a president was an hour behind his name\nYou may not like any of that but the tantrum politics that we're seeing played out right now in this country are shameful that'd be calling on this for a couple of years now use that term to answer tantrum politics on purpose [noise]\nIt's a ... it's a group of people it's not even one generation who\nAssume everybody that's different have different political opinions evil racist massaging this thick because they have a different opinion on an issue\nAnd when they feel that way they act this way now I understand there's politics but you saw the the uh the banks\nAnd the passion in Senator Lindsey Graham yesterday was said enough is enough people\nAnd his comment was was perfect because it shows how divisive this process becoming who do you think is going to be willing the next time an opening comes up on the U.S Supreme Court to put themselves or their family through this\nI saw people that I respect\nThat I Know very well say things on social media yesterday calling for revolutions\nAnd you know shaming anyone who who ah supports Brett Kavanaugh's nomination because we disagree with them I saw family members on Facebook attacking each other over this nomination\n\nWe've got to be smarter than that we got to understand that there's a process that's the political process is a cultural process it's it's at some points\nIt can't be about just the label behind you name it can't be out there\nYou can be upset as a woman about what happened to Christine Blasey Ford you could be upset as a man about what happened to her as I Am\nAnd you should always listen and I I I capitalize the word always and I was shattered if I could listen to what women are saying about sexual harassment and sexual assault for too long in this country that hasn't been the case\nBox\nIt doesn't mean that doesn't have to be facts evidence eyewitness testimony something\nOtherwise it rises to the level of a witch hunt which I think all of us decent honorable rational reasonable people understand is how this country works\nI Can't make her pain go away but it's pain that didn't have to happen yesterday and it didn't have to happen because of Dianne Feinstein or staff democratic leadership who said you know what we're going to trust you out here\nWe're going to make this is ugly as possible as ugly as possible for you so you can suffer\nEven more than you suffer thirty five years ago and we're going to do it for a political purpose\nShe asked to be protected she asked Senator Dianne Feinstein the Democratic senator from California of all places and they couldn't do the decent thing I protect her identity that's who you should be mad at\nThat's where you should point the fingers\nAnd even after that the Republican leadership on this committee Chuck Grassley\nSaid you know what we can do as a closed session and you know what those Democratic senators said no we want her to be out there out front in front of the cameras to tell her story pointing fingers where they need to be appointed here it's not that difficult doesn't meet women should be listening to of course they should always be listening to\nWhat is a country still\nHas a presumption of innocence and if you don't believe that maybe you're living in the wrong country\n\nAfter the break before I'd say on the four biggest stories as we see it across Milwaukee the state and the world no surprise leader off with the controversy in Washington DC the latest on that that's all messaging WTO's ...\nGood morning Wisconsin I don't I see somebody with you on WGM sales and uh\n[noise] over this uh this is my voice\nSounded a little better I Know it's been kind of a rough morning Oh thank you for listening is always fifty four degrees at Radio City a little rain coming very up as nice where you are thanks for listening as I said they don't forget friday forum coming up in the eleven o'clock hour but of course the ten o'clock hours before our town\nThe four biggest stores as we see it across Milwaukee the state and the world and the number one has to be the cabinet or lazy afford hearing from Washington\nAnd it has been emotional at times already today so the Senate Judiciary committee Steve got together earlier today they were going to discuss whether or not\nThey would have a vote and they have decided yes there will be a vote today in that community it should be around one thirty this afternoon but before that things have been heated even before they made that decision Democrats not happy\nHigh drama inside the Senate Judiciary committee meeting on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh several Democrats walked down if Republicans started debate on Kavanaugh's nomination one day after a binary hearing on sexual assault allegation one of the Democrats could walk down in protest Senator Richard Blumenthal\nAll of America is watching the United States Senate today and\nThey should be deeply disappointed embarrass a shame\nDemocrats are mainly the FBI reopen the background check into Kavanaugh cannot smoke and it'd be new for capital\nSo right now there is debate this could go as long as forever but they already have a scheduled anyway Senator Patrick Leahy helped me voting on\nJudge Kavanaugh's nomination is ever asked the tougher for a lifetime appointment to the highest score\nA nation Senator Orrin hatch we've had enough time on this the the such a course on I just have to say let's be fair or this let's vote whichever way my water and let's let's move on this\nSo one of the key senators in all of this is the senator from Arizona the one who is not running for reelection by the way Senator Jeff flake he is voting yes and there are a lot of protestors on Capitol Hill yeah you can imagine demonstrating upset with this many of them who have been assaulted\nIn their past and they confronted the senator as he got into an elevator [noise]\nAnd it's got to a point where he\nCould not shut the elevator doors so actually the hearing was delayed because he sat there and listen to some of these protesters this back and forth actually there's a transcript of it\nThat's been posted on mine already and he he was very cordial and and respectful about the whole thing but clearly could not move from where he was that bad the door jammed open they were talking to him and he couldn't have movie was very pretty much stuck in there but that is a big vote knowing that flake is voting yes\nOne can assume that some of the other is the generally vote in a block to gather will also vote yeah they're Murkowski\nCollins Jeff way right and the other one that ah so I've heard some news about is the the Joe Manchin of West Virginia might also be a yes vote he lives in a very conservative state loom there's a there's a good indication that the vote once it gets to the full Senate may be in the favorite Brett Kavanaugh or just to the point that you raised about the disturbances and the elevators expect more of us\nThe tantrum politics have in this country that's just going to escalate this isn't going to just do whatever happens with Brett Kavanaugh's nomination up or down that's going to continue to escalate and and I said earlier in the show if there is another opening\nDuring this president's tenure you think this is something\nWait and see what happens with that one that's number one of our for us and the four biggest stories as we see of across Milwaukee the state in the world coming up next brewers Doug Russell let's make the connection between those two that's and that's where I think the ...\nPlus the brewers hey their their heads of the playoffs will find out this week and what that might mean whether it's one game or a series\nAnd joining me now is Douglas I Would say are my favorite sports guy but that would make massive man that I Want to I don't want an upset Greg mass of God I Am totally off the air that I'm your favorite says okay I'm going to have to solve that was a private conversation [laughter] so as we approach this week and there's all kinds of scenarios we could go we could wrap ourselves in a non trying to figure out and you can see I'm losing my voice I'm so excited about it\nIt's not that difficult or not it's honestly when I saw the light sports\nIt's in a not trying to figure out and you can see I'm losing my voice I'm so excited about it\nIt's not that difficult or not it's obviously a sports fan okay so you want the brewers to win obviously number one on ... you root for them and many root for the cardinals okay\nIf the brewers have more wins then the cubs do by Sunday evening and the brewers are champions of the division\nI didn't know that comes to be the wildcard or against either the the Dodgers I'm rocky is four cardinals and they all have to play their own games\nAh but the brewers are are definitely in as we know as are the cubs right now as are the Braves those are the three things that we know at this point are and so you root for the brewers against the tigers the tigers seven thirty games under five hundred the cardinals applying for their playoff lives they're not in yet and they're you know they need to win in order to get in\nThe cubs they need to win in order to stay in the lead for the division so that that series at Wrigley Field there's a lot of juice that's going into those those games which actually start this afternoon\nA at you ... it's like pre playoffs really I mean are these two weekends series are are are for the whole ball of wax nano central very cool stuff so let me ask you about the pitching staff as as the managers Madden and comes to approach this weekend\nIt's about a Republican lawmaker in the state of Wisconsin and then again mark your calendar is I'm Talking about a Republican in that's done something wrong so for those folks who say never do that you're that moments a representative Raul Brooks he represents sock ville area\nHe resigned from his position as assistant majority leader Wednesday or it's reported that he made offensive remarks that three female lawmakers over the summer or which prompted a review\nUm the governor to his credits and I agree with the governor asked him to leave office now represented Brooks has said he will not do that he did step down from the leadership position but he has said he will not\nLeave his is assigned position as a representative government went on to tweak this representative ... comments are offensive and disrespectful they have no place in our society and are inconsistent with the highest as it must be held by those in public office he should resign from office period\nNow different from the from the governor's take was assembly speaker Robin boss and majority leader just on a key frequent guest on the program they issued a statement Wednesday as well\nFollowing Governor Walker's call for a Brooks to resign said they condemn the offensive remarks and they felt the issue of inappropriate resolve and said yesterday they did not call did not call for books to leave his leadership post\nSo the women affected the women lawmakers were city do called Dow field any loud and back with Clinton and Jesse Rodriguez of Oak Creek\nUm they said this is their statement jointly we were satisfied with the assembly response to the summer of ... excepted representative Brooks apology while we respect his decision to resign as leadership position and appreciate the seriousness with with what you take the issue\nIs beyond what we expect or even wanted report the incident behind us we would kindly ask others to do the same so that's the statement from three women\nWho he made those comments about\nI'll actually what happened in July they were at a restaurant it was after or simply GOP caucus in the Dallas area of books they would buy drinks for everyone\nBut I said to some are represented Rodrigues because she says Hispanic she wouldn't buy one for her for a for her um and he bought it did indeed buy drinks for other people's but not Rodriguez and and to Jesse Jesse use credit she is taking the high road on this which is to be lauded and and appreciated so what do I think about this\nFirst of all I should know better and you can say that doesn't involved in a situation of alcohol or just bad judgment but lawmakers elected officials have either party need to know better\nAnd really it's it's the public's\nRight to say the law makers you leave recall you know that's their call really so I get where he's gone with his his decision to stay on but at some point you make bad decisions like this when it questions your integrity on anything else\nBecause if I Know one thing about the climate in this country right now and and this happened in July this year\nMiddle of the me too movement any comments to women like this unacceptable not just a gray area\nNo confusion though uh I just said the wrong thing you should know better you're elected state representative you should have more smarts than that\nWhile I applaud him for resigning his leadership position you might want to take the next step I agree with the governor here there has to be some measure of consequences for bad behavior\nAnd you may think some Republicans in ... and do you think that just stepping down from the leadership position is enough I say no\nYou've got to be smarter than this\nAnd if you want to win election if you want to the big picture and grow your party which\nI bang my head against the wall and I think about Republicans and some of the decisions some of the things they say some of the things they do not understanding why these types of stories hurt their party both in Wisconsin and nationally\nAnd you wonder why we have the political\nDiscourse that we have in this country because of nonsense like this you made it worse not better\nSo representative David Brooks\nRob Brooks I should say as not stepping down but a stepping down from his leadership position will maintain its position as a state rep that's number four of our Fort Sam we got a good way those Chris bought tickets to assess the tickets right Jordan\nLet's go to caller number eight and color number ten the for one for seven nine nine one six where the African Americans ...\nGood luck to Jordan enjoy that concert a he's a great Trump put her in that that will be one heck of a cost to see but you got to get our rights hopefully it wrote them down to four at ten to four biggest stories as we see across Markey state in the world more next year they'll be themes\nAre burned the votes either with their playoff plans are nowhere near ... what kind of impact on the weekends series with the tigers bring Greg math it goes through all the playoffs and I said I have six or seven words central Steve's really with you on this Friday a horse voice you can really but I'm plugging along thanks to all the folks who are\nTelling you about there's a lot of cures the ... of\nThat people are putting forward that some of them frankly I've never heard of I Want to spend a few moments talking about the er the cabinet hearing I Know that that was a a a big discussion point early on on the show and it and we'll continue to be there's a vote scheduled for twelve thirty today our time on the or at least moving to the nomination for it to the full Senate or early next week\nAnd I know ...\nAnd I know people have um a lot of opinions and feeling strong feelings on both sides of this and I don't discount either one my anger and my\nI think my distrust of the of the narrative years that's a one side\nIs evil on one side is on the side of rights that we can argue about the presidents and what he does and parties and what they do and all of those things are are well and good that's politics twenty Eighteen style no one's disputing there\nBut when it comes to this issue there is a process elections have consequences presidents pick Supreme Court justices those justices go through their process with the Senate Judiciary committee and then to the full Senate you don't have to like the results\nBut this call for revolution which some friends of mine I call them friends put out on social media or the ridiculous attacks on family members because they have a different opinion on this issue\nStrikes me as going too far\nLook at the facts of the case we're having a accuser\nChristine Blasey Ford said something happened thirty five years ago we have the accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who says it didn't both have the opportunity to testify in front of the Judiciary Committee yesterday\nI thought it was handled appropriately I thought both sides\nIn the morning hearing handled the questioning appropriately\nUnderstanding how delicate that situation was not wanting to re traumatized Christine Blasey Ford who whatever she experience deserved to be listened to\nNo question but please don't indict people because they disagree with you\nAnd just another note on this I saw some commentary and I even through the body after the fact that the an actress Alyssa millennials in the audience I I got some clarification she apparently works as as a victim's rights advocate but when you\nIt's really about a yes or the fact that the an actress Alyssa Milano was in the audience I I got some clarification she apparently works as as a victim's rights advocate but when you're sitting in a hearing\nRoom in the Senate office building don't hold Blinder that has some message on the back of it you diminish the process\n\nThat's not your role your guest in that chamber act like it's\n\nThankfully we didn't have the disruptions we had in the first few days of the cabinet hearings\n\nThere may or may be a civil war in this country on on issues like this\nBut it doesn't help when level head level headed smart people advocate violence which is what revolution is that protests and violence\nJust because somebody disagrees with you and frankly it's gone on too long\n\nWill it be changed by anything that happens our next two years probably not probably just get worse and as I said earlier in the show you think this is something give president Donald Trump another Supreme Court pick you've seen nothing compared to what that with that race and that's like would be about\n\nI'm One guy saying this\nBut I think at some point commonsense needs to prevail and while you may be passionate about politics even despite of Donald Trump\nLove 'em or hate him how he goes on families are raised\nAnd but the format where she got five minutes to go down a list of questions and was kind of going somewhere and then go to a Democrat who had kind of do their thing and then he'd go back to her and yet it was it's very hard to follow so I don't think it was really effective in that respect\nBut uh I'll be honest I don't know if the optics of safe seeing someone like Ted Cruz interrogate Christine Blasey Ford I would've worked out very\nWell Republicans were nowhere right if that would have happened to senators male senators would have interviewed Christine Blasey Ford if they'd be crucified I think so you can argue about the strategy of using an independent counsel but I think it worked out as as well as it could be worked out let's talk about the testimony to the actual customer that played out yesterday\nChristie and biology for emotional mhm gut wrenching mhm I sat on the show women always need to be listening to they don't necessarily have to be bullied and at some point it has to be about producing some piece of information or a witness that says this is what happened that's something we can agree with\nHer yeah absolutely and I mean we\n... you can't separate what occurred yesterday from two big elements of contacts and the first is that we've known since before since the moment Anthony Kennedy retired\nThat the entire Democrat's strategy is predicated I'm getting this confirmation vote beyond the mid term elections every second of every decision has been predicated on that\nThe other thing we can't escape is the fact that we are in this a reckoning of this me too movement and we have seen powerful figures brought down by a um\nAllegations by a corroborated stories from many many years ago and we know we we we've heard the testimony of of\nMillions of women in this country and I think a lot of men are cheering women in their lives for the first time she stories that I they didn't know existed that they didn't know that women are kept these things up that they didn't they didn't they weren't believed at a time and that's that's a big thing for this moment in this culture in this all feeds into that\nI Want to ask you after the break could this be a victory for women even if Kavanaugh was nominated because the fact that her voice was heard a common rocks from Wisconsin He gets a lot of the journey on the friday form presented by the Medical College of Wisconsin more next right here to be the amateur\nFor safe ripples of face for such as there is just a funny for a few of his Facebook page\nYou can send us questions are a lot of comments on account Ross joining us from Wisconsin is too for liberty on this Friday and we're short one just because she is out sick but we'll we'll go along as we can [noise]\nUm so before the break we're talking about Christine lousy forced testimony let's talk about Brett Kavanaugh out during the break we were talking about what that look like what that sounded like what did you think of his testimony how he delivered if his style\nReally as anger at what was happening to him and his family\n[noise] yeah I was prepared after watching a lot of the the Ford testimony in the morning I was prepared for ...\nTo ah to go down I ... you know there's a high minded affect you start reading people on social media and you think those of us and what can you do take it to a to change the dynamic here and again\nUh accepting that this of this of optics this was theater this was a spectacle I cheated the one thing that I think he had to do absolutely had to do\nAnd what he did was you sounded like he gave righteous indignation he sounded like an innocent man and I think a lot of people uh we're looking to see you know ... ... if if I were innocent how would I react\nAfter you know ten days of having his name and his reputation dragged through the mud things his family is done through or how would you react and ah yeah he he he brought the fiery dial up to ten I think some some might wish in certain places he would have dial it back to eight but I'm\nDirectly challenge some of the senators yeah they didn't appreciate\nRight right and now as highly unusual but this whole thing has been highly unusual inner city it was in the fight for his life and I think uh what he did was he showed spying and I think it's given Republicans the spine that is likely going to get 'em on approved\nOne of the things that I are flooded on the show this morning and I applaud it on social media yesterday was a crime as a Senator Lindsey Graham I thought that was a singular moment in this in this testimony and that hearing that stood out because he was calling out his colleagues suddenly has he said he had been friends with for a long time\nI see that as as a potential rallying cry for Republicans other people see it differently what do you think\nIt's a it was an extraordinary moment ... it was it was extraordinary because if memory serves that was the very first Republican uh besides Grassley to really take their time that they use the first one not to defer to the special counsel\nAnd I mean he took out the flame thrower I and I described it as a sham and I think he voice ... a ... you know Lindsey Graham of all people not a hero to many conservatives not a hero to many ah [laughter]\nWho who are out you know activists and who pay attention to this stuff I'm up for for Lindsey Graham of all people to to deliver that message I think it was very very powerful\nWhat does he writes\nYeah I yes yes he's right in the fact that this is a circus there is there's absolutely no way in which um this was a fair process can be a fair process going forward I think there's some serious question going forward\nBecause of that you're talking about the fear of proud processing the grand even brought this on the yearbook that year book talking about an old high school yearbook of Kavanaugh's from thirty plus years ago\nThat likely is the new normal Illinois has been I assume in some respects where you\n... these nominees over and over again or a candidate for president or\nWhatever now that we're moving into the digital age that we have everyone that we talk about digital footprints imagine ten or Fifteen Years from now I'm I'm In the with the digital footprint that there are leaving right now I don't know how we ever go back to any type of normalcy when it\nComes to the [noise] yeah yeah I saw I saw somebody post a jokingly say say good bye to any funding yearbook post right like I mean from now I Know it's an extraordinary question I think it extends beyond Supreme Court nominees on on what is\nYou know everyone has a digital footprint if you'd be able to geo cash where people were for our location wise uh you know probably some future Supreme Court justice is tweeting something right now that could you know blow up in their face it it's an extraordinary things something that when we're not prepared to grapple with\nAnd um yeah I mean I I've said it's more than one person I mean\n... ... ... we're in for more things like this especially in a part of the atmosphere\nWant to read from a lot of comments on Facebook at if you want to catch you can go to a news radio six twenty WTO ... Facebook page Denise as she says what scared me while watching this unfold and total on hinged wore a man I fear for my husband's brothers and nephews\nThis prove that you can say anything with no proven our men will be found guilty before they can possibly defend themselves do you worry about that do we shouldn't be worried about that audience and I'm not saying Christine bought these accusations are not true I have no idea and there was no evidence provided to suggest that is or isn't\nIs there 'cause there'll be a backlash against men as part of this me too movement\nAnd there was no evidence provided to suggest that is or isn't is there 'cause there'll be a ... a backlash against men as part of this me too movement and and the hearing like this\nSure and we and we've seen things like this right we we do clip crop uh the Rolling Stones thing at the University of Virginia we have seen false accusations that people jump to conclusions they looked at a certain culture and they say yeah that sounds right that sounds true those guys are frat boys those guys are prep school guys\nThat sounds true and people jump to conclusions before there was evidence and in both cases those were found to be Charles\nBut we are in this moment of reckoning we are in this moment in which there are a lot of real authentic stories coming forward about a\nPowerful men and not powerful men or women are feeling empowered to speak and uh this was really a test of our principal those are the test of of um not not believe any accusation but um are we going to defend the presumption of innocence I mean\nThat is ... ... we we we cannot move forward in a society which any accusation without any corroborating evidence results in the destruction of anyone men or women\nOr this is this is going to be a real real test going forward and I'm worried that that in in search of political gain in search of power in search of what have you that we're going to cost a lot of those principles suicide\nCalling Ross in Wisconsin in super long there'd be joining me on the friday forum wind solar were presented by the Medical College in Wisconsin after the break kind of what else\nCan we get our traffic in Ninety four east on right now moving along actually pretty well Eighteen minutes ... highly sixteen and a downtown electrons downtown because he was Thirteen that as an extra thing to do that we think chemo the eleven minutes forty one south on how we do Fifteen minutes\nForty three around you're ready to Marquette at twelve minute ride that is an extra to have you continue to them our cat downtown late now is going to be a bit heavy Fifteen minutes of seven minute delay and then on eighty four it sounds sounds ...

four one four seven nine nine one six one evacuate mortgage talk or text line Let's jump back into the phones we've got a guy and managed to walk hey guy you're on WGM jak\nHey thanks for answering my question what a great game um how our brewers fan stable to score so many tickets in Chicago to be a make them some market them to the Milwaukee area they\nWent on sale last night at seven thirty\nThe uh make them some market to the Milwaukee area\nThey went on sale last night at seven thirty a cubs dot com and it was first come first served\nWhile you're up there was like ten thousand Moore's fans there and they they are\nAll the all the twenty thousand cubs fans that seems like so so that's all I have the answer\nYeah they actually did a great job by brewers fans I'm sure many of them are in their cars right now driving back to Milwaukee and you should be commended for the impact you had you made an impact\nOn this game and the players manager Craig council that the staff general manager David Stearns they all took note\nOf what brewers fans did after the brewers got into this game where they went yesterday at seven thirty last night tickets going on sale and a lotta brewers fans bought tickets and made the trip a into Chicago and that's pretty darn cool\nChrist as insurer would have Chris thanks for calling your on WGM Jay\n... say that you hear me I thought you're on WGM jak\nYeah I just want to say I'm Glad that the what they did give major kudos for David Stern in being able to trade\nOffer and yelling and bringing in a free agent like king 'cause I really believe that they didn't have those two guys I don't think we'd be talking with the same thing here I Know they have a great you know a lot of great relief pitchers um but I think with all those two guys they were the major spark plug for this team to get the where they were I just\nI mean I'm just so happy that they're in there\nBut I'm just glad that we've seen for a couple of years and yelling for three years I think it is and I think they can just build on those guys and it's just it's great super feeling yeah\nNo you're right I don't think there's any doubt in the world\nYou got two guys who play to envy the caliber level there's a lot of years that what Lorenzo came this year would have him in the conversation for the MVP\nAnd obviously Christian yell at you I think he is going to be the MVP you bring in guys that perform at that kind of level clearly a term that credit council likes to use a lot\nIs driving the boss and those were the guys who for the most part this year absolutely we're driving the bus and it was pretty cool we'll go to Doug and Doug thanks for calling you are on WGM Jay\nThanks Matt how much fun as this boy it's a blast it is a blast of it\nThey were a Saturday and Sunday we were at the games and we got in our thirty three games are for the the the ... and that was fun to butt ugly with today's game I was so glad that the uh brought hater back out to pitch in the in the ninth inning\nUm I don't know if that was the plan or if it just worked that way that is is that he thought he pitched in the age of ... he's he's pitching this way let's see them in there\nAnd uh and we did and then go to all the ER a three point seven five or maybe the air lower today\nFor the year I'm a great is that in my other comment is I'm looking forward to watching Archie

played defensive game today is the brewers prevails three to one Ryan Braun hit into a double play in the first inning that excited the crowd and then the other players well Aguilar with a nifty Turner fields rocket back to retire the cubs so\nDefensively speaking that probably I I thought it was a will play a game on both ends even college former was making plays in left field sometimes it looks like he has a frying pan on his hand but nonetheless a rocket hit them was dark is at thirty is able to pick it cleanly and and I like to see that kind of baseball regardless of who wins that\nNo team gave it up right I mean there was an earned a victory by the brewers it didn't come down to just one single play or an error or a mistake or something haywire since the solid baseball game\nA game like this should be played at that yeah this is the two best teams in the national league by record playing the most important game of the year you would expect them to be totally locked in and playing a strong defensive game and just because they're not being in the air's like you alluded to there was a pretty nice sequence of plates made on each side of the on each side of the pleasure\nI'm Greg Mankiw he's mad poly ... wheels north woods in on the side of Chicago very Wisconsin friendly Barletta Bruce fans hanging out on that you were here for the game too and I I imagine a got a little noisy inside here it did it was\nProbably about fifty fifty split between brewers a cubs fan so when the cubs made a a good play out here out of the cubs fans making noise when the brewers Anna did something I heard the brewers fan so is that it was an interesting environment during the game\nIn the truest sense this is a neighborhood bar with people you know walking their dogs outside here running back and forth in about a mile walk to the stadium in a a pretty cool walk back to is that came across a number of ruins fans\nWho are headed back toward the Milwaukee area following today's game what was your story of the game today how did you just digest it when kids out of school and how far do you think this team can go\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty let's grab Eric in a lake villa you're on WGM Jay Hi Eric\nHow're you doing great thanks for calling yeah that was that was just an incredible game for the um [noise]\nI Would really like to see the brewers a play Chicago because these are Thursday for a series\nThursday for a series that would be off from\nMy ... and I'm trying to computers um are lined brown was on ... been sort of went on line ... tried to steal a base on I didn't understand why he tried to\nDo that but if you do that why did they Somerville king alone could turn on the long run ... you're in the process of making up play\nYou know we were talking about that and the press box to to the phone call Erica it was a pitch of the cubs knew something was coming and a broad took off and I I don't know if he expected came to to move\nInto a very good base runner a inroads a very good base runners so I don't know if it was a mistake or play that was Mitt\nRomney took off and can really didn't move some third base at all I'm pissed off came as well as I don't know if that had anything to do with team not moving but a rod is kind of a dead duck in suburbs had to run they needed I think that anything a little bit of an insurance but I'm Glad that did loom as a big playing the game to be out of that in an earlier than you would expect to\nEntertain you're well aware of the fact that hobby by as has a great throwing arm so you don't want to take off from third unless you know you're going to be able to get in there probably in that situation but it it did come off as a funky play either assigned being master somebody knocked completely knowing what was going on and to your point you just you're glad that that's a\nThat's a sidebar that after tonight we're probably never going to mention again\nGot an

that the cubs fans are ruined them but none of our self so out of the loop chance we're just getting out\nYeah no you're you're ... you could tell during the TV broadcast all out it was\nOh oh by far or that they don't like it was fifty fifty\nThat's great died in the United not have the benefit of the TV broadcast I couldn't quite tell if it came through a or not but uh but yeah I mean the the the most sense right I don't think it was cool and it's pretty sure it was most from a stock has been ah we've talked to a will play the interviewer ahead with the stock is coming up later in the program but\nThis is the guy you got some history was mad going back to the early days in the early uh levels of baseball with the Kansas City royals and you've seen this guy basically grow up you've known him for over a decade and here he is back and get up an opportunity to play in the world series\nIt's really fun for me he was a when I was working in Norway baseball I his first full season in professional baseball\nI I was a broadcaster for the team there and you could just see it from um All right then I mean just to use an Eighteen Nineteen year old kid and the leadership that he had on the team all the way back then it was very clear and to see that ah [noise]\nHis play is kind of followed all those intangibles you knew that he was going to be a good ball player\nCity of everything else and he does he's a complete package kind of guy\nI Know in today's world of baseball where we talk about advance numbers and everything some of those kind of old school scouting language stuff kind of have gone by the wayside but with him he's just a ballplayer I mean you just look at him he hospitals you run hard he goes after everything and I think he's making a really positive impact on his team very\nCool stuff for one for seven nine nine or ... six twenty three one win for the brewers and the dynamic changing just slightly here in Los Angeles will keep you updated on gay and number

can\n\n\nSo it's just not in the season and winning the triple crown told him well but his O P s finishes at an even one thousand five Ninety eight slugging percentage for oh to\nBase percentage and you know I was looking at some of the stats and what I thought was interesting I I understand the envy the discussion and certainly a lot of cubs fans civil the hobby bias and when it first and yell at his batting average was just a few points below hobby by as\nA on base percentage that just gives you an idea\nYou know who's getting on base more than the other so it's it's interesting angle to the argument but uh again coming through I don't matter how you get on base as long as you do I was surprised the cubs pitched yelling out as often as they did turn out to be three singles which I guess could be like pitching around them and ending up with a Walker but that big it right there gets the birds on the board of drives that are run\nAs for his defense of ability I don't think that's something that plays and so to me it's Domingo Santana who gets onto the roster and I question whether or not job scope even want to start today I'm not a hundred percent sure scope ends up on the roster\nYes those are the start today over Travers saw was a likely a matched up with ... on them out to a school for the hard hit live ball a long drive to third base and his first step that I'm just calling into Daniel Murphy line drive to a little bit later in the game\nBut you know he's kind of been that cluster of infielder as you mentioned are known for as such a wildcard even play at all today but you can see how it got like ... looms large in a playoff series give it a defensive versatility I wouldn't say scope is overly versatile you can play a couple of positions press can play like eight\n... right I Do pretty well at it and I'd probably give you a little more consistent stick so the more that I go through this the more I Wonder is go has a spot on the twenty five man and I don't think he does either and it gets tricky and it'd be kind of have to wonder about the relief situation at home and he started to keep but\nMore than likely you'd like to keep an actor arm somewhere possible ... could be expendable by that notion as well\nWith the caller earlier say the corporate burns wasn't going to make it on housing for sure he would he's clear to me he's clearly one of the maybe he's not in that group of\nJeffers hater can Abel story I answer Danielle but he's that next group down and he is somebody that if you need multiple innings I think he's a little bit more reliable than a brand new wonders put Fritz really while he's put\nHimself into contention as well so for me I have this decision player situation it's pretty simple to figure out again it probably comes down to Santana or skill but then when you get into the relief pitchers and there are so many guys a junior Guerra brand of what the courtroom burn some of those long relief kind of guys how many of those guys do you end up bringing on\nFor one for seven nine nine one sick twenties the academic mortgage talking tax line Jeff's on his way back from Chicago hopefully driving fit

your boy those guys you guys are old enough to remember who maybe they were really good I think you\nAre right there and I just wanted to throw that out I think it's part where you guys talk about the fans you know you can play out I\nThink yell it might have played by it or not yell at\nSame thing is I think yeah\nI I I don't think he's going to be it didn't get into today's game but I don't think he's going to be a part of that roster either appreciate the phone call Joe and you know it's difficult decisions but a good problem to have\n... teams isn't even on the radar as far as I'm concerned on the ... man roster and it's I've said this over and over\n... things just he's not going to be successful as the guy comes off the\nBench it gets that bad here and a half bat there he's not built to be a pinch hitter\nEric teams can still be a productive player in major league baseball he just needs to be a guy who's getting consistent in bats and playing a lot and he's not getting he lost that opportunity when he says that you are became a secular this year so this is a knock on air things he has been put in a really tough situation\nBecause he because of what you are dead and to me it probably makes sense to move on from things and see if you can find him a place to be next year where you can get those consistent a bat what if he's not getting consistent about there's no reason for him to be on a playoff roster\nFor one for seven and nine one six twenty as the academic mortgage talk and tech blind when we come back we'll hear from brewers GM's David Stern who's able to chat with
