part of my responsibility I'm and I'm you know the the the best reason to celebrate this for me is it ... you see it makes everybody feel and how\nWe've been able to take a fans and on a journey here this month and hopefully hopefully find some new fans that are uh enjoy baseball upper left James\nAccredited doctors seem to value versus ... positions and you know different batters at face you know left handed pitcher right individual what is the challenge and facing that where you have so many more hitters to prepare for it and also like a you know once you switch pitchers of human\nYeah it's it's not you know really after playing a month of September baseball like there's only five players on the bench it feels like nothing to do honest with you um so it's um you know they they have I think when you get to the post season\nThe teams have good benches there's good hitters on the bench I'm that's part of the ... that's part of a post season game and I'm match ups are part of\nToday's game um the managers are trying to get match ups um\nAnd so you just you got to manage the game not both sides are not going to get match ups and every single case and not not going to get every match up they want and ultimately this boils down to the players you know the players competing against each other which is the ... which is how it should be aside as the players competing against each other so\nUm you know there there are they've got left handed hitters and write and editors as as we we offer the same thing I think so um it's challenging for both sides are to navigate through that\nA second row to your wife got kind of spending off of the first answer ... question you talked about the responsibility um that you have\nAbout the responsibility um say you have the brewers baseball remember a a video I think it was pre season video at the beginning of last year and we talked about that kind of it felt like okay we know where to rebuild but we're all in this together it's our responsibility is my responsibility are you surprised and that\nYou were in this season the national league championship series so soon after\nMaking a video like that\n[laughter] um\nLook I think we've um you know you you don't\nAnd David ... says the same way you don't put a timeline on it you yet you do your job you try to make a good decision just did we've tried to stack good decisions on top of each other David's done a phenomenal job but I'm\nAdding a whole a whole bunch of really good players to to this thing um we've gone out and competed and and try to win a lot of baseball games is done pretty good job of it\nUm you know so we got ourselves in this position so\nYou know I mean I I don't know that there was no timetable and it's it's you just take it as it goes you know and um we got ourselves into a really good spot I'm the team you know I I really believe that we mature greatly as a team kind of after the trade deadline um ... and things\nUm you know you start to see things that were that made you think of October and the possibilities of October [noise] um and then you know we've got a pretty good run and found ourselves in the spot and and and we feel like if we can compete against anybody at the top friend\nCraig how did you decide on geo for game on [noise]\nYeah so what do we just um we ... we like to match up or we like the matchup against their line up um and you know we talked about you know we've\nIt's no secret that that we're um we're going to use our pitching a little differently than um than traditionally than the traditional us for like\nUm and so for us that the the first national that we liked was was you on the mound um\nYou know we were asking jail to go out there and get a bunch out how many you know we'll just see out

M. J. for to discuss the Senate race\nBut let's talk about this Senate race I Want to begin with kind of something wrapped around the Senate race the brewers taking up all the oxygen in the room Tammy Baldwin leads by ten points according to the latest Marquette poll is it harder if you're Leah Vukmir to get traction to get attention when there's another huge story taking up all the oxygen\nAnd I would say yes and no I mean there are so many ways candidates can reach out to voters these days\nThrough Twitter and social media and all these other different outlets campaign commercials and so there's a lot of Venus and opportunities but the ... I always wonder you know ... what are people paying attention to what does\nCatch their attention and obviously there is a lot of talk about the brewers and excitement behind the brewers in fact there's going to be another Senate debates Saturday Night that will be competing with\nThe brewers but because there's so much reporting and ways for people at least to catch the highlights of the Senate debate but I think when you're ... you're not only looking to get attention for your race but you're also still looking to attract money to try to compete at a higher level with uh putting on ... campaign commercials\nSo I think the debate was a perfect example I did watch the debate you did a great job Shannon did a great job pointed questions it with heat it was interesting but the very next day there was talk about that but it may be less than one news cycle in years past maybe it would have been more but everybody was wondering you know how about you are doing what's Craig council up to share\nIt it's interesting to me 'cause I'll go back to it you know I I it's the next morning I had an interview with senator Baldwin on Facebook you know so people still interact I I still get tweets about people responding and reacting so people but I I think maybe those are more people like you and I who were ...\nThey're more people like you and I who were really interested in politics so the question is have people already decided who they are voting for their will tune out no matter what happens in the debate but if you look at the Marquette poll it's always interesting to me to see where are independent voters and John you and I have talked about this\nPretty much in Wisconsin when you get this down to this point in an election you're really trying to\nEither move independence away from somebody and toward yourself or you know that's where your 'cause you're not going to move hardcore Democrats or hard core Republicans and I think both of those folks have that side or locked in\nCharles you've covered politics in the state for a long time and interesting scenario potentially lining up here where Scott Walker wins Tammy Baldwin wins this was all potential ... what's the likelihood I Want to ask you likelihood\nLay out the scenario where people split where Scott Walker gets re elected as a Republican Tammy Baldwin does as a Democrat is that feasible could that happen\nSo I always think that's what's interesting about this state why we you know not really our red state or a blue state they use this term purple state because I think yes and I go back to twenty twelve okay November twenty twelve\nYou had Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney on the ticket as well as up against Brock Obama okay and that same year\nIn the recall election voters said I Want Scott Walker you they stood with Scott Walker in a high profile\nCompetitive race and then a few months later they said we don't want the Republican choice we want the Democratic choice for governor\nAnd I think people that this is a little bit different because it's on the same ballot that day but I think Wisconsin will look at the ballot and decide on the candidate not necessarily and that's where I go back to those independents\nYou're ... you know the Republicans are going to get the Republicans the Democrats are going to get the Democrats and one of the biggest ships we saw on the market poll was independent at one point last month Tony ... was up by twenty points now is only up by six points\nAnd a senator Baldwin still holds a double digit lead on the independent and I ... I think that's where the ... the battle is right now\nThat is Charles Benson today's T. M.
