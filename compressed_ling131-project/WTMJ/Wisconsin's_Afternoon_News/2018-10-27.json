guest is our waitress she'll coach right you know because we are going to order I'm really how's it going to be a cheeseburger combination please which is yeah [noise]\nMadam Secretary and love seeing that border of saying that you've got a special ed soup and grilled cheese sandwich yeah excellent thank you so much talk about the space wars we've had a couple of guests on this program or Jim ... administrator near the grass Tyson\nWorld renowned astrophysicist that's probably a fascinating was that I I highly encourage you to go back and listen to it I think that's that's forty five minutes of some of the most interesting as a civil\nConversation about the universe you'll ever enjoy oh my gosh up so I'm going to play for you a soundbite from uh your boss secretary of defense Jim Mattis this August thirteenth turn Eighteen topic space force Eli that's number one place\nI Would not I guess\nWe had to do a lot of work\nWant to pay All right that's the defense secretary talking in general about the space forceful Jim ... administrator near the grass Tyson and said there is an issue that has to be reckoned with space is a hostile place their interest in equities United States has ... involved in our daily lives GPS all sorts of other things\nAnd yet I Want to read something to you I'm sure you're familiar with this October force this month's foreign policy I Will be the lead paragraph to\nUS President Donald Trump is pie which with air force secretary Heather Wilson over her handling of his directive to stand up a separate space force in the U.S military and he's considering ousting her after the midterm elections three sources with\nKnowledge of the matter told foreign policy can you respond to that well when when the White House denied it my husband was very disappointed [laughter]\nOkay why even though the terms it gives you ... well yeah we have a a\n... more normal normal life yeah yeah no it let me talk about where we are on the space for a first of all I I I Am completely allied with the president and he set out a very bold vision for what we have to do and here's why here's the problem with that at that Secretary Mattis talked about that we're trying to address\nThe United states feels\nA glass house in an era before the existence of stone in other words in space we we are the best in the rural space we're at our adversaries know it\nAnd they are seeking to develop the capability to deny as used up space in crisis or war\nSo think about what that means and what we do in space today there's not a military mission is in the navy in some way by space we have Seventy seven satellites about little less than half of them are GPS so the the blue dot on your phone is provided courtesy of about forty ... air force base in Colorado\nAt the uh the timing signal for the New York stock exchange comes from those satellites\nWe do communications we do whether ah we do command and control so connecting the president United States to his forces in the field all over the world\nAnd we do missile warnings so on CBS News when they do that arch of you know a missile launch from North Korea it and that comes from the air force we gather intelligence we gather intelligence take pictures listen\nSo all of those are really important missions and ... and she'll probably the last decade or so we were not really worried about what other countries might do to either jam or knock down our satellites\nIn two thousand seven the Chinese launched a missile and destroyed on orbit one of its own dead weather satellites to press types of ... both tossed out that on this very program though so the world has changed and we need to develop the capability and to point the ability to defend what we have on orbit\nAnd to prevail in space so that adversaries won't seek to deny asked the use of space and in crisis of war few ... that's the problem we're trying to sell\nYou have any reason to believe the president is peeved with you know know how you I was with them on friday right are you with him no okay\nWhat what accounts for this representation that there is some distance between you and the president on space voice [noise]\nI ... I have no idea I mean I wasn't wizards of foreign policy article I wouldn't um I I I wouldn't put my art people trying to undermine you\nI have no idea I mean I this is not a game that I play I my job is to try to make sure that the president's intent is carried out and to do it exceptionally well\nWhen Jim Wright's time was on the program he spoke to this issue not only from his perspective is the current administration but as a former member of Congress as you were that's one part of your biography we left out a long time serving member of a New Mexico's first district which I'm Glad you did you know it ruins my credibility whenever I Try to you that you know\nFederally southern southern kind of thing um but she said one of the issues that has to be resolved days there is a part of the air force that does study and work on these issues and it's an important part of the forces [noise]\nAnd don't know I may I may well our mission yes a command control and other things and if you set up a space force than you are ... by nature are setting up another command structure of the command bureaucracy for justice one issue and is that the best way to do it is that the most effective way to do it\nThese are legitimate questions even he said so 'cause he's obviously as a civilian space has been a straight or doesn't have\nA bureaucratic dog in this time but some of the described why all this with some of the equities you're involved in some of the underlying questions gymnasts was getting at is that you have to reckon with us air force are [laughter] well that's the challenge of\nCourse is the threat that we face in space and there are there's broad consensus that we need to go back to something we used to have which was the unified command so Army Navy air force unified command reporting directly to the sec death\nFor space right now space comes under a Strategic Command and there is a pretty good argument that it needs to go back to being a tone unified command and so we have a unified command in central command we have a unified command first strategic can we have a unified command for the Indo Pacific\nAnd uh we used to have one in space it was it was a\nIt was just a tablet ... after nine eleven when the real focus of the world changed towards countering violent extremism right\nAnd the national defense strategy guides us explicitly recognizes\nThat we have returned to an era of great power competition and we must focus our efforts one of the great powers were competing with well China and Russia in the short term rushes\nIs a it is a threat in the longer term China is innovating faster and is set out strategic objectives to become a major military power by twenty fifty\nAnd that includes space it OK so with the air force the week or if there was a space force\nNo I've got the the organizational structure to me I should you know form follows function\nAnd we should ... than my focus is on how do we develop the capabilities to prevail in space and ensure that we have that capacity um the the ... the organization chart is lesson is really less for you is it\nBecause it it strikes me and look I had not spend a lot of my career at the Pentagon I spent some of my career there a couple of years\nBut uh there's there's always a kind of a friendly rivalry I think it's a competitive they're going to us about the services and this is an area of expertise longstanding within the air force I Would have to think just in ...\nLongstanding within the air force I Would have to think just institutionally it'd be like we can do this we got this I Need another thing with another\nPatch and another part of the Pentagon we can do this there are a lot of there's an inclination they're forced to say we can do that well we do do the right to have that in the fifties the question is do we need to organize it in a different way given the emergence of a new threat to the new set of circumstances\nI also think and it's interesting that you talk about inter service rivalry the relationships are ... very much secretary I'm\nThe relationships at the moment between the services are exceptionally good the\nThe three of us get along and like each other we actually have breakfast together and we're working a couple of dozen issues together all the ... at the same time I'm a we also have started we go to each other's homes for dinner about once a month with our spouses so there's a\nThey they may take because they're going forward they take most of the main painters with them which means the jets that stayed behind have even she maintain her so four thousand maintain are short as of today because of the increase in funding that we received from the Congress and support from the president\nWe're only four hundred maintain are short and by December this year we will be back either\nSo so we will now there'll be a very young and then it's about training and seasoning those main caters to make sure that they they have the skills they need to be craftsman at their work\nI was sitting around a face the nation panel or a year ago when David Martin who you very well know national security courts correspondent ordinary CBS News [noise]\nA mention romantic do when you first became air force secretary and were briefed on readiness ...\nAnd he said you looked at as well just can't possibly be accurate I thought they had the columns we're ... we can't resist ill prepared of this bill fitted for our readiness mission and you look around and said give me the right now and said no to the right number ... explained that level of surprise and what you thought was\nWhen I was a young officer in Europe during the Cold War we had to be ready for the at that time the Soviet Union to come across the fold the gap at any time and so we had very high levels of readiness but we weren't taking parts of those units sending them halfway around the world to you know fight against violent extremism and then bring them back\nAnd expect them to still be ready for for the conflict in Europe so as we do know exactly so what happens is is Eunice become less ready for all of their operation\nAnd and that's really what's happened over time so so job one for the air forces to restore the readiness lethality of the force even things like munitions\nWhen we were fighting against ISIS destroying their of their declared Calif it we were using a hundred and fifty or so ... a day to destroy 'em destroy ISIS uh we were not buying munitions fast enough to replace those we were using so we've we've ...\nSo ... ... ... you said you have the columns reverse what were you looking at and what did you think of me but what what is your plan it actually but [noise]\nUnits report their readiness and that's readiness for all of their different missions and um and so you'll have a a a readiness metric on you know eighty percent of their units are ready for all of their missions or whatnot and and uh\nAnd I actually thought the columns were reversed for years because it look so bad well because they weren't all ready for every mission that they had been assigned which is not to say they wouldn't go for\nThe not ready for all your missions doesn't mean we won't go right I mean David Martin would come back we'll come back that threat at all\nLevels and that's what it that that that's the most meaningful aspect of this is you can do the mission but we wanted somebody to come\nBack as possible if we want to win fast and we want everyone to come home again where's that ready to backtrack now\nWell we are Fifteen Percent more ready today than we were two years ago and Seventy five percent of our operational squadrons are a ready with their first for force pack pack and just so so uh we're we have turned the corner\nAnd uh we are um we are working a working diligently on both readiness lethality\nReady to send lethality so a three hundred and twelve operational squadrons usa three to six is the necessary go to the villain national defense strategy prophesied mathematically you could do the math how far we are a way but in terms of years an actual fulfilling a how far\nAway to the study that we were asked to do looks out to twenty twenty five twenty thirty time Frank 'cause it's not supposed to be a moment in time today it's supposed to look out to the future\nAnd to say what we do need that moderate risk given the protections of the threat at that time to be able to implement the national defense strategy\nThe difference between and I were not naive about where the money would come from for this and the other challenges that we faced I've I worked on Capitol Hill and understand those trade offs but we were asked\nTo say that the airports and had historically than saying All right if this is the money we're giving here's the air force we would build for that amount of money now we are being asked and had been asked what is the air force you need to execute the strategy when you're giving you a different question\nYes [noise] and [noise]\nIt's I Believe the president's\nFame and desire to give you and the other services the money necessary for the air force or service you need\nThe ah the increase and the certainty that we've gotten over the last two years if that has been tremendously helpful this the first year in ... decades I think now that you're a force and the other services have had a on appropriations fail so we've we've actually started a year with the budget right and that's a big\nDeal and we're going to get to the other on the other side of this right

hate crime the FBI is running this investigation because of that hate crime element in play here [noise]\nLike I said in the opening segment I really don't know what's age talking points I'm supposed to use your I I just I don't know and that's probably not good radio one oh one for hosts I just don't know so let's go to you and and you can help we can just talk this out here\nLet's start with cannon pie walkie Ken good afternoon you're on WGM Jay\nYou good afternoon I'm really in favor of the second job weapon carry because we get a lot of good people out there that you know what to do with a gun in case something happens like this year I'm not advocating shooting the people at random but something like that here yeah people need to be stopped\nAnd I I think the key here can if we really think about both sides budging a little bit giving a little bit as is the definition of compromise when you give a little bit but the key element you mentioned is the\nThe training the education the knowledge of okay I Am an armed guard at the church\nDo why am I trained do I know how to do what to do and everything like that because that as I perceive it is one of the scary things for people who say you're crazy you can't put an armed guard in a classroom or school or in the church because\nThere's a potential there that they may fire when they shouldn't and whatnot it's all about the training in the education of that person who has the responsibility of protection\nThat's true but the other thing that they have a problem with there's a lot of places that were no guns allowed or are they like that then they target\nYeah if I Know what I mean it's like you said both ways but it's\nEasy for people to go into a place that there's no guns\nAnd because they know nobody in fact going to have a concealed weapon or guard\nThanks for the call can I Do appreciate it you have bad sign and that's the decision by that property that company that business whatever\nFor that sign to say\nNo firearms allowed are you not than kind of if not inviting certainly saying anybody who would be\nEvil and have these hate filled evil thoughts and manifest them and to motivate the action or you're not saying we are at target that's a valid point John and couldn't OSHA Hi John you're on WGM Jay\n[noise] Hi I'm a complicated problem oh yeah what\nCan be resolved in the same manner as most people in this country resolve their differences and hosted insurance very beginning and that's not an overall policy from the\nLetters some big brother thing but each each individual parish\nChurch that I go to school [noise] really as to say okay we got a group of people here we have an armed guard you'll be singled out by the madman taken out because he's sitting there with a big red light on its head\nSo it has to be maybe two three four how many individuals that concealed carry within parish within a synagogue schoolteachers you don't know where they are whether they're or they're either does\nThe perpetrator um [noise] also the earlier callers said about the science my community or the bank it had the science gun free zone there were four times in a year to other banks within a mile them\nSisters did not have those signs and having been around once [noise]\nUm so again he said if they know that there's nobody caring hope the guy's not stupid he's going to come in and take 'em out as opposed to the other ones which are questionable that you might get killed so I just think that every community every parish every synagogue every school should say\nWithin its own numbers would you be willing to do this to help defend us in the event that were attacked and that's how I Would resolve the Asher\nThanks for the call John John ... a couple of very well stated

let's hit a Walker show and Paul joins us on WGM Jay Paul\nHi um I really appreciate your humble approach to the subject which is a very difficult one [noise] um and located lie you know you're supposed to know all the answers\nI have no answers though after a while like\nWell I'm showing a typical programs um and um I Know my my thing is there are just going to happen there are the two hundred and fifty million people he had one\nCan take their sent this tree ... million that are where does that something was going to happen show it's gonna happen there's nothing you can ... from gun control ... going to get whatever again ... need [noise]\nI think we're now has to happen is gearing up to a reaction to it to cooperation make their own missions\nOn yellow yeah you've got an ... guy that would\nBe you got to be prepared unfortunately when you go to church\nAlso asshole on thinking about you ought to be thinking about jobs and you know positive stuff but it's um it's a reality today and\nToo much of it is political change in gun control law new gun control and all that crap [noise] which is which is a wave 'em what really is going on you or you name mainly the dealing with a ... year mark yet politically involved one ... the other\nI appreciate apologized to let you go here and I appreciate your comments it is I'll say this right now in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in that neighborhood\nSurrounding the tree of life congregation synagogue squirrels hill neighborhood you know the last thing they're thinking about right now his politics\nThe very last thing they're thinking about right now in that area let's squeeze in a grant in Green Bay joining us here in WGM Jay good afternoon grant\nHow are you today let's say you sir\nWell let me start by taking your back a few years to nine eleven actually pre nine eleven\nIf you get any flying back then you could go into an airport basically just walk on a plane and you you can go somewhere and then nine eleven came along and we had all this security and everybody was up at all I'm not going to fly anymore there's just so inconvenient well what's the difference between nine eleven and today\nIs because today it's part of our lives we just accept it there\nThere are no longer any boundaries in this world shoulder and that schools churches\nNothing matters and so we have to protect ourselves so I think schools churches all these uh my my children go to school and they have a door and we used to be able just walked in the door now the doors locked there is a camera there\nYou have to ring a bell they can see who's at the door there is a guard there is something if you're not supposed to be there they're prepared for you\nI mean it's a shame that what we have to go through but what steps are you that you're just gonna let it go and say no we're not going to do anything this is the house of God God will protect us\nOh God didn't say you can't protect yourself so we need to do something about it and I think security and a half the priority in this country\nAnd it has been since nine eleven that's a pretty accurate analogy I appreciate the call Graham thank you have a good rest of the weekend\nThere has to be a level of proactive his do all this\nAnd that may be as my favorite word so far in the forty five minutes or so we've been talking there were that Ellen brought up with her church\nAnd yet as the gentleman said a moment ago\nThere are no boundaries are there any truth safe places anymore is is there truly a safety system some semblance of you want to say gun control or or something that can protect us twenty four seven three sixty five\nSadly that's not the case it isn't so then you have to look at how can in this world that we live in right now how can we best protect ourselves reasonably rationally respond simply\nBecause too quickly\nOver the next few hours dare I say\nCertainly by Monday the political rhetoric will take over\nAnd the conversation we're having right now which I have appreciated greatly because we have been some really nice salient remarks\nThese are the type of conversations that you need to have with people who have opposing view points when it comes to arming of teachers for example in classrooms are arming a security guard inside your church\nThere are elements like the costs related to security that all would have to be overcome at some point by talking with someone who disagrees with you\nAnd you can do so rationally calmly and with as little political overtones and under tones as possible maybe than\nSomething changes bit by bit things are changing though as Ellen in Brookfield said her church now has those I don't know if they were really security guards but there were people monitoring the grounds during services you don't know who they are the kind of like air marshals\nWe don't know who they are maybe that's the way to go do arm them I don't know all I Know is that today it was a synagogue a couple of years ago it was a Baptist church\nAnd of course twenty twelve it was a Sikh temple so there really is no protected religion protected ethnicity protected class\nWe have seen kindergartners torn apart by bullets in Connecticut we had seen on the other end of the spectrum adults workplace shootings and violence there\nAnd violence there this is an evil and the hatred that has no boundaries\nIt is blind in that respect\nEvil is blind and it finds victims of all ages of all ethnicities ethnicities regardless of religion that's the world we live and how do we combat it\n\nBeing proactive is a start and we need to start and some have more\nOf your calls I for one for seven and nine one six twenty be asking a mortgage talking text line when we come back on WGM jak\nLayer GM Jay Bybee for
