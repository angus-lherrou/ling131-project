Boston Store went into bankruptcy wasn't able to come out of it Sears has been heading this way for a long time and they've been making a variety of deals over the last couple of years where they reached shuffled their debt\nIn an effort to try to stay in business but the truth of the matter is there's only so much of that they can do there there's not too many financial experts that thinks it's yours is gonna be able to emerge from this and again I I don't play 'em\nI don't play shopping ... a retail store analyst but I don't see how the Sears story ends any different than the the bond time story ended any different than a lot of other stories ended\nI think it's interesting how we got there though when when I when my parents moved to Milwaukee years and years ago Nineteen sixty seven the largest retail the big go to store yeah they had Boston stores and they had gambles but there was a Sears store on north avenue and it was it was the whole block\nAnd if you needed anything you you got it I mean if anything you need it you went to the Sears store on on north avenue and I can remember every year the Sears Christmas catalog would come out and that would be at the big thing here is really was where America shopped\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty that as the academic mortgage talk and text line Sears was where America shock not any more down to a relative handful of stores across the country into bankruptcy the Sears come out of it or is this\nIs this not just the beginning of the end is this one step before the end of the end will Sears continue to exist as a viable\nStore and brand a year from now for one for seven nine nine when six twenty and if it's going if it's going to disappear why is that my guess is maybe years ago you did shop at its years what happened we discuss next for what for seven nine nine what six twenty to twenty four ...\n... mortgages and equal housing order animal is I Need to provide through six eight this is Brian wicker chief savings officer I was looking at some market share numbers and I am amazed at how many normally thrifty Wisconsin I it's just leisurely an crazily go with their\nBank when it comes to their mortgage a lot of you must do think he will somehow get a better deal or any easier process if you go with your back the reality is your bank simply has a lot higher overhead than low overhead high efficiency academic someone has to pay for all the bank branches vice\nThis mortgages so we've also come up with the simplest most pleasant and efficient process for getting along the starch by clicking on a ... button that I can uh dot com so if you're buying a home or you've been putting off or ... lower your payment to cash out or pay off higher adjustable rate balances don't let your heart or money on fire by going with your bank\nWhere she got the guys with the rockets or a mortgage company would overpaid law officers I don't know how much you can save today at a C.

going to lose another hundred and forty two stores\nBy the end of the year that's on top of another forty six disclose closures um that should bring them down to around ballpark five hundred stores at one point in time Sears is the largest retailer in the country\nI I'm Sorry I just don't see how they come back from this and I I feel bad for the sixty some thousand employees across the country are going to lose their jobs but I I think yours is a relic of the past jak downtown jak WGM Jake good afternoon\nHow's it going good what do you think um\nI think fear than the old ana like fear took out a lot of the mind places you know in the fifties and everything and\nThis year I mean remember how people with winter stuff out of the Sears catalog and stuff like that that you couldn't find that that was the big thing here when I get the bike or we're by the bike from Sears get it delivered in time for Christmas\nAbs well everybody circled everything they wanted for gray and now and now I'm going to take them out this is the way it is and you know they didn't modernize at the time that they were the first you know on line or not on line by mail order doing it\nAnd now they didn't go to the online world as much as everyone else that so yeah I think there are relics they're saying oh\nNo effective I I think you're exactly right I mean I just\nI really like is is the word that I that I Would use there was\nThere was a time where Sears Sears had the stuff that that you wanted to have I mean you had you know they had in many respects they hit the appliance world cornered you know and and they had the tools world cornered and all but that just that wasn't enough after a while I think what happened was\nIs the I don't know how you used to stay in a business selling appliances it's tough because people just don't buy that made a point you buy a refrigerator in the refrigerator last for ten or Fifteen Years you buy you know the stove it's er washer dryer whatever there there's just not enough new people coming in buying dryers to sustain the other stuff\nUm you you had the tool department that I think was always big those were the two highlights I think again the appliances in the tools but that wasn't enough I mean Sears\nCenter let's for people who who might not quite understand how this works what ... what did these really offer now the duration ... was just up to less than a year but we what are some of the differences between these plans and end Obamacare\nBut there is no required type of coverage so it doesn't have to cover to cover their whatever this is this is a free market plan whatever a consumer\nContracts with an insurer you can buy that play on there's just no Obamacare mandate sign up but you know one thing that President Trump attitude is now increased it from nine to three or four days\nBut you can renew these things for three years looking at his insurance companies wanted by charge little bit more of that guaranteed renewable but they can do that so it really protects consumers and gives consumers a choice\nBut yeah you don't have the Obamacare mandate which was which is what caused\nInsurance plans on the individual market to double triple quadruple in many cases\nSo if I'm let's say my concern is I Want coverage for a catastrophic situation if if somebody that again that catastrophic situation but\nI really don't care if she ... and getting coverage for this type of checkup or or whatever I can pick and choose and I can still get that coverage and can get it the stuff that I Want in a much more affordable rate\nYeah way more affordable again according to eat healthy from sixteen thousand dollars for the cheapest Obamacare plan that has all the bells and whistles to maybe as little as twelve hundred dollars a year for ... family of three now that that probably has a catastrophic care plan\nThat family has decided to pay for more things out of pocket up front or they're relatively healthy ... why should they be paying insurance\nThat covers all these really unhealthy people not just that was the faulty architecture of Obamacare\nIs it for a very small percentage of American population people that have to buy the insurance with the after tax dollars on the individual market they are paying the full cost the full sauces social costs are guaranteed people resist conditions it's just not fair\nHow do you think that it's all turns out senator 'cause we're not obviously the whole preexisting condition issue has become an issue in Wisconsin governor's race was with Governor Walker and until ... does he just in the Governor Walker doesn't want to protect people with pre existing condition the pre existing conditions I mean I\nI mean we I think everybody Republican Democrat recognizes that something important it just a question of of what's the best way to do it right\nBeside so again it's it's it is this honesty on the part of the Democrats\nThe American people decided we want to cover everybody regardless represents inventions or not now if you take a look at the right way of doing it you can do something like the main visible high risk pool they passed guaranteed issue which is covering people with preexisting conditions and their premiums double and triple predictably\nThat was acceptable so they didn't repeal guaranteed issue but they should try that within visible high risk pool and predictably their premiums were reduced to a federal level for young people they'll cut in half for the elderly\nSo there's a we're designing this courthouse or Republicans didn't even want to do that during the volunteer debate because they didn't want to touch the issue of pre existing conditions of ten foot pole so\nAgain nobody no Republican wants to take away those protections against pre existing conditions when the Democrats said we do they are lying through their teeth it is so dishonest and you can tell you fired up about it because it is so dishonest\nLet's switch gears for a little bit I I Know I'm at the end of last week you you sent a letter to the director of the Federal Bureau of administration in your role as a again a member of the committee for homeland security and governmental affairs ... what information are you trying to get from the FBI why\nWell I mean that's specific quieter as I Want the memos that Andrew McCabe wrote memorializing his meeting with Rod Rosenstein and and uh we used to page\nFor just a very very focused oversight whether there but this really came prompted from the threat hearing where directory testified before the very end of that hearing we first talked about the threats\nAt the very start asking director a about the all the oversight letters I sent to him that have really been either not responded to a dollar or got an armed response response and hopefully I'll be going back to D.C next week to sit down and direct rate he uh committed doing so\nBy the ... this was beyond absurd how long this entire issues in terms of the FBI investigation or over the Russian\nA deal to be the fact that we don't know really what the FBI putting those Pfizer award applications I asked directory why why don't you just like a band they just rip it off all the schools are get this behind us so the FBI can average credibility and take it a restored because right now that's under questions\nLaid it does almost seem like it's not every day every week or every other week there's something that comes up whether it's it seems like some of the stuff that just being slow rolled and and we we end up having the same conversation wondering what was going on at the FBI you know two years ago I agree I guess I don't understand\nWhy just let it all out there and then then move on with whatever it shows that shows\nHave is drip drip drip is not good for the agency and yeah my guess Geoff as the other right now they always say oh you know we can't give you a separation because it reveals sources and methods and puts national security risk trust me\nNo member of Congress wants to put those things that risk\nMy own personal opinion is that this is being withheld because the information if it were revealed is going to be embarrassing to individuals or to the agency and that's not acceptable response that is not acceptable reason to withhold this from the American people\nThat you know when when they were withholding information from Congress there withholding information to the public has a right to know\nCenter ... let me ask you about the ... the story that I was overseas last week in the story that we certainly can consuming a lot of people when we had to do with Saudi Arabia and the disappearance of the exiled Saudi journal\nCNN is saying that the Saudi Government is preparing to acknowledge that the journalist was killed 'em in in their custody ... how how should the U.S react to this\nBut we should wait to see exactly how this crime is going to be solved exactly what happened if that means prosecuting if there really were robust ... well they better identify them and and we'd better get an a\nHonest investigation of that but this could be a game changer and America was Saudi relationship this was completely unacceptable behavior I think there are certainly signed a letter I'm actually a instituting Magnitsky Act sanctions against Saudi Arabia I don't know exactly where this goes but if this is\nBasically true with this was ordered by for example the crown prince back completely changed our relationship with that the with the Saudi Government\nHow important is the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia in in that region ambiance is this an issue that I guess it is worth blowing that up over if if the worst case scenario happens to play out\nNo yeah I I wouldn't ever say we should blow up our relationship I think you would change it 'em knowing our relationship Saudi Arabia is ... is incredibly important because Saudi Arabia is a is it more\nStabilizing influence in the middle east what do you compare it to Iran because they're harder to Iran and Iran's influence as very malign some licking influence\nIn the middle east and and the Saudi Arabia and Iran are obviously at loggerheads so they'll just from a standpoint of a counter Iraq Iran's aggression or Saudi Arabia is a key ally from that standpoint plus they do control about a third of the world's oil\nAlso it's also there are also important player I I certainly\nWould like to see them reform and of course the the whole promises crown prince ... you're going to bring more more moderation reforms to the people Saudi Arabia but again this will be fused with disappointing if this uh all bears out to be true\nHe center before I let you go let me let me ask you to put on your political pundit hat or some of the\n... and again I I it's you know I'm extremely skeptical and polls if you believe the polls you wouldn't have been a senator [laughter] you know you would have lost both your elections if if we watch some of those polls some extremely skeptical of this but\nUm some of the new polling suggests that uh the particularly in in the Senate Republicans a number of your colleagues may be doing better than we originally thought you think there is some Republican momentum\nI I Would do things ... and yet I have to hope that the people who use are common sense when when when they see how the left behaves if for example two dollars and loving storming the the capital Madison vandalized the capital and when they see\nYou know Democrats willing to just throw overboard that the bedrock principle of our judicial system the presumption of innocence and then the way they're you know their supporters behaved\nUm it's really pretty shameful including the secretary Clinton's you said you cannot be civil with the political party wants to destroy you destroy you stand for what you care about so so she's got support him civility ... the threats of harassment which could lead to violence if Republicans don't agree\nWith her brand of socialism or her open borders or support for sanctuary cities or catch relief higher taxes\nOver regulation I mean it is beyond the pale with Secretary Clinton said what Maxine Waters Cory Booker so my bottom line yeah I think Americans I hopefully Wisconsin I take a look at that that bad behavior on the part of Democrats that overreaction the mob type of mentality\nWithout successful for the calls develop right here in Wisconsin\nHave become the standard for patient care you're in the United states and\nBe part of this

not very often I Can't remember the last time this was maybe two thousand eleven when it's the middle of October and the Packers aren't the top sports story in Wisconsin or the brewers taken all the oxygen out of the room\nI don't think statewide I think I said it's still a Packers but here in Milwaukee I think we maybe take a little bit more ownership and I know obviously we're heard all over the state you're on WGM Jay but I'm from home base here in Milwaukee I think that the brewers have kind of taken some of the air out of the room especially with the Packers I'll do a little bit of a slow started to June one\nSo you can hear the Packers coming up on Ninety four or five K. TI country the niners Doug coming in or one in four plants in the NFL take away they have only three they're starting quarterback has done for the year that seems to be the recipe for the Packers the get healthier or on the record side of things before they go into the by way\nDoesn't it yeah they don't want to call it a must win but a kind of it is for them this early in the season\nOne thing that helps them is that the bears last yesterday and you know there's no team that has really stepped up and said we're going to be the class of the NFC North\nSo after last week's lawsuit Detroit I think there was some soul searching that goes on but you've got this game that's very very winnable and almost a must win because it's not bad San Francisco as you mentioned that a\nJimmy ... they're starting quarterback their mega bucks starting quarterback is all out for the season with the ...\nThen it got to buy a week and then look at this schedule afterwards in than the next three weeks at Los Angeles against the unwritten rams then at New England who just knocked up together and be yesterday in Kansas City\nMiami's no cakewalk ... they're the team to be Chicago yesterday that will be a level field at least and then ask the adolescent at Minnesota oh man that's rough this is a rough schedule coming up so you need that wind going into the Bible you can't have you straight losses with the rams and patriots on the roads are you in the face\nDoug Russell is with us talking Packers coach McCartney says he has complete faith and and make them Crosby I'm sure he does it's going to be in the thirties limbo it's going to be windy in limbo it'll be interesting to see Doug it's in some scenarios where he would normally attempt to feel though he decides to ponder decides to go forward and said\nWell I think there is that no man's land in the middle of the field where you have to think about it any way somewhere between the thirty thirty and forty five yard line where it doesn't make any sense to try to punt because it's probably just going to go into the end zone anyway coughing corners\nThat doesn't really happen much anymore in the NFL and its too long ago a field goal to try I was surprised that mission Crosby is tried it out there for fifty six yard or last week even though it was in a dome and perfect conditions and all that\nI'm just based on the fact that he already missed four times three feel goes and an extra point earlier in the game yes you miss that fifty six yard or as well so [noise]\nWe'll make 'em think twice I don't think so because she has a lot of confidence amazing Crosby it was it was a bad day you hope it doesn't become anything more than\nThat hey Doug we've only got one minute left I wanted to ask you about Jimmy Graham we know he's not the player he was a young receiver tight and several years ago how big is the drop off then from what you see on tape\nThe drop off is it significant from the standpoint that he's not getting the passes that he got earlier in his career but he's also drawing a lot more attention now than he has earlier in his career and I think part of that is because of the injuries to the wide receivers the veteran wide receivers\nThat the Packers have had in his those guys get healthy and get more reps and get back into the line of talking specifically of course not random called the bond Adams drawn into Alison as they get back into the lined up and get back into the fold you'd probably see Jimmy Graham maybe get a few more passes ... defenders\nDoug Russell Packers insider Doug thank you so much for carving out a little bit of time over ... ... it is three twenty seven WGM Jay hates the home town called Turner how it's tonight\nThis is a free event this is cool a massive screen will be showing the game and seeking it up with the call of hall of famer Bob euchre it's tonight it's free doors open five thirty Turner how come on out it's going to be a whole lot of fun it's euchre um the radio and the brewers on the big screen we hope you'll join us\nRight now let's check out some news about your money it's Matthew test uh with the WTO O.

all credit to them I mean they always seem to put us in the rye spots you would make it in that adjustments and that moves and there's been numerous times where they've moved me three or four steps in very next pitches it right there so that's a credit to to the people that do the work but in the time for that um\nAnd for us it's just if we're in the right spot we're going to make the play and more

of your schedule well let's talk about what has been the topic this week hearing titled town and that is slow starts now everyone's talking about the deficit for the first half of the first quarter the Packers are being scored forty two to Thirteen and the first quarter of their games\nLarry what's the product to that and what is the solution for the Packers as you see it well and the thing about it is is because of those points totals there not trailing by a little bit it changes the complex from the game and suddenly the game plan or the approach that they were going to take\nChanges because you have to change it got to get back into the saying we're not talking about trading ... are trading field goals or trade Dutch we're talking about we gotta get back into the game and and even when you're down twenty four nothing has\nI mean that just throw everything out the window we got to throw it all over the field get back into this as a result they rented only six times in the second half of Detroit Green Bay averages forty three point to passing attempts per game that is six tires\nIn the NFL and the only ever twenty two point to rushing attempts for game and quite frankly they run the football very well averaging four point six yards per rushing attempt no and again and Mike mccarthy is certainly aware of that fact but again the game situation has dictated\nThat can't be to run and football team that they could be mhm if they kept games relatively close enough they proceeded normally the other thing are dropped passes slow in the fence but penalties overall on this football team rock\nCertainly third most forty three accepted penalties against Green Bay fifty in total seven were turned down\nBut um that's a lot of penalties overcome and a lot of yard he's averaging almost eight penalties pregame and over eighty yards per game that's a heck of a deficit to try to overcome those by memory serves me right there are two games for triple digit yards yeah they were penalize other Washington in Detroit if\nMemory serves me correctly and that's and to some extent I get the thing some penalties are going to happen and then the heat of battle that combative penalties I can live with those but you're not getting triple digit your average\nA penalty total ... and Justin combat or penalties there's there's the motion penalties illegal formation federal is the things like that that can be prevented those those ... thirty eight percent of the penalties have been either pre snap or conduct penalties of course that includes some of the rocking the pastor calls at\nTwo of which we will document that probably should not have been penalties on clay Matthews but daddy right Dennis that's kind of been bucking the Packers doubt especially early in ballgames tonight will be interesting to see what they can do against the bank of San Francisco squad that you know if they don't turn it over a they're dangerous way\nNot winning on first and

director of football content for Sean media as we look at the results from yesterday I got to ask you how did the bears lose it Miami to backup quarterback brought ...\n[laughter] well that is I mean for those who watch the game I think they know the barriers went looking for every way they could find to lose a football game and they got what they deserved a it was an ugly gamed either Miami or the bears really did deserved to win a there were some questionable\nDecisions made by the rookie head coach Mitt Maggie particularly\nUh at the end of regulation when they had a chance to get the ball back with a minute twelve laugh and he let the ... going down to forty one seconds before he called time out\nAnd then the dolphins punted now you know I don't know if you're going to score in a minute twelve but uh some other stuff late in the second half but then in overtime or they get a fumble from the dolphins that the goal line a huge played by ...\nAnd then Jordan our takes them right down the field of twenty yard run a sixteen yard run\nThey're basically at the forty four yard line and instead of going for the throat\nHe decides to run three diet plays and have Cody park you trap fifty three yard field goal in Cody park he doesn't have a fifty three hour leg he misses it and then gives the dolphins two minutes to come back and win the game so or the defense came up flat for the first time all year long they played well and the first half they will do it in the second half a hundred degree heat index\nBut the conditions were the same for both teams and and what happened with the dolphins Albert Wilson made two huge plays a\nA forty three yard bubble screen for a touchdown and Seventy five yard bubbles screen for touched on which the bears defense\nMissed multiple tackle so uh one of those things the barest came up flat I Do think they're much improved football team obviously not as good as people were talking about at three in one dolphins aren't as bad as they looked in those two roles losses the New England in Miami has a New England Cincinnati as they get to foreign to\nHobbits that time already it seems like there's a lot of talk about coaches being in trouble Jason Garrett obviously with a great performance yesterday but they're ... they're cutter but just relieved is the fact according to Mike Smith which coaches you think are on the hot seat\n[noise] well I think they're cutter certainly isn't and if he wasn't there because of his coaching he put himself there\nAre two weeks ago in Chicago when he said we should fire everybody and start with me and then he was right after that performance and it didn't get any better yesterday and I don't know that the Glazer family is in a hurry to make a move but he's somebody you really want to keep an eye on because a lot of people didn't think he would survive at the end of last season\nThen you've got Vance Joseph in Denver who are again was almost everybody assumed he was dead men walking though it was going to fire him I'm black Monday the week went on and he finally announced after a week to Joseph would be back but\nBroncos after winning their first two it had a couple of games that we showed up and competed yesterday but there's no question\nThat that he is in real trouble um\nAnd then you've got to keep an eye on below Brian and they seem to turn things around there are a little bit uh but he's been there too long for that team to be playing as as mediocre as they are\nUm uh and then beyond that you know Todd Bowles as a guy you want to keep an eye on although they did have a nice offensive outburst yesterday\nUh I think this is going to continue to build their three or four other guys Jason Garrett you know certainly saved himself the foreseeable future with that performance yesterday but you got to believe that that's going to be coming to an end in Dallas to cause the cowboys set him up to fail that that is no better\nThan a five hundred football team if they play their best and they probably won't get there and that's because of the roster they gave him but we're pretty sure that the Jones will end up making during the fall the\nHub before just ask you about sites game here what about the giants there one in five ... ... a couple of Super Bowls ... twenty times there's been a lot of criticism about his performance ... says hey they're sticking with him what do you see with that situation\n[noise] [noise] well I I think part of the issue is the fact that patch armor\nWas with Cal Saturday and I didn't think it was a big certainly wasn't a big surprise um look delete gamble because of the hot finish and and what they did was they put five primetime games for the forty niners all of the bunch this is the first and we have five like in a row\nSo that's the tough part and um it's white teams or don't want the quarterbacks I I I I did a college game Saturday with chip Kelly who's the coach and I was talking to him on the sideline before the game and he has a quarterback\nIs college job now that can run and and he told me I Will not put any designed runs in for him he'll he'll extent plays will use his legs but I'm not going to put design runs in because he has to be out there and he looks at me and he was\nJust looking when you went through [laughter] so I mean he is the point is your quarterback isn't worth it

dot com let's get right back to mark the immigration has one touchdown catch through five games has he been a disappointment\nGood question Dennis uh I don't think I I wouldn't say disappointment I think if you're strictly look\nI don't think I I wouldn't say disappointment I think if you're strictly looking at numbers you are hoping for more I thought last week there were some opportunities missed and you're not going to get a ton and the running him I think anybody anticipated immigrants coming in here and being a you know a dominant point of attack\nA locker what you were hoping for and what you were looking is any written some issues that you had Jimmy ... could have race and you throw the you know with his you saw that in the pre season that she had and everybody was up in arms like looking at catch radius and\nWhen push comes to shove you just throw the football up and Jimmy grandma get bad as the part that you haven't seen it I'd say if there was a disappointment part to Jimmy grab it would be\nThat he hasn't made those big impact plays yet but to say that just barely lost his up just because I don't think so I think when you when you talk about what he is not giving you from a number standpoint if you look at that Chicago Berg immigrate and that was four weeks ago a lot of coverage lot of attention drawn to him\nThere is a value to that but the bottom line as he came here to be a productive player and really a critical target in the red zone we saw that last week the red zone efficiency was not good enough you put the ball automation cross before he had a bad day and next thing you know you lose a football game should've won\nA doctor parrot everything the Martin said but I think purely from a number standpoint you do have to say he's a disappointing because of the fact you burn up\nA only one touched down in the Chicago game is more of an equally so you know the fact nearly the reception to that game open things up for other players but I don't remember the\n... when you talk about red zone often said Richard efficiency and where this team is I think you have to evaluate all phases it's not just Jimmy grand but he is definitely part of it but he's not just a red zone tied in I mean he supposed to be a guy that you can throw do\nAnywhere on the field I was expecting more than a hundred targets this year you know average of eight targets for game he's averaging seven target the game so it's not a question of that he's not getting the ball outside of weak one it's just he hasn't been productive enough when he has been catching the ball so I mean I Would say for number sample yes it has been at this one\nSo last season was he called ten touchdowns what the Seahawks right and people said they didn't know how to use it right so you know I think parents around here we are thinking oh my goodness what's he going to do in Green Bay with Aaron Rodgers yeah here too on even years watching technically three if you want to again but the last two around even with Seattle because two years ago he has nine hundred receiving yards last year at ten touchdowns within doesn't have the receiving art\nI still don't think it's been a disappointment though because if you look at it right now [noise] excuse me he's on pace for Seventy four catches some pays for seven hundred and some yard age right now I'm receiving among tight end of the NFL and he probably would have had a touchdown three weeks ago against the Minnesota Vikings if they didn't pick up a random\nAre holding call and tell them that looked like a pancake to me so\nWhatever the case may be they need more out of them I won't do that but I Do believe in my own opinion he has a hundred or game for him to the rest of it away\nSo mark the Packers are two two and one as we know with road trips after the body to play the rams and the patriots here's this most when\nI I I I Know you didn't say it was a urgent or must win it's not a must win and the fact that if you lose this game the season's over it's not like\nYou know the Carolina game last year was a must win game but I think just from a feel good standpoint and where this team in at the schedule is going to get really difficult there's no doubt about it you're you're talking about the the heat of the ... the heat of the scheduled comes up right after the by\nYou're playing a team you should be you're playing at home you're playing them without their starting quarterback\nSo you need to win the game now you if you want to put a must win a moniker on it I don't but it's something that I just don't understand I think everybody in this everybody here everybody in that lock reviews that says we need to win this dance\nSo I Will say it this way Jeff I mean if you lose this game tonight you're going to have a losing season\nWell let's get into the weeds are a little bit alright beyond after the by you mentioned ramps and patriots there's three other pretty tough road game Seahawks a on a short week I'm just glad Minnesota you have to play at Chicago right All right now\nIf you assume ten ... ten five but one gets you into the postseason with where the Packers are now if they go to in three and those five ... games\nThey have to win the rest of their games which would include tonight obviously and you're talking about on the road against the jets who knows you know how good or bad they're going to be\nGiving the falcons here at home getting the dolphins here at home so you know you want to give yourself a little bit of a margin of error I'm not going to say if they lose this game that season over even if they lose this and it's going to be a losing record but if you lose the game here tonight\nIt's going to be a very long climbed getting to the postseason when you consider how difficult the schedule is going to be not just in the next two weeks after the ... but for the rest of the season\nYou know west I I Know this was going to come off as I'm dwelling on the negative but if you lose at home one in four team playing their backup quarterback that's not a good look it is not a good look but I always I I I used to have a rule was probably when it started depressed because that there are no must win games in the first eight weeks of the season\nThen I changed that rule the not the first eleven games this season because I saw what happened\nIn two thousand sixteen and run the table\nSo from that perspective I don't think it's a must win but the Packers you got to go back to what they were talking about the end of last year they want to be at a team that's a one or two C they want to have home field advantage for the playoffs these are the kinds of games that you have to take care of business of because on the other side of this\nThere's some interesting match up against the rams and against you know the the patriots so I always shy away from saying most when but yes this is a game that you need to take care of business no doubt final question\nOr we get down like this\nAnd we still feel like we're going to come back again and all the time and I think the the things even was put in those are different physicians we never pointing\nFingers we never said anything everybody had to look in our life guy as well as don't get to stop and get all kinds of all back so they can get into a rhythm and\nWe all we have that mentality hopefully come in and he starts to show up more you know we have to stop me nuts for what all the teams and these things a lot of stuff happening I'm usually on a different game\nThat's traumatic Williams mark I wanted to ask you the Packers defense currently ranked force in the NFL and yards allowed even my patent kind of downplayed that this past week how would you assess how the Packers defenses play to this point\nI I think it's been better than expected at you you knew there was going to be some growing pains and I thought you know against some of the better quarterbacks especially in the first half it's been a little inconsistent\nBut for the most part when you see what other defenses are doing around the NFL and how difficult it is to play defense now with these rules\nI think you have to be optimistic about the direction where's this defense is going now you have to clean things up obviously but right now with some of the some of the struggles that you've seen a other teams having my patents group I think it's exceeded expectations that\nJeff the Packers favored by nine and a half side forty niners starting CJ ... quarterback out of Iowa passed for three hundred and forty nine yards against Arizona last week but as we talked about earlier in the show\nWe had five turnovers many of them by bathrooms that really do them in that game the first three losses came on the road to playoff contenders the Vikings chiefs and chargers\nKyle Shanahan and GM John Lynch both have six year contracts they're only the second year so this is a long project for them to grapple of injury obviously set them back how do you look at the forty niners\nWhile you know you go back to the end of last year and there was definitely a lot of optimism around the same because of the way the garage below played but you know coming into this year I think you know look\nYou got the rams they're the dominant team in the west and and you still probably wouldn't have some growing pains here with the forty niners but we're talking with that Robin tonight noted some of the inconsistencies of this team and you know a lot like the Packers they can play well for a half\nBut they can't seem to put four quarters together and you know even in their blown victory this year against Detroit I'm you know that one could have gotten away from it at the end so\nI'm ... you have a lot of injuries that you're dealing with a nobody likes to use injuries as an excuse but the reality is you just start to run out of play makers and I think that was the case certainly last week or for the forty niners are in their last Arizona but you know having settled that we learned us or against buffalo would certainly earned it against the Redskins earlier this year\nYou can't take anything for granted a in the NFL and everything is tough everything is aren't I'm so even though you say well CJ ... and\nYou know I mean how dangerous can't ... and you know against three of their key officer players are playing tonight but they're all banged up a fact of the matter is we seen the Packers team you know not executed off that's why they're in the position to rent it to do with one so you didn't get home as you mentioned the point spread of me everything should be going the Packers every year but\nUm it's gonna be tough and as it always is and and and especially this year the NFL just been so weak the weak it's so hard to evaluate where all of these teams are\nFor energy and John Lynch in his second season and only eleven forty niners remain from before he took over for starters to specialists\nFor years have an NFL worst three takeaways they're tied for twenty fours and we felt with nine sex their defense mark has been a disappointment to anchor of their defensive line is the forest but your\nSix seven three hundred pounds how old are you block of tall defensive linemen\nUh you'd be tall as well have long arms I I think it's more about the arm length
