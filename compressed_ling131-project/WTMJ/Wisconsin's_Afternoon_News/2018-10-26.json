absolutely John\nHey so I was looking up some stuff this was hard to believe but you look at the league now in guys that are considered very good tackles in our league that have a couple of holding calls every year maybe a handful of penalties when I was looking at your stuff it never happened once the secrets of playing ... line play\nI'm not sure never I mean it's great I I definitely a wrong with that but it was limited yeah I you know when you have ... come in at a training camp the rest of always come in and talk to talk to you about what they look or and you know how you say it will be free as you possibly can and I was being stuck out with the the ... say\nIf you if your feet ... feet that when you get in trouble so that you can get you get at an angle where your feet are brought\nUp a guy that you're trying to block that way and all of a sudden you're launching out in your hands or or expose but if your eat today in front of the guy which is easier said than done that typically is when you do you stay penalty free and that's what I tried to do as much like\nA market love have any on the show I Want to ask you another all kinds of line question so there's all kinds of line it seems like they are given Aaron Rodgers a lot of time that passing game has been up and down but not for lack of protection and other running games been really strong as well how would you evaluate how this all sense of line has played the first quarter of the season\nI think they've been pretty good uh you know with running the football and you heard this week they are not getting enough crack at it but I mean Eric Jones is averaging right on six yard to carry I think the protection you know it's been pretty good and I David ... yards playing at a a pro all level and\nRival August had missed the at the start yet he missed a couple of quarters or or that that's been something that you know when he's in there you Corey let's look at a high level I think this group are not protected standpoint\nI Would put the Republican anybody so offensively at all about timing I think Aaron getting hurt early in the season\nThat badly affected some things you gave it hasn't been as Chris but now you're hoping with the Bible and everything that you're hoping that that ... that that ... becomes a little bit cleaner than what it was prior to the by\nMark when you have a quarterback who's toppled but still out there how does that change the pressure that the offensive line fields to make sure he doesn't get being dumped further\nWell I think any time I mean I don't think guys looked at it like well you think that we have to protect harder you're always out there trying to do that I think maybe you have to realize that that internal clock where you're hoping your quarterback it throw the ball you know two three or second\nAaron has always been like six that way if you have an understanding of what that's going to be the case but from a mind that that's what I don't think that the vibe that have ever sat there and thought\nWell you think do I need to block our it's more about\nHe gets out of pocket maybe now you realize you're not going to do as much of getting out of pocket but that's all just based on the line you can tell when you know the eyes of a different climate start going in a different direction you hear the crowd you know when when the pressure and wonder you know what a quarterback tries to get out that the pocket and extend to play\nMark Dick's sporting goods had three day celebration this was pretty cool grand opening of a new

was ten and a half points\nThat is huge gray started at eight and a half yeah and then it was the wrong direction or you know when I went to had yesterday I saw yeah so I mean look this is the kind of\nGame that if the Packers are going to win it will be a shootout yeah I I think they'll need the scores thirty three to thirty five points in order to win this game\nI don't want people to take this the wrong way but I've kind of come to the realization that\nThey're probably not going to win and I'm okay with that as long as they don't embarrass themselves kind of where am I Hope they win one that again by wishing to be honest I've never felt that way that I can remember that that that's what the bears fans feel like for years yes yeah it's not a good feeling maybe it'll surprised and

understand this disease they tend to shy away and as they tend to shy away at times you feel that your friends have had forsaken you but they they have and what they have done is just trying to figure
