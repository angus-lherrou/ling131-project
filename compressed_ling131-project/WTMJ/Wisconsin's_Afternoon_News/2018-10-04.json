know going with what is today it's like he's been throwing the ball very very well and now I don't I think from our perspective we have\nWhat he is he's not a reliever he has the ability to do to do more than that um if if that's what the game calls for 'em so that that um\nYou know want to just throwing the ball really well and then too I think he is he has the potential to to do a little more than you know a a reliever maybe um as far as you know how the rosters composed um look I think the off days played a part of that's how he came into the serious play a part of the guys we kept\nAll guys that um\nYou know are at the end of their starters there's a lot of stars in that group and they have the ability to um I think they've done both I guess is what I'd say [noise]\nUm they pitched

specific to this team at this time and how much of that is no this is just the way the game is going at least the way the brewers player\nYeah I mean I think um\nIt it's it's part of the strengths of this team um that we're trying to take it that we're trying to take advantage of um\nYou know I Do think in the national league during the course of the regular season you your needs starting pitching um the way the way the game is structured at this time of the year the off days um\nYou know it's all hands on it you know that mentality that you're that you're able to take because it's it's a five

J. radio and associated bank brewers radio network\nThe doors of Turner hall open up at three o'clock this afternoon first pitch is at four o'clock be sure to check that out\nYou know it it it's interesting I we were talking about in the previous conversation\nSome people saying well this investigation was too short it should have gone on longer et cetera et cetera [noise] my point was given the nature and the timing of these allegations\nYou're never going to get a resolution you're you're never going to be fined able to find corroborating information um the people for example the lady that alleges that Brett Kavanaugh did this Saturday I Would think\nThat the names of people that she gives she's given they don't support her statements now I'm not judging one way or the other I'm just saying\nIt's an uncorroborated sort of thing and you could investigate till the cows come home but asking the FBI or anybody to go back and try to treat this I allegedly happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty what ever I don't know where I don't know when I don't know who was there except these people say it didn't happen\nAs it is in the mid fifties\nBut more and more of these companies have mandatory retirement age is sixty five Seventy and yet you've got the U.S Senate that has people that are in in their eighties\nShouldn't we have an age limit for politicians for one for seven nine when six twenty to start with Nicole in Sheboygan high nickel\nI'm really as a matter of fact I have that many in each one I Can't\nEat I start actually had um we end up either it was\nWhat would you say that wage would be\nI think my parents maybe that they need to eat what that means but I mean like I had called me and then I mean at Lancaster in if they were all\nRed and of course you've got to generalize but you've also got\nThe deterioration of physical skills and and that's just a reality no matter how in shape you are\nYou know your ... your body starts to break down over time and I guess\nI I kind of look at that as well as part of the thing that's frustrated me Nicole is of course these entrenched senators in particular um once you've been there forever you have this power you have this incredible ability to raise money so you know as you get older you become more and more entrenched it's tougher to get you out of office\nAnd as a result you you start to wonder are we really getting ... is it time for is it time for people to move on and and is that time eighty four eighty five years old\nI don't think so I think that much earlier than regular activities area and I think if you have very very easily around a lot of money going and\nYeah no thank you well you're right too because you know a lot of times and you you saw this in the past with senators\nAnd congressmen who were extremely old\nUm [noise] and and candidly who's best days were behind them\nThen what happened was you know that they had you had the age that took care of all the work and\nAnd and you just really that what what ended up happening is because of of age and diminishing skills\nThat the Congress people started to punch out more and more and look I appreciate that this is a topic that people were all comfortable with this because we ended up getting older but I I was struck as I was watching these committee hearings and this isn't a conservative or liberal Republican or Democrat but I was thinking point\nThere is there some young people and the committee but there's some really really old people that are on this committee is well Mike on the north west side my current WGM Jake good afternoon\nI compare that to override them on the show you have to you know you have to really think of all the time for a vote on if you're in the eighties or nineties okay boys differently and they have to do that they're veiled won't but\nWhen you're eight or Ninety it really don't want to keep going to work I mean if you hang it up and move on yeah well eight\nEight eight well it it is in anything be looking you hate to say that because their their second and third and fourth acts in American Life and there's all sorts of stuff that you do but\nLike I said they're the best example there's a reason why American businesses have mandatory retirement age is I mean there there is so if it's good enough for the the biggest companies in the world why is it good enough for I don't know the U.S Senate or Congress it should be\nBasically Mike appreciate it in in Milwaukee and you're a WTO O. J. lo\nO now you\nRealize Dan I'm going to go back and I'm going to look at my emails and my text messages that when they have all sorts of people accusing me of being an age is so and so I'm really not I'm just trying to call them like I see him and this one\nNo you're right I I just thank God I think that like that because we are I think a lot of people that have their Marlboro all the way to Ninety and\nGod Bless them when\nYou're pushing that I can find a link between they're pushing and it's like I said before you go to work that way and in your life and that someone else pick up the paper\nWas that that seat the other thing I mean and I mean I understand for example being a U.S senator has an incredible amount of power and stuff like that and I get that there's a a lure of power\nBut at some point in time and and I don't know when you hit it could make it whether it's sixty five or Seventy or Seventy five or certainly by the time you start hitting eighty maybe it's races or other stuff in life than traveling back and forth between your home district in Washington DC I takes a lot for the call and I appreciate just\nLet me just food for thought look you need\nWe have minimum age requirements and I I\nLook I I get into this discussion from time to time I've been doing this job long enough that I I'm One of these people who for example argues that\nWe should have additional testing of older drivers and then you probably heard me go on my my rant about this\nI'm simply because again was the fact is I don't see as well today as I did twenty five years ago I I don't and my guess is if I'm fortunate enough to be here twenty five years from now I'm not going to see is well then as I Do now\nThat these in Wisconsin the way it works is you can renew your driver's license\nAnd and you can go if you don't have an accident or a collision you can actually go eight years without having you know any sort of checks at all and I just think that's crazy because again the effects of aging and I'm never I Would never argue that somebody should not be entitled simply because of an age\nTo drive a car but I Do think it's reasonable for example to say OK once you hit a certain age we're gonna have added testing maybe some maybe some on the road things maybe instead of being able to renew your license you know for eight years without being checked maybe make it two years I think those are reasonable sorts of things\nAnd and I think we need to move to them unfortunately there's no political will for us to take a break it's one twenty six check right there WTO O. J. broadcasting live from Miller Park\nIs just one thirty six year ... civil U. T. M. J. WGM radio present\nThe hometown call eternal hall it is a viewing party\nFor game one this afternoon it is a free event here's what we're going to do massive movie screen broadcast to determine ... per whole course right across the street from the Bradley centered game one of the national league division series between the brewers and the Rockies and here's the cool thing is going to be sink\nHall of famer above your crews play by play broadcast on totally TMZ radio and the associated bank brewers radio network doors open at three o'clock this afternoon first pitches it for so if you're not in a position to be able to come out to Miller Park and enjoy the game in person you can check it out at Turner hall All right\nOne of the things that's become an issue in the governor's race he is the condition of the roads in this state\nDespite the fact that I think Governor Walker has put billions of dollars into road building in road gross\nYou you got it everybody gets frustrated by the state of the infrastructure and\nIn many respects trying to build and improve roads is just a bottomless pit because\nGiven everything that goes on and the weather the roads are always in need of repair and you want to have growth and all those sort of things plus you have the department of transportation that for the last several decades really idle belief has been responsible to the taxpayers we talked about this before [laughter] Journal Sentinel has the story about [noise]\nHow ... ... there's this project involving the market interchange where or the zoo or change where\nThey were double built state was double bill like four hundred thousand dollars for gravel was delivered one load of gravel four hundred grand and and they were ... they were charged twice for it and and people caught if they caught it\nAnd administrators to department of transportation decided to look the other way now we're not going to try to get the money back\nAnd say the the road builders groups the consortium said the deal\nThey behaving in a way that well they should have been wearing masks carrying guns they refuse to get the money back that's unfortunately part of the thing that goes on in Wisconsin where you have\nJust a a lot of just uncaring people when it comes to health taxpayer money is spent [laughter]\nPut any event there was a story a little while ago\nThat were out of state and maybe out of country investors who wanted to come in and we're offering to privatize the roadway the journal sentinel has a little bit more of this kind of interesting here's the way they report it\nCanadian and British investors polled Wisconsin transportation officials last year they had over a billion dollars available to fund highways in Milwaukee and around the United states\nApparently what happened is they they they reached out to to Governor Walker's administration and it got kicked over to the state transportation secretary and apparently you know he he he took a meeting you know or at least explore this a little bit in November\nSome guy from one of these outfits told state officials he was interested in investing in Milwaukee highways and had about one point four billion dollars available\nFor the the projects now they didn't explain explicitly how this would work but typically what happens in these arrangements is that\nYou have this private company that come in and they agreed to either build or maintain the roads hey you don't have to worry you don't have to worry we'll take care of this but they say then we're going to end the roads and these wells are we will we're going to typically putting tolls [laughter]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet any better than that right a guy was arguing with me the other day saying well I understand why you might like to go to the ball game but I just stay at home listen to the game on the radio watched on TV I don't get it let's start with Derek I'm a nominee falls Hi Derek\nOh thank you for taking my call\nIce her saying\nI agree with you wholeheartedly near the fact that as more\nThan we don't get it every year\nAnd if I go to one of the game I would've done it for them away five we don't get this through off once in a lifetime opportunity that you got to get to\n... you know it it it may very well be I mean you always that the team's going to get back in next year's team is going to be better or whatever but the truth is\nIt's been seven years since the brewers were in the play offs\nAnd the brewers haven't been to the world series and I work with the car to head of the horse than a bit of the world series since Nineteen eighty two so when you get the kind of opportunities I think if you get a chance you got to take advantage of them and you got to show out a show up and there's nothing like being at someplace in person they're just not\nCorrect appreciate for one for seven nine nine one six twenty Sean in ... good afternoon\nMan jobs for taking my goal yeah I think far at all at the last call me and my brother was alive and then also you know it\nIt it it got experience it's not that famous all your regular game that they\nAre also want to stay home by all means but you know you know you ... you might as well go if it's worth what right\nWell well it is because you're you're making memories no thanks so called John I mean I Would say this I vividly remember one of the same time I'm really kind of hung up on is it doesn't seem like seven years ago I mean I remember being here for the last time they were in division series playing the Arizona Diamondbacks and and you might remember they they it was a five game series\nThey ended up winning that was the team that had Paul in a motor that was the team that had Ryan Braun and Prince Fielder and Niger Morgan and they ended up winning game five in the tenth inning would just spectacular sort of play\nAnd I can remember walking out of of Miller Park and there is a place which is rocking\nEverybody's coming out everybody celebrate it seems like it was just yesterday but it was seven years ago and and yes I Know if I'd been watching it at home I Would have been celebrating I Would have been incredibly happy but it is just flat out was in the same and it it's a memory it it's being there\nYeah well I didn't know quite a story that's what happened and I don't at all I think we have a good opportunity here and I don't want to squander it\nAh Bruce side I tell you I I tell you you get to calls you are getting a round of applause from the people walking by they are appreciating the fact that you are willing to put team above your own personal self interests that is what being a brewers fan is all about All right\nWhen we come

I appreciate you're listening and I appreciate opposite perspectives and I also appreciate I Know you called the show before and like you say you are a Packers fan and bears country so you've got a special place in my heart but in this particular one I think you're all wet but but I get I I Will say that I mean the\nI think today and tomorrow are important games for the brewers simply because the the better Colorado pitchers are going to be lined up\nOver the weekend I'm so and again anything can happen but I think it's the brewers could get these two games and it would be to install it today and tomorrow we'll be in ... credibly important that would be a great jumpstart now I understand this kind of an obvious thing to say well gee saying that you know when the first two games\nYou know in a five game series we've got to win the best three out of five isn't it okay but what I'm saying is I think Colorado they're better pitchers taking nothing away from the people that are pitching today and tomorrow they're better pitchers it'd be lined up to pitch at home so that's I think one of the concerns in the issues that you have\nA chain and Romney fall share a double A.

I Will say this I mean if you look at the quality and simple brewers have in the bullpen\nAnd if if they get a lead early and you know their their head after five or six innings I mean is there a better bullpen and the league to hold is going to be interesting to me today that today's what they're calling one of the bullpen games they've got Brandon would rip who was a starter\nThen they had him in the bullpen he's going to pitch a couple innings and I think they're they're going to go to you know different alternatives but it's a lot of fun\nHas come out that he is head regardless of what the FBI probe signs\nAnd the FBI pro from what I understand it's on nothing new it's plowed new ground he says that the Senate needs to move on and whether or not he's innocent or guilty whether or not there is any corroborating evidence or not\nBut I'm Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh should be rejected by the Senate\nSimply because well he doesn't have the temperament now\nTo be a justice on the Supreme Court\nBecause we all saw how angry he was\nThat he was accused in his mind fall asleep being a sexual predator so now the argument is it does it matter we've got no corroborating evidence but we should still vote no because he lacks judicial temperament right let's open up the phone lines for one for seven nine what six twenty and the academic mortgage pocket and text line\nIn some respects so we were talking to yesterday I had an opportunity to interview on the air the White House director of strategic communications in some respects it would be the course of least resistance to simply say All right we've we've had all these attacks on Brett Kavanaugh he's had to defend himself\nIn a way that you know comedy has never had to defend themselves in the past\nBut because he's angry because he didn't like this\nMaybe it'll easier just to move on and say let's find somebody else\nAnd that presumably is with Cory Booker is saying hey innocent or guilty doesn't matter time to move to whatever plan B is for one for seven nine nine one six twenty is that what the Senate should do when it votes on the nomination and it will vote on the nomination tomorrow and Saturday for one for seven eight nine when six twenty\nIf you're on the line please hold on we'll discuss in just a moment\nWe're broadcasting live from Miller Park in advance of game one of the national league division series it's twelve twenty four this is Jeff wicker double duty I'm Jay\nWhen he says you're whether we can say the wait is over the playoffs are here for the first time it's Seventy years postseason baseball is going to be played at\nMiller Park I Am broadcasting live from outside of Miller Park\nHall of famer above ... on the call for every pitch in October it all starts at three thirty this afternoon with game one of the national league division series between the Colorado Rockies an hour Milwaukee Brewers\nWGM Jay he's your home for a brew October matter of fact ah right out of the box tomorrow twelve o seven I'm scheduled to be joined by Mr baseball Bob euchre we'll talk about all things brewers for one for seven nine nine one six twenty to the academic mortgage talk and text line critics in Milwaukee Chris your first good afternoon\nOr good afternoon\nWhat do you think or I think that from my understanding is that allegedly happened to the the thing that there isn't any backwards or a limitation as far as I'm In charge criminally\nSo regardless if they were thirty five years ago if is found to be true I think it should be pursue\nTell me how you tell me how you find it to be true I mean that but if you have no other at all sides her client\nWell now you can be accused of something if somebody testimony than it did there sometimes if you love me jarred\nYou know what I don't think anybody seriously thinks he's gonna be criminally charged with them\nAnd it during the course of that wow\nIt more you prevent ever do who or not prove that it actually occurred there many times people did try a currently or some ice either way and it it might not be any physical evidence but they the police to\nArrest in charge of the first one and a half before the court all\nGrew up okay because I I Want to stop you because we were in that we're in the twilight zone out like let me let me just tell you I don't think\nI don't think anybody and even their most fever dreams is really seriously argue that Brett Kavanaugh should be charged with a felony for an uncorroborated allegation from thirty six years ago and I will tell you this from an ethical standpoint\nI ... I Believe that it's fundamentally an ethical for a prosecutor to bring criminal charges in a case that they know or I should know that they have absolutely no chance of being able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and that is clearly the case\n... electrical Fairfax alert if a child claims that priest molested them thirty five years of gold should they be held accountable incredibly charge\nBecause in ...\nWell ... ... ... what the answer is is it depends if you have an unverified and I'm completely uncorroborated ... an allegation from thirty five years ago there's nobody that's going to bring charges based simply on bad\nNow it might be if you're able to find some cooperation might be that you're able to find a pattern and practice and other people who made those allegations of but but just\nSaying we're going to charge somebody for something that the allegedly did thirty five years ago when again there is no cooperation it it's it's just flat not it's not going to happen and\nI I guess that's the point I can make your long about these investigations that if you're you're never going to have more evidence and you have you have to lady who makes the allegation\nAnd I can't remember this I Can't remember that and again people can argue about whether that is legitimate or whether it affects her credibility I don't even want to get to that point in time I just wanted to say that the mere allegation itself\nIs all you were ever going to have\nBecause of the passage of time or or whatever\nSo this idea that well simply because he's been accused of something and there's no her operation at all\nThat should be disqualifying that's a really really dangerous place to be in America if that's where we are now where somebody can come up and say ... any of us did something thirty five or forty years ago it was never reported\nThere's no sort of cooperation but this now means that you shouldn't be able to do this job or that job or whatever we're going to pick it up right there if you're on them\nOn the line please hold on for one for seven nine nine one six twenty Cory Booker senator from New Jersey says it doesn't matter whether capitalized guilty or innocent he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court what do you think\nIt's false or each other just whether doubles U.

J. good afternoon\nAnd thank you for him I think in my car and I wanted to mention how I think that a lot of people aren't that king about not only is your story I'm cooperated\nStatements are far greater flying and then and then after that you find all over the world and then her story about that claim that were there\nThey actually have not only not cooperate refuted and then stories out there are a lot less time in the house was Chinese out from it that it would be that you're trying to get out and\nWe're actually and she didn't enjoy the beach on it and then also that lie about how the graph not knowing if you're in the Iran and by her lawyers and probably graph\nI mean your lawyer would have happened you know I'm a\nLawyer and certainly inconsistency showed me that there's there's clearly inconsistencies I guess but what about the whereabouts of more fundamental things that\nThat the allegations in them all in and out themselves compare and you look at that plus the way he reacted he he was angry et cetera et cetera is that enough or should that be enough to disqualify him from Supreme Court\nWell you know Andrea Mitchell Chelsea department chair and everyone knows if\nYou're going in front of him right whether it's similar I don't know you have to have it as a plane you can't just go to court or you can file a claim and on and say that here's my allegation you at some kind of evidence playing the money that for instance claiming ... in your case or not I mean they could actually do\nYou practice here and there and found out what it really is an avid fan\nFirst slander against or if you wanted to do that but you can't just fine Sal and he had a lot it again so much as it gets an allegation you have to have some kind of evidence of\nNow the problem is it's interesting because most major news outlets\nBefore they will run a story accusing somebody of gang rape or aiding and abetting gang rape\nThere they're going to imply certain journalistic standards like hey we got to be able to go out and Italy's get some confirmation we're just not going to put anybody on there to make these sort of allegations well All right that's why a lot of mainstream news outlets just wouldn't touch the story with a ten foot pole other than to say\nThese were allegations that were reported you know wherever part\nMost of the major news networks stayed away from this woman like I say with a ten foot pole because they they just couldn't corroborate anything and the more you got into the details of her story she started back tracking well I didn't really say this or I didn't mean that or whatever\nThat did not however stop NBC\nFrom jumping in with both feet on Monday Night KBC NBC Emmett on MSNBC\nUm they did at ten minutes story on an interview with this Julie sweating in an excerpt appeared on NBC nightly news and it's interesting because\nEven among the mainstream media that is not necessarily sympathetic to somebody like Brett Kavanaugh there because there's all sorts of blowback because people are saying you know well what we've done we recognize\nThat this is an explosive story we recognize that there is a competitive deadline but\nThis is one where you know maybe MSNBC really kind of cross the line because you know the difference here is\nThe these allegations are explosive there is no cooperation and if you do multiple interviews this woman seems to back off and all of these\nI really I think as I said earlier the Supreme Court nomination process has been forever changed and not for the better and I think again the way the media particularly the mainstream media handles allegation is\nAnd what they choose to present when there's no corroborating evidence I think it's changing the media standards as well and like I Would say that's not for the better as well heart we got a lot of great stuff coming up on today's program we'll be back with more just a couple of minutes\nLike I say we're broadcasting live from outside Miller Park the six twenty ... mobile studio it's twelve fifty seven to ...

J. good afternoon\nI agree with it your first stop let me say that every time there's road saying he was not my ... and I drive between Milwaukee and lack in Sheboygan and watched John\nMadden every day and and the roads that I use hiring right now I get into the ... the roads are terrible but I don't think that not wanting to small I think their mismanagement by Tom\nBy aside from that um I think privatization\nIs a is not a good route to go down one of the public transportation and roads it's one of the most basic functions of government like providing obese and fire service and write off privatization is going to be\nProfit driven if there is no profit\nUm what are they going to do closed the roads like Toys R us than Boston Store\nRight the show where where are they going to make a profit they're going to increase fees to the point that it's unaffordable for some people that drive on the road\nOr they're going to skimp on the roads themselves to the safety standards are going to a high\nQuality or instead of like Milwaukee County following ... ... they're going to say well we're only gonna are ones that they can't afford a ... the roads a you know snow ... I'm Sorry I I think it's a huge disaster\nDisaster and again I I agree\nWith you and see and I I think you know there are some things that candidly I think you can do the privatization might make sense for and\nAnd but I think you have to look at it on a case by case basis I mean it's one thing to say okay can can we hire out custodial services or something like that\nIt's another thing when you're talking about again like you were saying what are the basic requirements of government which is providing rose complete completely different than I think you can support some forms of privatization without saying hey turning into turning the rose over to a private European company would be a good idea\nI think that's being done and in some cases like the city of Milwaukee\nUm during large snowstorms bait you hire private ... wow so they don't have a hundred thousand dollar shedding or write months of the year I'm I'm all for the government is controlling those contracts and\nAgain I just want to reiterate the south east was constant the roads are perfectly fine\nSo called ... I mean here's here's part of the issue and and people complain about the roads and\nAnd and I do I do think it's it it shows how far we have come in Wisconsin over the last eight years that that this is now becoming a primary issue we're not worried about jobs we're not worried about the economy that's all going great we're not worried about the state of taxation but you know we're concerned that there is a pothole well there's always been potholes that's kind of the reality\nIs always a challenge though to figure out how you're going to do the road building we need to do\nDo the expansions and also do the repairs and I think it's fair to have an ongoing conversation about it but as far as privatizing this I think it's a bad idea carry in Sheboygan Gary you're on WTO O.
