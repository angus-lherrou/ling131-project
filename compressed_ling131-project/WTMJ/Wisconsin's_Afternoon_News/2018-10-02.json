Daniel was unable to get the job done and retiring Daniel Murphy allowed to walk to ... risk as well and that was really the cubs only true threats of the game ... story was able to get out of it\nStriking out by us who uh I used to work out a lot recently there was no question about that and he had to find season and he will finished second in the envy the voting and I think that's a justifiable position to have him in it but he didn't have as good a year's Christian yelled if you want to get into the MVP to date\nA debate and uh that was a big moment and he wasn't able to come through good on Syria\nThat's the big south again it definitely was sets ... without a doubt that is the biggest out of the game and walking ... another one of those guys who was brought in\nThe deadline to go get out like that and he did and you know sometimes you think about the run scoring and you think about the starting pitcher walk him soaring getting hobby biased to strike out was without a doubt the biggest out that the brewers record is in that game\nNow at that time we did not know what we now know and that's something about Jeremy Jeffords who apparently was not available for today's game\nYeah according to correct counseling also general manager David Stern she was in uniform today but not available to pitch for undisclosed reasons they say he will be a full participant\nIn the LDS somebody on his Twitter we did at him asking him are you okay he tweeted back at that person was just a single word answer yes so getting the fact that they say he's going to be a full participant for the LDS you don't know what's going on with them but for whatever reason he was not available today\nLet's go to Mitch in Florida I miss good to hear me again you're on WGM Jay\nOh so this is great I have no idea how much I Would prefer to be out there and be swept up and all this free for 'em but being with you guys you know I can stream nuts and that's the next best thing so thanks for everything you do this it's just been tremendous\nHey listen\nEverybody on that so and so good spot on [noise] but [noise] one guy that I I'm not hearing\nGetting all while he gets funnier credit but as the as an acquisition he's a little bit overlooked in that crash I'm\nYou know the brewers have had like thirty guys on their pitching staff he's during the season he's caught most of them I think he's\nReally reliable catcher and backstop throws very well I think is the best I've seen her on the basis of Santiago and he's given some punch in with what happened with unfortunately what Steven\nI just think um for Manny navy Sandy that do this I don't think they won the division and the long he's won some games just sort of his presidency I played\nFor the phone call thing for a charming in and he's become the ... not everyday catcher but he's become the primary catcher even at a point where many penis that started to heat up a little bit Matt air was getting\nMajority of the place it seems like you start to my three out of every five yeah so and I thought it was just relegated to a well credits always catches this guy but it turned into more\nThan that yeah he's he's the number one cats are at this point and that's not a knock on many senior crafted the best Kramer and the games to typically nobody frames pitches\nHe has become a leader inside of that club policies that he's a veteran guy\nHe's got a good sense of humor he understands what it means to be a good team made is a perfect fit for this team and I love the story because think about this strike us yeah four months ago he's playing for play baseball and the Yankees organization with no thought\nAnd then I'm In the off season but at that point you had Steven Vogt you had jet fan he still had a young guy and Jacob now coming up to the prospects with the brewers did not look good and the off season so that's why he signed with a that's why he went back to New York so he's he's catching a Scranton looks very critical a guy\nAnd he comes in and he has made a profound difference on this team\nThe chase Anderson in front of the Jack Davis and look at the look what's happened in the past week they skipped chase standards and they took Anderson out of the rotation they suck was acting clearly jak Davies is in front of Anderson now I think there may be a scenario because you get that off day after getting to and that off the after game poor\nThere is a scenario where you only take three starters or a D. S. roster once you go to the in the ass you'd have to go to for you you're playing with fire a little bit if you do that in the uh divisional series\nBecause if you have a postponement which is less likely because your plane most of those games at Miller Park but if you have a postponement where are you getting off they take in a way you could get into trouble but I Would say it's worse to gamble to go with a three man rotation take shot seen\nTake Miley and taken dollars do not have Davies do not have Anderson on the national league divisional series roster you'll tweak it for the championship series but I don't see a need for Davies or Anderson ...\nYeah the ... then is to not worry about guys being well rested but keeping them sharp yeah through the divisional series or if you make ... combat arm in the national league championship series so I'm probably able to dial there's been a little bit more uh tomorrow at some point I don't know if\nThe potential matchup\nWould have anything to do with drug counseling David Stern decision if they face Colorado or face a cargo that in any way alters that based upon you know the wonderful pictures they might have starting in the world of analytics master baseball that could play a role I'm just not sure how much are role overflowing well I think\nWe're plays a role potentially is with Jenny because he's a left hander so you look at the the hot baths\nFor Colorado you look at the hot baths for the cubs and you make the decision maybe if there's if there's a toss up situation between a left handed reliever in a right handed reliever and you look at the other team and you feel like there's going to be more opportunities where we need to have more left hander is coming out of the bullpen then Jennings probably would get them out\nTo the phones we go ... in Illinois and joining us on WGM Jay Hi Wesley\nYeah thank you for taking my call back a\nFew weeks ago when they were in a rain delay in Pittsburgh and I had to give a little pep talk for the first team about basically taking no prisoners and no one Mr nice guy and all that and I'm really pleased to see that\nHave done very well since then I've just thrilled that they won the decision to I mean that was the thing is\nNobody's managed to know that they've had a record in a National League up until it June but um I don't see I see them you know\nReally going to get a World Series so sure I I don't think stopping them I'm at all they got a great team and everything's Joel to gather and as the previous caller from Florida to uh regarding the catcher yeah he's kind of a he's a few pets on the back that he's done as well [noise]\nYeah that that could that goes in for anybody really I mean any any member\nOf this roster ... you're on the roster for reasons and you're affecting it one way or the other um [noise] now I remember the phone call by the way because I was doing the rain delayed program uh when uh the thing in Pittsburgh was happening and we thought we had a window Memphis they just didn't have a window and they just had to delay it delayed and\nWhatever lasted a long time there was a very long rain delay program we have to do on WGM J uh but I I think part of\nPart of what I look at with the roster and its its makeup\nYou feel good about so many of the stories and and you know some of these guys and they're all for competitive are going to be on the outside looking in but I don't feel like it's going to be a woe is me pity party right I mean it's just easier for me to seeing them from this these but\nYou get into a series and\nI got to feel good about your your ability to help get this team to the point of that and uh the understanding that difficult decisions have to be made Greg you've been\nCovering the brewers longer than I have I'm In my third year around this team so you can speak better this and I have have you ever been around a team\nWhere from player number one player number thirty eight currently every single guy is a really good dude [noise]\nThere's not that one guy I Know because in recent years the map Garza there's always been a grant there's always going to get there is not a guy and I'm not just saying that you don't pump these guys up we both talk to all these guys all the time there's not a bad guy on this team there's not a guy who can look right and look left\nNot have their teammates back\nEric names has every reason in the world to be ... right now\nHe lost his starting job he's not performing well it's potentially costing him money he\nDoesn't know what's going to happen next year he had everything going against them and today in the clubhouse he's having this wild celebration where he is going down beer without asserting during a hulk Hogan impersonation I mean he is having such a blast these their first teammates so yeah there's going to be tough decisions on this roster and guys are going to be\nPersonally disappointed that maybe they're not on the twenty five man roster but it's going to have zero impact\nOn how they are as teammate\nLaura damn bike on the phone will get you guys coming up on the other side of the last year

credit freeze in place and as I shared with you just a week ago\nCredit freezes and thaws of credit freeze are now free\nSo the credit bureaus having this be kind of like a backwater to a major part of their activity\nWere really wanting a simpler way that has upset a lot of people\nUp to last week the procedure was that you would file a request for credit freeze with a credit bureau and they would issue you a unique secret code\nHow old is the trouble on her credit\n[noise] probably ten years\nNothing that old should be on her credit items only stay on your credit seven years okay and so when's the last time that that if you've talked about this together when's the last time she looked at her credit report\n'em or credit report I'm not sure I Know she's got credit karma so I Know she's monitoring it and it's trying to rebuild um so I don't know as far as our credit report that's a good a good idea that she would\nSlowly credit ... on the credit card machines see her reports to and what she should look for is any items that are not what's called age properly because of her problems with credit go back a decade\nThose things should not be present on her report so she should essentially have a no file almost versus a bad file for things from long ago\nIt's not unusual for a collection agency to do what's called refreshed the date\nTo try to keep something active in somebody's mix that shouldn't be\nAnd then what she would do is if something's on there that is too old\nShe challenges that with the credit bureau notified whoever has it dated wrong that she's challenged it needs to be removed and generally when somebody's savvy enough to do that the collection agencies behave themselves\n... okay so the other thing is if she's already has credit card to their own right now is that is that um the uh her credit scores fires if I'm reporting her on line\nYeah I'd say you added her as an authorized user on top of what she's got\nThat will be really helpful to her as well because it will increase her available credit which will help driver score up that's one of the areas where the credit report you can have the greatest impact and the shortest period of time\nIs improving the ratios of how much debt she's carrying versus how much debt is available to her so adding her authorized\nDepending on how it's recorded again should be of help to
