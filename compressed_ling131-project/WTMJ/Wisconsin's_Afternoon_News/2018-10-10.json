and Alabama all kind of hook up together they're right in that tri-state area air traffic 'cause you can imagine is going to be an absolute nightmare probably for the next several days Alex Stone ABC News is with us with that part of the story good afternoon Alex\nHey there John yeah not that you're in Atlanta is the busiest airport in the country and by any metric the busiest airport in the world and a major hobby biggest town for Delta Airlines and Lana later tonight is going to be feeling more the impact of Michael we've been seeing the numbers go up all day today but they are still\nRelatively low for canceled a delayed flights\nAround three hundred flights today I in the U.S could have been canceled two thousand that have been delayed\nI Would expect that number is going to go up tonight as the storm gets closer to Atlanta but if you're flying today delta saying that the most delays American saying that the fact that most they have strong operations in the south east so that makes sense\nThat the Atlanta Airport seeing the most good delayed and cancelled flights\nI and then the other airports in in the area the smaller regional airport Pensacola Tallahassee they're completely shut down and we don't know when they're going to reopen that's where many of the delays have come from and cancelled flights already just because the flights are taking off the the smaller regional planes for those airports that are shut down but\nThe numbers will definitely keep going up tonight\nSo are people getting in the airports are they finding other places to go to sleep or staying until their flight and sound rescheduled\nWell we don't know when in Pensacola in Tallahassee when they're going to be a look at the airport reopen again they completely shut that down well before Michael arrived and and so no they emptied those out they didn't want them to shelters but for those who may get a guy in Atlanta yeah they may tonight end up not being able to to go on wherever they want to go and\nThey may end up spending the night in the airport or having to divide a hotel room but in the the hardest hit areas right now they are pretty much because they're pre cancelled the\nFlights and said nothing is going in or out there they had to empty out the terminal and said nobody come in\nABC's Alex Stone is with us this was going to be kind of a rolling thing Alex because you mentioned it Lana Charlotte is one of the primary hubs for American Airlines and so Charlotte will be impacted probably about a half a day or a day after Atlanta is impacted\nAbsolutely and many other flights even before it gets there or even get through Atlanta because so much of what American delta flies regionally I in the southeast goes to these him back to the airports that Charlotte\nIs already saying that quite a few delays but just looking at the airports that are the major airports that there are flight waivers up on right now so if you're flying there you can change your flight without at least that dates of the flight\nWithout paying a change fear and increase the fair but Atlanta Charleston Columbia South Carolina Fort Walton Beach Florida Greenville Spartanburg Mobile Alabama Myrtle Beach\nPanama City Florida Pensacola savannah there are a lot of airports being impacted because of this storm\nABC's Alex Stone thank you so much Alex you got to think that\nYou know we play American a lot so I'm very familiar with American and how this is going to work is if you fly American Airlines you may not be going anywhere near that part of the country but American has I think it's for flights from Milwaukee to Charlotte each direction each day\nSo they will have trouble getting those planes to your into Milwaukee so you might be blind to Phoenix or somewhere else or Dallas for instance at American Airlines out of Milwaukee\nAnd if they can't get the plane here from Charlotte you're gonna have to reconsider your flight as well so uh make sure you check it out if you're planning to fly or you have somebody coming in or out from the south east or anywhere in the country 'cause there is unstable whether throughout the United states make sure you check the boards go on line\nAnd find out the status of that flight before you show up at the airport looking at that storm right now\nIt is massive there's a lot of rain in a lot of
