L. dot com and this was an act of defiance yeah there's no way that you can let that go because otherwise if he doesn't then the next guy doesn't then the next guy does that and then all of a sudden you lost your football team and in a critical moment like that if\nIt was an act of defiance there ... there has to be consequences\nYou know Doug I think about this football team in everybody's talking about Montgomery man it was a nice showing and I'm gonna ask you about that in a second but I Am concerned about the ... and the up and looked good in spurts but\nThe numbers really don't lie their fist in yard itch per game fifth grade they're Thirteen and points there Eighteenth and the league in touch downs with teams like the bears and the chargers and the lions putting it in the end zone more often in the Packers how do they fix that\n[noise] I think a lot of it is going to be how Aaron Jones and the running a false and we saw a little bit of that yesterday twelve carry springs six yards\nI think they're starting to get the idea that this kid is the real deal I Hope they are because they do need some balance that we're talking about that during the week as well that they they have to have more\nOf a running game to set up the past and get housing like earlier in the season I don't want to make excuses but I think earlier in the season after Iran suffered an injury in week one against the bears was unable to practice and then you saw his veteran receivers that I'm just rental car\nUm you know they went down with injuries journal Allison as well and he was having to try to figure out what he had with some of these rookies now\nMark was ... when he looks like the real deal looks like they're on the same page but his arrow gets more time with these younger guys and as top now is back in the lineup\nAnd the bond Adams is certainly asserting themselves as a a great one of the elite wide receivers in the NFL I think you're going to see some of that get better as time goes on it it seems like I was a la\nCarte Doug let me take you back on something you said you know I Know everybody's tired of the conversation about Aaron Jones he's the real deal it appears here's where I get frustrated why are they still routinely rotating the running back so seven carries for forty six yards early in the game for Aaron Jones\nA couple of series later Montgomery comes in third possession the Packers go three in out later in the game I Know you're familiar with the six forty nine to playing the game the Packers up by one right there on the Twenty one yard line\nPressure on the rams they score they're even feel go it makes a big difference Montgomery comes out again and and does nothing why do they continue to do that\n[noise] well if you look at the overall number of carries I mean our insurance was the\nBulk a carrier yesterday and he carried twelve times again for eighty six yards and they're only Nineteen Russia's that the Packers and for the entire game show that's most of the marriage or why he's not getting the rock in those ... that you bring up\nI think they're still trying to work through that I don't know why they're still trying to work through that but Aaron Jones is getting the bulk of the chairs or at least you started to yesterday\nBut in those situations that you bring up a specific he situation that you bring up or whatever reason a Mike mccarthy jumped filled and they decided that they were going to give the rams defense a different luck and I'm not entirely sure why but air and jumps to get the bulk of the carriers\nYesterday they dug out stuff sound like the guy for for ... let me ask you about a ... year Alexander boy is he turned into something special back from injury and he had a really nice game yesterday\nYeah he was all over the field making plays looking every bit like the first round draft but they have needed to have I mean Kevin came as a good cornerback he's got the size and certainly got to be\nA second round pick but he was their first draft pick a year ago Gerald Zander looks like he's a smaller and smaller certainly that he is making plays all over the place and that's what you need out of a cornerback you just need a guy who can be doesn't have to get a lot of interceptions but he would cover you like a blanket I think he's looking\nLike he belongs on the rookie team right now I think that when he's been healthy all season long he's been gracious shame\nAnd let me ask you another question about clay Mathis he's another guy looks pretty good yesterday seven tackles a sack a quarterback had several pressures he looked like he was into this ball game yesterday a little bit Doug\nYeah he's still during the week that it wasn't necessarily all that special ... even thought about going back to the coliseum you hadn't thought about going back to Los Angeles where this the first time he's played in LA since he was in college playing on that field at the coliseum for us you can start the Trojans\nI think there might have been a little bit more than what he let on and I don't know if there's a little extra juice and step or whatnot but he really had a monster game for the Packers he was certainly motivated you want that for everybody to be that motivated going into the game but sometimes it's just\nThat little extra X factor juice and and that may have been what spurred clay on he had the best game certainly has a of a season yesterday at the coliseum\nHackers insider Doug Russell great stuff Doug thank you for letting me rent a little

it was shocked but unfortunately uh I really wasn't shocked because many of us in the Jewish community have\nObserved in and seeing for quite a while now I'm a significant increase I'm even a spike if you will\nAnti Semitic acts perpetrated against the Jewish community um so I was obviously filled with a lot of pain and anguish um and for a moment you know it was a bit surreal but I honestly can't tell you I was shocked\nSo when you talk about and I've talked about this before this rise in anger and the fact that people are directing towards a group of people who are just trying to celebrate their faith live their lives doing like everybody else only less than a hundred years from the Holocaust why are we at this place again\nThat's a really good question um I you know we the Jewish people Jewish community um where people have refugees were people who have sought safety from persecution for millennia um\nAnd we really felt that here in America\nUm we we've been welcomed a we've really been\nMade to feel part of home uh we we've been spared the kind of state sponsored anti Semitism that you know it was more than prevalent in other parts of the world including a Western Europe uh um what happened on ... part of this past Saturday\nWas I think a wakeup call for any of us who\nWho've never thought that the kind of violence and overt hatred that we've experienced in other places a ... that we would be confronted with it in America in a neighborhood like squirrel ill\nOr you know the neighborhood where Mr Rogers mhm uh one lives he his home is just down the street from tree of life synagogue\nUm it's it's honestly um [noise]\nIt's baffling but unfortunately for the past two years there's been such a rise in division in our country and I'm In\nHate speech and it acts of of hatred and much of it has been\nTargeted against the Jewish community if you look at the FBI eight crimes report or for the past few years there's been an increase in incidents against the Jewish community\nAh and it's risen precipitously the last couple of years uh the the greatest number of hate crimes committed against a community a religious community as the FBI um [noise]\nDenotes it you know America is against the Jewish community and the a DLT which is expert in tracking in identifying hate crimes against many communities including the Jewish community has noted a fifty seven percent rise\nAnd anti Semitic acts since twenty sixteen do you believe the negative\nAnd yet there are fifty seven percent more anti Semite felt there it means that the anti Semite ... out there are

terrible story the shooter was also injured made his first court appearance today prosecutors say they will seek\nThe death penalty earlier today I got some local perspective from Joshua burns assistant professor of geology and a a a Jewish man himself at Marquette University\nAs an expert in Judaism I guess initially what was your reaction when you heard this had happened inside a synagogue in America\nAll my initial reaction was less as an expert in Judaism that as an actual Jew so it was devastating in that respect\nBut as a scholar of the Jewish experience throughout history um I Can't say that it was surprising\nIt's a it's something that drug dredges up very very bad and painful memories of a ... cent of the Holocaust events that may be\nNot so much distance to most a contemporary listeners but a very recent very fresh and the minds of the Jewish community worldwide\nYou know when I think about this uh ... it seems for years Jewish people fear this wouldn't happen attack in a synagogue and now it has happened I mean this is just a terrible terrible thing and it's like a combination of of fears over the years I Would imagine\nA most definitely you know here in Milwaukee are Jewish community various Jewish community institutions have faced threats some of them out in the open some of them are more more covert\nUm and so there is a sense I Would say amongst the community across the country that this was inevitable it was only a matter of time and unfortunately uh it it happened in Pittsburgh where it could have happened anywhere\nYou know Jewish people have been persecuted for so long it and they felt safe generally the United states haven't they\nBy and large I mean the Anti Defamation league has a has made it official in that to this is the most severe attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United states which\nIs something unfortunate to say it but it's also a testament to I'm just how well in general terms the Jewish community

there was the United states\nHow would you characterize the state of Jewish Christian relations in the United states\nGenerally I Would say it's very positive you know when we see atrocious acts like this\nIt's difficult to conceptualize the perpetrator as a Christian and therefore um I think unfair to put this in the category of Jewish or put an incident like this in the category of Jewish Christian relations is is a an incidence of Jewish psychopath relations and that's very different equation the Jewish Christian relations\nI can tell you that here in Milwaukee and throughout the country\nI'm Jewish organizations have built and maintain close partnerships with all sorts of churches are all sorts of denominations\nI'm part and parcel of the Jewish experience in the United states has been to commune with our neighbors are a bit of different faith be they'd just be they have different backgrounds\nAnd so I'm an incident like this um I Would say stance to strengthen the resolve the Jewish and various Christian communities to uh to support one another because somebody who can perpetrate such a such violence really belongs to neither community\nThat is Joshua burns at

and the editor right Wisconsin joining me as he does every Monday morning at nine o seven I was going to talk to you James\nHey Steve coming up next congressman Sean Duffy lots to talk about Congress mid term elections he's been all over the place for early in the center of your book Merrill ask them about that\nNine thirty five she's pretty with you on this Monday thank you for listening is always across the great state of Wisconsin\nAnd wherever you are joining me on the line now he's just he's that pretty frequent guest in the last year so congressman Sean Duffy good morning congressman hey good morning he thinks that man I Want to get your thoughts first about the the shooting at\nThe synagogue in Pittsburgh within our own ask a follow up on that question that that events happen over the weekend or eleven people losing their lives to someone who uh targeted members of the Jewish community your thoughts on that\nYeah it was a horrific and another example of you know what appear to be a drain person fault hey you know taken a firearm and maximizing destruction and now I'm so grateful for law enforcement as well I mean here you have\nYou know a little first responders getting the pain and Russian adding for their injured but obviously have a lot of live in the meantime and we're grateful for them right now that everyone who lives or spare and that rubber attack was grateful for the past response as well\nAs somebody who lived through a mass shooting in the city of Oak Creek now six years ago um the question always turns to after the the moments in Greece and the visuals and all that is what should we do I'm gonna ask you from the perspective of a congressperson\nPunishment from Wisconsin is there a role for Congress years or something we can do when they were going to stop these completely but as or something we can do at whatever level that might be what I in whatever way we could do it that could could potentially we slow these people down\nHere I think it's I think it's a hard question\nIn whatever way we could do it that could could potentially at least ... people don't\nKnow I think it's I think it's hard question I'm ... and most people want to go to how do we implement gun control I was at a\nI'm a ... a candlelight vigil last night um with our Jewish community and several people came up and in the ... the need jerk reaction\nUh the the the the problem is you know receiving Europe if there was no you know a\n... right falls in those handguns of having a handgun those vehicles or you know pipe bombs\nYou know so I think people want to do harm um are the ones that will find a tool or with a machete the ... and don't flip that harm people don't want to see the problem is there's been a degradation of the family\nUm for a number of reasons and we see people that are are being raised and it's tough to be you know I sometimes my wife goes nuts Fox on the weekend why going on in Congress being a single person at home with your kid is really tough\nUm but I think it makes a lot harder to and so I think we're raising kids and a lot angrier and they dive into these video games the violence of the video games\nI think the seeds of love our our plant it in a in a family around the dinner table um and I see that happening as much anymore and you see a lot of kids that are angry and detached and lonely\nUm and the end result of that is I think really I'm Carrying hateful potential behavior and so we gotta get back to I I think family and raising good kids that's the answer to all the\nWisconsin congressman Sean Duffy joined me so how do we do that in in in the in the country to celebrate the freedoms of people when we have as as I said earlier on the program an anger management problems a lot of it has to do it as you said with with the way we raise our kids with families have disintegrated\nHow do we how do we make a difference in this problem and and mass shootings are occurring a lot more frequently than a lot of us would like to see was put it that way\nYes so I'm I'm On the family side and I was I'm a conservative and I go who gets to decide what conservatism is Steve and I think that it's important that we support families I don't support families and the tax code there was a recent article that said well hey\nIf a so we have a a birth rate right now at one point seven uh children you know for a a per couple um I don't have a point of the child but that's what the average is just to maintain a population you have to be a to point one\nUm and if you ask you know couples they want to have on average two point six children if they want to have more kids but they're not meeting you want to incentivize\nYou know parents to have kids and um whether given a additional tax breaks for for couples who have you know three or more kids or your help them with their student loans don't forgive it but if moms who have gone to school want to you know go back into the home and raise kids until they get back in the workforce\nHelp with their student loans let support families in public policy I think that would be incredibly helpful um and I think what's not helpful as I listen to the media\nAnd I I I'm shocked that they want to ... feet of Donald Trump and I I just this is that there's there's there's bbs moving I don't know if you've talked about that but this is the boycott Israel when it's an anti Jewish movement\nAnd it you know it was a platform of the Democratic party that was debated I don't want to talk about politics but when\nThey're trying to throw anti Semitism at our feet\nUm makes me angry 'cause I'm In the Congress and I see how Republican vote on Jewish pro Israel issues and how Democrats vote and it makes me pretty magical stuff gets skewed instead of talking about the politics we should talk about what are we doing wrong right now this was an ... we had a lot of guns\nThirty years ago and this wasn't happening when I was growing up um so what's changed to the end I think that's the the deep dive we have to have and look at our society and our communities and go what's what's different what's gone wrong and how they have a hard conversation about fixing it\nCan conservatives lead lead the way on this conversation I Know you and I talked about this before and and you know conservatives are an interesting group we tend to believe in family in space\nAnd and and all that that presents for our lives in our lifestyles but can we lead the way in a in a in a more diverse country a country that maybe doesn't think like you and I say\nI think we can you know but you you're going to get some hate for it but I look at it may take a step back a ... there was kind of became the dog ... and just read you thinking and we have this thought process I think on trade you know we had to be free traders and to be free trade it it could be unfair for the American worker\nThat was the that was a dog of conservatism until Donald Trump said hold on a second\nI'm about free trade food too but it has to be fair for us when people take advantage of America and the American worker we have to rethink our engagement and trade and because of that leadership you've seen a lot more conservatives and Republicans who do believe in free trade\nAlso come along to go yeah you're right Mr President it has to be fair so to your point I think conservatives can lead on this will be more thoughtful and how we support you know young people who want to have families\nUm in in in raise them in a loving home and have a society that's far more carrying\nA and I'm far more engaging and left detached and I'm less lonely by the way I don't think that if the left to it because they hate guns but you know every kid my ... my kids want to watch movies there are all the ones that you know blowing things up in the shooting each other and there's video games that come from they're\nThey're the most violent things ever we've got to have a ... again ... a community conversation and Steve I think you know guys like us that can lead the conversation to find out you know what the right foods are\nShowing up and take a quick break after the break I'm going to say I do on a ship the politics a big big elections coming up in Wisconsin next week Sean Duffy congressman from Wisconsin more him nuts W teams\nWith you on this Monday we're joined by Wisconsin congressman's ... area and Sean Duffy so let's shift the policies\nThat you've been very close friends and your support or leave ...\nAnother
