you Jim or I Want to play you a soundbite from one of our earlier episodes we have the NASA Administrator Jim riding signed the new one yes as our guest July tenth twenty Eighteen here's what he said about space as we interact with the nuts\nAnd that sort of philosophical politically we were talking about in the first segment but a much more practical way Jamie that summer one plate please\nOur very way of life is dependent on space\nThe way we navigate the way we communicate over the horizon communications\nThe way we produce food the way we produce energy or the way we do disaster relief in fact the way we do banking in the United states of America if we lose the GPS signals there are no interbank transfers that means there'll be no milk in the grocery store our way of life shuts down\nAnd and that's why hostile countries around the world\nAre taking action to make these capabilities vulnerable to the United states of America\nAnd it is the Chinese have called space the American Achilles' heel and you know the president is getting the same brace and he said you know what we're taking it up a notch the time has come I think he's right uh and of course I voted on it multiple times in the house of representatives\nSo near the grass Tyson two part question first uh that was a prelude to a conversation that we have a gym brightened sign about the space force which will get you on a second but in general is his description about our practical either dependence on a reliance to space accurate it's an understatement let's understand yes please expand\nWell the way I mean he knows the full extent and he was just starting to list okay so almost everything we care about in modern civilization than we think of as modern civilization is today enabled magnified or distributed or contributed to buy Spanish accents\nAnd in a way that is I mean beautifully invisible to us we just go on and you're getting you withdraw money from the ATM you you just do these things and you're not even thinking about it and so\nSo there's the old saying ... probably apocryphal the person who doesn't want to invest in space or because they just want to stay on earth\nWhich I don't need space investments [noise] I don't need space\nI've got my cell phone and that's all I Need that's all right how do they exist without the assets in space and talk about assets what ... what does that mean maybe space needs a marketing campaign I don't I don't know but if people think they don't need it when in fact their life depends on it\nThere's a mismatch there what's an asset in space you use that phrase well so it's very fast it would be let's start with a GPS satellites watched by the air force\nCo opted by the rest of us and GPS stands for global positioning system got here I I don't think the essay for satellite I think that's a system ... definitely the GPS global positioning rash and it is a system satellites\nThat provides for coordinates for you your lunch or to your attitude your altitude and your time\nThis is very important oh by the way a completely obscure fact the GPS satellite just so high up in a significantly different gravitational field of earth than we are\nAnd I signed the general theory of relativity prescribes that if you're in a lower gravitational field\nTime we'll take more faster for you that it will if you're in a higher gravitational field sort of time kept by GPS satellite has to be corrected for general theory of relativity before since the signals back down to us and we know precisely how much correction that is a really obscure fact but it has a threat that's fantastic yes and\nAnd how was that program how do we know what that differential is because you can calculate what the strength of the gravity is at they're orbiting aptitude\nGot a safe that's more than you engineer back you know medically reverse engineer that's what time difference it would take because time is not absolute it's relative according to the [laughter] as someone who\nWorks in a business that has built at least conceptually around a precise timing right I Know it's also precise but also incredibly relatives relative and hence the theory of relativity but anyhow so you've got to these GPS satellite so we have carpet for our industry for businesses for\nIt not only help traditional businesses like shipping to keep track of their trucks and cars you can follow where they are on earth final if they know the diabolical side of that as you can track how long the coffee breaks because I write it for sort of hyper efficiency\nYou know it's now seven and a half minute coffee break exposed to a twelve\nMinute average so that's like the downside of that but um so but in addition you shouldn't think of the value of the satellites themselves they each have a cost of engineering costs of building to launch and to maintain but that's not the ... the actual value the value is what does it enable down here on earth\nHundreds of billions of dollars in commerce is enabled by that so if you have a military that traditionally protect your borders are protects you from someone who wants to fight you you might also want them to protect your assets\nAnd to protect your assets would be a fundamental part of what it is to be a sovereign country right and so so so you have your GPS on it then you have your weather satellites you have your communication satellites throw in direct TV there as well this is part of a world of business\nThat require space for it to even exist at all you said this is invisible to us largely is it crowded up there [noise]\nThere are some crowded places that geosynchronous orbital place is twenty three thousand miles above the earth\nAnd you can only orbit above the equator act that distance could why because I look satellites in orbit low they they take one trip in Ninety minutes around the earth the higher up your orbit is the longer that trip takes could take two hours two and a half hours five hours ten hours\nWait a minute for Arthur C Clark is there a height where it takes so long that takes exactly twenty four hours to go around the earth\nWhat how does that if you found that high to put a satellite there then it would orbit earth at the same rate that earth rotates such geosynchronous yes you can actually more specifically geo stationary fat okay\nSo you could basically park a satellite over the earth\nIn a single spot so now park one over the Atlantic\nBetween North America and Europe now you could beam a signal up to it and bring it back down across the curvature of the earth just as a ministry of biting staying at referenced you can you can communicate beyond the curvature of the earth by the way a flat earth or could never be head of NASA just never know you wouldn't that wouldn't work right around\nThat was that that that line on the resume would disqualify\nHer ended running a job for you if you want the earth is flat head and that's just not one of them [laughter] so so\nI just F while you're so Arthur ... wrote a paper on it and it became the foundation of our communication satellites ward it so that is one distance at one hide in one place and that is crowded and that the British crowded and ... other places space\nIt's up there and more being added all the\nTime not all of them are taken out okay be it'd be something different if you can sort of vacuum up the bad ones are the ones that are dad are the ones that broke or or a collect the debris left over the Chinese Tomahawk doubt a satellite\nWe're going to get hold out it was actually that is a ... or what we call it geezer really ostrich real the grass Tyson didn't even know he ... he bought a set us up China talk taking something out of the sky debris space force all of that coming up a major Garrett this is the take out where to blow honey in Arlington, Virginia lunches and roots\nSingle satellite that's up there and that was the scenario portrayed in the movie gravity\nThat was yes so that is something that we can prevent or we can't prevent\nIt says that if you want to ... up in space it's the end of all your space assets even if you're targeting your enemy so space as far as I can project for it will always be sort of one of reconnaissance\nThe militarization of space has been around since the sixties if you include the constant in your concept of militarization the role of intelligence gathering we've got spy satellites ever since we've had satellites that's not a new thing\nI that is the militarization of space 'cause it enables command and control decisions on earth that are much higher precision an accuracy\nThis is a great way to get two full we'll start with probably a conceptual conversation about space for so they're more specific one because that leads into your book accessory to war space force Jim ... the massive ministry that when he was here said\nIt sounds brand new it sounds like I said we've never considered before he talk us through how in Congress it had been discussed in the under a different name and under a different construct tell me your evaluation of the space for us as a concept and as a either achievable or should not be achievable goal for the United states\nI remember recommending a space for some two thousand and one twelve member commission to which I had been appointed by George W. Bush\nTo serve as a ... to to explore why the u._s. aerospace industry was on hard times it was a commission specifically task to understanding\nWhat would happen if we let the aerospace industry just go the way it was headed\nIt would be it was a going out of business sale\nAt that time the Cold War was over the weekend competition from Airbus embrace air other sort of aviation I'm a giants in the world so what what's going on because if we lose our aerospace industry then we lose our control over our own or we lose our own um\nAh what's the word but your own destiny does it work without it forgetting losing it at the moment I'm a loser you lose your own access to your transportation right through your security and to your commerce okay so\nI'm In there I remember saying well why don't we separate out the space force from the air force these are two different\nRegimes of our of of of of military interest one involves finding a vacuum that you know everything is different and people said well we got this the air force guy said we got this because there's us space command\nUnder the air force I said okay I'm not going to proceed you OK I'm OK I don't have a horse in this race like All right that your bureaucracy exactly zero [laughter] so but if you want to create a space worst\nMost of it is sort of an accounting shifts all the space activities that we have conducted since the sixties had been under the umbrella of the air force you just pull it out in outer space worst I'd want to throw in some extra things and that's what I'd like like a like protected from rogue asteroids marijuana\nI call that difference that's a good one because that protects us from going extinct ...\nThat okay and one would think a high priority I Would think I'm also like I said earlier why not have them look after the space debris ... if I were to just add to the portfolio whatever we designated they should think about [noise] um so it's not a crazy idea\nA lot of Trump haters want to hate everything that comes out of Trump's mouth I'm an academic I ... I analyze everything and just because it came out of Trump's mouth doesn't automatically mean it's a crazy idea evaluated okay so\nSo so that would be a space for us and its and we have precedents for it is\nThe second World War the air force was a branch of the army right it was called the army air force and then we realized you know guys you know the soldiers for the air force they got to be pilots and the engineers have to be aerodynamic says\nThey're not fixing tanks for fixing a whole different kind of thing and the command and control is different than off the needs that survival conditions so no one today questions the value of having had an independent Airforce right\nSo I'm imagining a future we have a space for so no one really questions that part of me however wonders whether this was just I got to keep up with the recipes 'cause they have a space force there's always a little bit of that\nThere's always some competitive hysteria near the grass license our special guest we are continuing to learn and happily now eat our fantastic lunch here uh to belong to a cafe in Arlington, Virginia I majored in back in just a second\nAdmitted you probably want to eat healthy but getting enough organic fruits and vegetables into your diet every day is not only time consuming and expensive that's why in Texas uber food we've created a blend of the best USDA organic vine ripe and fruits and vegetables powerful enzymes in probiotics\nAn energizing herbs all in a convenient capsule or powder we call it\nTexas super food complete organic\nHi I'm natural passing Dr Denis blacken I invented Texas super food almost Twenty years ago with one goal in mind\nTo help people like you who lead busy lives get the all natural nutrition that every one of us needs an deserves Soviet camp ... organic fruits and vegetables everyday Texas super food complete organic makes eating healthy easy\nSee our full line of quality nutritional products attacks to super food dot com or call us\nAt eight five five Texas fifty five that said five five Texas fifty five Texas super food dot com\nHave you ever thought about saying goodbye to your job just walking into your Boston saying I quit and how would you like to commute to work without ever leaving your home\nWill not long ago at thirty nine year old entrepreneur from a billionaire family spent twenty million dollars in three years to find the best home based business in North America he researched Seventy different companies and when he found the only one that had a real long term potential he bought it\nAnd right now he's looking for people to help them turn this company into his next billion dollar success story so if you're serious about making money from home without having to leave your home will grab a pen because I'm about to give you the address of a website where you can learn all about this unique in rare opportunity\nWrite this down W.

the way the\nLaw system more a person is innocent until proven guilty that's what it is we can't let our emotion ruler if I thought somebody what should go to jail I mean they have to go to jail they have to be proven\nGuilty so\nAll of this aside until he was taken into a court of law proven guilty the man is innocent that matters and this and I understand what this is kind of get politically I understand that it's a huge deal on the Supreme Court bought nevertheless\nWe can't judge a person just because of one public outcry on many public outcry have to have proof\nI think Marilyn you you know what you see your point Marilyn I did you listen to Susan Collins yesterday some of her floor speech at all did you catch any of that\nI didn't catch any of that working\nAt her ears addressed but why would she address the points you made and she said look it is not a court of law whereby beyond a reasonable doubt should be our threshold but Susan Collins said the threshold that we should use in something like this which is not a court of law is\nMore likely than not is it more likely than not that he was there that he did this and she laid out\nThe case quite candidly as well and that's just simply as anybody had for Brett Kavanaugh that I haven't heard up until this point for the simple fact that there could\nThere there was not one person who could corroborate a professor Ford's claim and and because of that was it more likely than not\nYou know it it it was it more likely than not and that is what pushed Susan Collins over the top and that kind of sounds as if the mindset that you have Maryland before I let you go I'm curious you said you're an independent often times\nHow do you think or maybe you don't how do you think this will galvanize Democrats in November\nWell I think a lot of that are one way or another that people that are\nAbsolutely and it quickly he should've been gone they are going to make sure that they are out voting one way I think that there are people like me and I have talked to two people that I that I trust privately and they are very much in the same mindset I Am\nThirty years later you can come back and said this about somebody so one way they may or may not vote\nFor them I think it's going to depend on the political issue and the candidate for me that's what it's like it's going to be dependent on the issue and the candidate more so than that I'm not trying to minimize the me too movement and not try to minimize\nI'm a professor for clean\nBut you have to go out the truth\nAnd Thirty years later or whatever years later you can't do that but I Do think it's kind of half have even on the other side I think there are people that are going to say we can't let any of this happened so yeah I think it's done a polarized country even more\nUnfortunately I'm One of these people beliefs which to compromise and reach real negotiations and the real focus in government but I don't think that\nI'm Marilyn from

I was just that I did hear Susan Collins presentation and fall yesterday would you make of that yeah\nI thought it was a outstanding but Mars an outstanding it was such an important message because she weighed so well all of the issues\nAnd we're on a farm it the way that it makes you did a real um service to the to our country um you know Susan Collins I began to\nAs one of those that I make a strong conservative person mhm and um I wasn't sure where she was always going to come down on this issue but\nI just thank God she came down in the way she did and for her to deliver that message you have to realize she spent a considerable amount of time thinking through all of the ... militia that had to be dealt with what ... and\n... to that point though Edward as I Walk I couldn't agree with you more because\nSusan Collins she struck me as somebody who struggled long and hard with the decision to come to this conclusion of and and I know in some of the reporting that has been done\nHow much behind the scenes work she did a ... and others uh Lisa Murkowski also meeting with constituents\nAway from cameras not doing it because it would look good a good photo op as if I'm listening to look at me listening to people know they did a lot behind the scenes to truly lead themselves to a point where their vote would be as hard as it was ... they could be at peace with their vote\nAddict uh right now the the big winners are the country President Trump um it's unbelievable we have no a conservative majority in the court for my lifetime and be on the economy is booming like it's never had before I mean our enemies fear us our friend who's a respect or\nI'm going to focus just on what that is just on the court here um it's great do you fear as it sounds like you're a Republican conservative camera conservative sure do you\nDo you anticipate do you fear that this might I'm a cause momentum or lead to even more momentum for Democrats in a month or so in the midterms how do you are seeing them in terms now\nPersonally or the way I'm cabinet was treated I mean it was outrageous when they try to try to do to him I Would not be surprised if we keep all houses are we're up here we're going to gain seats in the Senate and and I would not be shocked if we maintain the house also\nOkay thanks for the call pat look whether you are a Trump fan or not this is a win for the president he's a winner in this\nYear's not even served three years and he already has not one but two picks on the Supreme Court right now\nOf course Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh either winter in this you have to admit it even if you're on the other side Charlotte in northern Illinois Charlotte\nGood to hear from you how are you can find us our\nAh that I'm tired of that Merrick Garland\nA argument he would not personally destroyed by the\nOpposing political party are you know unbelievable check to destroy judge Kavanaugh and also it had been the Democrats power here did not nominate in the last year than George Bush's presidency people to the higher court\nYou know elections matter a McConnell control the Senate and the whole you know\nDonald Trump won preventing a landscape nominees to the court the American people decided in two thousand sixteen\nSo who's the biggest winner in this whole ordeal Charlotte who do you think the constitution why ah [noise]\nA presumption of innocence due process that man to our bill of rights [noise]\nAh there was not a single shred of evidence against judge Kavanaugh Matty single cooperating witness\n... there was even ... and the FBI check ... line more people an extra week I interviewed nothing's\nI Do think Charlotte I Do think on the other side let's say\nYou know you play the game a what would have happened if Republicans would have or President Trump pulled the nomination of Kavanaugh\nBased on simply what we know now no other further information the precedent that that would set it does scare me because the ... because then as Susan Collins so eloquently said yesterday\nYou you've gone from a you know the innocent until proven guilty a court of law not a court of law but then what about the most likely are more likely than not I'm I'm\nA standard if if we're going to ignore that as well ... ... then all bets are off then it's just you know to the bar the door it it it gives me\nWorry the think had had his nomination been pulled\nHave this not unfolding as it did the precedent that ... cents for\nSingle and it's not just Supreme Court nominee who sits there at the table and that's just sit and answer questions in front of a committee for every ... a cabinet position for every undersecretary position for every ...\nEvery judicial nominees that is not just for the Supreme Court you know I'm a federal judge ships\nThe door that would have been open I think would have been scary for a lot of people in for the country\nI think having professor American Alan Dershowitz call this a car than it would take America into a darker period in the early fifties when Gilman heresy believe he was from Wisconsin\nOh yeah he was just you know I didn't really know that one I have\nThis lead a you know red scare at the time and that allegation thrown thrown out\nThere it is very scary to think about thanks for the call Charlotte it's good to hear from you call again call again for forty three Jim in

I Know you had said in recent days which ever side of the political spectrum comes up short in this Kavanaugh battle will be more galvanized than ever potentially heading into the mid term so do you believe that for the Democrats [noise]\nYeah I I well that that's my that's center at the time when I'm happy I'm less less emotional galvanize anger in Iraq\nWill vote to motivate angrier what both we both got nobody [noise] way out you never forget never say like if\nThey are are you going to ask Charlie you're clearly not generally you're clearly not using your old Wu TMZ cell phone or your plans to Britain you're breaking up with us a little bit here\nOn part you know there's going to get better on us around but\nMaybe move around a little bit so you so you certainly think that this uh this galvanize the Democrats go ahead we'll give it another shot\nI I think that if I Want some kinds of things he's got to lose by the winters are more satisfied I'm about as angry or the anger I

appreciate it and go brewer's we actually have that [laughter]\n[noise] it's been fun\nCharlie Sykes Arthur commentator contributing editor Weekly Standard host of the daily standard podcast you can follow him on Twitter course at Sykes Charlie before one was better than the first segment than it was in the last segment I don't know what happened there I'm\nIn a ... year a we know that a judge Kavanaugh is inside the Supreme Court reporter that he will be sworn in later tonight my guess is there will not be cameras like an entire media gay go nuts warm in there and record this my hunch is that\nThey will have a photographer and maybe one or two camera people there they will record the swearing in which will be done by a chief justice John Roberts and retired justice yeah retired Justice Anthony Kennedy\nDo have the photos they'll have the footage and then they'll release it to all of us after the fact so I don't think it's going to be so much he lied swearing in a police have remove protesters from the steps outside the Supreme Court we were right up against the door there for a while it was hard to tell looked like a couple of hundred\nMaybe President Trump tweeted a reaction to the um [noise]\nTo the protesters saying the crowd in front of the U.S Supreme Court is tiny\nLooks like about two hundred people and most are ... that would not even field a couple of rows of our Kansas rally already about rallies for that matter the fake news media tries to make it look so big Rio's and it's not your references Kansas he's in Kansas for a rally here tonight but\n[noise] yeah [noise] [noise]\nI think in a dimly what I'm saying this in some ways but Chuck Schumer was right when he spoke earlier today just prior to the vote\nAnd the Democrat from New York the minority leader of the Senate said quite candidly after a series of statements if you do not like what is happening here vote if you do not like Brett Kavanaugh\nAs the Supreme Court justice vote that I think is the best way for anybody who does not agree with what's happening in Washington at any level of being in the judiciary or the executive branch are in the legislative branch vote that is the record so we have if you want to protesters stormed the doors of the Supreme Court all that may probably get you as a night\nHim getting warm two days in a row how does that affect his arm moving forward and I would bet the club won't know for sure until they get to course built tomorrow they're sometimes they go to Josh\nAnd they say how's the arm feeling and they kind of make that decision had time we're sort of in uncharted waters here now where maybe he'd be asked to pitch on three or four days I don't think he's done that the season I have to go check but I don't think he has done that\nEverybody else can we find even with jeopardy throwing a the two innings yesterday he's got an arm that bounces back really well I think that bull pen is perfectly fine going into tomorrow\nAnd then you know offensive Lee I I always think whether I'm just a fan watching other teams or the teams for which I cheer but\nIf he makes a run and this isn't a hard and fast rule but it just seems is way so it's more anecdotal anything else when the team makes a run\nThrough the playoff through the baseball playoffs it always seems as if\nA man if if you're not divisional series they got a couple of guys that just get key hits who you don't expect to give ... hits and then in the U.S they get a guy who gets a big clutch it off the bench a pinch hitter hitting two fifty whatever the case may be\nAnd through two games you look at what ... Perez did yesterday and Eric crafts those are the type of things Matt and you can squash my joy if you like but those are the things that I see happening I go ... those things kind of happened the teams that have long runs in baseball playoffs\nNo joy squashing coming from me here Scott I think you're right on right or the I mean president line up you get there to the ballpark and you see presence on the line up and it kind of go okay so that's it and I guess a left hander they're going to go with President is not going to be scope it's not going to be our CEO let's see how this all works out and he ends up with\nTwo pretty big hit to couple doubles apt to left center and for me aircraft just continues to be that guy who can come up with a key hit there and he had here it's ah\nHe's really been a big part of the team and it's it's amazing histories of Scranton Wilkes Barre you know back in may and he he's he's playing triple a ball and who knows at the age he's thirty eight maybe he's thinking\nThis is going to be it for him and all of a sudden jet bandied just can't hit for the brewers and they they have to find something to me it seemed like the grass was acquired that was more of a band aid than anything else while I was wrong on that because he ... he came in and\nHe's a he's a senior done nice job and it feels like crafts gets a little bit more playing time that even Pina right now\nAnd then last but not least you look at uh\nThe Kansas City guys what what my stock is has done and he's maybe made up for a little bit of Lorenzo Cain who\nStill put some pretty nice at bats together but has yet to to really get going you're the through the first couple of games but when we stock is done through two games is is every bit of what David Stearns wanted out of him when they brought him in with that experience with that championship pedigree\nYeah absolutely he's heading out three Seventy five right now and and he's coming up with big it's not so much how many hits it's the biggest these coming in the fact that he can ah drive in runs and\nYou mentioned championship pedigree this is a guy who knows what it takes in such a cliche thing to say but he knows what it takes\nTo win and October and he's done it he's been to two World Series with the royals obviously he's won one of them and he is a big big big part of this team right now and the fact that he comes through I don't think is surprising anybody and\nThere's a lot of royals fans who've been paying attention to the brewers there's a I I bet there's a few more brewers have to walk around Kansas City right now because we stock is was was loved in Kansas City and just\nA as someone who spent some time ah living in that part of the country and follow people from that part on my Facebook and Twitter I can tell you all these royals fans are really hoping for the brewers to do well because the stock is because of ... even even ... a and a crash where at one point in the Kansas City organization\nHe has met Polly course you'll have all the post game take your calls tomorrow after game three could we'd be talking sweet oh how sweet that would be of a

twelve ten here on double duty and Jay this five forty six Scott wars we will have a great Scott and just a couple of minutes but first the kind of get something off my chest\nSomething that I saw unfold this week and then the irony of it so this was mid week we had a another rally color rally I dunno we'll see protest is more likely to be accurate turn\nTo fight for Fifteen group and the fight for Fifteen folks added again of course you probably saw at that rally they call it a rally called the protest\nAnd arrests were made um several of them were made over the new now whereas the object for reports were made during the noon hour on Wednesday the rally\nProtest why why aren't they using the word protest the protest appears to have started in the parking lot at the restaurant but moved to North avenue that's what multiple people then started sitting\nIn the road to block traffic on north avenue and did not follow police orders to stay on the sidewalk stay out of the road that's when police moved in and made arrests\nCourse fight for Fifteen as part of a larger protests that's being held across the country fast food workers in Milwaukee walking off the job on Wednesday in an effort to protest for\nHigher pay and the right to form unions to fight for Fifteen now and I don't have time to take calls on this but I really wish I could\nAs soon as I saw this unfolding on Wednesday afternoon and saw the video\nAnd hurt the audio and there was something incredibly ironic about it incredibly ironic that here you have a group of people who find it so very important\nTo stop whatever they were doing that day whether they were working at McDonald's and walked off the job but we're left their own jobs or many maybe did not have a job and said I feel so passionate\nAbout a Fifteen dollar minimum wage that I'm going to now cross over the sidewalk in the street sit down and go so far as to block traffic which could be certainly harmful if you're you know could be not good at cars barreling at you depending on when you get out there\nAnd if nothing else even get arrested I feel so passionately about Fifteen dollars for a minimum wage and I think it is so near and dear to my heart that I Will go to this extent\nA night in jail block traffic whatever I have to do to get Fifteen dollars if only I could get Fifteen dollars minimum wage I'm going to go to the hilt for this what's incredibly ironic about that and we should have a guess here oh what's your guess\nBecomes your well she's when it comes to your lively but I mean Fifteen dollars I don't know Fifteen dollars it'd be a livelihood I Know a lot of people who are getting by on less than Fifteen dollars an hour\n[laughter]\nYes you're right she says that it's their definition of livelihood I think\nIf that's your definition livelihood I I don't know what I [laughter] we've all them I say we all but I've made it out in less than Fifteen an hour a lot of people can make it on Fifteen oh my but the most ironic thing about all this is what this was Wednesday do you remember what happened on Tuesday", "show_name": "Wisconsin's Afternoon News", "year": "2018", "city":
