caused a lot of people to get down you know money to save for retirement they ended up spending it to kind of live\nAnd and so a lot of people now maybe they're working longer than they had originally tended to work\nIn addition what happened is during the recession a lot of people who were perhaps older ended up losing their jobs and I I think as much as as anybody it's the people who are in maybe their fifties and sixties who had the most difficult time trying to get comparable type of jobs\nThere are laws that say that employers cannot discriminate against people based on on their age and yet I think a lot of us believe that\nThose laws are very very difficult to enforce\nAnd that a lot of people are in fact discriminated based on their age let me give you a story this in the Chicago Tribune the other day guys fifty eight years old he he's a lawyer with a link the record of success he's got decades of experience he was a general counsel at deans foods\nHe was the c._e._o. of a dairy products trade group and and he was trying to he lost that those jobs for whatever reason and he was trying to get something comparable way couldn't get anything comparable so he decided well All right I Am I'm not going to be in a position where general counsel for some large company but you know what\nI still know my stuff and I I'm not at the age of fifty eight I'm not ready to retire at this point in time I don't want to start drawing down my retirement money so what I'm going to do is I'm going to lower my expectations I'm going to work at a job that\nI don't wanna say beneath them that's not what I mean but he made he he's he's arguably arguably overqualified for the job but you know what the heck yeah job is a job\nSo he starts looking for\nCorporate counsel types of jobs and he finds this jobs it's advertised it it's they're looking for a senior counsel position at I'm a medical technology company\n... okay well that this looks like something that I could perhaps do and then he comes across the at the ad says looking for senior counsel\nThree to seven years experience but no more than seven years of relatively relevant legal experience so three to seven years no more than seven of relevant legal experience and the guy says wait a minute\nYou know what what do you mean I understand a minimal that you want okay somebody that's worked in the field three years of relevant legal experience that that's fine\nBut what do you mean no more than seven\nWhat should you care and what if I've got twenty five years of experience you know it it doesn't that make me arguably perhaps more qualified guy never got an interview because he has more than the seven years of relevant legal experience\nAnd now he's turned around and and he he's filed a lawsuit saying this is blatantly this is blatant age discrimination you know they're\nThey are saying that you know they they don't want somebody because by limited somebody at the top and do it seven years of experience\nWhat they're saying is we don't want anybody who is older we don't want anybody who has more experience and this is I think this is bringing up to this whole issue did a lot of older Americans are finding\nThat you go in for the these jobs and you know you're just not getting in the door because despite the fact that the law says it can't discriminate against people based on age that is precisely what is happening and maybe it's because the employers who offer health benefits\nRecognize that somebody who is sixty maybe and I say maybe maybe statistically more likely to I don't know drawdown on health benefits and somebody who's Thirty years old\nMaybe it's because they figured that okay if you get the job at fifty five\nThey figured that okay if you get the job at fifty five maybe you're going to only stayed eight to ten years whereas you know we're looking for somebody who's going to be a part of the company for decades you know we're we're better off going with somebody who's thirty five\nBut this is I think in many respects a real problem that older Americans are having as they jump into the job market now it's very very tough I guess to prove it but in this particular case the guy saying hey I I've got I've got objective evidence of this\nThey're telling me that I Am a centrally overqualified for this job well who are they told me that I if I'm willing to do it what should it matter but they're really saying by putting a limit on the amount of experience is they don't want older more seasoned people\nThat want to open up the phone with our numbers for one for seven nine nine one six twenty but at the ... mortgage talking text why\nI Will tell you this anecdotally\nMy ... and this is just from from conversations that I've had with people over the last several years that even in a job market where you know we're nearing full employment\nThat from the perspective of people who are older and again I'm Talking about in the fifties and sixties but not ready to retire and again willing and able to contribute\nThere there is an incredible anti slash old bias that is there and that you have employers maybe subtly maybe not so suddenly who are sexually saying we're not interested in older workers\nHave you found that to be the case\nFor one for seven nine nine when six twenty that is the economic mortgage talk and text line and again I mean I understand that there were a lot of jobs for example that have just disappeared that were occupied by people who might have been in their forties and fifties and and those jobs are gone and those jobs aren't coming back\nBut have you noticed a reluctance or do you believe there is reluctance on the part of employers\nTo hire people again who are in their fifties and sixties because despite what they might be willing to say they truthfully just don't want to deal with older but you know not retiring Americans let's start with Diane and he'll squandering WGM Jake good afternoon\nHello yeah Hi Diane you're talking about my life story right now I'm really wondering the same or not or the nightmare a\nNightmare that's a better way of putting it I lost my job in October\nI still don't have a job I have applied to many many many times in between\nI've had a number of interview some good fit someone someone someone I got there I realized that wasn't what I wanted others I Would have like the job and didn't get the offer but there were many jobs that I Would have been perfect for it was like they were writing my job description I never heard the word\nI turned I was when I turned it into I I Know I'm sure that's a big part of it I miss that job a few weeks ago and it was it was up to me and to people and feedback I was getting from them was that they really liked me but then in the end they gave it to somebody else\nWho's presumably younger than\nI Am one of them I thought the last person I was coming at first or second interview on I walked out the door and she was quite a bit younger than me and I thought okay there you know I don't know that can be a fact but I think it is certainly a component\nBut when they don't want to give them an extremely hard worker and very dedicated screwing around on my cell phone 'cause I don't know what's going on right right you know I I Am I'm a real deal but nobody don't get me in the\n... and I think so yeah and I think there is that frustration I mean I understand you know it it sounds like what's going on is ... ... ... you can't discriminate against people based on age but the problem is how do you prove this I mean that\nRight and and how do you if you if you were to first of all how do you prove it secondly\nI'm you know you you presumably to try to work you don't have the wherewithal to go hire a lawyer that's going to you know didn't filed the lawsuit and things like that\nI think this was going on a lot I think there is blatant age discrimination when it comes to people trying to get jobs in this argument that well maybe you're overqualified for particular job both nuts to that I mean if if you're willing to work at the job\nYou would think that somebody would love to have somebody who's overqualified\nYeah that's the story that you led with you know what were they didn't want anybody with more than seven years of experience that's kinda funny 'cause I never thought about that but my own mother might Ninety two year old mother pointed out to me when I was reading it was like two to five years of experience\nAnd she said well you've got way more than five years old even look at you know I think they're just they only want it that much but now I'm thinking maybe that is what they're looking for they don't want somebody my own and they don't want to pay more\nWell yeah I mean I mean I I mean that I got to tell you again and this is this is just you know take it for what it's worth it when it when I saw that what do you think it through if you say you know I mean I I understand a minimum you know you we want three years because okay so you know was like in the field\nBut why put a maximum on it I mean if you can you can get somebody who's willing to do the job for whenever you're offering and it's got Thirty Years' experience when Joe loved to have that experience why put at maximum on their ... thanks\nSo you would think they wouldn't want Mart and the thing is that old story about your own job you know what if they're fifty five that there may be only will be there eight years you know I definitely think tears unemployment let possibly depending on whether I go to my retirement age right\nI'm going to be there that if they don't want to hear it they're going to get disgusted I look for somebody else\nWho am I was right there is no guarantee that somebody's going to stay at a job I mean you you there's no guarantee you doesn't matter whether you're sixty or whether you're thirty there's no guarantee you're exactly right and somebody could turn around and Sarah I'm leaving in three years right next to call it they hang in there for one for seven nine nine one six twenty\nHi I'm a frog or Israel\nOr or was a construction worker for quite a few years and I turned sixty four and my son took over took over the job and um and\nI was looking for something to do that I wasn't ready to totally sit back and re sure there there was a\nFactory job available in a city called\nGo fight or flight and I got to interview and I'm about to background check and then after that the physical and it was I was hired and I'm like I go to the job and worked for approximately six weeks and then on the last\nFew minutes of my one\nAnd then my ship the form uncovered and said after today we want to get any more and I said gosh why is that um\nTo do something wrong or something I didn't do it you know you're you're doing a good job or that I said well you're let me go and he wouldn't\nGive me an answer a Human Services the next couple of days and what to do with those and no one ever gave me a real good answer so I finally found her case um\nTeaches criminal action right\nRight but um I couldn't have any proof or a theater of Ninety Days grace period before you were able to join a union you\nKnow regular you run if you were probably probationary employees stuff but you're convinced it was because of your age they could just find somebody who is younger\nRight because I could see how much product that I put out that I knew what the other show before and after me put out and I know of producing as much if not more than what they were doing but I I feel a lot of lot of it has to do with a factor of health insurance\n[laughter] well yeah the ... did you know I mean I I get it to I mean the ... the idea number one that if you hire somebody who's older and\nAnd it's not necessarily the case in somebody to thirty five years old to develop a serious medical condition\nBut the idea that somebody who's sixty years old for example going to be a bigger drop health insurance and things like that I I think this is one of the subtle things and it is subtle and it's difficult to prove that I think it is going on in the American workplaces today\nJulian Brookfield actually on WGM Jay\nHi what do you think well I think well\nI'm going to give a little bit of a different perspective um first of all any kind of discrimination very bad but it only happens in full spectrum though they try to young people get discriminated against either don't have enough and you know experience or they look too young to be taken seriously\nThe other thing is as far as the attorney where it was you know the free to seven years of experience while there's a couple of reasons one the company policy could be that they have to pay someone a certain amount based on their experience and they just don't have that in their budget\nAnd then the other issue as well is this guy gets higher nice yeah you know twenty Thirty years of experience and his immediate supervisor only have maybe Fifteen what kind of a\nWorking environment or you're creating there that can create a lot of problems too\nWell but then then you have to see that and what you're saying Julie ... then that's just kind of court blush for for discrimination because that that's almost always going to be the case if you reach a certain point you're in your fifties or maybe your early sixties\nChances are if you go to a new place you're probably going to find a supervisor who's Yonkers or let's just kind of the ... so I mean if that's the case then I mean new older Americans could ever be discouraged\nNo older Americans could ever be discriminated against because they're always going to be working for somebody to Juncker the\nCorrect but then maybe someone who had twenty or Thirty years right maybe they shouldn't be applying\nFor those jobs will ... or no no I I see 'cause my on my argument would\nBe that that you you know obviously you as the older employees you know it's the person their fifties or sixties\nYou have a responsibility to adapt to the to the culture and if you come in and say with the attitude of I Know more than my supervisor or whatever\nThat creates an issue at all you could write you know it could be and and that perhaps is a reason for saying look this isn't working out after they try it I guess I just don't and that's maybe even a reason\nTo some a question you asked during the interview process are you sure you really want to to do this you know you've you've had these high level type of jobs but I just don't think you should be able to simply say no just because the supervisor was forty and you're sixty you're not going to get the job\nRight I agree with you and I I guess I see it per se knowing\nYou know somebody maybe a little older and more experience it shouldn't be that way right right under somebody who has what I really shouldn't be that the dynamic but see that happen and of course they create really bad environment right will know thinks they know what they're doing and I'm trying to company in Thirty Years' experience it\nWell I mean the ... I mean but it in that case I mean I guess like I said if it turns out to be an actual you know\n... that happens you know that happens all the time and I guess my my my only point is that after you've done so I've been I've been here for Twenty years All right so it's it's not surprising that the people\nYou know our our program director is younger than I Am you know that that's that's the deal you know a lot of the management staff is younger than I Am and has less experience but it's all\n... that's I think that that's the whole thing that you have to kind of work stuff out there and if you are the older employee the you you have to be willing to say okay well there's there's new ways that you're going to do certain stuff and you have to be open to that and you can't just digging their heels\nAnd say nope I've been doing this this is how we did it twenty five years ago and this is how we're always going to do it well that's a recipe for failure but at the same time simply because you've got more experience than say your supervisor I mean look what when I was in the U.S attorney's office I was a supervisor and\nI was younger that some of the people that I was supervising and\nI I don't know and I have less experience I guess in some of the people I was supervising but it's just something that you you you know figure out a way to you know work out again I\nI don't know how this particular law suits going to turn out there's some there's some\nInteresting legal issues as to what does the law say and who can bring lawsuits and stuff like that\nBut I I Do think this is one of the recurring issues that we're facing in our society namely the fact that there is I think sometimes subtle sometimes less subtle\nDiscrimination against people as they get older and it's one of

good afternoon Wayne how you doing John I'm doing Great Hey nicer dumped information Crosby but I Want to ask you\nAbout another guy to begin with Kevin king critical interception late in the game we know this guy as high upside tell us about Kevin kings upside and its evolution\nWell his first intersection of his career you know he went through an injury like you see the last year a showed promise and this year is ban went healthy the Packers that's covered order\nAnd uh that was a great player that he made them at all but I have you have to get my credit because\nThey came with an all out lifted especially the pressure up ... or right after quarterback did not allow a you know the quarterback is CJ better to step forward and and a complete that has that was the same way they earn Packers opera big cuts down a to a good one in the first quarter so\nUh and the difference of the two plays is that the quarterback was able to step up in the pocket and delivered throat you wasn't able to step up as much because of the pressure so I get credit for that intersection as well the parents are just a little bit under thrown and Kevin used all three of his brain to grab a\nWayne Larrivee is with us on WGM Jay Wayne as we head into the by week and then a very tough stretch I Want to ask you a two part question the first part what is the strength of this Packers team as we head into the by week\nOh I'm you know I mean that it's been so inconsistent strikers Aaron Rodgers I mean ... years ago makes it go one way or the other um as far as you know what what would be good for you I guess\nUh the deep end or in general um has struggled at times to stop a craft and last night really struggled to stop the run of course drunk quite a bit in that ballgame\nBut I've got to say this about that because I'm In the fourth quarter they needed to get three three stops and they were able to do that in one of them ended\nA Kevin gang interceptions so uh I got you got to give them a lot of credit when when it really counts they stepped up and made a stand about ball game but they have yet to put together a for really solid real good quarters or outside of the buffalo game of the times\nWhen I wanted to ask you about red zone efficiency last night Aaron Rodgers once again demonstrates why he indeed is probably the best in the game and his position\nBut the offense to for for when it comes to touchdowns in the red zone really could be two for five because they also at a drive that stalled out at the Twenty one yard line how do you solve the red zone efficiency problem if you're the Green Bay Packers\nWill I think some of that will happen when they get you out of a um I think also when they get a little better feel for how to use Jimmy grandmother read these got such a great radio\nUm you know I I think that'll come along I'm not as worried about the red zone often says is a lot of people are I think we're the hackers are struggling or did last night the big struggle was a third down there just couldn't get hurt\nAaron Jones I Know everybody's talking about Aaron Jones not getting enough carries yesterday eight carries forty one yards five point one of her carry this guy's really dynamic kid isn't he\nHe is um but you know what John is not complete yet he's not a tree down back yet there was crucial play a fairly crucial play a part of the fourth quarter where they threw him a little after the flat and\nAnd he dropped it yeah not a very complex as a receiver or as a a a block or pick up the blitz yet so that's why he's not getting more time of the field especially in the second half down the stretch\nWayne Larrivee the voice of the Packers lean thank you so much for being with us our guys have a good week\nWe continue to monitor the fire a chase and Oklahoma things much better situation than it was but there is still a little bit of smoke coming from that fire traffic has been impacted in the area as well uh Debbie we'll get back to you
