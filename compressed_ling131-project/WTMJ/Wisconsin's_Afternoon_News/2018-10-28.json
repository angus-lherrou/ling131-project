{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WTMJ", "content": "I'm also in Westchester County New York yesterday the packages were immediately identify during routine male inspections investigation of those is ongoing Margaret Willard ABC News\nWe'll keep you posted on those uh updates as they come in on top of the hour new as well so I have some information on that does is it's one of those indications that uh the violence as a part of what the national storyline has been about ... extreme rhetoric instability\nAnd now direct threats when ... when it comes to explosives devices is playing out in real life at the latest case to the home of\nFormer President Bill Clinton and presidential nominee Hillary Clinton after the break we'll be rejoined by congressman Grossman I'm gonna ask you about that that story\nBut also uh the president's conduct in the last week or so and then I'll be ... minutes from Central America is making its way to the U.S border and President Trump is committed to stopping you Jeff Wagner thinks he's on the right track\nYour just explanation is today at twelve ten we are joined on the phone by Wisconsin congressman Lynn Grossman for someone who's your comments on the developing news story\nMore explosive devices found now the latest on at the home of bill and Hillary Clinton we saw of course yesterday George Soros\nWhat do you make of his\nHopefully the Afghan it's going to track down this individual quickly and their prosecuted and have to serve all on a long prison sentence I mean it it's just a horrible thing that's happened in our political process I Can't imagine who would do such a thing\nI think over time it becomes easier to track down people who do something like this and like I said I Hope we hope you find that very quickly that\nI've talked to you and I have talked before about the conduct of the presidents and and you you frequently saying well you don't like his tweets you agree with most of his policy as I Do in most cases but I've I've noticed in the last week or so the president has played pretty fast and loose with the details of storylines\nAnd I think of maybe a the the ... the caravan of migrants caravan will be through Central America and some international stories\nAs well what do you make of the presidents who doesn't seem to be in touch with the facts of the storylines\nWell a President Trump has a tendency to embellish on the facts and sometimes in Belgium figures and that's a frustrating thing I mean I I've only had one\nSay conversation of over met with President Trump says she was sworn in and I told them to tweets these are partly as tweets were not helping them and if I Do what I'm always in the uh all next time I see it might I plan on trying to talk about that with him again\nYou know the economy is doing very well I think he gets a lot of responsibility for that I think his cabinet is tremendous\nI think it's Supreme Court picks are tremendous he just that necessarily hurts himself and quite frankly other Republicans by some of these tweets I mean he's got a heightened it up you know and uh\nIt's a it's a frustrating thing because in so many ways\nI thought a very good job or you know he unlike these other politicians he has a sense of urgency and way too many people in Washington they have no sense of urgency uh I think if you pay attention to where he is on the issues\nCompared to the average Republican I think most of your listeners will find is much more for the average guy either the average Republican that's why they got like about\n... congressman you said that he got to tighten up on the streets do you think his\nMessage as you're in the midst of your reelection campaign is helping you are hurting you\nWell I think the fact the economy's doing book very well helping me and he's got he's got a lot of credit for that so in that regard it's helping me I think and so fires heat embellish does in his tweets or a is\nA little immature his tweets ears me because we're both Republicans and all I can do is say look you know I have taken my time to try to change that I've watched a lot of other Republicans are on President Trump and they got all you know squishy and farming and even wants to know something is wrong they're\nAfraid to to address the issue with Donald Trump and I'm not afraid to address the issue with them but uh you know we just have to uh appreciate all the good things she's doing and hope that over time I use it proved it in the last year on this but over time kind of tightens up on what he says\nI got about thirty seconds I wouldn't Wisconsin congressman growth and do you agree as as a lot of people are saying that the health care is the number one issue in the states are discussing\nUm health care and uh making sure we have enough people for industry I think the two things I hear about most\nOur health care and you know my district he has more manufacturing jobs have their district in the country I don't care whether you're dealing in manufacturing are dealing with the medical field we have a shortage of people to work and if you can have this economy boom we have to have more people trained for the jobs are available out there\nIs always great to talk to Wisconsin congressman Glenn growth we've got to get your back in Studio soon\nAbsolutely next time on Capitol dry\nAll right good to see him and thanks for coming on congressman ... always wanted to talk to as I said there's a lot going on and we'll keep you up to date on the way to stories in the news is next right here WTO ...\nMorning was the night away from the city with you on this Wednesday they'll forget our show bull is oftentimes sweaters find me a W ... and you see the question [noise] Netflix is out with his second season of\nMaking a murder\nSteven every guilty or innocent simple as that you can weigh in on on the Twitter poll will do that every day on the show going forward so there's your opportunity\nAlso unnecessary twenty W changes to the page as well or joining us now is outstanding attorney general for the state of Wisconsin brash image good morning\nThe morning the how are you good so you had a big meeting I Believe it was last night's or this week on the opioid and mess problem in the state what are we what are we learning about that problem is as all of us in the state of Wisconsin it seems like we all know someone or know a family that's been affected by this what are we learning about it how are we dealing with it\nYeah that is a fact we I it it will cost everybody if you if it's not your family if somebody you know well and that that's true for almost every Wisconsin I [noise]\nWell what we have learned is that we have to work at a collaborative comprehensive approach to this forever we have gone after drug problems by going after only ... the supply side\nWhat it's never worked and we shouldn't have been surprised because as long as the demand exists somebody is going to spend the money or say somebody is going to be willing to sell drugs to people who are willing to spend money to buy drugs you have to address the supply side and we are doing that very effectively as\nWe caused that event yesterday with the two U.S attorneys in the eastern and western district of Wisconsin I'm On local law enforcement with walking police department and among others\nWhen we've ever work better as federal state and local partners but we also have to go beyond just than just going after the drug dealers we've got to address wire people using drugs and so this conference yesterday had over five hundred people and many of those many of them were\nHealthcare specialist treatment or experts a victim advocates law enforcement prosecutors social services public health yet everyone together and we know that\nWe know that we've got to get more treatment in place for the people suffering we've built it yes it's two thousand four came when I took office\nUm we had twenty nine counties with treatment alternative and diversion court programs in Wisconsin we now at fifty one\nAnd two tribal communities and we're going to work to keep growing that for some of the smaller county it's hard for them to have the economy of scale to operate a court tire the staff you need to do it but we're gonna we're we're going to keep working on ways to have regional court so that we can get that available to every county\nWe've got to figure out why do people start using these in the first place we know often times it is traumatic experience is people have as children mhm teachers telling me that by kindergarten and first grade they know which kids are going to be using drugs by the time they're in junior high\nWe've never taken advantage of that knowledge before we are now going to take advantage of that that's why with our school safety grants\nWere requiring schools and requiring makes it sound like they're resisting because they're welcoming test but schools are now going to be training every single full time staff member in adverse childhood experiences in the common form of care\nAnd then ten percent of the school staff are going to get adolescent mental health advanced adolescent mental health training and we're going to safety intervention teams all of this is designed\nWhen we identify those kids that are struggling to do something about it to get services plugged into that child into their family\nTo make sure that they don't become the kid at in junior high that's using drugs or engaging and violence and acting out will be able to prevent more kids from using drugs will be able to threaten more kids from engaging in violence in our schools all of that it's going to make it safer in stronger long term\nWe're talking to Wisconsin attorney general bread shame on WGM say let me ask you about the story I read the other day about the DNA backlog I went to when did you get your take on why that is and what we're doing in the state of Wisconsin to address that\nYeah there's a whole lot of factors that are playing a role in this one of them is a year and a half ago the FBI increased the um [noise] there there are different locations on a personal DNA strand\nAnd the [noise] I'm trying to think of the right word here\nPast we use before could only we we can only passed with certain\nAh [noise]\nThe past we use before could only we we can only passed with certainty to a certain number of locations will now were you able to look at more locations that gives us more certainty ... when we get a DNA in a result\nTo use the word nationalism or national list is really it's really not helping the cause and it suggests that he still doesn't get it when it comes to communication\nReally change I don't know but it's something he needs to think about every word you choose matters and in this case the wording choose was the wrong word take a break more natural WGM jak\nCaravan of thousands of migrants to make its way toward the U.S Mexico border was I mean for people in Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson ways then when he joins John mature at four thirty for Wisconsin's afternoon news and Eric and I are keeping\nAn eye on the developing story from New York City now CNN facilities uh we have the the reports from the building a home of a bill and Hillary Clinton George ... of course earlier the lots of developing storylines year all related to threats or in some cases explosive devices\nThis all started yesterday we heard about the George Soros situation and it was making the news that this uh financier for liberal causes short source\nIn a suspicious device the explosive device was\nFound at his home now we're learning that other devices had been sent to like you said former presidents rock Obama Bill Clinton them the most recent development is what's happening right now in New York but Time Warner center has been evacuated\nSo there are people without their coats all just clearing that center and in that center of course is the CNN New York bureau\nSo now this is becoming a story that is starting to develop they become even more fluid than it already was the secret service had already been investigating these other stories that we had been some of them had come yesterday the the devices that arrived at the Clinton home had been scan did they have people that you know check the mail that comes into their their home\nThis is a little bit more fluid in active right now what's happening in New York with the folks now evacuating the time Warner than what they found there again a very broad in their description of what it is like clearly something that is more incentive evacuation at this time\nSo we'll keep you posted on all the way it is about my son that throughout the show this morning after the news right to be talking with two gentlemen are that are related to the story about Eric ... W teams that cares raised the beam initiative that'll be after the news\nSeventy five seats with you on this Wednesday\nI've done every day of this month [noise] that'd be a chance that cares\nRaised the beam Eric ... says project this month and then they ... they've been are just great features and today it's no different than Eric I'll let you introduce our guest in the studio this morning\nSo we are trying to raise the beam of course this is the six foot twenty two hundred pound piece of steel from the north World Trade center towers that currently rests on the ground in the center of ... we went out and raise the beam further nine eleven Memorial Day as you do see\nSo many other aspects of the story than just nine eleven and the victims itself the other the other aspects of it being the first responders being the U.S military the educational component there's so much to this memorial\nAnd what we're trying to do is help with phase one raised the beam forty thousand dollars would we'd love to do it by the end of the month and we need your help with that we will let you know how to donate and of course thinks the first big financial center for their help in this project is WTO O. J. cares initiative so how did you build a memorial with so many different components so many different aspects\nJoining us in Studio is Dustin males are using architect of dust that will let you explain where you come from and all that and Peter could lotta reflects don't thanks guys for being here today\nA thank you very much Eric I'm a senior vice president of architecture and construction with lakeside development company out of ... and I was approached early on in the project and asked to help and use my professional talents to to basically move the needle on a design\nHave you ever built a memorial before I have not this was the first story so where where do you start with a process well\nI was actually a a given an artist concept that was developed by another to us from high school graduate or David heirs and Gordon and a year ago so who you've spoken with earlier this month\nI just asked if I were to help take this idea and develop it into a concept that we could use for fundraising and give folks have visual on what this might look like some day\nIs it pretty remarkable and striking rendering which you can see 'em ... got WTO O. J. dot com [noise] when you think of raising the beam and having to point toward New York and all of that I assume physics has to come into play a little bit okay how do we get that in the year and make that work\nAbsolutely and that was one of the first the challenges that I face was holy cow this is a you know one ton piece of steel just over one time and how do we support this so I reached out to some of my professional contacts I'm an engineer\nAnd he gave me some advice as to what we might need to do in that it was actually possible because you get an artist concept that doesn't always translate into reality\nI'm so that was a there was one of the first steps in making sure this could happen\nAnd Peter what's your and how did you get involved\nA dusting that asked me [laughter] ... previously or we work together um I work for flights on landscaping her and the owner and principal a landscape designer and so he needed that and so I volunteered to help\n'em and so then I came up with the whole design of a site\nWhy was it important to be involved in the present well I've been out to nine eleven site and it was very moving for me and I\nCouldn't raise my hand fast enough\nWhen you see a different sites that adds some are either influences are there and pressures how does that work when you say okay I Want to replicate or at least you bring something to light here he wants to come there isn't the same in New York or Washington but also as a meaning in depth to it\nWhen I tried to do was using to monitor that you don't never forget so instead of just creating a memorial we wanted to create kind of a teaching center so you know her Fifteen sixteen year olds were going to live when this happened\nAnd it's so close to to us or me who are older but there are people that it's not\nSo in their face or in their\nUm say they're not just in the consciousness as much as ours we went through it or were there when I heard about ... everybody knows where they were when it happened\nI'm teaching him how did you incorporate that into your design so and so what we did was I Would I Do is build a are designed a ring of of trees to inside that ring of an apathy her um where it's race where people can sit and listen to someone talk about the event [noise]\nI'm In the middle of the um circle is this Pentagon shaped desk\nI'm In honor of the victims you know of that event and on top of that is where the beam is going to stand so it's going to be very dramatic as people look at whoever's speaking they'll have to have been pointing at New York and it will be very dramatic\nDustin when you first started to take part in this project have you noticed anything since then what what is raise your eyebrows what have you felt how is this gone as you've gone through this process\nUm for me it was it was just the awareness I mean I've been working on this for four and a half years now and just getting out there and talking to people and uh you know young ... as you said before the younger generation that did not experienced is emotionally\nI'm there all the come up and talk to us and touched the beam and you know so let's tell them that they're going to be enlisting and you know in the military um because they want because as far as continue to go on today and they wanna they wanna help\nAnd um they don't personally my my story is that my daughter is nine years old she was actually born on nine eleven and she came home a from first grade with a book about the terrorist attacks and that just a you know sent chills on my spine that you know because of my involvement\nBecause this is in the schools\nUm in the community people are learning about it and they're asking questions about it and they're not easy questions to answer but at least people are talking about it and that's what's important to me\nAnd one thing we should point out to ... as we raised this be one of one of the aspects that I find so important and said you'll still be able to touch it correctly can actually put your hand on the bean even if in the air and for some people like tactical experience actually could help in some way as you try to comprehend what happened\nIs there some showers this for either want to use some challenge we have something that's that\nBig and that heavy to to build it in a way that's one incredibly impressive to people that come up on it but also save for all the people that do come upon this thing\nI think Peter you can talk to how you isolated this in the center of the ...\nLook them up on it but also save for all the people that are that do come upon this thing\nI think Peter you can talk to how you isolated this in the center of the memorial and created this this outdoor room that really isolated from\n... where do you have this ring of trees that surrounds the space and and make it more intimate um\n... if\nYou can surrounded by the states are almost cuddled are held by it\nAnd the significance of the tree that we used that surrounded his the pear tree I'm On the site there was one survivor tree after the accident which was this ornamental pair for kind of taken as a symbolism of the rings around this whole space\nAnd then I'm\nGoing that again creates this kind of intimate space where you're not just out in this field and uh and we wanted to kind of have this kind of to play the feeling when you're in that area\nOn my yesterday or maybe Monday or was um so now here we are now learning that a pipe bomb or some type of device was also sent to the White House it was an intercepted well before even close to the White House\nAnd uh we await word from the president or other authorities here about what exactly these are where they are coming from all of that is still you have to be determined\nI read the statement from the White House are read by the press secretary Sarah Sanders and and their condemning these attacks as you would expect to it's a it's not but there's no grey area here [noise]\nAnd and at this point we don't know a lot 'cause they're they're clearly have always been threats to government figures that's why we have a secret service right we have we've had a white ex presidents and ex officials often carry on that protection way pass the time they're in office\nBecause there are people in this country that are intense I'm causing them harm\nAt this point motivation is not known motives are always difficult to determine anyway but we we do know that these devices have been sense\nAre targeting the White House the Obamas the Clintons Soros family as well and then does give on pause and when you think about the current state of affairs in this country and I know a couple of ... and say well how can you make that connection\nI'm not making that connection I'm saying given the current political climate\nIcy parallels between what happened to the Nineteen sixties and in some cases the assassinations that happened in Nineteen sixties John Kennedy Robert Kennedy Martin Luther king\nAnd that was also a very tense time in our country at what shocked me at all if we're seeing a ramping up of threats of violence while our current political situation is kind of unfolding mid term elections the ramp up to twenty twenty the times are different clearly\nI Would argue in some ways they're more volatile than they were in the Nineteen sixties I as far as that is to say and believe but here we are we're talking about in this case explosive devices\nWrong I I think often times you don't realize the impact of rhetoric and again you can't we have no idea what the connection is if there even is one\nBut you you look back at this release shooting you remember that shooting during the baseball practice it didn't take long until rhetoric amped up again and things that are just said by a politician with just meant to make a a news cycle and make a sound bite oftentimes\nAdds to the intensity that the rest of the country has its it's true it's just there's a deep hatred or at least the eight deep\nEnergy for lack of a better word between the two sides red and blue right now and it's always been that way but now it's more than ever before and just the rhetoric add\nTo that I I think there's a case to be made that when you when you're going to the point where you're shouting down on people who are just going out to dinner with their spouses or their families in restaurants in public places we have escalated that rhetoric to a point where people can't they can't even function anymore\nWe all know that mental health and mental illness or an issue in this country shouldn't surprise anybody and again we don't know the motives you don't know the background of whoever did this amazing these threats are sent these devices\nBut it doesn't there's not a big leap of faith to suggest that when you have people that are unstable\nOr showing signs of mental instability that they can go to the next level and that could be what we're talking about here and I think it's important to remember when you have conduct that rises sort of level we've seen you mentioned is Congressman Steve Scully you mentioned\nPeople not being able to even go out to dinner with their spouse because people want to threaten them in restaurants or the attacks and pronounced made by even elected officials towards each other\nThe rhetoric they use all these things contribute to the climate in this country\nIsn't it interesting though that you just kinda automatically assume that this is some type of domestic situation\nThat we do and it isn't\nIt funny though like we wouldn't have thought that a couple of years ago but now it's like automatically just assume it some craved lunatic from within our own country that's doing\nYeah again we don't know anything about the motivation of this individual or individuals that are doing this but right now we look at the the climate of the country it should not shock your surprise you and that's why I Will continue to monitor story or as I said you know had to evacuate their headquarters\nAre there still evacuated ... yeah I think Jim ... a share on the streets broadcasting live on a on CNN right now um\nThey were basically ushered out of their building the alarm went off to get out of their studio while they're doing the show\nAnother broadcasting on the streets of New York heavy police presence as well I don't know the specifics of that of that the threat yet and we'll probably learn much more throughout the day are right here is that the teams able given the latest on these stories but explosive devices threats made White House the Clintons the Obamas the George Soros family and also CNN\nAll of those places being threatened by this story today so we'll keep you posted on that that is number one of our for at sand the four biggest source as we see the costs Milwaukee state in the world number two\nWe've talked about it before the Milwaukee health department now facing criminal investigation\nWhat is this all mean would break it down for your next right here in the ... and they really on this Wednesday on WGM Jay we're in the middle of our for Ed Towns I forget the have a chance to win more you symphony orchestra tickets for\nA kind of a fun thing a holiday or Hollywood celebration and music of Hollywood but you got to get a rise to write them down if you have to be for attend the four biggest stories as we see it across Milwaukee the state in the world number two Eric it's not a news story per se market health department issues with their their a\nResponse to the the lead water situation the ladder roles and the impact on Milwaukee citizens health but now pending criminal investigations into that department so ultimately\nTonys or Lenski had issued a press release we had seen it if they they sent it out to everybody questioning why Bevan Baker hadn't been subpoenaed and testifying\nBefore a city hall on the hold water issue with the health department Bevan Baker you may recall or had resigned abruptly not that long ago because of the situation where they were doing the letter Bateman process properly there was a lot of issues within the the health department and over\nThe last few months we try to here I'm sure other news agencies have is well we've reached south of Yemen\nBaker into his lawyer him I always get the same response back basically saying I Will let him know that you've requested an interview and usually that's all you've ever heard the ah so ... was questioning why wouldn't\nWe bring him in a year from the man himself from now only shot to handle the Milwaukee common council president says the reason is because there is a criminal investigation into the matter and that's why for now we have not heard from back and think\nYeah I mean on the side of all them in twenty so is he slammed the show on the handle decision not to subpoena Baker\nAny he issued a statement actually saying accused him of playing politics with the health and safety of our citizens delayed delayed delays seems to be the president's monster here referring to president shots you Hamilton the real issue is transparency conspiracy and shoots the citizens and families of Milwaukee desert so these two women going back and forth on this handles and comes back\nAccused excuses whiskey who uh who has already announced remarkably so that is the twenty twenty mayoral candidate\nGrandstanding here's what Hamilton said\nNot interested in wasting staff and council members time it's quite a spectacle that were ... nothing but an opportunity for you to grandstand on the issue I come\nDown as the whiskey inside here let's get to the facts of the case let's find out what's who's responsible for the delays for the bad communication maybe in some cases the retribution it was raining down upon health department employees for not producing information not letting them tell people about what was happening in their departments\nBottom line is people can be affected by these decisions or lack of decision and lack of leadership whether it's a shot to Hamilton are better than Baker\nI think Tony so let's get on to something here you have to ask these questions let's get Bevan bakers peanuts or we can find out what the real answers are I understand the politics understand ponies Lewinsky's throwing his head into a race that hasn't even begun yet\nThere's always going to be that when you talking about elected officials\nAlso understand ponies Lewinsky's throwing his head into a race that hasn't even begun yet\nThere's always going to be that when you're talking about elected officials doesn't anyone to take a shot the Hamilton has some career aspirations when it comes to a higher office hands mayor of Milwaukee\nThey're not no one's immune from this but the bottom line is the citizens of Milwaukee deserve answers on their health\nAnd if you have any health departments and as someone who led that department the words and his conduct matter and that's what I think ultimate twenties was getting so we've also reached out the ultimate if he wants to talk about this and I don't think we've heard back yet but uh\nI don't I don't think that a shot the Hamilton president Hamilton is right when he says the someone's cause meaning how his leadership is asking tough questions\nQuestions I should be asked\nLast thing from Hamilton we're supposed to be trying to respond a probably a properly to this crisis while you and your accomplices offer only criticism and conspiracy theories raft and misinformation and confusion so as you're a leader I asked that your excuse yourself from the table when when the hard decisions are being made or I by God's will ... will excuse you again that's shanty Hamilton\nI'm not sure where he's going with that and again that's that's a mute the politics out of it let's get to the bottom\nOf this and figure out what is the problem here who dropped the ball what we can do and how we can fix it classic Milwaukee problem\nPolitics overcoming overriding everything else not fixing the problems that exist get to politics out of it all depends on skis and and\nPresident Hamilton are both welcome to come on the show and you need their side of the story so that's number two of our for its hand he for biggest stories as we see it across Milwaukee the states\nAn attack on domain people would say that what ... did not good for unions but there's another perspective too I mean how 'bout to actually describing it as what Scott Walker has done for taxpayers through at ten so the way they frame their stories and they probably maybe don't even realize it themselves as a\nAs I think has perspective somewhat safe biased and advocacy but\nThat's just one example there seven hundred of these uh of these are stories that have appeared well some of those I I Can't say seven hundred and some of these stories have up here to multiple\nCan have papers but another one that a damn Bentsen pointed out was one from last uh last August die in which they I think it's fair to say lamented the speed at which the Walker administration has pushed through some significant legislation saw that yeah you know so those were a couple of examples\n... here's how I see it playing out when I when I look at the coverage and I read everything about the elections we have is obviously the mid term elections coming up I read everything about them and I and I and I look at the stories the choice of the editors make\nA December reporters out a way to do uncovered certain elements and it does seem like just from the casual perspective of somebody who talks about politics for a living\nThere seems to be an increased emphasis on covering the critical elements of the Walker campaign less so on ... campaign let me give it a direct example the plagiarism story last week\nTony Tony Evers responds with no discipline we acknowledge that had happened and that that was like the\nEnd of the story where's the heart journalism being done on that story and why is that not continue to\nBe as I mean I I have to say that I I was a little surprised especially with journalists to if you plagiarize in a newsroom at least when I was in a newsroom he got fired just a big deal and it's a big story\nIt's really a big deal when it's when the policy of posted on your own Web site at department public construction and yet you were found guilty Tony Evers being the you there of doing that very thing yet there's no discipline and\nYeah and you know I Do I Do think that a lot of reporters they do do make an effort to be fair to to be to be objective um and and often succeed I'm\nWith the stories that they do right I'm not always but I think uh they're in an atmosphere where they often don't see the things of interest to folks who are in the center even let alone on the right so it's also the things that they don't fight the questions that they don't ask\nFor talking to Mike Nichols president badgering switch over here to take a quick break here we come back other issues facing journalism in in the era of Donald Trump and as we said to be the contentious Wisconsin election season that's all next right here WTO's a\nForty five minute with you on this whether they're happy [laughter] everybody forty six degrees at Radio City over the place\nWhere you are thanks for listening as always we're joined by Mike Nichols the president of the ... Institute and we want to get one more thing about transparency or as we were talking about the advocacy journalism and just the press in general\nYeah I just wanted to make one more point I'm In the world is sort of heading towards advocacy journalism and let's have some transparency right I mean you have a W Madison is actually making any kind donation to an advocacy journalism group and decker ... stories that are running into can have papers but\nUh okay I'm a you know can add needs a copy to fill a whole but let's be transparent about it and tell people who these folks are or who are producing these stories that are running in the main cause you never know that George Soros has given ... million dollars\nUm ... you know over until a couple of years and they give them a million dollars you'd never know who the other funding sources are you'd never know that it's very very fair to characterize them at at least\nAt least left leaning if not just progressive so I mean let's let's let's have some transparency about about who folks are you're going to run their stock the I don't see that and that is kind of it's kind of offensive it's not um it's it's not it's not it's not ethical in terms of the way a way I understood journalism ethics\nYeah for for somebody wants to school for broadcast journalism I understand what I think I understand what the rules should be of disclosure and being ethical are probably some of the principal tenants of that profession do you think consolidation of the newspapers you mentioned the good that grew up in and how that's all come together has that contribute to this\nI'm not I'm not sure about that I mean you look at their reach and it's still way down from where it used to be I mean sure they've consolidated can add on ten papers but I'm the journals down to a hundred and thirty thousand or something on Sunday that can act like you know given that the other Tanner are down I think on Sundays to a hundred and\nFifty thousand total so I'm sure they're consolidating but uh and they're and they're one voice now a but hey you know they started there they don't have to reach that they used to\nHear that somebody who who died just a lot of newspaper contact mostly on line it's interesting you go to all these different websites always papers across the state and saw the same concept so you can really ... in eases that process I Want to ask you quickly about journalism in the age of Donald Trump presidents\nWho uh is I I use the term uncharacteristically on presidential in the way he communicates and do you think that's been a challenge for journalists to kind of push aside some of the bias especially we've seen some Jim Acosta ... of the world but Caitlin columns already announced that seem to have a running battle with the president well\nTwo things I guess it applies to Governor Walker's while there's a lot of criticism all their Governor Walker and the trucking especially in that is that is completely appropriate right and the longer somebody's in office as with our current governor more Christmas means going to get from journalists and as it should be so\nSo criticism yes but when you have somebody like the New York times during the election that comes just outright and says that they see it as\nUm if out their mission um you know I guess part of their of of of of the way they're going to proceed or to actually work against Donald Trump is actually what they did\nThat that's that's that's not right or if it's not on your editorial page I shouldn't be happening in the news pages so uh I mean I think there's a lot of admission that you have again some advocacy journalism going on\nIt does it certainly seems like that a couple of minutes left with Mike Nichols from the badger Institute there's a great piece by ritual now you W women's studies programs and or maybe they lack of ideological diversity or you know you say hundred courses now\nOffered right and a\nHalf their tour after tour to that page and read read some of these courses actually Steve I'm so you know simply undergraduate runner undergraduate courses at you W and the gender and women's studies program\nYou know race gender colonization capitalism sex and power and Greece gender migration um the female body in the world uh\nYou know and then there's a we have a bunch of stuff in here about who to who the professors are and what they write but you know the big question there you know Madison now there's one of the biggest women and gender studies programs in the\nCountry it's second only to another Big Ten school Michigan and or is this really is this really an academic discipline or is it activism and if it is a discipline should there be as much activism as there is there there's a perspective there and I'm sure we really be be funding activism or at ... at it with our tax dollars\nKnow typically the way our country works as things go in cycles are waves but in in the liberalization of of our educational institutions there is no there's no way there's no cycle it's just it's it continually ramps up when you see some of the course work when you see some of the things that people are getting\nThere's no there's no way there's no cycle is just it's it continually ramps up when you see some of the course work when you see some of the things that people are getting degrees and it's hard to be optimistic about the future of those institutions when you see that kind of course we think of course being generated there\nIt's tough work trying to reach out to you know a lot of kids there are there are there are kids who are fair minded\nNow want to learn are open minded at U. W. Madison as hard as it is to believe there's conservatives like there are all across the country and we've written we've written about it actually but uh yeah it takes some courage to be a conservative a and a smiles your views let it let alone turnout paper that you know you're progressive professor isn't gonna like Steve ...\nDirectly right Mike Nichols president the badger Institute I I we met last weekend or or how can they find out more about your your publication beginnings and all the great stories that you do\nAre you sure so I can go to our website I hit some uh WWW dot badger Institute dot org and you'll find it all their um sent me an email like badger Institute that Oregon will send you a copy 'em they put you on her email lists\nGood stuff good things for coming in ... seems to be with you on WGM Jay more next moment of hers Ross it looked like come spring training\nIs there a wish list for GM David Stern is enough grades great magic discuss it signed up for central beginning at six or seven Greg uh [noise]\nYou break it down for you Greg is all about sports and he knows are probably more than most people about the current state of affairs and the\nFuture state of affairs for those Milwaukee Brewers and the bus and the Packers a show no if you want to weigh in on our Twitter poll you can find it a WTO O. J. Steve questions today based on the Netflix series you think is even areas guilty or innocent I think about thirty folks body weight and yesterday's question\nWas should the president cut off aid to countries associated with the migrant caravan a fifty six percent said yes forty four percent no thanks to all those folks who voted yesterday still find it a WTO O. J. C. at sweater Eric bill said did you\nBuy a ticket for mega millions last night I did donate to the call I did two bucks I think it was my my second my I have one number Seventy\nI mean I haven't checked out because I I heard that I didn't win the one point six billion say look you could still be a million dollars or whatever but I doubt it I think we would have heard of who wants to ... million well of course so [laughter] so Simpson ville South Carolina\nThat is the place to be right now that is where the winning lottery ticket was sold Simpson ville South Carolina population twenty two thousand\nOr do you think he's guilty or innocent I make it as simple as that guilty or innocent\nOr Stephen every a pall on Facebook guilty and makes me wish Wisconsin that the death penalty Susan on Facebook guilty as well let's go to Scott in ...\nIt's MORNING do you think back in the car I Believe both me and if we are both guilty\nOr her body was her bones were found in three different burn up to them behind his trailer\nWhich means they [laughter] I Know I Know that oh of course come but they took time to their number of the core and ... this poor child mhm and and burn her in three different on your property or all of the best position of planting evident that all minutia\nOr you you really gotta drawing down to where she was found in what condition which was found in\nYeah I agree with you and thanks for the call Scott I I think the the circumstances of that discovery\nThe storyline that suggests she got her to a out there to photograph one of his vehicle\nAnd the and the discovery of her body and yeah there's always things that you can make the case for as part of a you know no one's ever a hundred percent guilty writes you you make the best case and the judge or jury decides to me that's been done you know what the\nI think we're making a murder tries to do is just to supplant evidence with theory conjecture um\nThey're trying to point I was reading it right or pointing to the whole box ex boyfriend Ryan he'll I guess\nI'm framing it that way that he had something to do with questionable action suspicious actions and are also people point to bring the deaths these brother Bobby is likely killer I think one of the things that you notice is is when when filmmakers make these kinds of show\nDown by the gender one\nOf my taxes from nine to a point that out out from a wop huh is any number looked in the background that people are producing the series\nI Believe they have an agenda I Believe ALS writes they're trying to prove a point I understand\nThe role of groups like the Innocence Project and trying to make sure that the\nEvidence and the the the facts of the case or iron\nClad that's really not how the justice system works you make the best case the best argument and then the judge and jury decides there's no absolutes you could have done things better in prosecuting the case absolutely\nShould they not have done some of the things that don't probably there is no perfect case but I think the avalanche of evidence suggests it was Steven Avery and brand and death involved in this case and I'm Sorry I don't feel sorry for them\nIt's a it's a big leap from Netflix\nSeries to saying Steven every urban and deaths you're innocent um more more comments coming in on the Facebook\nMaking and murder of post ah Cody guilty um he said that's what documentaries do there's a documentary and the prosecution side I Believe he was guilty of it goes back and forth so I mean there's you can present\nA viewpoint on a on a Netflix series or any production really tried to make\nAn advocate for a certain point of view that's what they do that's what the filmmakers have done you but to suggest that Steven Avery was railroaded or evidence was planted I I'm just not going to buy a\nShoddy work at some degree some level of the investigation perhaps to make some arguments there but again none of these things are absolutes\nThere was a it was a case cried out for justice and I believe she's a ... and her family got that justice with the\nWith the convictions Steven Avery and brand of deaths you know take more of your calls in tax next and also weigh in on Facebook at six twenty WGM Jay on Facebook and hands as I said the I can I'm always\nTalking touch line for one for seven nine nine one six twenty more of your calls in tax next on this Wednesday right here on WGM Jay\nHere from Central America is making its way to the U.S border and President Trump has committed a staffing itself wider thinks he's on the right track here just explanation on this today as well ...\nWhat's the what's that yesterday on the show I don't think he has a choice\nYou can't have chaos at your border especially a border that sees about Ninety percent of the drug traffic and human trafficking problems come to Wisconsin across that border like that can't continue and they can certainly be made wars are now we're talking about the Netflix making a murderer season to\nDoes it change your mind on Stephen ...\nMy show poll a new feature on the program on Twitter find me a WGM Jay Steve asking the question guilty or innocent right now thirty three votes fifty eight percent guilty\nForty two percent innocent stays open for about twenty four hours you can vote throughout the rest of the day um some some comments on the economic and stuck in text line\nAs a former law enforcement officer I did and will not watch either of these programs the cases have been adjudicated hard to argue with that a mission sturgeon bay you might find this interesting people I Know in Florida who based or opinions solely on the show are mixed in their opinions\nI Know no one in Wisconsin was undecided guilty um let's see from the two six to\nWatching the series makes me still feel that he is guilty but our court system is embarrassing the way they handle that case that it's been a big criticism right the the somewhat shouting nature\nI'm I'm how their case was prosecuted in handled and again there is no there is no absolute zero perfect year things could have been done better that's the case in nearly every trial every case\nThe people that are that are working on these cases aren't perfect as either a perfect either but uh I think when you think about the every case\n... if I look at it from the perspective of all signs point to somebody who was guilty of a crime I see ... face there\nAnd I don't shed any tears for him being locked up for the rest of his life or from the two six to ... I was thirty six million reasons to keep every locked up after watching season ones like I Can't stomach what they did the death see\nAfter season to all things point to Bobby D assay Webb mode of an opportunity but the entire ... bothers me or people who commit these types of crimes often repeat the fact that we don't have another ... tells me they got the right guy in the job with the thirty six million bothers me a from the two six two\nIt's the fact that we don't have another holiday tells me they got the right guy in the job with the thirty six million bothers me\nA for the two six to watching the series makes me still feeling guilty but the court system is embarrassing me and one more from the nine to old guilty but a good example of the N doesn't always justify the means so interesting conversation on Facebook\nOn our airwaves and online about the the Stephen ... every case and uh as I said but again a he's going to be guilty for as long as I'm Alive I see nothing and I've sampled season one and I will probably sample season too as well just to have a better idea where that series is going but hum\nLoudly and clearly he's guilty of my mind All right after the news we're gonna continue update on the latest on the explosive devices found\nEither on their way and routes or after the homes of George Soros and the Clintons in chapel in New York the Obamas and uh the work that's being done CNN was threatened a that's suspicious device was sent there as well causing a a\nAlmost a widespread panic as they were getting alarms as they were broadcasting gyms judo some of the other holes have to actually the building and we're broadcasting from the streets outside CNN so there's a lot of uh\nInformation out there they're going to bring in the latest on that in a few minutes on the on the news coming up but in the next half hour when talking about something more technology related\nAnd it has to do with a decision\nAbout a country in this\nCase countries Sweden but we've we've touched on that story here with us counseling with the company three square market and they have but I think about sixty five employees now that have microchips embedded in their hands between their summer therefore finger one Sweden and this idea\nHas caught on in a big way in some of the ways they're using this technology I think they're going to be\nA things there are some folks not all but some of the United states are going to want to think about and constant place to make life easier I'll tell you what those things are the details how that works or after the news I'll probably touch on another story as well\nWe talked a lot about single payer health care on the show the other day\nWell I looked at the Democrats that are running in the house races\nAcross the country would be surprised to know that in half of those races\nThose Democrats are advocating for free health care for all that's an interesting dynamic as we look at the midterm elections November six really voting starting already\nVoters trying to decide who to vote for a while if you knew of half the Democrats were ... were sponsoring are supporting free health care for all does that change your mindset to the independent voter lore is it really matter in this election does that make you give you pause\nSo I'll give us some details about that as well but we'll start as I said with the microchip story thousands of Swedes getting microchips inserted into\nTheir hands who never thought Wisconsin would lead the way on that story but that's next you know votes are starting to make themselves known by starting to seize was three wins and zero losses are back at it from five serve foreign for a nationally televised match up with the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers had Davis is on the

the way or the other devices were sent to former President Bill Clinton the former president rock Obama into Washington shields the congresswoman out of Florida\nSo significant serious threats

Wisconsin\nAnd I think in the ... and there's a little area north and west of that as well of course the breaking news uh an explosive device found near the home of bill and Hillary Clinton or chapter ... home\nA song about one am by Secret Service and the FBI um they lived there since they are the president has left office in two thousand and one I wasn't clear if they were a whole mess of time\nThis is only one day after device was found in the mailbox and democratic billionaire George Soros\nAnd his New York home and I asked gene about this to raise the question as we as we fire up the emotions and the hostility and civility related to politics in the lead up to the mid term elections on November six\nIs this part of the story\nWe all know there's people out there that aren't stable and they can't make rational decisions\nIn as a byproduct of all that hostility and incivility pushing some people to pick these kinds of actions in this case building devices explosive devices neither sending them or dropping them off\nAnd homes of people they they would like to see gone and I I may ask this later in the show\nIs this the the new age of violence when it comes to politics we saw it in the Nineteen sixties certainly the fascination John Kennedy his brother Robert Kennedy Martin Luther king\nAnd you wonder if it's if that tension is being echoed today because of this inability to process the differences between people the understanding that we made different politics but doesn't mean we should have each other\nSo we'll follow that story a story line throughout the day of device founded the home with the Clintons in chapter ... about thirty miles north of New York city and uh as as details emerged we will cover that story for you right here as of your team J\nUh

well I think it was well I mean for those those paying attention to this race or frustrating thing is that it might have owners that addressed a lot of issues he didn't address the last ... welfare reform is an important issue\nAnd so really we got a lot done this week when I was a very very productive week um and most importantly we need to go out there and play Airbus football games of course
