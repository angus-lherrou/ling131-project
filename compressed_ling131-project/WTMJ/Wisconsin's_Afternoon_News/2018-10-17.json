I think in concert to kind of bridge does it make those connections bridge those\n... absolutely Steve I mean it makes you remember that we're all we're all in this role in this together we all we all are fundamental beliefs and um I think this this project in class can relieve simplifies that\nWe need to reiterate the project is more than just honoring the victims it's also honoring the first responders those who survived and those who did and it's honoring the U.S military those from Wisconsin who\nEnlisted after nine eleven and are no longer with us they were impacted by nine eleven they went overseas to fight for their country and now they they gave the ultimate sacrifice and then the the educational aspect of it and I can't stress that enough I mean we talked about it earlier Mike about how these feelings come back to you\nWill some folks never realize what those feelings where we have young Americans who don't\nUnderstand don't comprehend and they need to learn some of this and need to learn about the war on terror they need to learn who played a role they need to learn that there are ground zero workers dying today because of the health implications that got from working on the site for so many months\nAnd all of that can happen with this memorial because it's more than just putting one name up there or just the the all of the names from nine eleven on that day it there's so many other quote unquote tentacles to this memorial\nMemorials or just stuff that you know their ways of of ah remembering and um I think um so that's that's why I'm so excited about the project and I I Hope that to other people will be exciting to contribute to it Eric how do you find out how do you find the book\nOn Amazon or just plug in uh my name or or or just a few states away do you miss your news reporting day I Do I Do I miss I still do a little bit of writing but I Wish I could do more I'm trying to get back to a little bit of it but I I uh I loved working for the

in the midst of all the things we talk about every day more next right here in New Hampshire\nDegrees for the reserve Radio City over the place\nWhere you are and you're listening to the program thanks as always for listening [noise] I said I haven't gotten away from talking about Hillary Clinton because frankly it is or is not not much purpose but um\nI Can't let this moment pass so we're talking about the me too\nMovement um all the things that I you know the necessary or changes in the relationship between men and women in this country and the fact of the the the the bad guys have been called out publicly many cases losing their jobs at a high level winds dean\nCharlie Rose Bill O'Reilly Matt Lauer I mean there's the list is long [noise] but then you talk about bill and Hillary Clinton so Hillary was interviewed\nBy a by CBS a reporter the other day it aired on Sunday and at one point they um they go to the the the bill question right in the midst of all this ... stuff\nAnd they asked her should her husband former President Bill Clinton have resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and ah she\nDidn't hesitate absolutely nuts and I'm sitting there watching this same game you didn't leave it at that you actually went after these women\nWho I think most historians\nReasonable rational Citizens United states I think we're probably telling the truth so he didn't just leave it at while he should resign you went after these women at the time\nSo how is it\nThat a woman who's who's was seen as this icon of women's rights and uh you know shattering the glass ceiling to the point where she actually have this elaborate set design waiting on election night that they frankly never got to use which play on the uh the the theme of shattering glass ceiling\nGets away with these kind of response and it's hard not to think that the reason she gets away with it is because she's a Democrat\nThe behavior of the president's\nWas so far beyond a consensual access of what's his what's you also said\nIt was about power\nAbout taking advantage of a young woman in that power such situation that power dynamic the very essence of really what the me too movement as a boats so for almost Hillary Clinton lovers and defenders which who I Know are out there how do you reconcile that how do you\nMake the case that what she did at that time didn't damage women's ability to come forward didn't hurt the cause when it comes to women's rights\nNow it is different when you're in a marriage relationship you do ten people do tend to defend their spouse not always but some unusual but after the fact all these years later\nCalling this a consensual\nRelationship\nAnd that doesn't mean that he forced her to do\nIf he ended up on the ... next year yes by\nToo much money then I got him he's afraid that they don't have three hundred million dollars for him\nHe won't be for next year if he was going to be a bird would have been a rental for the end of this year yeah what do you expect from a a game five tonight on the ...\nI Hope they can find some off and so I Hope they can\nDo a Jew plate in her shout what they did in game one I don't like making productions I'm I'm not a production production guy because\nAnything can happen I mean this is October baseball and and literally\nThey say just get to October because anything can happen in so far we've seen anything of scooter talk Christian yellowish would be hitting let's see what is he right now ... in the series uh who would have thoughts of Lawrence okay we'll be right at them and does align and who's to say goodbye or be hitting to fourteen nobody would have thought that but it's October in October baseball's is its own animal\nDon Ross always great to talk to your brewers Dodgers later on today WGM chicken here at all here leading up to its and boy and that probably works late doesn't\nFees the hardest were well he ... and Greg massive to break out in in Los Angeles good grief I he's working twenty hour days out their assertive and a half of those guys\nAbsolute rage out for us you can hear it all as I said right here in Dubuque chance after the break Canada makes it official and I'm asked the question is half the population high today that story next to for a town right here to resume Jay\nWalking to his team made it for the world series can this be Maria was we'd go even farther jak writer think the answer is yes [noise] gives us the explanation at twelve cents a day they can go farther [noise] gotta get a gun and it was the officers to dodger's tied at two games apiece will be a pivotal game five\nComing out a little bit later right here on WGM J uh\nThis started talking about this last week and I I use the example that um you know as the United states wrestles and rain goes with the idea of legalization of marijuana we have a great test case happening\nAs we speak in the country of Canada not United States has what three and fifty million people Canada has thirty seven million people so you know there's a little bit of an imbalance there and population but as of midnight last night at twelve o one\nOne hundred and eleven illegal pot shops open across the nation of Canada no stores and Ontario they're still trying to figure out the the rules and regulations will have some open in spring and are just so everybody knows what we're talking about medical marijuana has been legal since two thousand one and you know so this was a recreational marijuana\nWe've seen the United states states have gone to this recreational marijuana lots of states have medicinal marijuana I'm a big fan of that I think it's important that we do that\nBut a recreational marijuana is a completely different thing\nYou can even order it never sitting right to your door\nYeah they also um anybody that was in in a custody that had ah what was it thirty grams there not be being released for possession\nFrom a great story from Vicki Barker this is thirty seconds that you will not forget check\nThis out as the clock struck midnight that became the world's largest legal marijuana marketplace this is like the end of prohibition for alcohol in pretty much\nI feel magnificent marvelous [noise]\nA little bit bland man I was an\nBlonde means high on marijuana I did not know what he was saying I have to look it up Canada also plans to park and all those can get to thirty grounds of marijuana then now legal threshold sticky Parker CBS means no matter [laughter] that'd be A L v M yeah or she looked it up for its\nInteresting or or something every day or Canada they've been working on this thing for two years there\nAre led by prime minister Justin Trudeau plans for legalization or they wanted to get out of the black market into more regulated system what's the big reason money dollars taxes um billions of dollars in investments\nAnd it comes back with a chance for the country of Canada to make money as I said before nine us states have\nLegal recreational marijuana thirty\nHave medicinal marijuana so that that Titus has been turning in this country a towards legalization of marijuana but we're going to find out again smaller sample size but still thirty seven million people in Canada most who live with him I think Ninety percent live within a hundred miles of the border\nSo there is some similarities in the conduct in the culture there\nHow that works for them and that could\nIf it studied correctly improperly with ... with good research good numbers tell us how these\nUh legalization of France the United states could or could play out what they might mean for the rest of us as I've said over and over again big fan of it so marijuana not so much recreational\nAnd we'll see in Canada\nIf indeed half the population is walking around high all the time what that means for production productivity [laughter]\nRecreation glamour\nOf the state of black um so the we learned about today and surprising young reporter so Canada legal recreational marijuana marijuana effective today the future is rights or maybe ... depending on your point of view in Canada so that's number three our four time coming up after the break\nUS deficit rising in the United states the highest level since twenty twelve so what does this mean in words all my conservative friends on this issue right\nFiscal conservatism fiscal responsibility\nTax reform packages that contributing to this issue\nI might go a different way we spend too much money in this country way too much money and we're really lousy with a great a test case for the health care discussion at the at the current system and and programs we were you a lousy job of managing those lousy horrible\nAnd we're going to throw another one in the mix that's why we have\nA deficit this rising not tax reform\nToo much spending country in Africa and unfortunate cry of our Thirteen any game for Los Los Angeles to Brooklyn Dodgers are back at it for game five less than twenty four hours later the series is also going to games of fees 'cause hall of fame Bobby ... is on the call once again and our coverage starts right here that'd be teams at two o'clock\nThis afternoon red mat sick Bob ... got to get it done game five pivotal game it's my new favorite word pivotal got to get it done to to\nBob ... got to get it done game five pivotal game it's my new favorite word pivotal got to get it done to to the team that wins today has the uh the leg up the advantage going into the last two games if needed at Miller Park in Milwaukee coming up this weekend so big stuff\nFrom our Milwaukee Brewers and we have we love the show before our time with all of our brewers coverage or wanted to wrap up to the fourth time with this story because you're gonna you're gonna hear this reporter and a lot of different ways\nSo US deficit up Seventeen percent highest level of an increased since twenty twelve deficit rose to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars in physical you're twenty eight see I'm Seventy percent from last year according to figures released by the Treasury Department\nSo one of the big things talking points most by people running for office elected officials even the media is that just because of the Republican's tax cuts\nAnd it is true that Seventy six billion dollars less were collected but that drop was offsets by increased revenues from individual and self employment taxes\nSo\nThis notion that the tax reform package causes deficit is specious and not true the issue spending rose three percent over the previous year\nOne of the biggest things I'm a I'm a big supporter of the defense budget but they have huge increases and these are all agreed upon in September of twenty Seventeen is a deal between Republicans and Democrats too you know you remember that story to head off a government shutdown\nSocial Security interest on the federal death that's also a contribute to this increase so don't let anybody tell you that's a tax reform package of tax reform package is what's driving this economy\nFor the first time in a long time businesses are shaking off the shackles of government over regulation over taxation over burdensome a review\nAnd I said you know we're going to add employees were going to add to our facilities build new buildings pay our people more and we've seen these stories play out since December of twenty Seventeen and a lot of different levels\nNobody nobody wants to see that's\nEspecially from the federal government because as I said this number gets bigger and bigger and bigger but the answer or the blame has nothing to do with the tax cuts and has to do with the fact that we spend too much\nI've stopped for a long time\nEvery dollar spent by the federal government should be examines case by case program my program dollar by dollar\nIn a a real Congress one that actually the voters would have trust them with say All right we've paid for this for a long time is it working has it affected his actually accomplish anything if not\nIt stops\nBut what I what do I always say about this the government is very good instituting programs new programs they're not very good at managing the ones they have and this has been a constant problem since many of the big government programs were initiated in the twentieth century\nDoesn't mean the government's not important or vital in in our economy works they have a role to play\n\nIn a job to do when it comes to driving success both in the governments and for business and for the taxpayers but don't\nTake the empty had an argument that the Republican backed tax cut that led to this deficit we're spending too much money and to call on my Republican conservative friends you're contributing to this problem\nThe one thing candidate should avoid now is looking insincere\nCandidates have to be careful not to work too much like they're just sort of um blatantly you know jumping on the fan bus to appeal to their constituents there's certainly a potential negative if if you look you know if you appear to be sort of fake and you know Johnny come lightly\nBy most voters probably don't care all that much at their candidate there was a ... fan or not there's one group in particular that could still be swayed\nThis was the year of the swing voter and the swing voters are employed at most are the people that they're got impressions of do I like the sky or not are going to be very important and and being in brewers gear and appearing to be one of the you know the people when certainly play well with those swing voters so I think it's important\n... mayor WGN genes there you go interesting piece and I'm ... we've seen that the candidates I think most of the major candidates have kind of done the brewers gear at some point or they are they're treated out something the governor has the emoji where he's wearing a brewers journeyman um cartoon character of the governor and\nOf course that's attacked by the by just by Democrats whenever he does it\nWas interesting point but made by a device in there we talked about this yesterday you can get away with it if you've done it for years yeah someone might be governor who's been seen him in the park before has been wearing the Jersey before he can get away with continued to root for the team but if your candidate who's never done that before\nAnd that's when it's a it's a delicate balance because you don't want to come off like that person he's faking it even if you're not really\nYeah fake is the is the word there the key word um\nI was just real\nQuickly on politics one of the texture as nine to oh I'm a male made a surgeon banned it bothers me I have to deliver those those ads total garbage I agree with him they are garbage\nI'm coming up in the eleven o'clock hour or some interesting topics were to start with this one I've I've kinda shuffled my line of a little bit but there's a lot of a big school referendum all across the states um and I want to kind of detail some of the numbers are startling how big a number of this is in total\nAnd I guess my question is this the new normal in our school district they're all in some of these projects some of these referendum are four in the case of Tulsa for new grade school elementary schools they're just saying basically\nWe went all new stuff we've got a great city Tulsa is a great city we want all new stuff you're going to pay for it here's a referendum pass it and it's not just hosted so creek Oregon, Wisconsin is I've got some examples of that I Want to spend a little time on that subject is this the new normal\nIs it going to be all about school districts I've said critically about school districts and school boards you want to see run away salaries look to your school district look to your school district most local\nGovernments have had to tighten the belt not the case with school districts they've exploded their salaries I use the example of all time\nLeader in a city or make a hundred and twenty thousand a hundred thousand there'll be ten people on the school district payrolls to make that amount of money from the top down superintendent on down\nThat's where the uh the waste is so we spent some time on that day when I talk to our and also are you being silenced because of politics politics make you hold back and kind of dinner conversation parties or elsewhere that's all coming up next our seems to be with you on this Wednesday right here on WGM Jay morning Wisconsin eleven\nYou know I was thinking about this I I saw a coffee and\nWhat's your name Megan Kelly has brought her mom oh okay so I'm thinking my parents which is a show there was a lousy you've ever been down to the new changes as far as I Know they would love to do that so I'm not doing a different\nDay yeah you can celebrate any non take your parents work\nDay day yeah I think that if you get a kick out of it and I think I told you the sort of saw before back in my dad's day when he was a meteorologist from National Weather service WGN Jay news department would play his National Weather service recording of the weather man he was on our airwaves in the sixties December\nHas we bring it back oh if you could find that these weren't there maybe we have them do alive ones\nWere and he always tells me my my dad was an awesome guy tells me that she did it before the computer so they were really had a real for jazz scene back then but I say well they should just call Minneapolis to say hey what's the weather is just coming our way that's good enough but no yeah they'll those guys work time I'd as now I think he's he's been retired Marine that he's been there and he works for the national weather service got to be close\nSo shuttled to my parents and take your parents to work day that I didn't bring them in but maybe in some future date I'll have to bring on them\nAll right so why not just talking about this

I've told you on the air there are people that I have\nLess friendly relationship now because of one what I Do and to what I say and I think I tried to be is fair and balanced as I can and coming from a conservative viewpoint of course and I offered times who Democrats if you don't take it up not really my fault but we do that with Tammy Baldwin\nThan others so yeah for still stands at the she or any of the other democratic has to come on happened to have you I Love a civil honest conversation\nCivil and honest about the issues that you talk about and the the substance of your campaign [noise] so in the world of politics\nWe see that side of it we see the candidates and parties the\nPoliticians elected officials at whatever level you're talking about dominating the narrative telling us\nUnfiltered doesn't misuse of Donald Trump or filtered the words of policies of Donald Trump supposed to do the eyes of the CNN or MSNBC or a Fox and that's the reality the world we live in but there's a great piece in the ... in the Washington Post\nAnd it's a it's titled and only get your thoughts on this we're staying silent out of fear\n\n... I'm not going to the whole thing but part of it only among trusted family and friends as a possible speaks speak one's mind if even that was not guaranteed he's talking about life in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union all aspects of totalitarian life citizens the former eastern bloc say this is the hardest to explain that those are those who grew up in the Democratic west instill now perhaps\nA new study of political attitudes in the United states offers studying evidence that most Americans censored themselves\nExcept among people they regard as like minded\nOn a bundle of sensitive topics immigration and immigrants race and racism gay lesbian and gender issues and Islam and Muslims\nReports called more in common and it uh is set up to understand potentially Shia political polarization the United states and Europe is based on a nationwide survey of nearly eight thousand people um and the numbers were gathered in December and January and the last year beginning of this year\nAnd then found that between fifty one percent and sixty six percent two thirds\nAgree there's pressure to a certain way about each of the or for measuring topics with immigration seen as the least sensitive\nAnd Islam is the most sixty eight percent reporter that's acceptable for me to express what I think about race or Islam only among people who are like me on immigration Seventy three percent felt that way\nOn gay lesbian and transgendered issues the figures Seventy percent again reading back from the story political freedom has never been an absolute in the United states to be sure for much of them most of our history ostracism or worse away to advocate for racial equality especially in the south\nWhich anyone understands you press the missile being forced to build on a false front everyday it'd be the American game and lesbians who grew up in the area closets\nConversely a certain measure of self censorship is necessary democracy Jewish people refrain from a gratuitously broadcasting bigotry it promotes trust in rational discourse [noise]\nSo what do they fear not necessarily government repression but ridicule and harassment from their fellow citizens which is often magnify this is the key point you're my words\nNot necessarily government repression ridiculing harassment on their fellow citizens which is often magnify this is a key point you're my words by social media\nSometimes even the trouble at school or work large majorities of public eighty percent or more see both hate speech and political correctness has problems plaguing American politics\n\nIn the United States Senate right and left wing tribes progressive activists conservatives in force core beliefs within our own ranks a quarter to a sort of Americans feel pressure to sink a certain way about controversial issues even among people like themselves\nWhat do you think think about your own circumstances\nWe've all probably been at a party or neighborhood gathering or even a work events although worked as a little little more social because as soon as you can talk about at work but\nDoes it gives you pause when a subject\nComes up politics or gender issues or even the me too movement\nSo that it's safer than I think this is what the study is showing some nuts put yourself out there I'll give you a specific example\nAs a conservative radio host I often share stories that I read things I'm building a future segment a show on on social media specifically Twitter\nYou can find me a W team just even if you're interested\nAnd they don't hear from liberals friends of mine saying how dare you share that story and I I've often thought about doing what some people do on social media putting a retreat does not necessarily constitute endorsement but really do I have to\nIt's an interesting time because we're all opinionated we all have like ideas about things and some of the issues I talked about that piece in the Washington Post\nImmigration immigrants racism\nI'm going to close the show a little bit on the on the shore with high school decision to not staged a plane that's really what that is they can filter it the way they want but that's what it is but do you censor yourself or one four seven nine nine wants to swing the mortgage talk untouched by\nWhat do you think are you are you living in your conversation based on what you think the

politics at a brewers game and I was nervous an argument would ensue with someone around us that's I've heard that before from people\nKevin mosquito haven't keeping quiet about politics not out of fear but for the fact that it seems everyone is completely dug in on the issues I just saw civil discussion with friends and family but as far as changing someone's opinion it just isn't going to happen\nBill from a kind of walks we can call her to the program as well I for one will not be silence amount of freight is my point is on my mind to anyone\nAnd uh and the one side of dumb down as they don't want to get into a fight because I've heard these same people fight with others it's a no win situation was should should have\nOr could have been a healthy discussion you just can't have a
