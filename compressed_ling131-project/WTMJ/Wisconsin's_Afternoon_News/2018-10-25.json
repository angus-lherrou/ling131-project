after yeah that was quite a speech yesterday the president speaking for over an hour and ... he usually can\nHold the crowd for an hour long yeah ah and you know sometimes you look it looks like he's on the script and other times you know he goes off script\nAnd yesterday seemed kind of half and half that's a really good point because he was scripted you could tell but boy he likes to just\nTalk about why and I've been at some of those rallies and yeah he can um\nBut yeah that's I've watched and listen to some of them are just the last couple of weeks I mean he has been traveling all over the country not surprised that he came to Wisconsin and not surprised that he went to that part of Wisconsin that is\nYou know where he is the strongest uh and if he's going to try to rally the base or bring other folks in\nThe question is how much does he how he is a motivator and I think he helps motivate potentially both sides\nYou know that is a good point because a lot of Republicans traditionally George Bush would come off into walk a shower walk a shock county the president this president won by twenty points in the northwest part of the state and Sean Duffy district and that's where he showed up to try to rally the\nBase site so strong there but here's the thing people like well what do these last minute endorsements what are these last minute efforts were and see the President Obama here tomorrow or a vice president Biden coming in you see a lot of people coming in but\nHere's which has always surprise me about the twenty sixteen election yes the narrative the story was President Trump turns Wisconsin read for the first time since Ronald Reagan\nBut forgot and sometimes in the numbers is the guy who got the most votes\nThat day state wide is not the guy who was at the top of the ticket Donald Trump it was Ron Johnson and I'm not just talking a few thousand Ron Johnson pulled in almost Seventy five thousand more votes\nThan President Trump so why are you bringing that up my point is I think people go in\nAnd they vote who they want for not just the straight ticket for one candidate or one part similar independent that there's there's this they liked to say I'm for this person and I'm going to put down for that I'm not necessarily pulling\nThe ... that's the old term pulling the lever litter so ... and even if you look at Hillary Clinton now she gets a hundred and thirty eight fat one million three hundred and a two thousand three hundred and two thousand and about twenty two hundred more than ... so\nNot a big gap there but that's what I'm saying I think voters go in and\nThey do what they want to do and it's not like well someone says I should vote for this or you know I liked that particular person I think they vote for who they want to go\nI think you raised an interesting point in this election because there's the real likelihood I shouldn't say likelihood there's the possibility that Scott Walker wins right now that races within the margin of error and then the Democrats for US Senate Tammy Baldwin wins that what could happen\nI'm Glad you brought that up because that's your other point I'm making some people think wow you know if if Tammy Baldwin who looks\nOh you know if if Tammy Baldwin who looks a pretty strong in the polls up ten percent we have so many people are coming in to vote for her and I you know doesn't that hurt the other Republicans on the ballot and my point is I don't think it does all the time\nOr the other thing is when you look at um we're we are with who's coming in town the president in here you know his approval rating in the last Marquette law school poll was at forty six percent\nFifty one percent disapproval now midterms are not good times for ...\nFour years ago President Obama was at forty one percent approval fifty three percent oh interesting\nOkay that was his second midterm market doesn't have numbers for his first midterm because they weren't pulling at\nThat time there were you saying that people are voting for who they want to vote for does that mean they're doing more research they're more educated on their votes it's well I\nI think it's that that they they they hear what other people are saying but they go in and say this is who I Want\nAnd they look at a candidate and like to say these are the candidates I stand with and even though you know Trump
