Packers I guess I don't want to well at least initially on in Crosby we know you had a terrible day what one of the things that jumped out at me\nWas how parents that isn't Aaron Rodgers and these young receivers and Jimmy Graham and others are not on the same page inherent actually kind of owned that a little bit today just not in sync at all it looks like\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think that that was pretty evident you suffer so many years how much he was with for example or denouncing the heritage already has really played a whole lot in the last couple of years or ... injury last year ... year prior to that\nShe's me and I'm you know Aaron hasn't practiced a lot with anybody in the last couple of years because of this last job is sort of our own this year it's been the me he's gotten back on the practice field\nBut there just hasn't been that much time to gel in young players I forget ... only took six naps in the pre season and while he was able to practice certainly during training camp they just haven't had that that that chance to get any kind of rhythm down whether I mean I thought markets ... head of the game\nYesterday for someone who has been practiced a whole lot with Aaron Rodgers we're still waiting to see a game on more has anything if you can hang on to all in any kind of consistent fashion like many states around um he had a couple of catchy yesterday but really nothing that you would call significant so those three wide receivers they drafted them\nA for a reason to trust them to be the future but so far especially with the injuries that

when when the Packers get down\nTo an early death and so what do you blame that on I mean uh the Packers or down twenty four and half time yesterday they were down ... nothing at the end of the first quarter or they haven't been able to start strong with the exception of the game the previous week against buffalo where they didn't score the earth's position but they were able to score the second
