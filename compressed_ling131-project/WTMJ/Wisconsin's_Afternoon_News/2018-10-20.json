the rivals\nIn a powerhouse division in eighty two\nWhen you had the Yankees you had a bought and\nDetroit and Baltimore\nSo a lot of how old am elites yet you know you're a you're exactly right so I got to ask you were there in eighty two were you one of the guys or maybe the kids then that storm the field [laughter] [laughter] no I was in the upper deck so okay\nWell we'll be happening tonight\nRight an editor for the call al ... the teams are good they are usually at the top two or three teams in baseball are and that division\nIn on unfortunately out and make it to the

deals three o'clock news cast German shepherds and that's allowed us he's ever heard Miller Park and remember he's been a brewer a few times now so he's heard some loud Miller parks including over

Believe it was yes\nYeah that was that weird um you know ... strike shortened season it it's it's interesting I think a lot of people don't even remember that in quite candidly because eighty two overshadowed eighty one going all the way the world series all the way to a game seven but\nThere is a pet is standing sitting out there and Miller Park a hung over the Fridays restaurant representing eighty one those brewer is the Yankees rivalries of those early eighties and and and the earlier caller referenced some of those powerful teams in the top of the a at least man those were fun to watch

thanks for the call Ross I Know you'll be watching maybe it will be here tonight to appreciate your call for one for seven nine nine one six twenty again to simply asking the question this game\nIn perspective for me answer the question the last time we had a game this big in Milwaukee was blank to line five time in Richfield wants to get in on the conversation Tom what say you\nAlright well I Can't tell you the sport but everybody's used a game five of them are American League championship but I Would say the one that\nThe other one that sticks out was the ice bowl a\nDallas that Green Bay Packers and bart star sneak in for that touched down in the championship that was\nI mean that's your heart was enraged anywhere in showing your nails you weren't alive it was that was unbelievable and oh we have a little bit if you remember that I don't know if you remember that mhm\nI Do I get a little cap yet and I appreciate the call Tom thank you will let you fly I think the only ... years I Try to keep it a little bit ah milk\nI Try to keep it a little bit a Milwaukee centric because look obviously if we open it up to the last time it Wisconsin sports team was in this position I'm your view we we we we could come up with a number of happened up there in Green Bay and level field I\nI got one for you\nOkay it was the game that chance to go to the the playoffs when she sees the math\nAnd we want it in their late innings that was exciting 'cause otherwise we were not the winner yep\nNo you've got to Tom uh yeah that was two thousand and eight yeah that was two thousand eight gosh it's been ten years already but it was the final game of the season I was in there for that when I was down the right field line feces about the against the cubs\nAll right and I don't get enough yeah but I remember before game theory\nThe Baltimore\nIn Baltimore yeah Jim Palmer was going for the Orioles if memory serves me correctly a ... a big ... big day they beat Jim Palmer and\nThe rest as they say thank you Scott Johnson creek led to a well in Milwaukee on line three well good afternoon you're on WGM J what say you\nWithout a doubt it has to be the eighty to a series of angels 'cause that took us to the world series\nAnd that was not and I I mean I was watching it on TV but uh on TV but we are just flipped out and then I\nRemember celebration that everyone\nConvert to Wisconsin and\nDime that will just thousands of people on it it looked like a ticker tape parade mhm and it was just wild I mean\nThat that that data\nOn forever and and the question is tonight and that game was during the day so that was you know a lot of people were able to get down to ... avenue but tonight if they do when something like that happen again or\nYeah it's a good question will I appreciate the call thank you so much I I I had not thought about that but um\nWhat does happen celebration wise tonight\nBecause they need to dodger's and in ... know eight hours from now probably nine hours eight hours and hours from now it's even that seven hours of the world series what what is the celebration look like is it Wisconsin Avenue is that the one place to go to celebrate tonight\nI really don't know I haven't even thought about that\nI don't know I got to give that some thought let's hit a bride and west band on line for Brian wants to chime in on WGM Jay what's your nominee for this one Brian\nBlau perk for\nProbably ... if they win the game I think it's going to be really a great thing and one thing that comes to mind are about ... years old and her a little different perspective\nWhat is it to the Milwaukee a pep rally at the county stadium I'm at that time I work at a full service gas station a quarter of the nation Seventy six and Bradley and the people in\nThat environment they're in there and\nStand up for and they are like crying kind of felt they were such a fun place the everyone wanted to talk about the same thing a lot a lot of snow\nAnd you know what I appreciate I appreciate the call Brian as I hear all of you sharing your stories from Nineteen eighty two here I'm gonna do it gets me he's a little bit more pumped for tonight because\nAs I said I was born in eighty one so I'll tactically eighty two in that World Series of parents happened in my lifetime this is the first time in essence this is happening in my lifetime and\nTo be able to enjoy that and relish the moment I sit at the top of the show I Hope all of you are enjoying this yes the nerves in the tension but I Hope at some point you can do step back\nAnd kind of look at yourself in what's happening go gosh this is fun man this is great these moments don't happen all that often here hopefully a lot more now more frequently under market announced he was leadership position in the last segment what\nDoes this is not a team like the Yankees Red Sox and and even ... even the Dodgers were here last year and the year before that even we have to enjoy these moments enjoy what could potentially happen tonight and really relished what's happened up to this point because it has been a blast\nLet's hit the line five year time since your time is at Miller Park Tom you're you're you're out here where are you in the parking lot Tommy where are you\nWere right now are on the part I was your game on last night game six game on was saying\nEspecially what they did in the ninth inning heart attack\nBut tonight it can be even in the last night it was just wonderful\nI was a kitten eighty two didn't make the games but I remember everyone going down to Wisconsin now this is the biggest night for Bruce baseball since then but\nI don't know it's just exciting ... you can't really I don't have to work to express it is just a blast\nTom you did a pretty good job of expressing it and a drive safely I Hope you get a good parking spot and or walk by the booth waited I mean when when you walk by what's your time is up partying his car it sounds like\nRight outside Miller Park thanks so much my friend has fun tonight for one for seven nine nine one six twenty mortgage talk in Texas when I hear the little one that's out of the box let's go to Sandy in my nominee falls\nI'm trying to look for some sort of comparison as to what we're going to see tonight and Sandy what uh what do you want to offer up for us\nTo remember the ... how are you going to marry a white man however they put me in there and we went you know three thousand and\nThree day waiting [laughter] and then it led to an extent him\nWhat was the day it was September do you remember the date by chance I\nDon't remember the day I don't remember the day\nSo it was Nineteen Ninety two that much I remember um thanks for the call Sandy that's a good one too and and what ... what is interesting and she says\nYou you knew it would happen eventually but you didn't really know which game it was going to be a during which y'all got number three thousand you Sandy said it took her three games for her to finally a\nThe winner if you will of course did it off the Indians Jose Mesa summer is one thousand two thousand and his three thousand hits\nAll off Cleveland Indians pitching we got about a minute or two before the break let's squeeze in one more let's go do Edwin in Oak Creek Edwin you are on WGM Jay what's your nominee\nMy nominee is kind of a lot of the box to you know I'm a huge ... brewer fan and I'm a I Love that the the the city to state and all those kinds of getting behind our brewers but one one memory that sticks on in my mind is a win for the bucks more ... bucks when they were just like one game away from the eastern conference finals was banned\nUm big dog around St Glen Robinson and and I'm a ... Baker that whole crew I remember going to like every one of those almost\nAll of those series games and the brand new Senate wishes explosive and just knowing that we were so close and going to the eastern conference championship won six on in my mind as comparisons to like the statement that built around tonight in seven\nCats a good one that went thanks for the call and yet you talk about places that got loud Brennan Center got loud it's just a shame it was not in a position or the teams necessarily over the life of the Bradley Center the teams were good enough for that place to get as loud as it did and everyone talks about the two thousand one Milwaukee Bucks\nSeven games in eastern conference finals the game seven law says Philly\nBut um yeah that that I think when you talk about a box comparison that might be the closest um or most recent I should say to come close to what we're going to see the night at Miller Park where the parking lots are starting to trickle in now so it looks like the parking lots have been opened\nOftentimes Miller Park crew will do this if there's a a decent line of traffic and that's what they've done here tonight so the parking lots have been open about fourteen minutes earlier than announced and I'd be curious to see how much tailgating happens 'cause it is cold out there is a windy there are flurries in the area\nIt's like opening day three forty six we'll take more of your calls at Fort won four seven nine nine one six twenty when we come back broadcasting live outside Miller Park Scott war if somebody T.

Wisconsin Avenue\nI mean what do you think happened tonight celebration whitewater history now would it be water straight up water street is a good ... is a good call yeah they're not going to do Wisconsin Avenue anymore water street for good cause\nSomeone who lives in the western suburbs let's let's rock downtown walk a shuttle\nLookout Barker road I don't know what to tell what what is downtown ... I don't\nI don't spend a lot of time downtown walk shop but that's the biggest downtown closest to the area that I that I live and so ah I don't I don't know I watched it I don't take brewers fans are going to be a flip and cars and light on\nFire ... and I I have railed against that I don't get\nThat food or just won a championship or we're going to the world series or\nWe do that still burn a squad car what let's let's go let's go like these garbage is let's go like these dumpsters on I've never understood that thankfully fans I've never done that here they're they're not that's not on the docket say that for Detroit or something\nWhat's that called for the insurance agent the next day a brewers won last night yeah so uh I had my car it got lay on fire and flipped over how do I go about filing a claim on is what I've\nNever I've never been able to put two and two together when it comes through we one let's do burn stuff OK\nHas it's set in yet if they win the day they're going to the world\nSeries like three days for now they're going to be starting the world series and they're going to start in the world series at Fenway Park one of the most historic ballparks\nWe've got about a minute yet before the news what we can do this the players or coaches can we can do this Boston Red Sox you know best team in baseball all year a franchise record wins for a really old franchise what'd you see at a Boston in the air outside of the things\nA than just a sporting event and it it's easy to remember those sporting events in the eighty two World Series and the two thousand eleven and I'll see us and and two thousand eight making it to the post season but I feel like it's bigger than that because you can\nUh you can connect generations with moments like this right and and there are going to be memories they're going to be\nThey're going to be funerals they're going to be weddings they're going to be births of children that people are going to come together as families are a member of two thousand Eighteen remember being at the ballpark or being a following the brewers being in the middle of that I mean we're going to have those moments\nWas speaking the moment is there a moment this year with this brewers team maybe not a moment maybe it was a series maybe once a week or ten days stretch\nWhere you and rock and certain things you know what they might have the seats that might have it do you remember any kind of line of demarcation\nIt's a good question I I Would say spring training was a big one for me watching the watching the team come together and kind of getting my eyes on the new version of Lauren's okay and we had seen him in two thousand ten before he was traded\nThat all season so you you get a look at Lorenzo came now is this veteran presents this this guy who's been\nA so decorated in the game with a an AOL cs MVP um you know has won a World Series or the royals then you then you get a look at the outset I've been a huge fan of yellow ... from the time he got called the big leagues and you felt like there is a\nI wouldn't say it MVP I'm not saying I was going that far out but there is a high level all star player here\nAh and then to see that how that fits with Ryan Braun and what I say a lot um\nWhen I saw this group in spring training Ryan Braun was in the lone alpha dog anymore he didn't have to be I think that's a good thing for a guy who's thirty three turning thirty four years old I'm I I think it's important to have multiple people in the room who can carry the load at certain times\nWill say after the yell at each cycle\nThe speech now we didn't know that was going on which one the first one of the worst one yeah we didn't know that happen until after the fact but I I Do think at that moment when this great player made this great individual accomplishment all about the team\nThat's when you start to say man this this could be something special right here\nWhat is the leadership makeup of this team well\nI think it's that I think it comes in a lot of areas I think yours is not a ... a very vocal guy but we'll\nSee what he needs to when he needs to I think Lorenzo Kane is certainly one of those guys who leads by example um is pretty calm and his delivery I'm not in the house all the time I Do a do get\nA little bit of that in the periphery but I think Braun has its place and um I think aircraft has its place\nYou know I I I think it's a team that's pretty well rounded in that regard and I think they're pretty pretty good team to connect some of the bad dots or when they need to make a turn and um you know that five game losing streak before the all star break\nA lot of teams could have folded right there especially what went on during the all star break you know the the hater situation came up you have five all stars there was a time to\nTo glorify this team who who are rolling until they lost five in a row then the all star break happens and then you come back and there was a it just didn't it didn't feel great when they came back from the all star break but they flipped it\nAnd so I think it's really important to ah\nTo understand that it's it's beyond just the the play on the field that goes with the encourage wants to pick me up the accountability\nAnd I think that's when you know I think maybe at that time was for me the demarcation you're talking about that probably happened when they got on a nice little winning streak after the all star break with so much turmoil coming out of the all star break\nJust a couple of minutes longer pleased to be talking with Brian Anderson of course Turner Sports play by play announcer you're on the call ... let me ask you this question for you you saw Boston in Houston you run the call for TBS the ales the ass or their holes\nIn that Red Sox team line somewhere in a lot of credit but I don't want to\nTeam both teams I mean we were there\nTalking before game too about is this Astros team on the historically good\nPlateau and they never want another game Boston was so impressive I think they can be beaten of course I I think the brewers bullpen\nOf the pitching staff the way it's set up the flexibility that correct council has set himself up for uh I Do think they you know great pitching the oil it's the oldest cliche in the book good pitching pitching beach good hitting and I do think the brewers are scary in that regard\nIf Milwaukee hits it all of course they can beat anybody Boston offensively is on a on a level that I don't think any team is in the major leagues not to say you can't beat them\nBut you're gonna have to score fewer runs and you're going to have to trust your pitching staff to hold him down and I would love nothing more than for the brewers have a chance\nTo play Boston and and kind of relive some of those old school baseball memories from the Boston Braves to the Milwaukee Braves then the Boston Red Sox and the American league you know there's a lot of connections between Boston in Milwaukee and now you have the modern ballpark with the roof\nThat closes and opens retractable roof you have old fashioned way so there's a lot to love about that that series it would be great I think if a Milwaukee could could advance going to be a tough game than I Do\nMy ... let's get one last question for you [noise]\nPrediction for me not I mean a final score it I won't go there let's go game seven moment there's always that moment there is a guy off the bench or reliever does it make a prediction what might be the game seven moment that we're talking about in seven hours at a fourth\nOkay here's what I'm going to say if I Hope I'm right All right I'm going to say about this from a strategic standpoint can\nThe second time around the Dodgers batting order will be huge from Milwaukee okay so if you have to go to a guy like hate or early\nNow there are a little bit earlier and their bullpen ditch shot scene can get through that part that's a strategic side of it if she can get through that second time through the line up there in great shape now from a philosophical standpoint\nYou think about some of the great moments in major league baseball postseason history and it is usually the guys you don't think of its travesty she tower it's Cody Ross is named pitch Bernie ... if you want to go back to Moscow to Boston time it it's mark limb\nTo Boston time it it's mark limb key now it's usually it's correct council said bring him sit on credit cards came that guy twice you know scored the winning run not only to correct council scored the winning run in Ninety seven for the Marlins\nHe hit the ... fire that tied the game that got two extra innings so it's usually an ancillary player not the star player it's the ancillary player that comes up big and so if you start looking at the brewers roster lineup possibilities\nYou start thinking about guys like ours here or ... or maybe it's Curtis Granderson off the bench it's usually go to boil down aircrafts somebody like that yep so take your pick copyright all the ancillary figures\nI like it however right Anderson I can tell you it's a privilege just to spend time if you went in to talk with

training sometime in February boy it seems like an awfully long offseason if you don't win tonight incredible scene\nLast night here at Miller Park and you'd expect it to be duplicated\nHere tonight coming up on the program we'll hear from rivers manager Craig council his thoughts heading into tonight's game how good a shape is the bullpen in reflecting on the Nineteen eighty two season where council was a just a boy's dad was working for the Milwaukee Brewers and he was certainly a part of the surroundings here\nAt Miller Park or or them county stadium\nBack in Nineteen eighty two would also love to hear your guts thoughts and opinions on tonight's matchup or do you expect to see how do you expect it to play out we can do that all night long here at for one for seven nine nine one to six twenty that is the acting it more get to talk of tech wind\nGotcha do six thirty tonight that's going to the over arching question of the night how do you expect this thing to play out\nAt Miller Park when things get rolling a little after seven o'clock\nBy about ten o'clock\nI just I Can't get him or her I'm calling on TV where I Want to ditch all far\nBeyond all over all the time you have on our fair share of work so hard and they've proven now so I just want to see them get a fair share um quit their air and you're not I'm not seeing that and I'm not like that but you know I've been a long time for\nThe phone call Eric I I'm not really in a good position to comment on you know how the broadcasters have been out all the games which has been wonderful and certainly fortunate to be in that position but uh I I don't know what the guys are saying but I Do know that I I don't think there was a ton of attention on the brewer throughout the regular season and\nI don't think it's bad to have another dog mentality not at all in fact I think it was a representative and the Sam's last night I mean fans that this was the loudest hurting him apart\nSince I've been coming to Miller Park when it opened\nIt was the loudest I'd ever heard it last night I mean for all the game they're not just at certain points or want to run was shorter when Machado came up no there was a perpetual buzz in Miller Park last night it did not leave it did not believe it was incredible\nI feel like if they would have played game seven at one am nobody would have left\nAnd the brewers might have been on a roll who knows but that's the kind of thing you're talking about here that if he decides of home field advantage there were times and you know some of the earlier games with the series where you have the moments were great and it was loud and fans of rent you hide it but it then it kinda cooled off as the Dodgers stored and it was sort of tepid you're just waiting for the next big moment\nWhile the brewers delivered last night after being down to one nothing coming back with four runs on five hit score a goal for runs with two outs in the first inning\nWell that's all you at night a fan base after being calm down probably that David Freese home run by the way David where he's not at the starting lineup tonight for Dave Roberts\nThat's the kind of a motion you'd like to see here are the brewers fans tonight and I'm expecting to see it here in front of a sellout crowd was grabs series come into the game tonight Spencer going on\nI think for me I just wanted to I just want to fight the result of earth than out of the room I'm not worried about\nHer shawl Walker\nMine management or not worry about any of that I Want to stay Haider Haider given the earlier tonight\nOn the earth you know internationally panic in the city and higher than that\nThat's what I'm hoping for my friend that it's a Saturday you know what that means people wake it up getting the get in the middle of light flow it out in the parking lots of little bit early nobody's coming from work and credible crowd last night definitely looking forward here in the\nWinter or on the greatest of all the time we get it done and I know he wants to better than anybody either\nThey're certainly certainly the longest tenure brewer and a guy who is\nNot yet pointed a World Series in his career present the phone call have

put you into a little bit more normalcy\nI'm like man there's this is a very different type of game there's way more emotion and the crowds way louder I'm everything is more magnified so I'm\nA huge

what do you remember about uh the eighty to ... the final game of just you're kind of your thoughts and what it meant for the city in from walking\n[noise] um I remember the last as my routine during the games\nIs that I Would walk county stadium and then in right field there was this you know the stairway to the upper deck and you could\nYou could kind of it was you know back and forth ramp and I would stand on one of those ramps and like the sixth or seventh ending to try to that was my luck you start to try to get some runs um\nAnd I think that's one Cooper got the head um so that's what I thought I was you know very lucky at that time I was\nThat was the stock I'd found the spot didn't work in the world series but on the spot Neal is yeah so um but it was it's a routine is not superstitions I'm not a clear with that [laughter] um\nSo that's that's probably my fondest memory of that that time and but it was still the same it's a it's a you know it's October baseball\nAnd you get to kind of unite a community around um something that everybody's enjoying talking about\nShe married a little bit left him when you look at the year to year progress in recent years of the organization what is the sense within the organization that this is just the start of something\n[noise]\nYeah I mean I think [noise] you know your goals are ways to the bill sustainability I think that that's the and that's the hardest thing to do is to develop sustainability\nI think um so that's you know going to be what we spend a lot of time talking about next year probably is a sustaining this but we we feel like I'm you know that that's\nYou know at the forefront of our decisions is how do we build something that we can sustain so you know hopefully that gives us um you know ways and means to kind of make that happen\nFor mature right Raasch agree with you all are here's a kid who has improved elimination game before you mentioned the crowd yesterday could play a part is is there a way to rattle young kid and a follow up as their special routine superstitious place in this ballpark officers for you and a six or something\n[noise] um you know I I don't think the formula is different for the amount of the age of the pitcher the experience of the pitcher it's we've got to put pressure on him\nBy getting guys on base um that's how the crowd gets involved um you know that's how you know runs scored as you guys on base so you you get laid off hitters on base or you get multiple runners on base [noise] um that's one of the pressure starts\nUm when you know you're in a year in Nineteen Ninety season you know this is a during nine innings season [noise] um\nSo that that would be that I think um you know routines for this ballpark nothing nothing particular really um you know routines and ... and the baseball season they come and go but then sometimes you don't even know you're doing them um\n[noise] yeah I mean I think [noise] like I think you leases a product of his experiences and he sees learned what's best for himself I think are are medical staff in our training staff\nHave done an excellent job of\nKnowing the person knowing the body what makes them tick 'em what gets them right um he he understands it better as you know as you go along in your career I'm like DJ pitching coaches on a nice job of tweaking some things with them and encouraging\nNew things and ex exploration of how can I be better and watch snacks even though I'm a veteran major league pitcher so I think those are the those are the things that make it better and that that's the cops and search that good major league players haven't and need to continue to have\nUm like as far as giving him the ball I think you know he's had the ball and\nGave one sixty three I'm a wild card game a game in Dodger Stadium\nAny any pets brilliantly and and\nYou know frankly hasn't gotten enough attention for how he's pitched in his last three starts in absolutely huge games um you know he's a it's around sixteen Fifteen sixteen endings one Ron I'm In three starts that's\nPretty heavy stuff um so he's been our guy and you know were given the ball to the right guy today decree more second ruin your right\nGreg how you feel like you're rotation sets up for today is anybody off the table\n[noise] no I mean I'd I'd were set up a good I mean it was set up you know as as well as we could have hoped\nI think going into the seventh game of a series um\nSo I think you know that that everybody's\nI nobody's going to come in and say no today and and even if you're saying if you say no to anybody they're going to say I'm fine so you know we're we're in good shape and I'm not I think as as same thing across in there it's it's it's all it's nine innings season today and then that's how you treat it\nOperate in the red jacket wanting a there's a lot of talk about Nineteen eighty two but winning how you're feeling today nervous excited to all the above\n... yeah that that's how you should feel I think yeah I mean I think um [noise] our I'm\nExcited to get games started like every every everybody if the if you take all the players they would have chosen to have like a one AM start little break and then start the game right again [laughter]\nUm [noise] but that's that's the good part about it you get to you get to think about it for a little\nA little bit and um you know that that's that's part of it and um\nEverybody's excited and wants to get started that's it's always been my experience there's there's some\n[noise] there's there's some column in the clubhouse before days like this\nIt's it's a little more calm than because you know there's there's a storm outside you know and it it's going to be pretty cool when you get out there and it's going to be
