question is now when you're locked in for a fight for a playoff spot\nIn that secondary on that back line it's going to be bumpy they clearly don't get any better to day by what they did yesterday\nThe Packers are not better on the practice field today other teams in the division other teams in the league are better today so they've got something to figure out\nAs I've been looking at this more and more John to me this goes back to the draft remember what Brian ... did in his first draft\nHe's sort of doubled down and traded than he acquired another first round\nFor this coming brampton twenty Nineteen so now they Packers have to first round draft pick one of the new yesterday they traded for a seventh round of the trade it for a fourth wrote her what does that tell you they're acquiring draft currency here to me this is in a ... been on Ted Thompson's drafts from twenty eleven\nThrough twenty Fifteen in at the core of this team gets a bunch of aging veterans in very young inexperienced players\nThe court the guy's drafted between twenty Thirteen and twenty Fifteen they shouldn't be the backbone of your team right now and there are only three players from those three drafts still roster to buy the battery that's a problem wow David ... very good player\nBut ... you need that sort of debts and to me this is Brian ... saying we're pretty good we're okay it's possible we could win the division\nBut realistically the steam as it has a lot of flaws to it and I think Brian good across does recognize the death and the quality of this roster is just not there and it's to me if you're going to be drafted developed GM right that was you have to do better than that\nTime I'd gum or a you know yesterday I was the guy that was at the front of the line saying I'm Glad he's gone I'm Glad he's out of here and I was thinking from the perspective of what we expect of our players and what he did on the field but the more I thought about it\nI'm Glad for him too because this had turned into kind of an untenable situation that he created but wasn't pretty wasn't pleasant and I think it's best for all parties that they moved them\nTime a gum rehab to in advance

that game people he made a mistake and it was wrong and then it got we're to the locker room that's why he's gone but nobody should take it to that level ever\nYeah I think you're absolutely right I Want to ask you about the ... so the evidence is just in yard edge that is great but they're Thirteen points there Eighteenth and the leading touchdowns how do they fix that yeah\nThose are the numbers you have to really look at yard it can be kind of a kind of a smoke and mirrors kind of sad defense at our fence but the rest of the fish and see it just has not been very sharp busier settling for field goals when you need touchdowns got a couple of field goals and that's great good get points on the board but against a team or the rams\nYou have to get the ball in the end zone and but I think it also boils down to third down to fish in the ... this is another area where historically with Aaron Rodgers playing quarterback\nYeah the Packers were top ten dean and they're really struggling with that there were only two of nine against the LA ran in the defense not quite a sharp I don't believe with the patriots but still\nIt do you think you're going to be Tom Brady if you if you get for fuel goals probably not\nProbably not going to be fun to watch isn't it it it well I think ... line time Sunday night you could see a lot of points that don't expect a ton of difference I guess but um [noise] you know it it it doesn't feel like the ... was able to consistently prop up the rest of the team like it had done in years past that's what I'm saying\nYeah I think you're right

coverage referendum on the November ballot there are a\nTon of them in Wisconsin I discussed it with Vince ... who recently did a major story on southeast Wisconsin referendum ... this is a very timely an important story it's on a referendum on the November ballot until I watched your piece I had no idea how prevalent this has become and southeast Wisconsin\nBecause and we're talking primarily about school referendum because you know the only referenda that you see are the ones in on your ballot you know we wanted to take a of a broad look at the state and see how many school districts are putting referenda out their questions um\nAnd what kind of spending that we're talking about so in this election November six\nWisconsin taxpayers in various communities are going to have an opportunity to vote on a proposed spending of one point four billion dollars ... billion in a single day one billion four hundred and thirty two million three hundred and four thousand five hundred sixty dollars\nEighty two questions posted by sixty one school districts in Wisconsin\nIs the majority of this going to things like infrastructure roofing air conditioning stuff that's needed or is it for field houses and stuff like that\nMost is John I mean not all referenda are created equal some are asking for huge massive building projects where we're tearing down old schools and we're building new schools some are we're getting a pool and an auditorium and a field house and then\nOthers are smaller things we just want to add some classrooms in an elementary and then some are actually just you know referenda that give a school districts an opportunity to increase the revenue to just do basic stuff like keep the lights on so\nMany how many calls we've gone to a referendum a couple of times in the past ... your last one and we did actually yeah one past couple of years ago one got shot down\nAnd the big question the falls and I think a lot of other community just when it when it's for infrastructure and it's for repairs and things like that why don't district budget for this why don't they do what we as homeowners have to do and just figure it out\nSo that's a complex question and it's a fair one um we talked with a guy by the name of ... over at Marquette university's political science guy who studies among other things are these sort of things and the only point out a couple of factors\nThere are state imposed revenue caps that is not new and a lot of people want to blame various political parties or various candidates for this but that's not new that mid Nineteen nineties stuff where you have revenue caps\nThat kept the amount of money that school districts can a raise their budgets or raised their levees so you can't just gradually raise taxes a little bit a little bit a little bit and then you know sort of save the money stashed away perhaps you might at home that's one thing that limits school districts\nThe other thing is some of these are big ticket items\nSo you can raise taxes a little bit here a little bit here a little bit here when you start start talking about building new schools German town was a school district we just visited they passed in eighty five million dollar referendum they made additions and all of their schools to also wants to tear down for elementary schools essentially and build new uh for a hundred and twenty five million dollars so\nThe districts are are limited in raising that kind of capital in a traditional way\nWhich would try to do is with us today the entree for he went in depth on the referendum issue in southeast Wisconsin or the referenda successful by and large do we know how\nOften they pass so this is interesting our political science cover my cat also talked about the the success rate and as we're seeing and it it definitely is a trend if you feel like we're seeing more referendum questions we are\nWe're seeing a lot more in recent years one of the reasons for that as the economy has been better when the economy is better school districts are embolden and feel like they can go to taxpayers and ask for that money\nUm but the other reason they're doing it more often is because they are passing more often the pass rate is over fifty percent\nSo I'm more often than not even with the big asks voters are given the green light to these so if you're in a district you know like you guys said no German towns right across the freeway from you\nThey said yes they're looking at that as an opportunity of like wow you know we have a chance to build this German town says they're open enrollment numbers are up there a residential numbers are up so it's a way that some school districts thing they can attract people\nThat has been sort of trying to today's T.

it was forty seven for Walker forty six rivers three weeks ago so it's hardly changed but it did manage to tighten after all\nYou know when I talked to a likely democratic voters as we've been doing the past couple of weeks it seems there's as much or more disdain for Scott Walker as there is a doozy as him for Tony ... is there a way to get inside that number\n... we see you know sharp partisan divides that's always there\nBut when we ask people's favorable or unfavorable views\nAre there too it's very very tight neighbors is forty two percent favorable forty one unfavorable but with Walker it's forty eight favorable forty nine unfavorable so you're you're so close to dead even with both of them that way now within individual groups\nRepublicans and Democrats are overwhelmingly over well
