on those we had to buy an out of it\nHey Larry what concerns you the most when you think about how things have gone so far\nI think defensively there's been a lot of\nThings to like but I think overall uh they're they're just got to be some work done and that sort of the ball and I think uh\nThe complaints about past Russia I think there are valid or need more off the edge a regardless of

your boy makers to make plays a crunch time\nBut overall I I really think if you look at the history of two minute drills and so forth it take that one play that one player that doesn't have to be the first play as it was\nThe other night against the forty niners but it takes out one way to eat up ... yards to kind of expect the troops and get everybody a\nRowing in the same direction that the

the stadium and you ask her I Love all night and then he got to go down to get wherever you need to go you're on the floor or when you went to the stadium so it's a little unique perspective what it is really just a classic Hollywood sort of feel wary\nYou expect to walk into you know it was celebrities from twenty five thirty years ago just kind of built around at a ballgame but Dr Dog\nHey Greg I Want to ask you about to yesterday's pitching decision at the beginning of the game I thought it was genius\nSo I just wait Miley starts the ball game pitches to one batter that was clearly the game plan then will drift comes in and he gets to face a lot of writing is because of how the Dodgers that set up their line up just brewers team is really kind of prided itself on doing things in a
