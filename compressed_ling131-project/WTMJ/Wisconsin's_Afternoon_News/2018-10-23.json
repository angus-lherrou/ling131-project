{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WTMJ", "content": "Yes because\nWhat happens far too frequently is of course came to get in office and they they have NO PLAN or it's not vetted properly and we have no clue\nBut I was going to have any impact on the problem we're trying to solve some Joel Rose I Will call that one even use the governor has some liabilities there and when it comes to paying for the future are roadways and the state of Wisconsin so that that's an interesting one as well\nEducation and taxes unless the taxes for ... Wisconsin under the previous boil administration was attacks hell\nNo you can be one of those people say I don't care about that when voters pretty loudly says and they spoke with their votes we don't we're not happy with this being attacked so therefore we're going to let Republicans run the show for a few years\nWhat's happened where every budget surplus when he was three hundred million dollars in a way to sponsor\n\nTheir budget deficits before Governor Scott Walker took office\n\nThat's a pretty clear positive or current administration\nBlowing the child tax credit the tax holiday taxes in general being down significantly in the in the the tenure of Governor Scott Walker his eight years that's a win for him what does Tony Evers what can you point to\nSchool budgets are in trouble across the states rising number of referendum in school districts I think it's one point four billion dollars on November six I think about that number one point four billion dollars school referendum ... just on November six\nSo for taxes clearly does Governor Walker last one education then you can weigh in for one for southern nine nine one six twenty that can work as talking touched one\nWe have white candidates who works in education former teacher he was a former principal to\nSuper attended a public construction the state of Wisconsin although really troubled record I Would say and that's given student progressive achievements\nThe referendum was pointed that as well troubles in school districts across the states and then to just do the plagiarism thing\nOn on that pile not the best look\nSo education for the governor interesting thing about it is his actual dollar investment K. through twelve education as ramped up\nThe last time he did a budget adding additional dollars for K. through twelve vegetation Tony versus himself his words called it a pro kid budget\nAnd they get all that by lowering the property tax burden on the people just think\nUber's rousing at one point four billion dollar increase that includes money for students with disabilities of six hundred million dollar increase their know who doesn't think that's a good thing no one\nIs it's become increasingly challenging for school does your budget just because of the larger and larger number every year this let's put towards students with disabilities it's an important contribution but that's what makes these budget so challenging\n\nAnd lastly on an education if you submit a budgets and the budget proposal that's heavily plagiarize if I was a voter\n\nI Would look at that that's probably not a great example from someone who prides himself and I've been working the education field for decades\nWhen you were very policy as my friend James wages in pointed out earlier on the show suggests the rules tells you the rules I have the time I can blame it on somebody else but again where's the discipline he's already indicated he's not some discipline anybody for that kinda\nI always say leadership is hard it's not for everybody\nYou can have titles you can have positions of importance Twenty years as it has one of those it doesn't mean you're a great leader\nJust means you're in that position\nOne of the Texas to succeed Tony years has been promising everything for a vote I Want to hear how he plans to pay for it even down to his middle class tax credit redoing the rosy giving teaching pay increases the money has to come from somewhere and no one wants to talk about it\nI Can't stand any better than to six to tax where's the money coming from Tony or is it more of a throw it against the wall promise everything well somebody's fooled by and then the cast a vote for you\nFor one for seven nine nine wants to just one of the mortgage is talking tax find\nMore on the governor versus either as a heavyweight fights remembers sex titled bouts ...\nBrewer season is over and I was just hard to manage shift their attention to the honey defeated Milwaukee bustle back had\nVisor wanting us we are from Davis is on the call\nCoverage starts with six thirty tonight alright let's get\nThe free you know let's keep that momentum rolling as they celebrate the opening apply sir forum\nGood stuff than there are a bunch of times I Love the place can't wait to see a bus game they're\nHim seems Peter Fagan just give me a we're talking about ... versus Walker a west that race looks like what are the issues I kind of runs through the issues that were talked to one of those debates it's an interesting race for a lot of reasons because it shows at least if you believe the latest MU law school pool\nBut its neck and neck I think Walker's was forty seven forty six let's go to the gym on a northwest side you're on WGM Jay the money Jim\nYour morning where do you think I ...\nMy question is if we have a surplus and I watch the governor forgetting what why aren't we using that money towards the wrong\nGood question I think we should at least some of it you know there's a there's a reason why you have a rainy day fund so you should never exhausted completely because there are things that can happen but you could have a budget shortfall you need to plug it the plum that whole but if\nYou have surpluses one of the things you can do with those somebody used to run a much smaller budget is is fixed the things that needs fixing and that's one of the biggest liabilities for Governor Scott Walker is the roads clearly\nAnd I don't I don't know why we wouldn't use some of that surplus to fund some of those projects makes a call from Jim let's go to rich in Waterloo you're on WGM Jay\nRich Marty how are you what do you think ah well I'm\nI just want to call in and comment about a comment about school referendum I'm\nBeing the author Tony ... actually I Believe the reason there's been so many school referendum just to cover the operating costs because of the massive cuts that have been made an education by locker during that time but often the\nLegislator there's bureau came out with three or indicated shootout at eleven at night feeling [noise] actual Benny not cool public schools and the ... gone down by\nSix percent mhm banning include the amount that Walker claims to be a record in ...\nOh can you make a record than best friend in school and also I have to go down by a\nBritish I got a letter I got to let you go because I go to commercial but thanks for bringing up quickly I'll I'll address that I'm One of the things that I think the Democrats could push it push back on the governor and and the voters said that that some of that is is real or has been an impact on schools and that's why you're seeing this referendum\nBut I Would also argue that a lot of these referendum 'cause I've looked at almost all of them was at one point for are related to facilities\n\nHave nothing to do with the impacts of any cuts to the state education budget it's about building new schools fixing older schools and what\nWhat's happened over the years when he was directed into other areas of of the budget and the neglected their facilities that happens over and over again it shows short sighted is a school boards school districts that's what's driving some of the referendum but thanks for the call rich appreciate that call we're gonna we're gonna change topics\nAfter news about a thirty five CCD with you on this Monday things even listening man the temperatures rocketing up four fifty seven degrees Jordan I\nI Love it it's really a twenty seconds of October just twenty second right it can say that when you start to marry\nOr you got about a half hour left but this is going to be a good discussion so I I'm a big fan of Twitter love uh I Love social media but Twitter more than ... face to face with when I think it's more of a family thing it was the that's the way I use I don't know how you use it at home but we're on your mobile device but I use the Twitter or Facebook outweigh Twitter's more\nChecking on the pulse of the country in the world falling a lot of journalists seeing what's happening I'm almost instantaneously that's the value I get out of it\nBut what I've noticed I probably follow thousand different journalists prince\nTV\nEven satellites local and national\nAnd it's one of the things I've I've highlighted on on a bunch of occasions I I Do see a distinct difference in the conduct local media versus national media\n\nIt's not an absolute but it seems to me the local media still understands there's a separation\nBut it seems to me the local media steel understands there's a separation\nAnd I've talked about the fact that um it's it's really um comes through on a network like CNN and that worked at I I still watch a lot but mainly now just to see how far they push them and it started\nIf you continue to do that you're going to blow off any credibility you have now some people don't care some networks don't care CNN they're all in they decided this format works for them\nTwelve panel members talking about president Donald Trump screaming at each other then decided that's what best serves the public and frankly to the public you've rewarded them with high ratings for doing that\n\nThere's a price to be paid for this kind of behavior you think it's bad now you think you can't figure out what's true and what's not true wait to see how it is during twenty twenty or twenty twenty four\n\nYear not games because ultimately what you'd get here is a bad product at the end for policy ineffective leadership\nIn a populist that's so confused they have no idea who to vote for and we're seeing that come into play right now dangerous times and it's often simple things\nAnd yes even social media complains of his\nEnvironment\nWhere you think you're being funny you think you're not injecting your own bias in the stories and then suddenly you are and it's hard to get to pull back from there\nI wrap up my show handed off the Jeff Wagner that's ... by the way we were laughing [laughter] listen I reacted to the science and [noise] I don't think people even know what the song and you know\nI don't think senator found like [noise] you know some nice slow jams needs\nTo Philly audience in on that one I found this music action for Jordan a got a couple of minutes left before we had it off the Jeff I I saw this in the NBC News dot com written by Ani ... does a lot of\nBlogging for them I'm not going to read the thing is I don't have time but basically as premises that we should stop celebrating\nThe American space program because it demonstrates that were women we think America is different or something we should not celebrate or or feel proud about and I couldn't agree with her cell phones take more than that let me just read a little snippet of it\nUm well clearly a cheap political points Rubio's complaint does ... ... what a certain say on the popular he wants from these retaliatory Nineteen sixties space program they want to be totally made it to them and because Americans are smarter better faster stronger\nThis film of talking about this is a new film a first man despite leaning towards her Ross ... ultimately doesn't do that planting the flags will have some wrong this movie Americans did not walking them because we are special because we were stubborn\nWe can do it again but at what cost all the things he just sat are wrong we were special we were smart and we did it better and faster and and incredibly we got to the moon\nIt's okay to be really good at something it's okay for one country to excel beyond another country it's it's time we stopped apologizing for greatness I Know the socialist thought they would like to say everyone's the same every one stop the same I couldn't be an astronaut\nI could never be an engineer I could ever design a building pay for those people that are smarter than me that our deserve that praise and attention in the American space program is nothing we should ever apologized for the fact that people blog about this stuff\nI'm going to point that algae 'cause it just shows the silliness of the arguments in our country now Jeff Wagner is back what you guys coming

thirty four seats really with you on this Monday [noise] while we don't have to be excited about the in the next week\nAnd a half for the for all those who got to go on that ride it was a lot of fun [noise] doesn't make Saturday any less disappointing but we'll spend a little bit of the first half hour talking about\nThat in playing some of the great highlights of the twenty Eighteen season this was a ... if you're a brewers fan you got a kick out of the season as if it didn't and the way you wanted it to but boy there was some great thrills along the way some kind of revisit that before we launch headlong into politics again\nA busy show as you would expect for a Monday eleven o'clock hour the candidates for governor debated on Friday nights do you think anybody watch the debates I sampled that that's the best I could do given all the things were happening I'm going to break down why I think Governor Walker's should win this race November six\nHe says it's his final race for governor\nRecent news have not been kind to Tony ... says his opponent in this race if you can't write budgets without stealing from previous budgets using the same words changing a few words that's a deliberate act and you can say there was somebody that worked for you but ultimately you're responsible\nDoes that casts a light on what a problem with Tony ... administration potentially if he won the election in November what look like somebody you can't be trusted with the simple things somebody who's led the state schools\nAnd yet has achieved notes significant progress someone to break it down for eleven to seven why Governor Walker's should win this race eleven thirty five this is an interesting one because I spent a lot of time on social media is part of my research and the fact that I like social media\nBut I've noticed that journalists are using it in a in a unique way if if you don't know broadcast journalist print journalists many of them use social media\nTo promote their stories and their pieces\nBut a lot a lot of them are also using social media support opinions out there\nAnd my question is simply do they show biased when they do that no not all journalists do this and I noticed is some dry distinct line but for some folks mainly the national media\nThey're using this as a kind of half hearted round of the roundabout way to\nInterject opinion into what should be a journalistic process so we'll we'll dig into that one eleven thirty five course for coffee or the ten o'clock hour before at ten the four biggest stories as we see it across Milwaukee state in the world is the latest on Jimmy costs missing girl from Baron Wisconsin\nThat that stories that head scratcher someone breaks into their home fix the door down kills her parents she's been missing for a week now\nNo real new developments but we'll update from what we do know uh with I think a four PM Press conference panic in a in western Wisconsin also President Trump come at a time this week former president Brock Obama coming to town this week I think friday\nWhat does it all mean\nUnlike twenty sixteen Democrats are paying attention to Wisconsin they see it as a one of the signatures states governor's race US Senate race first congressional district all of those races had primaries last friday as I said who watched them\nOf course not act like our every Monday the editor right Wisconsin genes weakest and joins us by if you talk about the plagiarism plagiarism case with Tony ... all of the races that we uh\nWe now know will be interesting and tights\nThe only one that's shown any resistance to that description is the U.S Senate race book near Baldwin\nAt one time he bombs had a significant lead for quite a while it interesting to have been about Sammy Baldwin so why all of us were so wrapped up in the brewers the excitement of game six is in game seven tennis ball was campaigning\nShe was actually at a concert Saturday Night campaigning they stopped the concert and she spoke at the concert apparently so all of us Wisconsin nights where Jeff Stevens more enthusiasm\nTammy Baldwin man that interested I'm going to GO Campaign interesting\nLook at how candidates approach the campaign season how big gate\nLook at how candidates approach the campaign season or they gauge what is important to voters once you mentioned the brewers in her speech at this concert because in Madison Tammy Baldwin definitely taking a different approach bringing\nKamala Harris in the town celebrating Kamala Harris his birthday in Wisconsin apparently\nAny any confusion that's out there about what Tammy Baldwin is about look to the people she brings to the state smaller Harris\nExtremely liberal from California Bernie Sanders noted stream liberal she doesn't hide it\nShe got about Wisconsin at all I'm the biggest day of the year for the ... one of the greatest sports franchises in our state she got hanging on every pitch you've had gotten her brewers garb aren't you going to a concert and campaigning\n\nYou talk about a pitcher who dominated not just me saying that the announcers most and buck I think everybody looked at the end all the guys on on on a Fox they set it this guy was lights out\nThe team that was an opposing him in the batter's box they didn't know what to do with them and he came in and did his job effectively a three innings on Saturday just an incredible season and a boy\nIt's an embarrassment of riches for Stearns council this team next year with their pitching staff who would've thought that and you know some coming back next year hopefully successfully from his injury there's a lot to look forward to it was an incredible season\nTo be a part of and I heard all of it on WGM Gina Gray ... brindle item on my show friday\nAll the folks who ah worked so hard year to kinda bring you some of the the great highlights we just play the ... and it was a heck of a season but you know what\nWe got to move on and I'm like I spent a lot of time on baseball if you want to send me your favorite moment I'll Try to interspersed throughout the show Jeff from Fox point said it was when he was surrounded by cubs fans Miller Park\nUm that happened a few times this year it's a great rivalry I'm looking forward to that rivalry going forward brewers cubs for a while a next few years that's going to be one of those robberies to watch it's a true rivalry in and wants to read for be respected All right after the break after the news\nHe joins me every Monday James we're just an editor right Wisconsin plenty of talk about about Wisconsin politics that's next we're hearing WGM jak\nMove out and we must be a look back a little bit on the brewers\nThey're season and then [noise]\nUh Saturday nights he joins we every Monday James winters in the editor might Wisconsin on your big brewers fan as well as a tough one for brewers fans rice\nYeah I was a rather depressing I had a hard time are forcing myself to get up Sunday Morning after that one [laughter]\nBut we're we're going to move forward we have we have a big election day coming up in Wisconsin I think open or early ... starts today\nA November ... of course the big day let's start with walkers eaters does anybody care what happens in these debates and and the big story really which I think it's starting to gain a little bit of traction as the plagiarism plagiarism charges against Tony Evers well any of that matter does it have an impact on November ...\nWell as far as the debate goes unless somebody makes a major gap and one of these debates are they they tend not to have too much carry especially in a debate that was\nThere was a during the ... game itself on friday night and it was so insignificant walk your statement was cut off by the ... PBS station I ended up email you know his closing statements to to supporters than we ever posted up on her Facebook page at right Wisconsin but um [noise]\nNo enlisted ... which is a real gap something in there wasn't really during that debate at all I mean ... look like emergency\nWho's about exactly what most people would have expected of them even before the the debate began\nI kind of just plotted along in a in a Walker was the same Scott Walker that we've seen for the last eight years ease of use very skilled at communicating his points of view and the successes that he's had in his administration\nWhat about the plagiarism now they're the charges that it's not just one instance in the in the budget proposal but he's submitted but there are several instances of him or someone that works for him taking large pieces of tax whole paragraphs will pages maybe a minor word change here there's it seems like somebody\nDoesn't understand the rules that are are set in place for for how you are supposed to create your own material\nRight the rules that are actually posted on the department of public instruction website a very clear about what plagiarism is and they only ten points the whole that they explain it right on their own website and yet they turn right around in some in the budget that is that is taken\nLifted in the hall from from other sources without any citation I was very interesting you risk reaction and friday night when he when he said that if this is the best that Scott Walker's car well it's clearly not\nBut the tax is she was much more important\nBut what did what's interesting to me is how you versus not holding anybody accountable and his agency and it's kind of the way the universe works He doesn't own schools accountable when they're feeling\nA you know there's a whole new his own staff accountable when they do things that are wrong and that would be the kind of governor that you would be we have a governor and right now that it's been criticized for hanging\nOnto people for too long ago a mansion with Tony ... is going to be like Tony ears couldn't you require a teacher that was watching porn in the classroom\nIs an interesting point because the governor has been challenged by some people that used to work for them because the governor made some tough call those people don't work for him anymore Tony Evers seems incapable of removing the bad eggs are bad actors from his employment or working in his department\nThat suggests a fundamental flaw in his leadership which I think voters and Wisconsin should care about leading into this November six election\nWell exactly I mean Tony versus never held anybody accountable for anything including um so and when he talks about being a lifelong educators let's let's tell the truth on this he's been a bureaucrat much longer than he was ever in the classroom and Tony ... which is somebody who's been in the education\nField he should know that plagiarism serious\nHealth and this was a huge effort I still think the Governor Walker and I'm going to talk about later on the show eleven o seven is going to win this race is Tony Evers won that race but what an university administration looked like could they get anything accomplished with the legislature currently in place\nWell the the thing that that's interesting to me is I mean you can try to hold up some\nOf the budget for example would be where he would have the most leverage and you can try to hold it up until he got what he wanted but some of the things that you would advocate for like a the repeal of act turned become really problematic he has to figure out where the money would come from for all these local school districts are fair tennis\nIs repealed a you would have to figure out where to where the money would come for state government uh we've saved over five billion dollars as a result of actor in over three billion dollars\nAt the local school system level I'm too so they advocate for the repeal of actor and he's going to have to justify to the public where the where the money's going to\nCome from a shift to the U.S Senate race well all of us were sweating the brewers Dodgers game ... Tammy Baldwin as that and that was like I say this red body I think it's a group she was at a concert giving a speech during the concerts\nFrankly I don't know what was the number would you would you use Ninety percent of Wisconsin ice were probably more concerned about baseball that night will Tammy Baldwin's campaigning which she loves to do apparently the only time I ever see are in Wisconsin on TV or in person is once you campaigning\nDoes that suggest somebody that's totally disconnected with the people that live in Wisconsin\nWell yeah it's kind of interesting to me it's suggested a socialism has failed because we had much better music when we pay for our generation that a ... to me it just kind of shows a deliberate cocoon that that\nThe Tammy Baldwin is in the you know this is so important and uh I Can't imagine that it moved any voters or even the even the fans of the band so\nI I have a hard time believing that they have that instead of heard some of their music um but\nIt's it's not going to move to many people it's it's no different than in past election cycles and you've had a John Mellencamp beer or Bruce Springsteen or you know if this was the best that she can do for getting a vans and campaign for wins in the past like I said we've had Bruce Bruce Springsteen it's not a good sign for it\nThe best that she can do for getting a vans and campaign for waiting in the past like I said we have Bruce Bruce Springsteen it's not a good sign for campaign\nSo let's give her credit we're talking to James winters in the editor right Wisconsin she has by all intents and purposes a double digit lead in the polls so as the leader does give her a lot of discussion and do what she wants but she's tried again again this weekend I patently was Kamala Harris birthday and I saw another social media posts celebrating the birthday of the center from California\nIt's like she's flaunting the extreme lizard liberalism as she tries to push away in her ads but yet does things like that do art voters in Wisconsin smarter than that [noise] well I Would hope so\nBut unfortunately like you said where the polls are showing an egg and it goes to the fact that there are ... years campaign has not had on on voters I'm Tammy campaign is going to be with you and bracing Bernie Sanders once again this week they're going to be bringing him back in ... the one person that's actually out there touring\nThat it's not going to come to Wisconsin is Hillary Clinton let's all be shocked if that right right but ah when Tammy Baldwin runs to the left her base loves that in she's just counting on the fact that her base is going to turn out and help her when\nJames waiters enjoying as he does every Monday after the break let's let's begin to uh to the uh Randy Bryce Brian style race and the comparison it\nRandy Bryce made it frankly is stunning and it's on his face and I love the fact that he started his debate in Oak Creek with a\nA you know a sports analogy it's like come on you know where you're coming from nine arrest yet this is a serious candidate for Congress in Wisconsin we have to do better folks All right mark James after the break right here in New Hampshire holidays right around the corner who's\nOr another W ... back in his annual holiday radio show WGLA presents the night before Christmas ... manager why during the slave for Wisconsin celebrities\nI understand you don't like Scott Walker that comes to loudly and clearly I understand you're more closely allied with teachers' unions\nI get how that works\nBut when you're a governor you represent everybody you have to make really tough decisions and you have to implement those decisions knowing if some people aren't going to be happy about\nAnd what Tony Evers has demonstrated loudly and clearly in his tenure as superintendent of public schools\nYou can make a decision you can't fire anybody even those that deserve firing Fort ones for seven nine nine one six twenty get me on Facebook as well Facebook dot com so six twenty WGM Jay what's making the governor's race for for Walker\nDefend his record ... defended his record and tell me why you're for here that's all night so I didn't do the ...\nWith the ... year we have someone was the face of lives will get to that as soon as you can also apologies for those cells were looking for [noise]\nOn Facebook machine so way on the in the mortgage talking touch signed for one for seven nine nine one six twenty giving back to the universe versus Walker race I'm trying to highlight some of the differences and the candidates on the issues that always roads and\nTo be honest there are some challenges here that Tony ... can make that does hit the mark when it comes to the Walker and restoration of roadways I've been I've been a critic\nWe cannot keep borrowing\nTo pay for the road construction in our state and it's it's a failed policy it's an easy one for politicians to me because it it just kick the can down the road\nSo the governor does have some liability there but from Tony Evers he's giving us the old well have a plan after I'm inaugurated no that's not good enough you want someone's votes tell us what's your plan here because what happens far too frequently\nIs of course Kennedy's get in office and they they have NO PLAN or it's not vetted properly and we have no clue but I was going to have any impact on the problem we're trying to solve some don't rose\nI Will call that one even use the governor has some liabilities there and when it comes to paying for the future roadways in the state of Wisconsin so that that's an interesting one as well education and taxes let's to taxes first\nWisconsin under the previous boil administration was attacked so\nYou can be one of those people say I don't care about that when voters pretty loudly said and they spoke with their votes we don't we're not happy with this being attacked so therefore we're going to let Republicans run the show for a few years\nWhat's happened wherever they budget surplus when he was three hundred million dollars in the latest budget\n\nThey had budget deficits before Governor Scott Walker took off\n\nThat's a pretty clear positive or current administration\nBlowing the child tax credit the pets holiday taxes in general being down significantly in the in the tenure of Governor Scott Walker his eight years that's a win for him what does Tony Evers what can you point to\nSchool budgets that are in trouble across the states rising number of referendum and school districts I think it's one point four billion dollars on November six I think about that number one point four billion dollars school referendum ... just on November ...\nSo for taxes clearly does Governor Walker last one education and you can weigh in for one for southern nine nine one six twenty second mortgages talking times when\nWe have one candidates who works in education former teacher he was a former principal to super attended a public construction the state of Wisconsin\nAlthough really troubled record I Would say at best given student progress and achievements\nThe referendum was point to that as well troubles in school districts across the states and then just throwing the plagiarism thing on\nOn that pile not the best look\nSo education for the governor of the interesting thing about it is his actual dollar investment K. through twelve education has ramped up\nThe last time he did a budget adding additional dollars for K. through twelve education Tony reversed himself his words called it a pro kid budget\nAnd they did all that by lowering the property tax burden on the people just think Uber's ... at one point for ...\nBy lowering the properties expert on the people just think\nUber's\nProposing at one point four billion dollar increase it includes money for students with disabilities and six hundred million dollar increase\nTheir know who else I think that's a good thing no one is it's become increasingly challenging for school district budget because of the larger and larger number every year this that's much towards students with disabilities it's an important contribution but that's what makes these budget so challenging\n\nAnd Leslie I'm an education if you submit a budgets and a budget proposal that's heavily plagiarize so I went to a voter\n\nI Would look at that that's probably not a great example from someone who prides himself and having worked in the education field for decades\nWhen you were very policy as my friend James wages in pointed out earlier on the show suggests the rules tells you the rules I have the time I can blame it on somebody else but again where's the discipline he's already indicated he's not going to discipline anybody for that kinda\nI always say leadership is hard it's not for everybody\nYou can have titles you can have positions of importance Tony resentment has one of those it doesn't mean you're a great leader\nJust means you're in that position\nOne of the taxes to six to Tony years has been promising everything for a vote I Want to hear how he plans to pay for it even down to his middle class tax credit redoing Rosa giving teachers pay increase of money has to come from somewhere and no one wants to talk about it\nI Can't say it any better than to six to tax where's the money coming from Tony or is it more of a throw it against the wall promise everything hope somebody's fooled\nBy him in the cast a vote for you form on four seven nine nine once they just want to be I can just talk and talk to find more on the governor versus eaters to heavyweight fights November sex titled bouts when that's next we're going to be changing\nBrewer season is over and I was just for the fans shift their attention to the hundreds of feet as Milwaukee must have had\nVisor wanted to go through your Davis is on the golf\nCoverage starts with six thirty some at All right let's get\nThe free you know let's keep that momentum rolling as they celebrate the opening apply served forum good stuff in there a bunch of times I Love the place and wait to see a bus game they're\n... feet of Vegas just give me a we're talking about ... versus Walker uh what's that race looks like one of the issues that kind of runs through the issues that were talked to one of those debates it's an interesting race for a lot of reasons because it shows at least if you believe the latest MU law school bull\nBut its neck and neck I think Walker's was forty seven forty six let's go to Jim on the north west side you're on WGM Jay Carney Jim\nMorning where do you think\nI called my question is if we have a surplus and I was the governor forgetting why aren't we using that money towards the wrong\nGood question I think we should at least some of it\nYou know there's a there's a reason why you have a rainy day fund she should never exhausted completely because there are things that can happen you have a you could have a budget shortfall you need to plug it the plum down hole but if you have surpluses one of the things you can do with those somebody used to run a much smaller budget\nIs is fixed the things that needs fixing and that's one of the biggest liabilities for Governor Scott Walker is the roads clearly\nAnd I don't I don't know why we wouldn't use some of that surplus to fund some of those projects makes a call from Jim let's go to rich in Waterloo you're on WGM Jay rich\nMorning how are you know what do you think\nAh well I'm I just wanted to call in and comment about a comment about a referendum I'm being the author Tony ... actually I\nBelieve the reason there's been so many school referendum just to cover the operating costs because of the massive cuts that have been made an education by locker during that time it off\nThe legislator bureau came out with three or that indicated from two thousand and eleven at night Jean [noise] actual Benny not cool\nPublic school and they got the gone down by six percent mhm that include the amount that Walker claims to be a record and that's how can you make a record than ... minutes school and also I have to go down by ... by\nRichard ... I got to let you go because like I go to commercial but thanks for bringing up I've quickly I'll I'll address that I'm One of the things that I think the Democrats could push it push back on the governor and and the voters said that some of that is is real there has been an impact on schools and that's why you're seeing his referendum\nTrying to glean your information about what's happening in our country on this panel of six experts with her quotes trying to figure out what's real it's not real when it's when the panels are filled with ... journalists X campaign staffers for Hillary Clinton\nOr democratic operatives\nAnd you don't understand why the public has no faith in what you provide them than the news that you deliver\nWhy is that so hard to figure out\nAnd if you blur those lines if he's soften that line between journalism and opinion which is what's happening and I started this talking about social media that's where it showing up loudly and clearly follow a few journalists and look to see how they act on social media\n\nThere's some that clearly understand that that line do Glover from walking Journal Sentinel great example he knows what the line is\nAnd that's how he tweets\nWould look at the national me and how they approach this issue\n\nAnd when you see words like in a range of the president has is lying which is another another term overused\nTerm when it comes to politics they all live it's all PR spin\n\nI don't care what candidate I don't care what party I don't care what decade you're talking about they all lie\n\nThere's nothing unique about the current environment other than the fact that reporters are doing their job as reporters\nWhat should they do during national news organization\nAny reporter that's involved in social media no more jokes no more snark no blatant sharing of opinions\nIf you continue to do that you're going to blow up any credibility you have now some people don't care some networks don't care CNN they're all in\nThey've decided this format works for them\nTwelve panel members talking about president Donald Trump screaming at each other they decided that's what best serves the public and frankly to the public you've rewarded them with high ratings for doing that\n\nThere's a price to be paid for this kind of behavior\n\nYou think it's bad now you think you can't figure out what's true and what's not you wait to see how it is doing twenty twenty or twenty twenty four\nThese are not games because ultimately what you get here is a bad product at the end poor policy ineffective leadership\nAnd a populist that so confused they have no idea who to vote for and we're seeing that come into play right now dangerous times it's often simple things\nAnd yes even social media complains that his\nEnvironment\nWhere you think you're being funny you think you're not injecting your own biases stories and then suddenly you are and it's hard to get to pull back from the\nRap on my show handed off the Jeff Wagner that's necessarily WGM Jim I might have been revived maneuver laughing [noise] listen I reacted to resign and saying [noise] I don't think people even know what the

before we had enough of Jeff I I saw this in the NBC News dot com written by ... does a lot of\nBlogging for them [noise] I'm not going to read the thing is I don't have time but basically as promises that we should stop celebrating the American space program because it's demonstrate that were when we think America's different or\nHis promises that we should stop celebrating the American space program because it's demonstrates that where we think America's different or it's something we should not celebrate or feel proud about and I couldn't agree with the cell phones take more than that let me just read a little snippet other\nUm what clearly a cheap political points Rubio's complaint those in castle want a certain size of the popular he wants from these retelling or Nineteen sixty space program\nThey want to be totally minutes someone because Americans are smarter and better faster stronger this film a\nTalking about this new film a first man despite leaning towards her Ross ... ultimately doesn't do that planting a flag without the wrong this movie Americans did not walking when 'cause we're special because we were stubborn\nWe could do it again but at what cost all the things you just said are wrong we were special we were smarter we did it better and faster and and incredibly we've got to the moon\nIt's okay to be really good at something it's okay for one country to excel beyond another country if it's time we stopped apologizing for greatness I Know the socialists out there with like think everyone's the same everyone's out the same I couldn't be an astronaut\nI could ever be an engineer I could ever design a building thankfully there's people that are smarter than me that our deserve that praise and attention and the American space program is nothing we should ever apologize for the fact that people blog about this stuff\nI'm going to point that out see 'cause it just shows the silliness of the arguments in our country now Jeff Wagner is

disappointed by must have been\nA little bit of the first half hour talking about that in playing some of the great highlights of the twenty Eighteen season this was a ... if you're a brewers fan you got a kick out of the season as if it didn't and the way you wanted to but boy there were some great thrills along the way some kind of revisit that before we launch headlong into politics again a busy show\nAs you would expect for Monday eleven o'clock hour the candidates for governor debated on Friday nights do you think anybody watch the debates I sampled that that's the best I could do given all the things were happening I'm going to break down why I think Governor Walker should win this race November six\nHe says it's his final race for governor\nRecent news have not been kind to Tony versus his opponent in this race if you can't write budgets without stealing from previous budgets using the same words changing a few words that's a deliberate act that you can say there was somebody that worked for you but ultimately you're responsible\nDoes that casts a light on what a problem with Tony Evers administration potentially if you won the election in November what looked like somebody can't be trusted with a simple thing somebody who's led the state schools\nAnd yet has achieved notes significant progress so I'm gonna break it down for eleven to seven why Governor Walker should win this race eleven thirty five this is an interesting one because I spent a lot of time on social media is part of my research and the fact that I like social media\nBut I've noticed that journalists are using it in a in a unique way if if you don't know broadcast journalist print journalists\nMany of them use social media to promote their stories and their pieces\nBut a lot a lot of them are also using social media support opinions out there\nAnd my question is simply do they show biased when they do that now not all journalists do this and I noticed there's some dry distinct line\nBut for some folks mainly the national media\nThey're using this as a kind of half hearted round of the round about way to\nInterject opinion into what should be a journalistic process or will begin to have an eleven thirty five course for coffee or the ten o'clock hour before at ten\nBefore they just stories as we see it across Milwaukee state in the world is the latest on Jimmy clause missing girl from Baron Wisconsin that that story is the head scratcher someone has a bracing to their home fix the door down kills her parents she's been missing for a week now\nNo real new developments but we'll update you are what we do know uh with I think a four PM Press conference pending in uh in western Wisconsin also\nPresident Trump coming in town this week former president Brock Obama coming to town this week I think friday what is it all mean\nUnlike twenty sixteen\nDemocrats are paying attention to a Wisconsin they see it as a one of the signature states governor's race US Senate race first congressional district all of those races have primaries last friday as I said who watched him\n\n[noise] you\nKnow\nYou in Rondonia going away and\nSwinging a high rise ha\nHa ha\n\n\n[noise]\n\nHa ha\nWill be back with you again\nIs ...\nRealize until a that's a great view splashed around then or one of our producers your WGM James Bond so sad at the end there man he he really really sounded said one of the incredible season there's two names that I'm gonna remember from twenty Eighteen\nObviously Christian yellowish incredible regular season not a bad postseason gets along well with a no probably not the postseason he wanted a from his performance there and in the second half just incredible why he wouldn't have you the other one Josh hater\nYou talk about it hits your who dominated not just me saying that the announcers most embark I think everybody looked at the end all the guys on on on a box they said this guy was lights out\nThe team that was for opposing given the batter's box they didn't know what to do it and he came in and did his job effectively a three innings on Saturday just an incredible season and a boy\nIt's an embarrassment of riches for Stearns hold so this team next year with their pitching staff who would've thought there and you know some coming back next year we have to test me from his injury there's a lot to look forward to it was an incredible season\nTo be a part of and I heard all of it on WGM Jay the great by ... ... ... to my my show friday\nAll the folks who ah worked so hard to ... year to kinda bring you some of the debris highlights me just read the piece from ... there was a heck of a season but you know what we got to move on and I'm like I spent a lot of talking about baseball if you want to send me your favorite moment I'll Try to interspersed throughout the show Jeff from Fox point\nThat it was the one he was surrounded by comes Miller Park\nUm that happened a few times this year\nOr some throughout the show Jeff from Fox point so that was when he was surrounded by cubs fans Miller Park um that happened a few times this year it's a great rivalry I'm looking forward to that rivalry going forward brewers cubs\nFor a while the next few years I was going to be one of those robberies to watch it's a true rivalry in and wants to read the respective All right after the break after the news\nHe joins me every Monday James which is an editor right Wisconsin plenty of talk about about Wisconsin politics that smacks right here in WGM jak\nWe must be a look back a little bit on the brewers says\nTheir season ended [noise]\nUh Saturday nights he joins me every Monday James whether it's in the editor of Wisconsin on your doors fan as well as a tough one for brewers fans right\nYeah I was a rather depressing I had a hard time are forcing myself to get up Sunday Morning after that one\n[laughter] but we're we're going to move forward we have we have a big election day coming up in Wisconsin I think open or early ... starts today a number six of course the big day let's start with walkers eaters does anybody care what happens in these debates and and the big story really which\nI think it's starting to gain a little bit of traction as the plagiarism plagiarism charges against Tony Evers ... any of that matter does it have an impact on none of them as\nWell as far as the debate goes unless somebody makes a major gas and one of these debates uh they they tend not to have too much carry especially in a debate that was\nThere was a during the bird game itself on friday night and it was so insignificant walkers statement was cut off by the ... PBS station I ended up email you know and his closing statements to to supporters than we ever posted up on her Facebook page every Wisconsin but I'm\nNo enlisted ... it looks as a real gap something in there wasn't really during that debate at all I mean ... look like ...\nIs about exactly what most people would have expected of them even before the the debate began\nI kind of just clouded along in a in a Walker was the same Scott Walker that we've seen for the last eight years ease of use very skilled at communicating his points of view and the successes that he's had in his administration\nWhat about the plagiarism now that the charges that it's not just one instance in the budget proposes ... submitted but there are several instances of him or someone that works for him taking large pieces of tax whole paragraphs will pages\nMaybe a minor word change here there's it seems like somebody doesn't understand the rules that are are set in place for for how you are supposed to create your own material\nRight the rules that are actually posted on the department of public instruction website a very clear about what plagiarism is sitting there ten points a hole that they explain it right on their own website and yet they turn right around and it's been a budget that is that has taken lifted in whole from from other sources without any citation\nI was very interesting universe reaction and friday night when he when he said if this is the best that Scott Walker's travel it's clearly not\nBut the tax issue is much more important but what did what's interesting to me is how you versus not holding anybody accountable and his agency and it's kind of the way that ... words he does it home schools accountable and they're failing hold his own staffer accountable and they do things that are wrong\nAnd that would be the kind of governor they would be ... we have a governor and right now that it's been criticized for hanging onto people for too long ago a mansion with Tony ... is going to be like\nTony ... couldn't you require a teacher that was watching porn in the classroom\nAnd interesting point because the governor has been challenged by some people that used to work for them because the governor made some tough call those people don't work for him anymore Tony Evers seems incapable\nOf removing the bad eggs to bad actors from his employment or working in his apartment that suggests a fundamental flaw in his leadership which I think voters and Wisconsin should care about leading into this November ... election well exactly\nI mean Tony ... has never held anybody accountable for anything including himself when he talks about being a lifelong educators let's let's tell the truth of the sea spend a bureaucrat much longer than he was ever in the classroom and Tony Evers when he was somebody who's been in the education field he should know that plagiarism\nSerious if and this is a huge effort I still think the Governor Walker and I'm going to talk about later in the show eleven o seven is going to win this race\nIf Tony ... won that race what would an university administration looked like could they get anything accomplished with the legislature currently in place\nWell that's the thing that it's\nInteresting to me is I mean he can try to hold up some\nOf the budget for example would be where he would have the most libraries and you can try to hold it up until you got what he wanted but some of the things that he would advocate for like a repeal of act can become really problematic he has to figure out where the money would come from for all these local school districts that fact tennis\nIs repealed a you would have to figure out where to where the money would come for state government uh we've saved over five billion dollars as a result of actor in over three billion dollars\nAt the local school system level I'm too so they advocate for the repeal of act ten you spending half the justified to the public where the where the money's going to come from\nA shift to the U.S Senate race well all of us were sweating or the brewers Dodgers game Saturday Night Tammy Baldwin as that and I hope I say this red body there I think\nIs the group she was at a concert giving a speech during the concerts\nFrankly I don't know what would the number would would you use Ninety percent of Wisconsin nice we're probably more concerned about baseball that night will tennis ball was campaigning which she loves to do apparently it's the only time I ever see her in Wisconsin on TV or in person is when she's campaigning\nDoes this suggest somebody that's totally disconnected with the people that live in Wisconsin\nWell yeah it's kind of interesting to me it suggests a socialism has failed because we had much better music when we pay for our generation that or is it to me it just kind of shows the the liberal cocoon that that\nThat Tammy Baldwin is in that you know this is so important and I can't imagine that it moved any voters or even even the fans of the band\nThis happens occasionally that that things need to be rescheduled\nAnd it it's always when it happened to ... it's a pain in the bud because you know maybe you made a ... maybe you you decided hey I Am going to come in from out of town I'm going to fly in from Nashville, Tennessee 'cause I'm a huge fan I Want to go see the show and you've made arrangements and then all of a sudden it gets moved\nAnd so it doesn't work for you I I appreciate that that that's the issue\nAt the same time there's a lot of people that are just I think I'm reasonably upset about this if you want to criticize the brewers you can perhaps say that maybe they knew about this they should have perhaps announced this a little bit sooner because they knew\nThey knew that they were going to have a problem at the same time I would say that if I was going to the show and I saw that the brewers we're playing at Miller Park\nOn Saturday Night and I knew there was a chance they would go to the world series I Would also figure that there's maybe a good chance that there's going to be this concert being rescheduled in any event I Know some people are unhappy but I think it's going to be a great show sometimes stuff just happens one fifty nine ...\nThis is ...

Berlin Hi Amy you're first\nCalf I'm back in two thousand three my husband and I are looking for some insight or walking and\nThey were looking at a bunch of different house and the hardest right now so I'm thirty one time was up here and it was three hundred thousand dollar well we thought\nYou know and we want to say that as far as we heard it my husband happens to be an architect so he he knows all about how much stuff like that that we target\nIt would've cost that's over a million dollars to\nRestore it and make it let them All right we realize when we've thought that we couldn't afford the ups and their parents because it was way out of our budget right that man that bought that house and like they say there is no way she did not know how it should be for a bought\n... by the way I think you've written about by you know what I think\nHe I think he probably I think he probably did but my my next question would be then so what I mean if he if he's bought the house why shouldn't he be able to do what he wants with it including tearing it down\nBecause when you purchase a piece of\nHistory okay so okay somebody\nSaying okay let's say you're not just in the original document is up for sale\nSomebody buys it and the same by it they want to bring it up because they don't watch the top them from doing that if you buy something that is architecturally historically significant died especially if you buy it how like like the state where you know I think it's wrong and you're already at a battle with them\nAbout it I'm Sorry I have absolutely no sympathy for an adult and he got himself into it in any kind of walk away okay do you think we\nKnow the thing I don't know I I don't know if he's not being responsible I mean he's he's saying hey I Want to live in this area um but this particular house it's I\n... it is it is just it is outlived its functional usefulness I mean that that's what I guess the argument would be because I mean sometimes I get you got old I get you got a story but the reality is sometimes there's these houses that just\nTo to retrofit them to do what you need to do to make them livable in twenty Eighteen is just so prohibitively expensive and then you're still struck with the older house I guess to me that's the fundamental question though is if you own it\nShould you have the right to do what you want with it including tearing it down now

that mean that that it has to stand there forever for one for seven\nStay in there forever for one for seven nine nine one six twenty let's talk to 'em dead in Waukesha Tedra WTO O. J. hello\nHello I'm I'm thinking if there were a fence on preserving that the house why don't they on some of the money to help them um remodeled at\nAll but the truth is he doesn't want to remodel it he he doesn't\nHe he doesn't want to live and he wants to live in a more modern house he he wants to location\nBut he he doesn't want that house because the way it's situated it doesn't have enough uses a lake and even if you spend a million dollars she still going to have a Ninety seven year old house I think that's I don't want to put words in the guy's mouth but that's my guess he wants a new house on that a lot\nAnd I agree if you bought it ... it can be whatever you want it but it wants to put in a book on\n'em or or offer to buy him out but I don't\nI don't think that's what I mean let's be honest I mean he he went through this I mean I think he knew with these issues were his plan is I Want this lot and this is what makes this issue so so interesting to me I mean is it is it different because this is a house that's built by a famous architect the house that my my former house\nWas in the national registry of historic homes because again to approve the architect was um but it was an older house that had a lot of you know whenever you try to do improvements\nThey would always cost you three times as much now I never considered tearing down the house I I Love the older house and things like that but I Am sympathetic but when you live in one of these older houses\nEverything you want to do it three times as much trouble speech as much money in this particular case the guy is saying hey I Love the law to this is where I Want to be but I just I Want a new house should have the right to do that for one for seven nine nine one six twenty let's talk to Christine in Cedar broke Hi Christine\nHi Ariel I'm well thank you what do you think about all this well you know we\nWere looking at you know\nBut doing improvements in upgrades and stuff like that you\nCan regulate um but when you do you do know I understand the gentleman own\nHouse now but how many times you hear about you know they they little how is the correct\nGiant Norman mansion right that affect other people you know value on their somebody had to you know it\nYou know if you didn't do this you maybe somebody else and I looked a little harder\nOr do you think All right do you think though that if you buy an older house that is in in ... as a story elements to it this case because the architect but his you needs a million dollars in upgrading you you shouldn't have the right to tear it down but that that helps them to stay there forever until it falls down\nWould probably have to walk away and say you don't mind them on the money and you know start looking at the community\nYou know people keep them correct they don't come in here down otherwise you're generic communities and it would have no or\nYou pay for their ration okay nothing I guess I I I ...\nAnd I understand there is the value of preservation and I I understand there's history I also look at property rights and I guess it's sort of like well if\nIf you have a house that really you know people can't live in right now because of all faiths physically you could live in it um but you you know you've got a million ... a house that's a million six that doesn't have the right situation for the views of the lake you've got the house that doesn't have air conditioning the plumbing all rusted out\nUm it's going to cost a million dollars to just upgraded even then you're going to have the problems at some point in time it gets to me if the choices are All right we're going to make you spin won an extra million dollars to upgrade this property so now the house is going to be worth more than I could ever possibly you could ever possibly get out of it\nAnd you're still going to have this older house that isn't situated right or since you bought it\nYou know you got it you get the right to do what you want with it now I Do think it is a reasonable requirement to say All right before you hear this down you've got to market this you know you've got to see if there's somebody else is going to come in and is willing to take this and to preserve it I guess I think that's reasonable requirement but nobody's going to do this\nI think this is going to be a fascinating fight as to whether they tear this down or not\nI think property owners have rights I I Do know what he wrecks next once he tears this down I mean that's of course a whole different discussion I understand exactly what she was talking about with you know the big mansions and things like that obviously anything you've got to build has to comply with the wide variety of ordinance is they have in the new construction and stuff\nI have no problem with that at all but\nYou know the fact that he's not allowed to put it up in the first place or tear down the building that's where I have an issue it is to twenty eight track record WTO O.

little bit we know Aaron Rodgers will be bothered by the need probably at\nLeast to some extent moving forward a couple of top wide receiver sat out the last week the last couple of ... actually before the by how much healthier do you expect the Packers team to be as they head toward Los Angeles\nI think they'll get to those guys back I I really do from what I can tell 'em I I Would expect the two veteran wide receivers or Gmail and in rentals we'll be back and I also think that this could be really I think an important player to get back and that would be John erotic standard especially against a team like the rams\nWho has you know they have tremendous speed on they're receiving corps\nWayne from a you know Aaron Rodgers didn't practice today but assuming that he will play I did a lot of being made of the Packers being eight and a half point underdogs like the ... the very famous for one of his lines that were nobodies under dog if you want to go back a few years\nHow much is being treated in the locker room is it is it being viewed as a slap in the face\nYou know I think they like it I think they are the players kind of like the promotion Williams especially like the under dog tag and likes to be challenged by that I mean these are the rams they're seven and they're playing at home they just won three in a row on the road\nUm this is the best team in the league right now\nI'm not saying they're going to be by January but they certainly are right now and the actors prior to that by they weren't playing their best foot all they know that and they're determined that they will play their best but going forward\nSee these teams about a season goes along I'd hate to be in the position of the rams except that they have great talent but I don't know if they can hold that edge all the way through the play offs into a deep January and February to the Superbowl but we'll have to say\nAre they more dangerous a team the rams on our fence or on defense\nBut I think on off as they have so many weapons they've got the top rated faster ugly now in Jared GOP Robert ... tremendous speed so to uh cooks the wide receiver and they're not going to have their third wide receiver in their ah Cooper corrupt because of an injury doesn't appear like you'll play this week anyway but\nThey've got a lot of speed and then they have the best running back of the game talked early or you know he's a little better than a year earlier because he's a much better receipt they do a lot of things that are that they're well coached creative uh they're they're going to show you ... almost every single clay and a couple of times are going to hand it that wide receiver or running back and and they usually get a big play out\nYou know when I Know there's been lapses on defense but here we sit going into we gave you look in the Packers are on the top half the league in most defensive categories I think good defense give up ... points weekend and we go to bears gave up thirty points to the patriots and\nYou just look at the scores throughout the week the league gonna given week everybody's given up points here\nGreg you can't you can't base defensive rankings on ... my pet and was talking about this last week he thinks that's the stupidest thing where you do is you know write these defenses on ...\nDefense today is different it's not like the two thousands when\nA Baltimore had that great defense it's not like the eighty five heirs you're not going to see those kinds of ... at the numbers that's not how defenses quite in this new age of NFL football because the rules have changed because they can't play at the same way and it's not just the tackling a quarterback it's everything that goes on down field\nSo defense today I I think where you've got to look at these guys are pressuring the quarterback or you foresee um office but are you good in the red zone are you denying that forcing teams feel goals instead of\nA you know touched down through the red zone turnovers you're forcing turnovers these are the things you look forward if that's what race fat and then of course in the end points allowed a that's huge\nWayne so speaking of Jared off how do you get pressure on them I mean Reggie Gilbert Nick Perry claimed that he was just not bringing a lot of pressure it could be the first time in a long time that no one on the Packers ends of season in double digits sacks how'd you ratchet up the pressure on this rain well off and\nYou know ... the here's the problem I'm John\nYou know my cat and can do some of the blessing that he was doing right before the uh the by weak and but against this team then you're you're asking your players down fielded quarterbacks\nTo cover one on one against the speed I think that the speed that that uh Los Angeles has on the outside forces you to play at least one probably to stay high which means you're not going to be able to blitz with those defensive back you're going to have to get it\nFrom your perimeter people on the second level or on the defensive line and you're exactly right they've not been able to do that if you come back if you look at the Packers\nStats or sex they they look pretty good sixteen sector among the league leaders are in that regard but the fact is if you watch the Packers we all know they're not getting as much pressure on the quarterback is they would like\nThe voice of the Packers Wayne Larrivee thank you ... have a great day guys\nAll right you to use about your money on this Tuesday\nHey guys All right you to news about your money on

cost a Thirteen year old in ... in western Wisconsin I wanted to get some perspective from law enforcement earlier today I spoke to Joel dined former Glendale police officer\nAnd one of the founders of ... as the security solutions so it's been a week since Jamie costs was found missing her parents murdered a no sign of her in in that week how much tougher as it very good resolution when that kind of time has passed\nWell I tell you what being involved in these specially when you're looking for someone being it's you know an elder alert or a or a missing child or whatever\nEach case is really different because there's so many circumstances involved and\nAnd I guess that's the real important part especially is in law enforcement was you know it was so important for all law enforcement and the support staff and other agencies to be on the same page\nWith information because obviously we don't know all the information and there might be clues but they can't give that up to the public in a lot of cases because\nYou know it would a compromise the investigation\nI Want to ask you about that very little information released here I Know there's frustration I've heard from people and Baron county because of that but that's a critical component to keep the investigation tied to the vest and not given information to possible suspects isn't it why is it important that very little information be released\nYeah John that's a great question and sometimes and I get a there's a lot of emotion and this is law enforcement we want to find that person especially a child you know more than anybody but\nWhat do we have information that you know is in a cave and I'll give you an example even other jurisdictions might be wanting to help when I was involved in one was social media where\nYou know let's put that missing person out on our social media and we didn't want that because we were trying to attract a person and just kind of you know it was actually it was a a run away and we wanted to kind of\nGet that person safely 'cause we thought she was probably with some other people that she shouldn't be and uh you know that was a big part of it so I mean it's always what we've always done in law enforcement we try to do is\nAlways check with the lead agency before you go pro active on anything and sometimes you know we we tell that to the media too and sometimes some of them don't like that answer but I mean number one for us is the integrity of the investigation and we just do not want to jeopardize it\nJoel dine ISP security solutions is with us out to visit for law enforcement when kids are involved oh it's oh it's\nEvolved oh it's oh it's it's extremely tough I mean law enforcement work people\nAnd uh you know and we care about the community that's why we get in the law enforcement and uh you know I was a tear officer to for many years so I saw a fifth graders every day and when you see a kit missing you know that age I mean it's tough and\nAnd I'll tell you what I can guarantee this I'm not but law enforcement is working countless hours on and off the books on this one to to try to solve this case because that's just that's how law enforcement works they give it a hundred and ten percent all the time especially when it comes to the missing kids\nJoel Thirteen hundred chips this was a small department in a rural county how do you go about processing Thirteen hundred different ships coming in from all over the place\nWell that's where the more comes in and obviously I don't know specifics but you know I Know that other agencies will assist and and that's what this great about law enforcement the federal state and local level\nI'm sure there's been calls and they're like what can we do um and and I'm and with multiple jurisdictions helping that's all you do it I mean it's teamwork and and the law enforcement and and obviously you know with you know even volunteers et cetera and if that's something that they need\nLike I said hey you know every case is different but that's what you switch to support is so important\nTwo thousand people in a search today Joe I Want to be sensitive when I asked this question but everybody's kind of talking about it that's a lot of people in a large area they say they're looking for evidence could they also be looking for her\nYou know I don't know I I have no idea and that's you know what John just I'll tell you what in from that area originally myself I'm a northern Wisconsin boy they'll they'll they'll get two thousand people I think I mean people really care about their community everywhere but especially in smaller communities\nSo I have no idea what they're looking for but uh you know hopefully whatever it is you know the soil\nJoel dine former
