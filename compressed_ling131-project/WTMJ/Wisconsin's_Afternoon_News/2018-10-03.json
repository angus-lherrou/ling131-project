a lot of phone field so that he definitely my for them for sure [noise]\n... energy or just to have fun I mean and I don't think there's any extra effort to show emotion I think it comes natural I think the games and the intensity and the situations bring it out of you or I don't think you're going to the game today we're going to show\nThis much more emotions or not he saw that from us down the stretch on the became a meaningful and we were in the race for the division and uh everything that played out but yeah it's exciting time I'm Glad it being a embrace you know you're not really you're not trying to show anybody yet but it's just\nIt's just what it brings out the atmosphere brands that in a lot of fun to be part of\nStephanie up in the right [noise] but then\nHow important is if we got to have game line here tomorrow at Miller Park and how much ... feet off the excitement of the fans here at Miller Park you have in the past ... tomorrow game\n\n[laughter]\nYeah I mean the

I mean it's a really in depth conversation it's something that's going to take a lot longer than the time we have here to\nExplain but um no I mean I stuck with what I've been doing my entire career within a few adjustments but a focusing on a launch angle is not one of them um there were some but uh that that wasn't one of them [noise]\n\nAh I think it's just learning yourself more as a player um I think it's you know learning what you do and you're successful and knowing what you do in a\nStruggle and trying to maximize those stretches when when you're feeling good and really try and get to the bottom of it when you're not you're not feeling good and short now stretches and I think you that's the goal I think every years to get better as a player and\nI learned something about
