day here in Chinatown hey you know the Packers as long as they have Aaron Rodgers we're always going to be known as a past first team but I was surprised when I read that they're dropped back rate so that pass attempt Saxon scrambles Seventy one percent this year that's the highest in the ten\nEleven years Aaron Rodgers has been quarterback do they need to run the ball more\nI think so I mean and you look at the office of output that they've had that sense it's been okay at times it's been abysmal and you don't really have\nThe wide receivers that you used to have especially healthy wide receivers everybody was able to practice today everyone on the fifty three man roster was able to get out there and that's a first but with some of the injuries that they've had they've really only have three wide receivers that going into the season had any experience\nIn a rental car drawn to mow Allison and dumped a Adams and all three of them have spent time getting banged up so it would be incumbent upon the Packers in my opinion to try to run the ball Aaron Jones after being suspended for the first two which is really kind of come on and just hasn't gotten that many attempts so that to me is a bit surprising\nYou know call me greedy Doug I just want to see a full and complete game plan B ... it seems like the Packers of a sizable deficit that they have a few games it it sort of take them out of their game plan and they've been forced to pass the ball\nYeah that's a big part of it as well but again they they haven't used one to set up the other very effectively so far this season and when they do get into those deficits as you know Greg I mean you're right I mean that they're forced\nTo throw the ball but honoring that whole game plan it starts in the first half and that's you you're really not seeing a whole lot of that and\nI'm In the second half that's ... and and it's great to have a quarterback that has the ability to make the comebacks that Aaron Rodgers has been able to make not only this year you look at the game a couple of weeks ago the last game that they played against San Francisco but throughout the course of his career he's been amazing at that\nUm but again I think that they've got the weapons on often just for whatever reason haven't been doing to them and Mike mccarthy I'm a little bit about that thing you know maybe we do need to uh that was to run in and get\nYou know a feature back in there that and I'm paraphrasing obviously and to get a feature back in there that um you know can carry the rock on three downs instead of maybe having this three man rotation that doesn't seem to be working very well\nIt does what's it feel like it a lot of that I think the players all do that the Packers are underdogs going into this gay and like the current even kind of joked about it but why does moved at Penn the rams are hot there are defeated or the Packers are a little second would hide is there a sense of confidence in the locker room\nNot really I mean and I don't know that there should be there is a sense of what we know what's up against us we know what the schedule looks like a head of us but in speaking with math is it's not like he's going to come right out and saying that\nUh you know look I don't think we can beat the rams no one would say that in the locker room I didn't get the sense that anyone that I talked to today was overly confident about going up against a team that if you look at every statistical category and often there in the top five\nWhether it's points scored points a or a total offense rushing passing their the top five in all of those categories plus they also the top ten overall defense\nThe rams are seven ... team for a reason\nYou talked about it on Monday and the segment a Greg they don't have really any real blaring deficits and\nThe Packers do they know that they know their schedule looks like and they know how important it is to try to pull one out in Los Angeles I mean it's it's going to be a whole task especially going out to the west coast to try to do that\nWGM Jay's Doug Russell with us from Green Bay thank you Doug\nThanks guys and the November eleventh game it's a gold

continue to look for new information and suspects in those explosive devices that were mailed out or to several places on the east coast US Congressman mark Bowe can I spoke to him earlier today shortly after the news broke\nSo developing story today explosive devices apparently sent to some members of Congress to former presidents Obama and Clinton household is this where we are when it comes to discourse in disagreement and our nation\nThis is a exactly what's wrong with the current level of discourse really coming from the president on down yeah I was at a high school this morning one of the questions asked was about bipartisanship how we can work together\nIf students in high school can get it people in Congress and certainly president should get it and I don't think it helps when the president has clever nicknames for people and kind of goes after him in a very colorful uh reality star way because this clearly has prompted people to do things\nThat aren't uh how you have discourse in this country so um I Would just hope we can all find a way to disagree without being disagreeable\nYou know to be fair congressmen it's it's Cory Booker and its others I mean it's on both sides of the aisle isn't it\n[noise] well the biggest megaphone in the country is the president right and when you have nicknames like lying this or Pocahontas or some of the rhetoric we have about a people in general that doesn't help a U.S senator get maybe a hundred of the coverage of member of Congress gets about one five hundred of the coverage of the president gets a lot\nAnd I said everyone has to do that but you know when you are waiting to um the number of people that President treats do everyday uh he has to learn how to be presidential because George Bush did it and ... did it and Ronald Reagan did it and Bill Clinton did it I think Donald Trump learns needs to learn how to do it\nHey are you ever nervous is your staff ever wrist\nNeeds to learn how to do it hey are you ever nervous is your staff ever received threats are kind of creepy weird stuff because of the environment we live in\nYeah I mean absolutely in fact I think a couple of years ago when there was a shooting a baseball field in in Washington DC uh we got some additional resources for our offices and you know even now I\nWalk by someone you know little cubicle and they had a picture of someone that has threatened the office so they have to be ready to do with that person looks like just in case again that's not just course that's not how you get things done\nPresident Obama will be in Wisconsin later this week President Trump is here today the highest approval ratings he's ever had although it's still underwater and most of the polls are talking about the president's Trump to Wisconsin today and what that means to the dynamic in the competitive races we have\nWell you know it's interesting I I've watched he's very strategic when he shows up so he is trying to have an influence of the state and he's twice within Minnesota to watch that in some races there to\nUh so you know it's going to get both sides I think motivated right a lot of the people who aren't happy with the direction the country will be motivated 'cause he's here are people who support the president will be motivated and you don't my bottom line is if we have the highest turnout ever no matter what the results are we're going to have better results that if people didn't go out and vote\nSo if this helps to increase turnout from whom ever ah I think that's a good thing and ah you know having both presidents here and I think next week they've got a bunch of people coming\nOr anything that can get people involved the Democratic process\nUh helps make the elections and our governing a more credible\nCongress and mark ... is with us I Want to ask you congressman one question about the caravan is making its way through Mexico it's likely to be here uh not before election day probably should we punish the Central American nations where these immigrants have originated\nWell you know actually I I look at it almost a little bit differently um I've been to solve it for example where\nThey have a lot of violence if we go back a couple of decades that violence was exported ah from the United states when we had gangs in the LA area and we send people to solve it or what we need to do is help those countries a deal with the violence in those countries that people don't\nFully and then try to come into the United states so you know rather than taking away any assistance I think we should cooperatively working with them to deal with the violence in their countries\nBecause look it's not people from Mexico coming across the border it's a hunter and all of it or in Guatemala so clearly a the violence seems to be the issue I think if we dealt with the violence you'd be dealing with the fact\nThat as US Congressman mark Spokane let's go to one of his colleagues US Congressman speaker of
