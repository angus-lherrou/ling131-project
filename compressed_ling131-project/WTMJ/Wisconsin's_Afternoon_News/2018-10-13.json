know that\nMatch up of baseball's hottest teens and this is there a preview of the end they'll say yes and actually just to show you how I'm the president this is these days you know one of the better ones that I've seen\nWhat do you do when you have a match up they ask between the league's best team\nAnd the most talented team\nNow if you don't know which is which they're referring to the brewers as the NFL's bass\nThe Dodgers as the most talented\nAny true blue ... wait a minute we're the we're the most talented team we're the most wins well you know it doesn't always work\nThat way and in fact\nThe brewers are certainly the hottest team a bomb on us or the Dodgers that you know they did with attitude down the stretch as well but the ... of course one of those living in a row since ... through the playoffs a sweeping the Rockies but what they are talking about is\nWhen you look at the statistics you would think the Dodgers would have somewhere between a hundred and five and a hundred and ten wins I'm completely serious about that they don't if they got Ninety two is what they finish the regular season with and they of course have to go through the tie breaker as well in fact\nThey led the national league\nIn most runs scored and fewer ... runs a loud so ... what is called is the one differential\nParental the number of runs scored versus a number of runs they allowed one hundred and Ninety for the ... one differential Ninety five which is actually a lot healthier there was even late in the season that was in the mid thirties was the ...\nSo they you know\nYou have seen that improvement download which makes sense with that but the hot streak that they had\nBut they're still not a really haven't been scoring machine and [laughter] without bullpen didn't really matter I mean they got timely hits\nYell at you for all the MVP thought that\nThe timeliness of his hands or you know as much as the statistics themselves so this is a pretty classic match up you have a red hot team which\nA school related story and there's pretty good chance you've already heard it\nIt is the story about short what high cancelling a schedule production of to kill a mocking bird\nBecause they got word of planned protest because the production would include\nJust reading a little bit here from the journal sentinels coverage when shirt with a high school chose to kill a mocking bird is this yours animal park place either relevant commentary empathize based on the Harper Lee classic up on a white southerner lawyer defending it is a black man in the thirties\nBut

just hours before the curtain was to go up sure what Hansel the production in response to a planned protest over the use of the N. word in some scenes\nThis does not fall cleanly as the journal sentinel accurately points out between ... on racial lines\nThis ticked off at this for one reason or another those who were upset about the presence of the words that this is what we want is\nWe just we just wanted the word omitted you didn't have to cancel the production\nAnd then there are those who say the word shouldn't have been omitted\nInto context it helps people understand what the world look like when her truly I I don't remember the exact you're Nineteen sixty ... wrote to kill a mocking bird of course it's set in her childhood years\nSo you have that\nEveryone pretty much is disappointed\n... was saying you know internally Charlotte Hi we address the sensitivity of the issue but we didn't do that well enough to the community so there are a zillion things you can call in about after nine o'clock okay\nMaybe three\nShould they have canceled it should they have admitted the word\nWhat about the whole notion of bending\nTo this threat\nWhatever the right and wrong as is it a whole separate issue said bands of the threat\nOf the protests will get to that\nThe next hour eight fifty eight\nNews radio double duty I'm J. N. L. C. S. friday morning Wisconsin\nIn for jet lag there but here at this time slot because Steve's defeat will be at Miller Park starting at noon or of course building to gain one of the NFL's yes All right\nLet's talk about this they acted in mortgage talking tax line for one for seven nine nine one six twenty over they have a thoughtful taxed on this story you may have heard that you follow the news at all you probably have\nShort what high school was to begin the production a multi evening production of to kill a Mockingbird last evening\nHours before that was to happen it was canceled\nWhen schools up the hold on one school officials learned the planned protests because the production would use the N word\nAnd there there are those in the community who are offended by that\nNow there are at least two I think important elements to this story\nShould people take offense to that word what ever it's used even in historical context to make a point and\nWhat message does that send them to school\nIn in fear of protests\nCancelled the production which means if I don't like what you're going to say I'll say I'm going to protest you and you will shot out\nAnd I quite frankly didn't understand the scope of the controversy I knew there were efforts around the country to band the book I didn't know there had been so many successful efforts to ban but as we come considered an American classic\nIf you read the journal sentinel story\nPretty clear that this is not everybody is\nFalling into what might be considered the usual ... winds here\nThe school district said in the same we concluded that the safest option is to cancel the play\nThe decision has angered and disappointed students and parents on both sides of the debate that was never a request we ask for the word to be admitted to patients Philips the mother of three African American students involved in the protest\nI understand that the children put a lot of work into this place she says this doesn't create a dialogue it causes more of a division\nStacey civil had two children in the play both of whose character's over the slur\nShe called the production of the most pointed she'd seen this at the school says there's going to use the slower start important conversation with her children so\nGreat loss to the community she's out of the cancellation this play is a warning of what happens if we don't change our ways and it's a message of hope that young people might be the reason things change\nAnd they've had other controversial performances before Spring Awakening year in town rent and others that as the paper puts it push boundaries\nShort with officials recognize this potential landmines and attempted to brace parents and students from the beginning of the cast was first elected they issued a statement and here it is is from their website\nTo kill a mocking bird which takes place in Alabama in the Nineteen thirties reflects a difficult an ugly time in American history fanatic issues of racism and segregation or prevalence of listen carefully to this next line\nTo accurately and honestly complete the narrative\nEmphasis I repeat the\nAnd honestly come sleep the narratives\nThe N. word will be used in the production\nThe fact that our society still struggles to truly embrace racial equality symbolizes that our work is not yet done and the Harper Lee's mocking bird is as relevant in twenty Eighteen as it was in Nineteen sixty when the story was published here comes another word\nOur fidelity to the production of this play\nOur fidelity\nTo the production of this play from the Nineteen thirties does not condone the use of the N. word in any contacts for example and musical are friendly banter or discussions today said this is not in any way a validation are saying it's OK to use that word in in in common conversation\nIt needs to be there to fully understand\nThat the contacts that was intended\nWhat do you think\nCalled the actor that mortgage talking tax line for one for seven nine nine one six twenty four one four seven nine nine one six twenty\nNine Thirteen news radio WGM jak nine Fifteen okay nine sixteen news radio that lead T. M. J.\nFor one for seven nine nine to one six twenty\nShort what high school cancels the production of to kill a mocking bird because the ... threats of protests over the N. word\nShould they have canceled it should they have taken the word out\nOr should they have said look protests aren't going to stop us from doing what we're going to do\nWe go first to a longtime listener of my show and my former radio incarnation sham it a little boy and a Happy Friday and my friends\nAre happy right in my friend who is always good to hear your when you get a ... director talents on the air [noise] um my current\n[noise] um [noise]\nWhat's the what do you think if if they had done the film one forward and for the production and hurt a fan of tight that I've known for example some school districts will fill a review and and read a\nMark Twain's classic hot yeah because the Huck Finn and of course if you know one of the characters that have become friends with as a black man who happens to be a flavor which has referred to as an worry jam and in the context of it but they but they won't ... release it and refer to them as ...\n... ... and it doesn't seem to lose its edge in terms of the context of the plane the main or does the points they'll get across cleaned up a little bit and would that be the case here and and kill a mocking bird\nSee and that's that really use the sixty four thousand dollar question isn't in Santa let me go back to the statements now this is a statement they put on the Web site before the controversy about that a\nShoot accurately and honestly completes the narratives\nI think in this case and I and I don't know about Twain but I think in this case Tim\nYou are attempting to sanitize and you're diluting the whole point that Harper Lee I think was making at the time people used to use that word freely that was wrong you can use this as a teaching experienced look this is the way it was back then and I think you run into a serious danger\nGetting your thoughts on that for one for seven nine nine one six twenty\nThe hacking at mortgage talk and text line\nJanelle on the east side says they should have canceled a Janelle Hi you're on WGM Jay\nBy I really appreciate you taking my call 'em and science and trying to think about 's last night after I had a story about the law if I'm Out here and they really mean point like make as to why I think unfortunately\nIt scored only realistic and wants to cancel the play on the first one and the fact that I think there is a very big difference between underage liners performing as plain and pain that's word versus acts of where I Know they're out for something else like that I Would not killing the Democrats and\nUm and then secondly I'm an or something like that they're not the kind of difficult especially for like a white person can't really at that is that uh the owners of being a particular word really godfather to those people who do word historically large in life\nIt's not really my first one to pay that\nThat way I understand the historical importance and I think it can it specially important story to us or is it now and especially at that age and they should read the story when they read it they should read the story with the word in it but when it comes to perform and what\nI mean I I have to think what about the kitten a play that on the ... the role that say that word what are the repercussions to them\nSo I think it's unfortunate and I think a lot of adults ... along the way and saying like maybe we shouldn't have thought\nGiven the fact that people clearly debt\nCeiling could be offended by it I think that's really the only option to fight the capital\nWell but if people are offended by it then isn't their choice not to go\nTo certainly certainly that and I think that really do um also include that point obese are under age kept her for me that's like and it's going to be repercussions clearly regardless if performer there if they don't\nEat it really got a whole range sensitive equation when you're talking about the fact that it's about to high school or a cat fights with adult again I have a different opinion if we're talking about the rap but bunch Andre in her climate and the thing that I guess incendiary\nFastest on a holiday on ... it's not a good idea to every her catches that could be a a unintended really\nIs you know lots of the call appreciate it a huge who I Would say to that\nBecause she made some good points she she does\nIt was I mean I certainly agree with it didn't start early but she made some good points as for not being adults I you know and the repercussions well All right if they're going to fish repercussions for using the word in a place then that's a whole new lesson I think the the school district has to teach\nAnd and I look I understand what you're saying about those who would be offended and I said this as a white person there are things I cannot understand [noise] let me ask you this though\nIf the school was going to put on a play\nBased in World War two the Pacific see us her\nTend to please script use a word for Asians that I'm not going to say on the air the search would GE\nOr three letter iteration of Japanese that I'm not going to say on the air should that be expunged even though we know darn well because my dad was one of them soldiers in the south Pacific\nHe was in in the army air corps but soldiers in the south Pacific certainly used that language\nShould we just pretend they did\nYou know and and when you make a decision and I understand what you're saying we can't understand the offense\nBut I think if you\nUnderstand that yes well it's the kids singles things they are rules they're actors in my senior Seventeen\nStudents can't differentiate that then the math and don't we maybe have another problem\nTo mark\nIn ... during the I'm Jay\nYou know I really wanted to touch on the protesting part of things as another caller mentioned or you know it when he went a little far with paying a fair protests and and my role and all that\nUm I I think they did the right thing and ... to play because that is just because of that effective dumb people doesn't mean it's quite offensive to other people but the\nThe non violent protesting when I feel that there's there's something wrong that needs to be righted I cannot fathom wrap my mind around the fact that we seem to be shifting away from viewing non violent protests as the proper way to handle things you know especially with things like ... and just\nI'm not advocating for violence I think we should be doing non violent protests but then we get all this for a bottle of people complaining about non violent protests well what do you expect people to do when they feel that there is a wrong and they have to speak out and say something about that I thought protest or was\nThe the right thing to do that how you're supposed to handle a situation like that is non violently and peacefully protest if we can't do that what do we ... what other its course it's their right to stand up for what is right and what we believe in to to group up and say hey this is wrong and we think they should change\nWell let me say this market they believed it was going to be non violent I Know that there was any reason to believe otherwise I should have a lot of the protest to continue and played both to continue that would be my opinion but apparently\nThey were concerned for whatever reason that the protests would be something I guess I'm married and they they thought was manageable but I where I Would say this I think I and I think maybe you and I are on the sensation mark things lots of the cops that\nWell they just you just wrapped it together really well because\nIf they thought that you just said the reason that they didn't do it because they thought the protests will be too much to handle that that seems like the exact opposite reason if anything they think that while there's the fact that people really don't like that that's the reason why we should call the play all\nNight long ago was that\nIf I disagree with that mark ... lots of the call but I disagree with that that you're going to cancel something because some people don't like\nBoy I cannot disagree with that more\nBecause that is the essence of free speech\nBut some people do in fact and remember the school board is a government\nSo you can argue that are limiting free speech here\nBased on concerns of some in the population are we still have a lot of people don't want to talk on this we will stay on this\nFor one for seven nine nine one six twenty an accurate mortgage talking text line\nMine forty two news radio WGM Jay lovers or center hosts the national league championship series at Miller Park is this a ... team in the history of the franchise sees\nThe ways in from where else Miller Park one of those southern this afternoon a\nHard topic to say the least for one for seven nine nine once it's plenty to act in the mortgage talk intact flying I live we had an excellent variety of calls on every angle of this issue shore with a high canceling scheduled productions\nOf to kill a mocking bird because they got word on social media of hotels over the use of the N word\nThey had options they could have just tried to ...\nTried to have a conversation with the community and say look if if you're offended\nUnderstand this is why we think it's important and they did on their website but apparently didn't get the word out enough to accurately and honestly complete the narrative the N. word will be use I think that is absolutely fair\nThey could have taken the word out they didn't feel that that would be right to do that\nJust you know the heck was that we're going to we're going to do this and we'll be able to protest they could have taken the word out I disagree with that or cancel a really don't I certainly don't agree with that\nI don't do they fear violent protests and and if so why go\nTo Dave in the wall but tell us a day by your auntie I'm Jay\nHey good morning I'm Glad I don't live in sure but I think it's ridiculous to careful when I'm In if we if it's a binary option leaving the word in or here calling them who work at a good look at it it was there to kill a mocking bird a classic story\nUm their word to me is a very small part of the story it's really about to say this person is a lower class citizens this person is a record low bait I mean there's lots of things that could have been used other than the N. word\nAnd and it's especially timely with the cabinet on trial I mean if you kill a mocking bird is really good exact story that math governor here you know so it's it's a classic it's very timely but I think it was ... you're they're cancelling three hours before\nOr you know grandma to come into town um everybody was ready yeah\nFor the art I mean we ... you know it's the same thing where\nA cavity are is what you get a crucifix and you're that's really offensive I don't know what are you guys are getting it art whatever they want to argue\nThat weren't even everyday and hip hop culture I every foreigner I

of American culture the thought but we are just running rampant\nGay face lots of the call appreciate it to Alex in Lake Geneva Alex go ahead\nA ah my\nDid we think we dropped Paluck says sorry about that that does happen modern technology is great to accept you know when it's not too out in Escanaba, Michigan our do at\nFirst I thought I Wonder how many people who have ever read to kill a mocking bird is a great literature they're calling it an array of the south\nBut you know and that there should not an apple a yes got to be that there are a word even though the thought that would have been an accurate I would've stopped at a bar I think if you're on the way I guess I kind of\nWhat is calling attention to the right I mean you know that aren't in the south\nI guess ... ... says we're going down back years a product better girl\nShould we not although the you know that you're jumped in order to help you know when the war I mean this is out of control it's out of control every ... or ... or your sugar not ethical but boy\nI A L think slot for the call appreciate it going to handle some tax um isn't just a minute and then on to other things were going to close the phone to this point\nI think it's just a lot of really good calls all on them every aspect of the issue and that's the way like I'm going to works out but I Will wrap up on this in a couple of minutes temp for teen news radio definitely T. M. J.\nSeventeen Jerry Vader in for Jeff Flake during Steve skippy these time slot because the will pick it up at noon from Miller Park and of course the animals she asked a game on tonight\nI Want to share some tax on the story that we have been on for over an hour now just a ton of really interesting calls I thought\nThe short would hide decision to cancel a production of to kill a mocking bird because of threatened protests over the use of the N word\nKevin and mosquito Jerry what is the standard to have ... possible protest you and I let her group's protests say a transgender bathroom policy I'm sure we would be told the pounds saying this is a shame the school ... the production should have gone on as is\nThe only way to be better in the future is to learn from the past which is what the production within about that that\nAnd that's you know where the rubber meets the road here I think he is and we not share the way things used to be input and contacts I have this ah for for example there were people who were upset that women weren't portrayed more liberal and advertising\nIn Mad Men and the producers came back yeah\nIt's really women\nDid ... there were all sorts of barrier to answer to that profession now that's not to say there weren't some women who didn't accomplish but on whole\nBut Mad Men tried to show is it was a real battle\nThen Andrew in Greenfield scrubbing historical context are you downplaying the ugliness of past racism my position is yes\nI I think that is exactly right if you slow down offensive words are actions from a historical context that in a sense makes the race is not seen as bad as they were that's just an outstanding points by including the full ugly contacts\nYou get a better sense of why this is wrong I Will put it this way if you're not willing to take the heat on this then I wouldn't schedule it I wouldn't choose it\nBecause you probably should have had some kind of census would happen\nIt's a very thoughtful and compelling explanation of the time listeners of race relations and fidelity to the work what's the point if you're going to just cancel it\nWith a drama teachers\nWhat's the drama teachers rather need to do is to write an original play based on this very debate call it mocking bird kill\nTony pie in Bloomfield Colorado formally Brookfield and he says go brewers\nUh let's see I disagree with the person who was planning the protest saying that cancelling the play stops communication on the subject a protest is not communication vote in the way it is I Know I get it but in a way it is\nOr did the protesters\nI'm not going to see their sex broke up and look at the practice of requests to conversation did they suggest holding town meetings prior to the play a\nAfter the play\nYeah that was the other thing why just at the last minute threatened protests\nThose who suppress or ignored historical facts tax another listener are doomed to repeat said history\nThat that is what I think you're doing in an earlier caller said a lot of history has been whitewashed which by the way I Do not disagree\nBut says that mean and the answer to that whitewashing is more whitewashing\nA another ... this is simply another version of the mob shutting down thoughts they're intolerant up no critical thinking haired or creativity\nThese works of literature offer opportunities to teach and discuss complex issues they'd rather tell people what to think and teach them how to think\nVery very well put\nA next actually short with high school could even make the semesters class work of writing a said mocking bird kill plays weighing and again I Would almost guaranteed this'll gotten the support from the community\nI should just makes a really good point I don't know if he or she uh next n word should have the news the end of the production could have presented the students feelings about the word oh\nOh a conversation afterwards\nThat wouldn't have been really act and the students who are the mouth that word\nFeelings about the word and what they would like to see happen in their community to bring unity\nIt's about that have you're not skin color the website information prior to the production because of the added the importance of the students talking about this lesson\n[noise] I mentioned this earlier but I Will say it again that's really the irony here\nThe purpose to sense of purpose and what was accomplished by Harper Lee writing this book\nIt was to expose using Nineteen thirties for example she wrote it in Nineteen sixty imagine what would have happened\nIf she attempted to make it contemporary to the south\nI don't think it ever would have gotten published\nAnd she was however using even then a historical and remember it's not set even in Nineteen sixty it's set in the Nineteen thirties\nAnd we are either going to as a society say look you know there there are things in our past we\nWe don't tolerate any more but not pretend that they weren't there\nAnd I do think it's a very very dangerous\nRoad to go down [noise]\nIt seems with every passing day\nThere was a story that just saddens me\nAbout where we are as a society\nWe have become we

Wonder why stories like this or Huckleberry Finn or even brought up anymore walked purpose do they serve and are they teaching people a word that they might not have ever known if we can should we be able to try to be a limiting the use of these words altogether\nWell as other callers have pointed out Chris ... it's\n... it's used heavily in some areas of our culture so it's never going to go way but in terms of because something in historical context contain something that's offensive today ... why do open that door Chris how far do you do\nIn saying\nAnd I know they're all sorts of theories of how we have gotten here as a society many people assign blame to the abortion issue\nHave to admit I used to reject the notion\nThat I actually think there is something to that but setting that

amazing incredible unprecedented run\nMy four oh one K. stuff and and my IRA stuff this is through the roof\nCompared to where they were just a couple of years ago\nYou know the temptation can be great\nOh man you know do I want to start over again on this stuff\nWell what if it's going to do it what if it gets into correction territory or worse\nThe dial some of the other markets already have\nMy guess is that is I I don't think you're going to see\nI guess\nAnything that resembles a major major continuation of this\nI think the big debate is here's the fed moving too fast the economy that the major fundamentals are outs standing right now\nThe reality is now however I feel about Donald Trump's character President Trump I won't deny that his pro growth policies the things that he dances have made a difference\nEven just even just attitude if he hasn't gotten a lot of things down legislatively the pro business mentality has help\nThe economy is soaring\nThere's no dispute in that however\nIs showing economy the raising of inflation rates are raising of interest rates is to keep inflation in check and that that really has a ... so\nI think the president is being overly critical of the ... but I Do think there are a bit over a grass on and I think\nI don't know I don't know what I think but\nUh I I wouldn't be surprised if you saw a continues to drop ten fifty for

and ... really\nA cold or talking about his you know what we're not we're not going to hide it anymore to Republicans don't hide their criminal charges pet anymore so we're not gonna hide ours\nAnd my response to that is one I had been highly critical of the president's behavior and you know a lot of things getting checked off the conservative agenda doesn't change my position on that\nAnd it has a problem you have\nIs when someone who is a Republican or conservative is going to criticize behavior of the left is just you have no credibility and doing it if you just turn a blind eye to what President Trump is doing\nSo but you have here is book\nThe Democrats did not take the high road in the whole Kavanaugh\nIt got to where a guy because they didn't take the high road because one Senator Dianne Feinstein didn't do the right thing when she got the information and to and really to his number one they they demonized Brett Kavanaugh before that the allegations from Christine Blasey Ford\nThey considered him evil based on this judicial ideology or I should say philosophy\nSo that that's that's just that's not the high road\nPeggy Noonan has I think what is an excellent column on this today's Wall Street journal I Want to share it with you in a couple of minutes I Love and twenty two\nNews radio double duty and Jay luggage money for news radio W T and Jay ...\nSays he's going to run for reelection and there are about three dozen Democrats who want to run against ... is president from more popular among Republicans today that he wasn't twenty sixteen she shared his thoughts at twelve thirty five today\nJust play that clip of Michelle Obama disagreeing with Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder on well have a son to President Trump\nAnd there's a column I want to share but we can certainly take the call on this to Jeff in a while but it's also Jeff what's on your mind\nI don't know about it and knocked out of the now the Democrats are going to come out today you know they're ... they're going to start in their own hands and this and that\nAll our politicians are out of control\nLike I said before I'm a girl from a shelter come out and and you know this and that about Hillary none of them would be out there right now in jail or what the dark\nFor an hour it's all about at all about the ...\nThe Democrats are afraid of Donald Trump the the one thing\nHe has not out of a wake up on hey I can do this job\nAnd I think in the long run what year it\nThat it you know people are gonna start you're already doing it\nBut it's part of the power prior to start over or not work with her and her\nWater all that [noise]\nYou know it just takes murder you know what I thought ...\nThanks a lot for shade if I've got to get your point and and and I do appreciate it well in terms of being afraid\nHere's what I Would say\nIs they still and by ... by day I mean with the exception of Republicans have decided they were just because there was just Donald Trump no one's still knows how to navigate and they ... they teaching them and they still don't know\nThey still don't know when they're ... being played by him\nFrom a criticisms of the president that's the one thing I Do marvel\nHis people still don't understand his manipulation\nAnd whatever you think of him I tip my hat is brilliant\nHim away that he does it\nWhen he came out after the confirmation any just both barrels against Christine Blasey Ford it was clear clear why\nHe was trying to incite them into protesting and get it because they just vented outside ways\nAnd it's very very affected\nI mentioned that it's it's affected for him as I mentioned\nPeggy Noonan I has a role I consider if he's related on this I'm going to get started here will finish it up after the news\nVoices of reason and on the reason Peggy Noonan today's Wall Street journal\nWhat did the cabinet controversy tell us about our historical moment it underscored what we already know that America is politically and culturally divided and that activists and the two parties don't just disagree\nWith each other but disliked and distrust each other I Would argue bordering on hating each other and public opinion surveys bear that out\nWe also do the Supreme Court has come to be seen not only as a constitutional and inevitably political body but as a cultural body that follows cultural currents moods assumptions it has frequently brushed past the concept of democratic modesty to make decisions that was\nMost peacefully be left to the people at the ballot box after national debate\nSo citizens will experience of course as having great power over their lives and nominations to the court will inevitably draw a passion and this was a fifth can serve it of seat on a nine person court but\nFor Kavanaugh hearings had some new elements there were no boundaries of inquiry mill vowing to the idea of a private self\nAccusations were made about the wording of captions under your book for those the Senate showed a decline in public standards of acorn\nAs living a number of senators no longer even pretend to have class or imitate fairness the screaming from the first seconds of the first hearings so coordinated interruptions be insistent rudeness and\nAccusatory tones none of it looked like the workings of the order democracy that has been the envy of the world\nTo Republican senators this week wrote to me with a sound that morning one fondue amazing and terrified that seemingly without very much thought nearly half the United States Senate has abandoned the presumption of innocence in this country ball to achieve a political goal the other side of these are truly disturbing result\nOne of the great political parties abandoning the constitutionally based traditions of due process and the presumption of innocence\nVery least Senate Democrats overplay their hand [noise] want to stop there when we pick this up\nShe makes it clear that she has a bias and\nThe bias in favor of sexual assault accusers\nAnd yet she was deeply troubled by what she saw her Jeremy Jeffress the the L C houses here that with the tea Andrei live from Miller Park all day and the Dodgers kinds of tile game on\nAgainst the crew hall of famer Bob Corker on the call all postseason long and our coverage starts tonight at six thirty five\nI Want to pick up where a I'd left off\nWith Peggy Noonan space\nWhat we learned about voices of reason and on the reason and I think this tells the tale into\n... what we heard this week from Democrats while we're now it's time to get down in the gutter and my argument is really only presentation ally\nNow there's ever been like Donald Trump and I'm not believe me I'm not pretending that has been\nThat her point is\nWe need to look at them more subtle\nVoices of on reason that's a concern is as well\nThe very least Senate Democrats overplay their hand\nMy bias in cases of sexual abuse and the south and it is a bias she writes his in favor of the woman I give her words greater weight because I'm not in my personal experience seeing women lie about such allegations and I know the reasons they have in the past kept silent\nIf you know your biases and are serious you will try to be fair knocked over correct\nBut to maintain standards I September sixteenth that David charges made by Christine Blasey Ford appeared in the Washington Post I was certain that more witnesses and more information will come forward we would see where justice lay\nThe great virtue of the hash tag me too movement is that the whole phenomenon has broken open by numbers and patterns numbers of victims patterns of behavior and the deep reporting that uncovered both in this case great reporter's tried to nail down ms forward story but they did not succeed\nThe New Yorker story that followed was dramatic but I'm persuasive hand grenades who's paying cannot be pulled the final allegation about rape train parties in spite punch was not in the least credible let me stop there\nThat even less credible with Michael Evan as presidents\nAnd most people recognize that she injecting himself into this was the biggest gift Republicans got [noise]\nShe goes on\nThere was news for a story that was compelling but in need of support or cooperation it did not come\nIt was a woman who redeemed the situation Susan Collins senator from Maine and her remarks announcing her vote she showed a holy unusual respect for the American people and for the Senate itself but actually explaining her thinking others or didn't denouncing kindly of this but I go on\nUnder intense pressure her remarks were not above her emotions she weigh the evidence in contrast to say senator Cory Booker who attempted to derail the hearing some of the start\nAs the birds are added to the end I'll see us by the way a quickly or to the the the Vatican\nPositive territory few moments of do the Dow had actually the rally solve altogether and it was underwater but\nIt's a up twenty five points but it had been up much more than that it's been in a pretty steady slide since mid morning ah that's where it is right now\nJust a quick word on this a head scratcher\nThere is a democratic group it's completely new to Wisconsin\nHasn't been on anyone else's radar screen\nIt plans to spend one million dollars is is democratic group on state Senate races that it has no chance of winning heavily heavily Republican districts\nThat no one else you know I'm On the left side of the aisle\nWould even think for a second the group is forward majority going after Senate majority leader Scott Fitzgerald he won his last election was sixty three percent of the vote\nOther ... other just completely ridiculously safe\nSenator Devon limit you over for ... marathons than whether machine\nThat's sixty percent or more\nDevin limit you know I feel pretty good there are some Democrats here you think of some of the tight races up in my part of the state where I live\nFirst Senate district race Kayla Crossman sort of the incumbent I mean he's the incumbent after the special election\nBut he would love to get a piece of that\nI have no idea what they're thinking no even Democrats what are they doing\nFiction are not going to win any of these races a million bucks to what narrow margin a little bit when you've got three key races that they actually have a chance of winning it is their money not mine but man that is really hard to explain\nIt is a lemon fifty seven ... has lived at Miller Park but you're going to be talking about for

that's just a touch of envy figure [laughter] that you're hearing there\nIt's finally here it's friday gave more\nExciting stuff\nAnd that we are actually going to be talking about the ... there's just a ... and things to talk about today we'll get to as many as we possibly can we get to the [noise]\nI don't want the big story of the day it's the ... the story of the day that short what high cancelling a production of to kill a Mockingbird\nThis is a there are a lot of elements to that story it is because the production was going to use the N word\nBut boy there are a lot of periphery topics we'll get to that and just a minute but I actually am going to start with a couple of things about the Milwaukee Brewers of course gave one of\nThe NFL cs tonight at Miller Park [noise]\nTwo things I Want to talk about\nOne is right now\nIs the Wisconsin fan base more into the ... than the Packers that in just a moment first this\nOkay so I my regular show prep those involved the wall Street Journal\nAnd uh they have in the print edition\nVeil sports section if you didn't do that\nMatch up of baseball's hottest teens and this is there a preview of the end they'll say yes and actually just to show you how I'm the president this is these days there was one of the better ones that I've seen\nWhat do you do when you have a match up they ask between the league's best team\nAnd the most talented team\nNow if you don't know which is which they're referring to the ... says the NFL's bass\nThe Dodgers as the most talented\nAny true blue brewer fan base ... wait a minute we're the we're the most talented team we have the most wins well you know it doesn't always work\nThat way and in fact\nThe brewers are certainly the hottest team a bomb on us or the Dodgers that you know they did was they had to do down the stretch as well the ... of course one of those Lebanon row since you know through the playoffs a sweeping the Rockies but what they are talking about is\nWhen you look at the statistics you would think the Dodgers would have somewhere between a hundred and five and a hundred and ten wins I'm completely serious about that they don't and they got Ninety two is what they finished the regular season with and they of course had to go through the tie breaker as well in fact\nThey let the national league\nRuns scored and fewer ... runs a loud\nSo ... what is called is the one differential the number of runs scored versus a number of runs they allowed one hundred Ninety for the ... one differential Ninety five which is actually a lot healthier there was ...\nEven late in the season that was in the mid thirties was the ... so they you know\nYou have seen that improvement that mustard which made sense without the hot streak that they had but they're still not really haven't been scoring machine and [laughter] without bullpen it didn't really matter and then it got timely hits\nYell at you for all the MVP thought that the timeliness\nOf his hits or you know as much as the statistics themselves so this is a pretty classic match up you have a red hot team which\nWhen you look at statistically the Dodgers did they didn't turn out the windows that they should have turned out with the offensive production end up teaching that they've got\nSo it makes it\nA really\nMatch up\nNow I [noise] producer Jordan advertising I've had a couple of minutes you know we were both optimistic\nSometimes ... it is getting hot at the right time and it doesn't matter the sport\nYou saw that with the twenty ten Packers and they ... they were actually the super bowl favorites really in that year then they didn't look anything like it in the middle of the season and got hot when it mattered ... just got into the playoffs and then the defense really played well\nWhat you would [noise] you know you look at even against the Rockies\nLots of squandered opportunities I mean really live sort of the run differential I I I don't know you know as a season stranded on base I I don't know what their numbers are but boy you sure saw that in the Rockies series and I don't think that will get it done\n[noise] I don't know why would do something so silliest predict this\nPlant in the aggregate it'd be Clinton her show\nI just I I don't know\nIt just has that twenty ten pac or feel to me I could be totally totally all went on a speaking speaking of the Packers and the couple of minutes I Want to talk about that\nWho is number one in the hearts of sports fans are in other words we got a lot of news these stuff including who's the real education governor\nOf the short story that I mentioned and a lot more\nBut we'll just have been a few minutes on that coming up and then we'll get to was the real education governor eight forty news

you'll find I don't live far from ... up in Green Bay\nWhite now and I'm sure it's part of it because of the Packers are under performing I Am totally just\nEnded a ... way more than the Packers and my thought was\nWhen uh the folks here when we got this information to share about the events that are in our home I thought as where would I rather be\nAll right\nLet's talk about this they acted in mortgage talking tax line for one for seven nine nine one six twenty over they have a thoughtful taxed on this story you may have heard that if you follow the news at all you probably have\nShort what high school was to begin the production a multi evening production up to kill a Mockingbird last evening\nHours before that was to happen it was canceled\nWhen schools to hold on one school officials learned the planned protests because the production we use the N word\nAnd there there are those in the community who are offended by that\nNow there are at least two I think the important elements to this story\nShould people take offense to that word what ever it's used even in historical context to make a point and\nWhat message does that send that the school\nIn in fear of protests\nCancelled the production which means if I don't like what you're going to say I'll say I'm going to protest you and you will shut up\nAnd I quite frankly didn't understand the scope of the controversy I knew there were efforts around the country to band the book I didn't know there had been so many successful efforts to ban what does the\nCome considered an American classic\nIf you read the journal sentinel story they make it\nPretty clear that this is not everybody is\nFalling into what might be considered the usual ... winds here\nThe school districts that in the same as we've concluded that the safest option is to cancel the play the decision has angered and disappointed students and parents on both sides of the debate\nThat was never a request we ask for the word to be admitted to patients Philips the mother of three African American students involved in the protest I understand that the children put a lot of work into this play she says this doesn't create a dialogue it causes more of a division\nStacy ... had two children in the play both of whose character's over the slur\nShe called the production of the most pointed she'd seen this at the school system to use the slur sparked important conversation with her children\nIt's a great loss of the community she set of the cancellation this play is a warning of what happens if we don't change our ways and it's a message of hope that young people might be the reason things change\nAnd they've had other controversial performances before Spring Awakening that year in town rent and others that as the paper puts it push boundaries\nShort with officials recognize this potential landmines and attempting to brace parents and students from the beginning of the cast was first elected they issued a statement and here it is is from their website\nTo kill a mocking bird which takes place in Alabama in the Nineteen thirties reflects a difficult an ugly time in American history fanatic issues of racism in segregation or
